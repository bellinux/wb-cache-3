50|$|BrettPhos was {{originally}} reported in 2008 for the Pd-catalyzed amination of aryl mesylates and aryl halides. This ligand helps promote the coupling of weak nucleophiles with aryl halides. Notably, this ligand is highly selective for the <b>monoarylation</b> of primary amines with minimal {{formation of the}} diarylated product. BrettPhos is also chemoselective for primary amines over secondary amines. Other applications of BrettPhos in catalysis include trifluoromethylation of aryl chlorides, the formation of aryl trifluoromethyl sulfides, and Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-couplings.|$|E

Previously, no general method was available to ensure the highly selective <b>monoarylation</b> of these classes of substrates using aryl chlorides. Using palladium precatalysts recently reported by our group, these reactions are easily accomplished under mild conditions that tolerate {{a wide array of}} heterocyclic substrates.

40|$|The first general {{palladium}} {{catalyst for}} the catalytic mono-α-arylation of aryl- and heteroarylketones with aryl mesylates and tosylates is described. The newly developed indolyl-derived phosphine ligand L 7 has been identified to promote this reaction efficiently. The key to success is attributed to the enhanced steric congestion of the catalyst and effective oxidative addition of the C(Ar) -OMs bond. In the presence of Pd(OAc) 2 (0. 25 - 2. 5 mol %) and L 7, selective <b>monoarylations</b> are achieved with ample reaction scope and product yields up to 95 %. Importantly, we demonstrated the applicability of this protocol with the modification of biological phenolic compounds, rendering it amenable for functionalization of phenolic (pro) drugs.

40|$|A {{method for}} the Pd-catalyzed arylation of ammonia {{with a wide}} range of aryl and {{heteroaryl}} halides, including challenging five-membered heterocyclic substrates, is described. Excellent selectivity for <b>monoarylation</b> of ammonia to primary arylamines was achieved under mild conditions or at rt by the use of bulky biarylphosphine ligands (L 6, L 7, and L 4) as well as their corresponding aminobiphenyl palladacycle precatalysts (3 a, 3 b, and 3 c). As this process requires neither the use of a glovebox nor high pressures of ammonia, it should be widely applicable. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|We {{report a}} newly {{developed}} carbazoyl-derived P,N-type phosphine ligand (L 1) for the <b>monoarylation</b> of acetone with aryl chlorides. The proposed Pd(dba) 2 /L 1 catalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic reactivity toward highly electron rich and sterically congested aryl chlorides, with catalyst loading {{as low as}} 0. 1 mol % of Pd along with excellent chemoselectivity. A reaction rate study of the system using electronically diverse aryl chlorides determined the mechanisms regarding the rate-limiting steps in this reaction. The oxidative addition adduct of Pd-PhenCar-Phos with p-chlorotoluene showed the participation of N-Pd coordination in the metal complex. The isolated palladium complex C 1 could be utilized as a precatalyst in the transformation and achieved performance {{comparable to that of}} the in situ generated palladium species.

40|$|The use of ligands to tune the {{reactivity}} and selectivity {{of transition}} metal catalysts for C(sp 3) –H bond functionalization {{is a central}} challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report a rare example of catalyst-controlled C(sp 3) –H arylation using pyridine and quinoline derivatives: The former promotes exclusive <b>monoarylation,</b> whereas the latter activates the catalyst further to achieve diarylation. Successive application of these ligands enables the sequential diarylation of a methyl group in an alanine derivative with two different aryl iodides, affording {{a wide range of}} b-Ar-b-Ar′-a–amino acids with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio> 20 : 1). Both configurations of the b-chiral center can be accessed by choosing the order in which the aryl groups are installed. The use of a quinoline derivative as a ligand also enables C(sp 3) –H olefination of a protected alanine. Over the past decade, substantial pro-gress has been achieved in the palladium-catalyzed activation of the inert b-C(sp 3) –H bonds of aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral oxazolines (1), the 8 -aminoquinoline auxiliary (2, 3), and a variety of weakly coordi-nating amide directing groups (4, 5).

40|$|A new ligand, AdBrettPhos, was {{synthesized}} and its use, {{along with}} tBuBrettPhos, in C-O coupling reactions at low temperatures was investigated. Using Pd catalysts containing these ligands, electron-neutral aryl bromides were coupled with phenols {{at room temperature}} for the first time. A variety of electron-deficient aryl halides and phenols were also coupled at moderate temperatures in good yields. In order to probe how the structural features of the ligand affect the catalytic activity of Pd catalysts containing dialkylbiarylphosphines, a series of novel ligands was synthesized and their utility in Pd-catalyzed C-N couplings was investigated. All of these ligands provided competent catalysts for the cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides with primary alkyl or aryl amines. However, in general these catalysts cannot match the rates and low catalyst loadings achieved by BrettPhos-supported Pd-catalysts, with the exception of L 8, which was shown to be superior to BrettPhos in terms of rate and yield for the coupling of methylamine. The high selectivity for <b>monoarylation</b> of primary amines exhibited by these catalysts indicates that the methoxy substituent ortho to phosphorous {{plays an important role in}} regulating this selectivity. by Nicole R.

40|$|Chapter 1 A {{procedure}} for forming a highly active Pd(0) catalyst from Pd(OAc) 2, water, and biarylphosphine ligands has been developed. This protocol generates a catalyst system, which exhibits excellent reactivity and efficiency in the coupling {{of a variety}} of amides and anilines with aryl chlorides. Chapter 2 A new class of one-component Pd precatalysts bearing biarylphosphine ligands is described. These precatalysts are air- and thermally-stable, are easily-activated under normal reaction conditions at or below room temperature, and ensure the formation of the highly-active mono-ligated Pd(0) complex necessary for oxidative addition. The use of these precatalysts as a convenient source of LPd(0) in C-N cross-coupling reactions is explored. The reactivity that is demonstrated in this study is unprecedented in palladium chemistry. Chapter 3 A catalyst system based on a new biarylphosphine ligand that shows excellent reactivity for C-N cross-coupling reactions is reported. This catalyst system enables the use of aryl mesylates as a coupling partner in C-N bond-forming reactions. Additionally, the use of this ligand permits the highly selective <b>monoarylation</b> of an array of primary aliphatic amines and anilines at low catalyst loadings and with fast reaction times, including the first <b>monoarylation</b> of methylamine. Lastly, oxidative addition complexes based on the new ligand are included, which provide insight into the origin of reactivity for this system. Chapter 4 An investigation into the Pd-catalyzed C-N cross-coupling reactions of aryl iodides is described. Neal is shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on these processes. By switching to a solvent system in which the iodide byproduct was insoluble, reactions of aryl iodides were accomplished with the same efficiencies as aryl chlorides and bromides. Using catalyst systems based on certain biarylphosphine ligands, aryl iodides were successfully reacted with an array of primary and secondary amines in high yields. Lastly, reactions of heteroarylamines and heteroaryliodides were also conducted in high yields. Chapter 5 A catalyst based on a new biarylphosphine ligand for the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of amides and aryl chlorides is described. This system shows the highest turnover frequencies reported to date for these reactions, especially for aryl chloride substrates bearing an ortho substituent. An array of amides and aryl chlorides were successfully reacted in good to excellent yields. Chapter 6. An efficient Pd-catalyst for the transformation of aryl chlorides, triflates and nonaflates to nitroaromatics has been developed. This reaction proceeds under weekly basic conditions and displays a broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this method allows for the synthesis of aromatic nitro compounds that cannot be accessed efficiently via other nitration protocols. Mechanistic insight into the trasmetallation step of the catalytic process is also reported. Chapter 7. An alternative approach to catalyst development, which led to a Pd catalyst based on two biarylphosphine ligands for C-N cross-coupling reactions, is reported. By effectively being able to take the form of multiple catalysts this system manifests the best properties that catalysts based on either of the two ligands exhibit separately and displays the highest reactivity and substrate scope of any system that has been reported to date for these reactions. by Brett P.
