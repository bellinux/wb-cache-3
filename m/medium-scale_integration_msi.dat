50|$|Fisher left Yale in 1984 {{to found}} a startup company, Multiflow, along with cofounders John O'Donnell and John Ruttenberg. Multiflow {{produced}} the TRACE series of VLIW minisupercomputers, shipping their first machines in 1987. Multiflow's VLIW could issue 28 operations in parallel per instruction. The TRACE system was implemented in a mix of <b>medium-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI),</b> large-scale integration (LSI), and very large-scale integration (VLSI), packaged in cabinets, a technology obsoleted as it grew more cost-effective to integrate all {{of the components of}} a processor (excluding memory) on one chip.|$|E
50|$|The Invention of the {{integrated}} circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce solved {{this problem by}} making all the components and the chip {{out of the same}} block (monolith) of semiconductor material. The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated. This led to the idea of integrating all components on a single silicon wafer, which led to small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, <b>medium-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> in the late 1960s, and then large-scale integration (LSI) as well as VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, {{with tens of thousands of}} transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions (109)).|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the PDP-8, the Nova was based on 15 x 15 in printed circuit boards.

This greatly reduced costs over the traditional wire-wrapping technique. The larger-board construction also made the Nova more reliable, which made it especially attractive for industrial or lab settings. Fairchild Semiconductor provided the new <b>medium-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> chips used throughout the system.

Now known retrospectively as small-scale integration (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as <b>medium-scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI).</b> Further improvements led to large-scale integration (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates.

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of cognitive processes depend on the integration of multisensory information. The brain integrates this information, providing a complete representation of our surrounding world and giving us the ability to react optimally to the environment. Infancy {{is a period of}} great changes in brain structure and function that are reflected by the increase of processing capacities of the developing child. However, it is unclear if the optimal use of multisensory information is present early in childhood or develops only later, with experience. The first part of this review has focused on the typical development of multisensory <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI).</b> We have described the two hypotheses on the developmental process of MSI in neurotypical infants and children, and have introduced MSI and its neuroanatomic correlates. The second section has discussed the neurodevelopmental trajectory of MSI in cognitively-challenged infants and children.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impacts of modularity‐based {{manufacturing}} practices (MBMP) and manufacturing system <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> on manufacturing performance (MP) using absorptive capacity as an important enabling factor. Design/methodology/approach: Constructs were developed through a comprehensive literature review. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research model and hypotheses based on a large sample of 303 US manufacturing firms. Findings: Both MBMP and MSI have significant impacts on MP. The positive effects of MBMP on MP are stronger than those of system integration. The absorptive capacity of a firm facilitates better use of modularity practices and system integration. Practical implications: More attention should be given to modularity practices in resource allocation planning. Also, system integration together with modularity practices can generate significantly higher MP. Originality/value: The paper is the first large‐scale empirical study to examine the effects of absorptive capacity on MSI and MBMP, which in turn impacts MP. Furthermore, the findings empirically support that a combination strategy of modularity and system integration can help manufacturing firms to achieve higher performance...|$|R
40|$|Callan, Jones, Munhall, Kroos, Callan, and Vatikiotis-Bateson Perception {{of speech}} is {{improved}} when {{presentation of the}} audio signal is accompanied by concordant visual speech gesture information. This enhancement is most prevalent when the audio signal is degraded. One potential {{means by which the}} brain affords perceptual enhancement is thought to be through the integration of concordant information from multiple sensory channels in a common site of convergence, multisensory <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> sites. Some studies have identified potential sites in the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/S) that are responsive to multisensory information from the auditory speech signal and visual speech movement. One limitation of these studies is that they do not control for activity resulting from attentional modulation cued by such things as visual information signaling the onsets and offsets of the acoustic speech signal as well as activity resulting from MSI of properties of the auditory speech signal with aspects of gross visual motion that are not specific to place of articulation information.

40|$|Failure to {{appropriately}} develop multisensory <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> of audiovisual speech {{may affect}} a child's ability to attain optimal communication. Studies have shown protracted development of MSI into late-childhood and identified deficits in MSI {{in children with}} an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Currently, the neural basis of acquisition of this ability is not well understood. Here, we developed a computational model informed by neurophysiology to analyze possible mechanisms underlying MSI maturation, and its delayed development in ASD. The model posits that strengthening of feedforward and cross-sensory connections, responsible for the alignment of auditory and visual speech sound representations in posterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, can explain behavioral data on the acquisition of MSI. This was simulated by a training phase during which the network was exposed to unisensory and multisensory stimuli, and projections were crafted by Hebbian rules of potentiation and depression. In its mature architecture, the network also reproduced the well-known multisensory McGurk speech effect. Deficits in audiovisual speech perception in ASD were well accounted for by fewer multisensory exposures, compatible {{with a lack of}} attention, but not by reduced synaptic connectivity or synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|This review aims {{to relate}} the sensory {{processing}} problems in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), especially multisensory <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI),</b> {{to the role of}} the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by exploring neuroanatomical findings; brain connectivity and Default Network (DN); global or locally directed attention; and temporal multisensory binding. The mPFC is part of the brain¿s DN, which is deactivated when attention is focused on a particular task and activated on rest when spontaneous cognition emerges. In those with ASD, it is hypoactive and the higher the social impairment the greater the atypical activity. With an immature DN, cross-modal integration is impaired, resulting in a collection of disconnected fragments instead of a coherent global perception. The deficit in MSI may lie in the temporal synchronization of neural networks. The time interval in which the stimulation of one sensory channel could influence another would be higher, preventing integration in the typical shorter time range. Thus, the underconnectivity between distant brain areas would be involved in top-down information processes (relying on global integration of data from different sources) and would enhance low level perception processes such as over focused attention to s...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{integration}} of various simultaneously perceived perceptual signals {{is crucial for}} social behavior. Recent findings indicate that this multisensory <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> can be modulated by attention. Theories of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) suggest that MSI is affected in this population while it remains unclear to what extent this is related to impairments in attentional capacity. In the present study Event-related potentials (ERPs) following emotionally congruent and incongruent face-voice pairs were measured in 23 high-functioning, adult ASD individuals and 24 age- and IQ-matched controls. MSI was studied while {{the attention of the}} participants was manipulated. ERPs were measured at typical auditory and visual processing peaks, namely, P 2 and N 170. While controls showed MSI during divided attention and easy selective attention tasks, individuals with ASD showed MSI during easy selective attention tasks only. It was concluded that individuals with ASD are able to process multisensory emotional stimuli, but this is differently modulated by attention mechanisms in these participants, especially those associated with divided attention. This atypical interaction between attention and MSI is also relevant to treatment strategies, with training of multisensory attentional control possibly bein...|$|R
40|$|Multisensory <b>integration</b> (<b>MSI)</b> and {{exogenous}} spatial attention {{can both}} speedup responses to perceptual events. Recently, {{it has been}} shown that audiovisual integration at exogenously attended locations is reduced relative to unattended locations. This effect was observed at short cue-target intervals (200 - 250 [*]ms). At longer intervals, however, the initial benefits of exogenous shifts of spatial attention at the cued location are often replaced by response time (RT) costs (also known as Inhibition of Return, IOR). Given these opposing cueing effects at shorter versus longer intervals, we decided to investigate whether MSI would also be affected by IOR. Uninformative exogenous visual spatial cues were presented between 350 and 450 [*]ms prior to the onset of auditory, visual, and audiovisual targets. As expected, IOR was observed for visual targets (invalid cue RT[*]<[*]valid cue RT). For auditory and audiovisual targets, neither IOR nor any spatial cueing effects were observed. The amount of relative multisensory response enhancement and race model inequality violation was larger for uncued as compared with cued locations indicating that IOR reduces MSI. The results are discussed in the context of changes in unisensory signal strength at cued as compared with uncued locations...|$|R
