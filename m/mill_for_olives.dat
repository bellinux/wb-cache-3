40|$|Dolaskom u okvire dubrovačke države, u Konavlima se 1427. godine zatječu četiri mlina. Zbog opskrbe velikog broja pomoraca na svojim trgovačkim brodovima, kao i zbog potreba nastalih povećanjem broja stanovnika, Republika već početkom 16. stoljeća gotovo utrostručuje broj mlinova za žitarice. Mlinovi su u vlasništvu države i daju se pod određenim uvjetima u zakup. Nakon pada Dubrovačke Republike postaju privatno vlasništvo. U drugoj polovici 19. stoljeća grade se mlinovi za mljevenje maslina na vodeni pogon. Povećava se i broj stupa za tkanine. Sto godina kasnije, i prije tehnološke zastare, zbog nedostatka sirovina jedan za drugim prestaju raditi. This article {{traces the}} history of water mills built on the River Ljuta in Konavle. When the Ragusan {{government}} acquired Konavle in 1427, there existed four mills in the upper flow of the river. The Republic tended to increase the production of grain due to the rise in population and the growing demand for flour and hardtack, the latter being an important provision aboard merchant vessels. This necessitated {{the construction of new}} mills, relocated mainly in the downstream areas of the Ljuta. Thus {{by the beginning of the}} sixteenth century, the number of water <b>mills</b> used <b>for</b> grinding grain had been tripled. The construction of Donji mlini (lower mills) represented an engineering challenge, as the slope was not steep enough. While at Gornji mlini (upper mills) the conduits that convey water from the river to the mills are less than fifty metres long thanks to the steep drop of the terrain, at lower mills, however, they measure in hundreds of metres. Mills were owned by the state and concessions were granted under specific terms. After the fall of the Republic, they became private property. In the second half of the nineteenth century, water <b>mills</b> <b>for</b> grinding <b>olives</b> as well as for the fulling of cloth had been built. A hundred years later, prior to becoming technologically outdated, the mills fell into disuse due to the lack of raw materials...|$|R

The objective of this paper was to compare two {{approaches to}} land suitability evaluations; Parametric and Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Methods to model the opportunities <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> production in Jeffara Plain of Libya. In this paper a number of soil and landscape criteria were identified and their weights specified as a result of discussions with local experts. The Fuzzy MCE approach was found to be better than the parametric approach. The Fuzzy MCE approaches accommodate the continuous nature of many soil properties and produce more intuitive distributions of land suitabilities value <b>for</b> <b>olive.</b> The results of Fuzzy MCE showed {{that the majority of the}} study area is highly suitable <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> production, while the results obtained from the use the parametric method showed that most of the study area is moderately suitable <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> production...|$|R
