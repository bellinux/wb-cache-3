40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} simulate the melting and flowing phenomena with different materials in multiple phases. In such a <b>multiphase</b> <b>environment,</b> solid objects are melted because of heating and the melted liquid flows while interacting with the ambient air flow. Our simulation {{is based on a}} modified lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), where the fluid dynamics of the air flow and the melted liquid is modeled within a common lattice framework. Therefore, no particular front tracking methods are required for the liquid-air interface. The liquid-solid and air-solid interfaces are implemented as curved boundaries in the LBM, which can accommodate arbitrarily shaped solid objects. Heat transfer is incorporated with a finite difference discretization of a standard diffusion-advection equation simulating the temperature evolution. The temperature and body forces (gravity and surface tension) are easily applied by adopting {{a new version of the}} LBM: multiple-relaxation-time LBM (MRTLBM). The melting and flowing behavior is controlled by the heat source, the viscosity and the body forces. All the numerical computations in our method are local and parallelizable, therefore, interactive speed is achieved by hardware acceleration on the contemporary graphics hardware (GPU) ...|$|E

The design and manufacture of controllable granular matter would exploit advances in microelectromechanical systems and nanotechnology. Depending on specific designs and applications, controllable granular matter could have characteristics like those of powders, sands, or aerosols, which would be dispersed into the environments to be explored: For example, sensory grains could be released into orbit around a planet, spread out over ground, or dispersed into wind or into a body of liquid. The grains would thus become integral parts of <b>multiphase</b> <b>environments,</b> where they would function individually and/or collectively to gather information about the environments. In cases of clouds of grains dispersed in outer space, it may be feasible to use laser beams to shape the clouds to perform specific functions.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method of {{tracking}} and characterizing {{the environment in}} which galaxies and their associated circumgalactic medium evolve. We use a structure finding algorithm we developed to self-consistently parse and follow the evolution of poor clusters, filaments and voids in large scale simulations. We trace the complete evolution of the baryons in the gas phase and the star formation history within each structure in our simulated volume. We vary the structure measure threshold to probe the complex inner structure of star forming regions in poor clusters, filaments and voids. We find the majority of star formation occurs in cold, condensed gas in filaments at intermediate redshifts (z ~ 3). We also show that much of the star formation above a redshift z = 3 occurs in low contrast regions of filaments, but as the density contrast increases at lower redshift star formation switches to the high contrast regions, or inner parts, of filaments. Since filaments bridge the void and cluster regions, it suggests that the majority of star formation occurs in galaxies in intermediate density regions prior to the accretion onto poor clusters. We find that at the present epoch, the gas phase distribution is 43. 1 %, 30. 0 %, 24. 7 % and 2. 2 % in the diffuse, WHIM, hot halo and condensed phases, respectively. The majority of the WHIM is associated with filaments. However, their multiphase nature {{and the fact that the}} star formation occurs predominantly in the condensed gas both point to the importance of not conflating the filamentary environment with the WHIM. Moreover, in our simulation volume 8. 77 %, 79. 1 %, 2. 11 % of the gas at z = 0 is located in poor clusters, filaments, and voids, respectively.

40|$|High {{explosive}} charges when detonated ensue in a {{flow field}} characterized by several physical phenomena that include blast wave propagation, hydrodynamic instabilities, real gas effects, fluid mixing and afterburn effects. Solid metal particles are often added to explosives {{to augment the}} total impulsive loading, either through direct bombardment if inert, or through afterburn energy release if reactive. These multiphase explosive charges, termed as heterogeneous explosives, are of interest from a scientific perspective as they involve the confluence and interplay of various additional physical phenomena such as shock-particle interaction, particle dispersion, ignition, and inter-phase mass, momentum and energy transfer. In the current research effort, chemical explosions in <b>multiphase</b> <b>environments</b> are investigated using a robust, state-of-the-art Eulerian-gas, Lagrangian-solid methodology that can handle both the dense and dilute particle regimes. Explosions into ambient air as well as into aluminum particle clouds are investigated, and hydrodynamic instabilities such as Rayleigh- Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov result in a mixing layer where the detonation products mix with the air and afterburn. The particles in the ambient cloud, when present, are observed to pick up significant amounts of momentum and heat from the gas, and thereafter disperse, ignite and burn. The amount of mixing and afterburn are observed to be independent of particle size, but dependent on the particle mass loading and cloud dimensions. Due to fast response times, small particles are observed to cluster as they interact with the vortex rings in the mixing layer, which leads to their preferential ignition/ combustion. The total deliverable impulsive loading from heterogeneous explosive charges containing inert steel particles is estimated for a suite of operating parameters and compared, and it is demonstrated that heterogeneous explosive charges deliver a higher near-field impulse than homogeneous explosive charges containing the same mass of the high explosive. Furthermore, particles are observed to introduce significant amounts of hydrodynamic instabilities in the mixing layer, resulting in augmented fluctuation intensities and fireball size, and different growth rates for heterogeneous explosions compared to homogeneous explosions. For aluminized explosions, the particles are observed to burn in two regimes, and the average particle velocities at late times are observed to be independent of the initial solid volume fraction in the explosive charge. Overall, this thesis provides useful insights on {{the role played by}} solid particles in chemical explosions. Ph. D.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known in oil {{industry}} {{that changes in}} fluid flow conditions such as water breakthrough or unsteady flow due to well shut-in can lead to sand destabilization, with a possible consequent sand production. In this research, different flow situations are incorporated into stress and stability analysis for the region around a wellbore producing oil from weak or unconsolidated sands, and the analyses involve strength weakening, stress redistribution, and decrease of rock stiffness. Two main mechanisms, chemical reactions of rock with formation water and variations of rock capillary strength, are identified and analyzed to study strength weakening after water breakthrough, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Using theories from particle mechanics, rock mechanics, and interfacial science, four novel capillarity models are developed and verified to analytically capture the physical behaviors of capillary strength at the grain scale. Based on model calculations, significantly better understanding of strength behavior in two-phase fluid environments is achieved. Based on a simplified model that can conservatively but efficiently quantify capillary strength with only two input parameters (i. e. particle radius and water saturation), a verified new method that physically calculates pore pressure in a <b>multiphase</b> <b>environment,</b> and a coupled poroinelastic stress model, the redistributions of effective stresses with water saturation around a wellbore are solved.

We use our Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP), which samples conformational space from first principles to build sets of loop candidates and then discriminates between them using our physics-based, all-atom energy function with implicit solvent. We also discuss {{a new kind of}} explicit membrane calculation developed for GPCR loops that interact, either in the native structure or in low-energy false-positive structures, with the membrane, and thus exist in a <b>multiphase</b> <b>environment</b> not previously incorporated in PLOP. Our results demonstrate a significant advance over previous work reported in the literature, and of particular note we are able to accurately restore the extremely long second extracellular loop (ECL 2), which is also key for GPCR ligand binding. In the case of β 2 Ar, accurate ECL 2 restoration required seeding a small helix into the loop in the appropriate region, based on alignment with the β 1 Ar ECL 2 loop, and then running loop reconstruction simulations with and without the seeded helix present; simulations containing the helix attain significantly lower total energies than those without the helix, and have rmsds close to the native structure. For β 1 Ar, the same protocol was used, except the alignment was done to β 2 Ar.

The CESAM chamber (French acronym for Experimental Multiphasic Atmospheric Simulation Chamber) is designed to allow research in multiphase atmospheric (photo-) chemistry which involves both gas phase and condensed phase processes including aerosol and cloud chemistry. CESAM {{has the potential to}} carry out variable temperature and pressure experiments under a very realistic artificial solar irradiation. It consists of a 4. 2 m 3 stainless steel vessel equipped with three high pressure xenon arc lamps which provides a controlled and steady environment. Initial characterization results, all carried out at 290 – 297 K under dry conditions, concerning lighting homogeneity, mixing efficiency, ozone lifetime, radical sources, NO y wall reactivity, particle loss rates, background PM, aerosol formation and cloud generation are given. Photolysis frequencies of NO 2 and O 3 related to chamber radiation system were found equal to (4. 2 × 10 − 3 s − 1) for J NO 2 and (1. 4 × 10 − 5 s − 1) for J O 1 D which is comparable to the solar radiation in the boundary layer. An auxiliary mechanism describing NO y wall reactions has been developed. Its inclusion in the Master Chemical Mechanism allowed us to adequately model the results of experiments on the photo-oxidation of propene-NO x -Air mixtures. Aerosol yields for the α-pinene + O 3 system chosen as a reference were determined and found in good agreement with previous studies. Particle lifetime in the chamber ranges from 10 h to 4 days depending on particle size distribution which indicates that the chamber can provide high quality data on aerosol aging processes and their effects.

Understanding the transport and fate of these compounds in the vadose zone is crucial to identifying pollution sources, assessing the threat to groundwater, and evaluating the need and adequacy of cleanup. CHCs exist in various physical phases in the subsurface, linked by interphasal processes. These, combined with unsaturated water flow in the vadose zone, which is complicated by the multifluid (air and water) situation, geologic hetero-geneity, and a highly site-specific preferential flow pattern, create a possibly four-fluid flow condition, with interactions among different phases of CHCs and between chemicals and geologic materials. Superimposed on these are various biotic and abiotic transformations. Integration of these processes is being attempted by mathematical modeling; however, natural heterogeneity and site-specific factors render these efforts partially successful at best. Regulators are faced with considerable uncertainties and cannot expect simple solutions with the current level of understanding of subsurface processes.

40|$|Today {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} suffers significant production losses due to fines migrations in high permeability sandstone formations or sand packs. During drilling, production or injection, fines migration continues to cause formation impairment resulting in oil and gas inflow reductions or injectivity resistance. The problem is further enhanced in mature reservoirs where increased water ingress and multiphase production aggravate the fines mobilisation. Proper fines management can optimise productivity, injectivity, safeguard facilities and reduce well maintenance cost. Today‘s core flood tests as part of risk assessment limit tests to single phase or at best two-phase oil/water flow. Meanwhile existing reservoir simulators have no facilities to analyse solid particles impact on productivity and injectivity. This research work presents the unique technique adopted to analyse fines migration mechanisms in a true <b>multiphase</b> <b>environment.</b> The methodologies adopted include studies of fines particle impacts on pressure drawdowns in several sensitivities of rock permeability, water cut, multiphase flow, liquid flow, porosity, fines grain size, and the rest of relevant rock and fluid properties performed using an appropriate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulator. The resultant drawdown pressures were then used to back-calculate corresponding particle-damaged permeabilities using a conventional field approach. From the results obtained, detailed mapping of prevailing pore blocking mechanisms and corresponding permeability impairment profiles are presented as functions of operating conditions. The technique integrates the CFD and 3 -D reservoir simulation concepts to define and quantify the effects of different operating conditions on discretised reservoir blocks. Among the major research outcomes are two developed particle-damaged absolute permeability models for multiphase and liquid flow conditions involving fines migration in porous media. The models were tested and validated using ten examples of field data with acceptable error margins in the majority of the cases. Contributions to knowledge include: i) new analysis of particle impact in multiphase and liquid flows, ii) integration of CFD with 3 -dimensional reservoir simulator and iii) the developed particle-damaged models.

The nonlinearities of rock elastic properties in stressed and biphasic fluid environments is analytically addressed, based on an improved nonlinear theory that considers both a failure-based mechanism and a confining-stress-based mechanism, the strength model, and the coupled stress model. The calculations demonstrate the redistributions of stress-dependent rock stiffness around a wellbore and its evolution with increase of water saturation, clarify {{the relative importance of}} each mechanism in reducing rock stiffness, and fundamentally explain why current predictive technologies are invalid when water appears in a flowing wellbore. To quantify the effect of well shut-down on rock stability, the redistributions of fluid pressure in reservoir are analytically solved and coupled with the stress model, while the water hammer equations provide a boundary condition for the bottom-hole pressure. This approach allows direct solution of the relationships among fluid properties, rock properties and production parameters, within the context of rock stability. The proposed new approaches and models can be applied to evaluate sand production risk in multiphase and unsteady fluid flow environment.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Droplet-particle {{collision}} {{interaction in}} a flowing gas stream {{is one of}} the major phase interaction phenomena in a wide class of multiphase process applications such as spouted bed coating, fluid catalytic cracking unit, fluid coking process for bitumen upgrade process etc. that govern the process performance to a significant extent. Such interactions are manifestations of complex hydrodynamics involving competing interplay of various forces e. g. viscous, capillary, inertial and gravity coupled with simultaneous heat and mass transport process which involves further complexity of phase change. Depending on the size ratio of the droplet-particle pair, relative velocity, physical properties, temperature difference, surface roughness and hydrophobicity; a number of different outcomes are possible which presumably affect the associated transport phenomena to a significant extent. For instance, inefficient contact of atomized feed droplets and hot catalyst particles adversely affects the desired product yield in a fluid catalytic cracking unit. Motivated by a dearth of knowledge in this field, the present research aims at investigating some of these interaction mechanisms with specific focus on the single droplet-particle system to broaden the mechanistic understandings using both non-invasive optical technique (high speed imaging) and numerical modelling wherever applicable. Based on the droplet-particle size ratio (Δ), there different systems were studied: Δ 1 and Δ ~ 1. For Δ 1 system, collision interactions between a small particle and a larger stationary supported spherical cap droplet were investigated at different particle impact velocities (Weber number ≈ 1. 4 - 33). Two outcomes were noted – particle capture or retention at interface and penetration through the droplet interface. A one dimensional model was developed based on force balance approach to predict these collision outcomes. Effect of different competing forces namely gravity, virtual mass, buoyancy, drag, capillary and pressure were analysed. Among others, the capillary force was noted to have dominating effect however effect of the drag force was also observed to be significant when impact velocity was increased. The earlier mentioned CFD model was modified to include the effect of particle motion utilizing a dynamic meshing technique. Using a static contact angle and no-slip wall boundary conditions, the CFD model predicted outcomes were in reasonable agreement with the high speed visualizations and force balance model predictions. Also investigated for the Δ > 1 system was the collision interactions between a small particle and a stationary liquid film confined in a capillary tube using different diameters of particle and impact velocities since the complete penetration behaviour of the impacting particle could not be studied with a supported droplet. Three different outcomes were noted based on the impact Weber number - particle capture/retention at top interface; particle capture or retention at bottom interface and complete penetration through both interfaces. A criterion was developed based on the energy balance approach to predict the collision outcomes. In complete penetration cases, the particle was observed to entrain a certain amount of liquid mass with it which was explained by the end-pinching mechanism of ligament breakup. A model based on the energy balance approach was developed to quantify this liquid mass carryover. Also an empirical correlation was obtained to correlate the liquid mass carryover and the particle Bond number. A sensitivity analysis on the predictions of CFD model was performed using different contact angle boundary conditions – advancing, static and receding contact angle which could only predict a specific instance of the outcome well and not the overall outcome. The simulated particle trajectory and velocity were compared with the experimental measurements. Also the contributions of pressure force and viscous force predicted by the CFD model were analysed to explain the collision outcomes wherein pressure force was found be higher than the corresponding viscous force by at least an order of magnitude. The Δ ~ 1 system was studied experimentally for normal collision between an impacting droplet and a stationary particle where two outcomes were noted – deposition in lower Weber number cases and film formation in higher Weber number cases. Also studied here was the interaction behaviour in higher Weber cases involving heat transfer. The film was observed to rupture when the film reached a limiting thickness due to intense vaporization involving nucleate boiling at the apex point of the particle. This system was also studied computationally using a coupled level-set and volume of fluid (CLSVOF) CFD model using different combinations of droplet-particle size ratio, impact Weber number and impact parameter (collision angle). Three distinct outcomes were noted – deposition, ripping and coating and skirt scattering in the increasing order of impact Weber number which reasonably agreed with the predictions of LBM model previously reported by Gac and Gradon (2014). In both ripping and coating and skirt scattering outcomes, separation of ligaments was explained by the end-pinching mechanism. It was shown that all outcomes are governed by a competition between surface energy and kinetic energy and while higher surface energy favours deposition, higher kinetic energy leads to separation. Force analysis reveals that both pressure force and viscous force increases when impact Weber number is increased. Rise of these forces occur specifically in the early phase of interaction followed by a sharp decay in higher Weber number cases indicating separation of liquid ligament from particle surface. Also investigated was the effect of impact parameter (collision angle) which was shown to be critical for droplet-particle interaction. Increase in impact parameter leads to significant decrease in contact area of liquid-solid interface which consequently results in inefficient momentum transfer. This was evident by the corresponding decrease in the magnitude of both force and strain rate. In continuation with this study, a droplet-particle collision induced heat transfer model was developed applicable for FCC environment. The model computes the heat transfer coefficient based on a conductive heat transfer mechanism involving wetted contact area and droplet-particle contact time based on the interaction mechanism of Δ < 1 system. The model also includes volume fraction of droplets and solid particles to account for the <b>multiphase</b> <b>environment.</b> The developed heat transfer sub-model was incorporated into a lumped parameter vaporization model to compute vaporization times for typical gas-oil feed droplets. Computed vaporization times were compared with the predictions of other heterogeneous vaporization models reported in literature and found to be in reasonable agreement. Finally, a multi-particle system involving injection of an acetone jet in a bubbling fluidized bed of Geldart A-B particles was briefly studied to understand the collision interactions of droplets in a multi-particle environment involving vaporization. Several interesting phenomena like jet breakup into multiple droplets, re-suspension of solid particles due to vapour explosion, droplet shape deformation, coalescence, levitation and nucleate boiling were noted. Also evolution of the vapour concentration profile in freeboard region was visualized using Schlieren imaging technique. Numerically, a two-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD model was developed using the FLUENT platform to simulate the jet vaporization process using user defined source terms for heat transfer between the liquid jet and the bed. Simulated vaporization phenomenon qualitatively agreed with experimental observations and captured the key feature of the vaporization process indicating diffusing nature of vapour concentration profile from bed surface to bulk. The CFD model also indicated significant reduction of local bed temperature which indirectly explained the presence of particle agglomerates found in the experiment...|$|E

This research integrates knowledge and techniques of mechanical engineering and health sciences to further study the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases in a multidisciplinary perspective and to assess their risk in realistic indoor <b>environments.</b> <b>Multiphase</b> fluid dynamics modeling was employed to estimate the transport of the infectious particles in air and their deposition onto indoor environmental surfaces. Knowing the distribution {{and the fate of}} these aerosols, together with respiratory physiological and microbiological data, exposure level and intake dose of the pathogens were estimated. Epidemiological and/or experimental biological models were then used to correlate the intake dose of pathogen to the infection risk of the receptor.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to implement a numerical model inspired by the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) theory able to simulate the complex scenario of contamination of DNAPLs (Dense Non Aqueous Phase Liquids) in saturated porous media. Groundwater contamination is nowadays recognized as a serious environmental problem. Among different polluting substances, the contamination by NAPLs continues to persist as a significant problem in industrialized nations. More specifically, an accidental release at the ground surface of DNAPLs, which include a variety of organic compounds denser than water, can lead to long-term contamination of both the unsaturated and saturated zones. Once released, the DNAPLs tend to migrate mainly vertically in the subsurface under gravity and capillary forces. Since they are slightly soluble in both water and air, they can exist in the subsurface as a separate and immiscible fluid phases and migrate to significant depths below the water table giving rise to aqueous phase plumes depending on the slow dissolution kinetics with persistence of the source for a long period. Furthermore, during DNAPLS migration in both unsaturated and saturated media, DNAPLs can be trapped by capillary forces in the porous medium (i. e. residual DNAPLS saturation). Predicting the source localization, often unknown, and the fate of these organic chemicals in the subsurface is challenging. Because of the difficulty in defining the separate phases migration in porous media and the further complication of the soil heterogeneity, a significant effort has been carried out for the investigation of DNAPLs motion and transport by means of experimental tests and image analysis and fate and transport modeling mainly of the dissolved phases. Nevertheless, further effort is requested to model the separate phase motion in porous media. On the basis of this context, numerical methods can be a support for understanding and investigating the fluids behavior in complex systems such as porous media. Different approaches to modeling flows through porous media can be considered. The classical macro-scale multiphase models however do not explicitly account for many important physical phenomena in which the phases are involved. As an alternative, a mesoscopic model known as Lattice Boltzmann (LB) has been successfully applied to saturated porous media and it has been widely used for its ability to deal with complex geometries as well as its capacity to simulate fluid flow and transport at the pore-scale. The LBM originates from the kinetic theory of gases and represents the microscopic phenomena by means of a statistical (macroscopic) description. The LBM has been shown to recover the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy and the CFD community agrees that it has reached an high degree of maturity to solve the Navier- Stokes equations for incompressible fluids in single and <b>multiphase</b> <b>environments.</b> Compared to traditional CFD, the LBMs lead to an easier implementation of multi-phase and multi-component flows and they are applied in many fields such as geologic storage of CO 2, Petroleum Engineering or reactive and melting/dissolution phenomena. Even more dealing with multiphase fluids, LBMs provides several advantages compared to the traditional CFD, such as the ability to model the interface dynamics between the different phases and to simply handle the forcing terms involved in the non- wetting phase migration in a porous media e. g. capillary forces, viscous forces and buoyancy forces. In the thesis, a multiphase multicomponent LB model is therefore presented to simulate DNAPLs migration in saturated porous media. Once described the main DNAPLs physical-chemical properties and the multiphase multicomponent LB theory, the implemented model is validated by means of different analytical solutions. Firstly, the interfacial tension phenomenon is analyzed by means of the bubble coalescence and the spinodal decomposition simulations: a sharp interface of few lattice nodes thickness is present between the two fluid phases in function of the tension parameter. The model has proved to recover the Young-Laplace Law, which correlates the pressure difference (at equilibrium) between the regions inside and outside a bubble of fluid 1 surrounded by the fluid 2, to 1 /R, where R is the radius of the bubble. Then, the wettability effects are analyzed and validated by determining the contact angle measure and comparing it with the analytical solution in Huang et al. (2007). Finally, the multiphase Poiseuille flow is simulated and compared to the results obtained from Dou et al. (2012). Different simulations varying the forces applied to the two fluids are then carried out to investigate the impacts of the drag forces, the viscosity effects and the velocity profiles in the channel. Regarding the simulations of the DNAPLs migration in saturated porous media, the results obtained aimed to investigate the influence of the gravity, viscous and capillary forces on DNAPLs motion. Specifically, the role of these forces is characterized by means of different dimensionless numbers, which vary during the conducted simulation tests; the simulations results confirm that, once the DNAPL is released, an increase in contaminant amount and a more radial migration of DNAPL occurs in proximity of the release point when the capillary number “Ca” (ratio between the viscosity and the capillary forces) increases. Contrarily, when the Bond number “Bo” (ratio between the buoyancy and the capillary forces) exceeds the “Ca” number, the gravity assumes a “destabilizing” role leading to the formation of gravity driven fingers. The influence of the hydraulic gradient on DNAPLs migration is also investigated. When a hydraulic gradient is applied, the separate phase shift towards the water flow direction occurs and the pooled DNAPL accumulated above the fine lenses is less. However, the DNAPL phase is also able to move backwards the flow direction when the hydraulic gradient does not let it to exceed the capillary pressure between the pores situated downgradient, explaining the not totally removal of pools over the fine lens even with higher hydraulic gradients. Finally, “trapped DNAPLs” are present: the gravity-driven fingers extend between the pores until they are too long and break. The disconnected mass can be immobilize as blobs and ganglia for the capillary forces. It can be concluded that the development of a model that reproduces the motion of immiscible fluids starting from the microscale- mesoscopic scale is of particular interest and importance. On one hand, it can be useful to investigate the DNAPLs scenario of contamination as well as the reactions and physical microscale processes that significantly influence their macroscale behavior; on the other hand, it is worth to underline its potential use as a tool to support any projects of environmental remediation, in which the identification of the source of contamination and the prediction migration dynamics of contaminants in porous media are essential in selecting the best remediation technology to apply. Although further research and investigation are needed to simulate the DNAPLs migration paths in real contaminated sites, the LB method can provide good results in such a field. The model can therefore be applied to investigate the migration behavior of these separate phases in saturated porous media. However, further effort has to be spent in order to provide a tool able to simulate greater contaminated domains: the potential use of upscaling techniques, without losing the intrinsic microscopic information provided by the LB model, can be suggested...|$|R
40|$|Erosion and {{corrosion}} of piping and 'equlpments {{continues to}} be a problem for the oil and gas sector. This primarily occurs where water and entrained sand are present in produced water. The pipelines used to transport these products are often subjected to multiphase flow regimes, which can result in severe degradation of the internal surfaces with the presence of solid particles and an oil phase in the flow system, and the erosion-corrosion mechanisms become more complicated when compared with those seen in single-phase systems. Therefore, it is essential to understand the degradation mechanisms involved to enable effective material selection to be achieved. In this project, a study on sand mobility was conducted, which focused on the effect of the corrosion inhibitor and oil phase adsorption on the sand particles and the effect of the mobility of sand particles in a flow system. A flow loop coupled with a high-speed camera was designed to enable the sand transport to be visualised. With such a system, the consequence of the corrosion inhibitor and hydrocarbon phase, ISOPAR M, on the adsorption process of the sand particles, and the effect of adsorption on reducing the kinetic energy of sand particles were studied. Zeta potential, which {{is a function of the}} mobility of an electrical charge at the slip plane beyond which the electrical charges form a stable entity with the solid particle, was also introduced in this work to confirm the result of the sand transport and to define the condition at which adsorption is possible. The results of zeta potential were in good agreement with the results of the sand mobility obtained by the designed flow loop and adjusted jet impingement rig. The results showed that the adsorption of corrosion inhibitor on the surface of sand particles is only possible if the corrosion inhibitor acquires an opposite charge to the sand particles dispersed in solution (the attraction force is dominant). In the study, the erosion-corrosion of a carbon steel (API- 5 L-X 65), 13 Cr martensitic stainless steel and duplex/superduplex stainless steel (22 Cr and 25 Cr) were assessed by jet impingement using a combination of electrochemical tests and metal loss analysis. The assessments were conducted under a simulated CO 2 erosive-corrosive oil and gas surface pipeline with the presence of hydrocarbon and corrosion inhibitor to understand the material degradation mechanisms under different testing media to enable supportive information to be provided for the mitigation of erosion-corrosion in the oil and gas industry. In-situ electrochemistry, LPR, was conducted in order to assess the contribution of the corrosion process on the total degradation of materials. Despite the significant effect of the solution containing 5 vol% ISOPAR M on the total weight loss (TWL), the addition of 5 % ISOPAR M did not show a clear reduction in the corrosion rate (higher slope of I' 1 E/l' 1 i plot). It was proved in this project that the presence of 5 vol% ISOPAR M not only has an important role in reducing the impact velocity of sand particles, but using CFD simulation it was also proved that the particles had a lower impact angle, and, hence, reduced the overall damage to the mechanical component (erosion-corrosion). The other interesting feature identified in this study is the interaction between the corrosion inhibitor and oil phase, which resulted in enhancing the stability of the emulsion flow and the change in the wettability of the metal surface. Unlike other testing media, the measured contact angles of water droplets on API- 5 L-X 65 surfaces, pre-exposed to the solution containing 100 ppm of corrosion inhibitor and 5 vol% hydrocarbon, led some sites on the surface to change to an oil wet, hydrophobic surface, thereby increasing the corrosion resistance. A three-level experimental design with full replication was developed for the purpose of developing a statistical model (using the commercial package Minitab™) relating to the total weight loss of API- 5 L-X 65. Such a model will enhance the understanding of the performance of a material in a <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>environment.</b> This methodology allows the interaction between the most significant parameters on erosion corrosion to be studied. Finally, this thesis has added to the understanding of erosion-corrosion in conditions containing a hydrocarbon phase and sand particles.
