40|$|Although {{injectable}} filler {{materials are}} {{generally considered to}} be safe, the risk factors are increasingly discussed, due to its expanding application and increased incidence of adverse effects. Because of the rarity of these reactions, it was difficult to make statistically significant statements for these reactions and possible risk factors. Now the berlin register offers sufficiently large sample sizes to investigate statistical significance. 238 patients in the IFS case register were statistically analyzed for significant differences in risk factors and adverse reaction in four different filler <b>material</b> <b>groups</b> (hyaluronic acid products, Dermalive (HEMA / EMA), poly-L-lactic acid and Polyacrylamid products). Therefore univariate data analysis and statistical inference investigations were performed using the Chi-square test and ANOVA. The adverse reaction 'pain' and 'discoloration' vary significantly between the different filler <b>material</b> <b>groups.</b> ‚Pain’ occurs most frequently as adverse reaction caused by Polyacrylamid products, on the contrary Dermalive causes the least ‚pain’. In addition, Polyacrylamid products show significantly less ‚discoloration’ than other groups. Significant associations exist between the filler <b>material</b> <b>groups</b> and the adverse reactions ‚swelling’, ‚nodulation’/’induration’ and ‚itching’. The highest occurrences for the adverse reaction: ‚swelling’ and ‚nodulation’/’induration’ is in poly-L-Lactic acid products. For ‚itching’ the number of cases is not sufficient for a significant statement. The collected data are not yet sufficient to determine significancies regarding the possible risk factors for adverse reaction on injectable filler materials. However, the data analysis revealed a trend of correlation between individual filler <b>material</b> <b>groups</b> and risk factors. A better characterization of the adverse reactions and risk factors is permited by the data of the IFS study. Significant differences were found between filler <b>material</b> <b>groups</b> and the nature of adverse reactions. The examined risk factors in the study seem to be associated with various filler <b>material</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if the application of structured writing principles to the developmental process of complex diversity training materials facilitated training and improved learners 2 ̆ 7 performance in recalling the content. It was hypothesized that structured writing principles would improve the overall effectiveness of the training material. ^ The post-test only experimental design was used in the study to collect data from 166 participants in an undergraduate hospitality management course. The participants were placed into three different groups and received training from three different formats of diversity training materials. These groups were: (1) the prose writing material, (2) the original structured writing material and (3) the revised structured writing material. Upon the completion of reading the materials, participants completed the 32 -item multiple choice post-test. ^ After analyzing the data by one way analysis of variance, the results showed there were significant differences between the post-test scores of the three groups. The average scores of group one, two and three were 19. 23, 21. 67 and 23. 46 respectively from a total possible score of 32 in the post-test. Participants from group three, the revised structured writing <b>material</b> <b>group,</b> performed significantly better than group two, the original structured writing <b>material</b> <b>group,</b> and group one, the prose writing material. Participants from group two, the original structured writing <b>material</b> <b>group</b> performed significantly better than group one, the prose writing material. Therefore, all the hypotheses of this study were supported. The results of the study suggested that implementing structured writing principles in the complex training materials facilitate the learning of participants and their recall abilities. ...|$|E
