5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical <b>mechanics,</b> {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic <b>mechanics.</b> In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical <b>mechanics.</b> (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A new {{relativistic}} <b>mechanic</b> {{that governs}} {{the motion of}} the vibrating string within the compactified-dimensions space-time is speculated. This <b>mechanic</b> suggests that the relativistic <b>mechanic</b> of the special relativity is only valid for the motion within the familiar four-dimensional space-time. However, the new <b>mechanic</b> is valid for the motion within the compactified-dimensions space-time suggested by the string theory. The equations of this new <b>mechanic</b> show that the vibrating string can move in a speed that is faster than light. It is also shown that this new relativistic <b>mechanic</b> goes to the classical Newtonian <b>mechanic</b> whenever the speed of the vibrating string is much less than the speed of light. Since this <b>mechanic</b> does not prohibit the existence of faster than light particles, then it might uncover some of the mysteries regarding to the string theory, such as, the existence of tachyons, time travel, …etc...|$|R

5|$|Von Neumann was {{the first}} to {{establish}} a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum <b>mechanics,</b> known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum <b>Mechanics.</b> After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum <b>mechanics.</b> He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum <b>mechanics,</b> observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.|$|E
