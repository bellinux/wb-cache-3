2500|$|In February 2000, Pérez {{was sentenced}} {{to five years in}} prison for {{stealing}} 8 pounds of cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker. [...] At his sentencing, Pérez read a statement in which he said, [...] "I cheated on my wife. I cheated on <b>my</b> <b>employer,</b> and I cheated on all of you, the people of Los Angeles".|$|E
2500|$|Gotwald {{undertook}} {{his early}} studies at an [...] "academy" [...] {{near his home}} of which, as an adult, he admitted to remembering little. At the age of ten, {{he went to work}} as a clerk and errand boy in various stores to help support his family. He also worked as a carpenter and a carriage maker. However, Luther later wrote, [...] "my desires for further education prevented me from so concentrating my mind at these trades as to make a success of them. I remember keeping books in the drawer of my work bench and at every spare moment, I would take occasion to read from them. In fact, <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> said that my mind was so set on the books that I managed to spoil more lumber than I was worth and I was discharged." [...] His sister, Eliza lived [...] "out west", so he decided to follow her. Of this move, he reports.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back to my room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> and that I had a key." ...|$|E
60|$|As I rang at the {{door-bell}} of <b>my</b> <b>employer's</b> house, {{a thought}} occurred to me {{which might have been}} alarming to a better regulated mind than mine.|$|R
6000|$|Tow. I'm {{not to be}} {{provoked}} out of my temper: Here I am {{a public}} person, entrusted by my king and <b>my</b> <b>employers,</b> and should I kill you, Harman-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{gave them}} to him willingly," [...] I told her. [...] "I {{do not wish to}} have them back. He is one of <b>my</b> <b>employers,</b> and he has a right to claim them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a pity <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> did not marry. It is a pity <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> {{lives in}} that dull house, in that dull lane, all by himself," [...] Mr. Medlin said, angrily.|$|E
60|$|RUTH. [With a laugh] <b>My</b> <b>employer</b> {{happened}} then--he's happened ever since.|$|E
60|$|He {{placed a}} wrong {{construction}} on my solicitude for <b>my</b> <b>employer.</b> His manner became excited.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} to hustle and back the right man. Since you're {{stopping}} at the presidio, it's obvious that Askew's on the president's side. Well, I suppose everybody knows <b>my</b> <b>employers</b> have put their money on Galdar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You might say,' went on Sam smoothly, 'that {{this was}} creditable to Mr Burns's heart. But, from <b>my</b> <b>employer's</b> {{viewpoint}} and yours, too, {{it was a}} chivalrous impulse {{that needed to be}} checked. Will you please read this, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Write it on a {{piece of}} paper," [...] said the waterman, [...] "that such is your {{positive}} will; I must have something to show to <b>my</b> <b>employers,</b> that the transgression of their orders lies with yourself, not with me." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} the door opened, and <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> came out. He {{appeared}} relieved at seeing me.|$|E
60|$|I laughed, {{a little}} impolitely, I am afraid, {{considering}} {{that this was}} the son of <b>my</b> <b>employer.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not so}} {{much the}} money, Mr. Windsor, though, of course, the expense would be considerable. <b>My</b> <b>employer</b> is a wealthy man." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{watched him}} bending over the stove, pale, dark-visaged, with the subdued manners and voice which mark the {{aristocracy}} of servitude. <b>My</b> <b>employer's</b> confidence in him must be immense, for while he watched over me I was practically in his power.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait and see," [...] Olsen rejoined, [...] "though that plan's expensive, {{because it}} may be too late when you find out. <b>My</b> <b>employers</b> don't often back the wrong man and I trust their {{judgment}} now. If you'll listen, I'll show you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} get off my ship before I lose my temper," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "But rest assured that I shall report this attempt at {{intimidation}} and bribery to <b>my</b> <b>employers,</b> and they will without doubt lay the matter before the Government." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{one thing}} does clearly belong to this {{particular}} conversation I am recalling. When I started out it was quite settled {{in the back of}} my mind that I must not leave Rawdon's. I simply wanted to abuse <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> to Parload. But I talked myself quite out of touch with all the cogent reasons there were for sticking to my place, and I got home that night irrevocably committed to a spirited--not to say a defiant--policy with <b>my</b> <b>employer.</b>|$|E
6000|$|By the evening's post {{two letters}} arrived {{for us at}} Sir Charles's house: one for myself, and one for <b>my</b> <b>employer.</b> Sir Charles's ran thus:-- ...|$|E
60|$|As in duty bound, I {{went first}} {{to the place of}} {{business}} where I am employed, to shake hands and say good-bye to <b>my</b> <b>employer.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know if it's wise to over-work {{yourself}} for {{the advantage of}} your pupils," [...] Thirlwell remarked. [...] "At one time, I was very keen about my profession, but soon found it a mistake to tire my brain for <b>my</b> <b>employer's</b> benefit. But what do you study?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{regret to}} find, sir," [...] he said, [...] "that I have lost {{my place in}} <b>my</b> <b>employer's</b> estimation. The man to whom you confide the superintendence of your clerks and the {{transaction}} of your business has, I venture to think, some claim (under the present circumstances) to be trusted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Bob Repton, <b>my</b> <b>employer's</b> nephew, {{and future}} {{member of the}} firm. Treat him with all respect, and handle him gently. He is a desperate fellow, though he doesn't look it. This is the young gentleman I told you of, who made a night {{expedition}} and captured four burglars." ...|$|R
60|$|Jopp's {{opponent}} was a nice-looking young man, {{but obviously}} nervous. He giggled in a distraught {{sort of way}} as he shook hands with <b>my</b> <b>employer.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Wolfenden," [...] he said, [...] "you are {{the son of}} <b>my</b> <b>employer,</b> but I {{take the}} liberty of telling {{you that you are}} a l--l----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I came quite {{recently}} from France; though, <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> being American, I suppose I am {{entitled to the}} rights of citizenship. Are you European, also?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "National {{selector}} — that's a big wrap, man", {{he said at}} the time. [...] "It's a bit {{of added}} responsibility and I hope that I can handle it. I'm really happy {{that the people who are}} virtually <b>my</b> <b>employers</b> think I can handle the extra responsibility that goes with being a selector." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{what has}} brought you here, Mr. Morning Tatler?' asked my interlocutor, rather roughly. My answer was frank--that the {{disappearance}} of a noble lady from the house of her friends had caused the greatest excitement in the metropolis, and that <b>my</b> <b>employers</b> were anxious to give the public every particular regarding an event so singular.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} won't {{have much}} money," [...] Olsen agreed. [...] "It's {{going to cost}} him all he can raise to turn Alvarez out, but he'll have something to give at the country's expense; sugar and coffee concessions, and perhaps monopolies. If I can get my share, it will pay <b>my</b> <b>employers</b> well and I allow they're generous." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>employer</b> looked worried. Sally was in {{a regular}} cowgirl riding costume, in which her trim, shapely figure showed at its best, {{and her face was}} saucy, sparkling, daring.|$|E
6000|$|Thirlwell hesitated. [...] "On the whole, I don't think so, but my {{judgment}} mayn't be sound and <b>my</b> <b>employer,</b> Scott, does not agree. Anyway, I'll help you all I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been often successful," [...] he admitted, with a laugh, [...] "but <b>my</b> <b>employer</b> is, {{as you may have}} heard, a {{sanguine}} person, and has not hitherto been beaten." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peters {{sat down}} on a bench. [...] "All the same, I have {{followed}} you along the coast for a week. Felt I needed a change after my adventures with the exploring party, which I dare say you heard about. Business was slack, and I had a dispute with <b>my</b> <b>employers.</b> I resolved to give up my post, caught a Royal Mail boat, and here I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As my {{explanation}} has satisfied you, Sir," [...] he went on; his {{clear and}} deliberate utterance rising discordantly audible above the long, retiring {{roll of the}} last burst of thunder--"may I feel justified in speaking {{on the subject of}} your present position in <b>my</b> <b>employer's</b> house, with some freedom? I mean, if I may say so without offence, with the freedom of a friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I should {{say this is}} a pleasure," [...] Leslie remarked lightly. [...] "There is no use disguising the fact that we last met under {{somewhat}} unfortunate circumstances, but I give you my word that {{it was too late to}} suggest that <b>my</b> <b>employers</b> should choose another emissary when I discovered your identity. Where commercial interests are concerned, surely we can both rise superior to mere sentiment." ...|$|R
