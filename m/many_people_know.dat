[...] Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty [...] "cowards". [...] "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement {{they were trying to}} make I don't know. If it was {{anything to do with the}} relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, but how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "What Is Life" [...] was {{included}} on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as well as 2009's [...] The song has also been featured {{in a number of}} popular movies: Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), during the [...] "May 11, 1980" [...] sequence; Tom Shadyac's Patch Adams (1998); and, more recently, Sam Mendes' Away We Go (2009). In late 2012, [...] "What Is Life" [...] was used in advance promotion for the film This Is 40, directed by Judd Apatow, although it was omitted from the accompanying soundtrack album. According to Rolling Stone: [...] "Today, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> it merely as a song from all those soundtracks: it's in This Is 40, Patch Adams, Goodfellas and many more. It's almost as ubiquitous as 'Let My Love Open the Door' or 'Solsbury Hill.'" [...] In Scorsese's 2011 documentary , [...] "What Is Life" [...] plays over a sequence of 1969 photos of Harrison – with, variously, Preston, Jackie Lomax, the Plastic Ono Band, Clapton and Ravi Shankar – immediately before which, archive footage shows him discussing the restrictions he felt within the Beatles and how the band [...] "had to implode".|$|E

[...] Overall, it wasn’t the Pomo people who wanted to give up their traditions and arts; it was the forcefulness of other cultures. If the Pomo people were not so objectified and attack in their past, there would have been more baskets, traditions, and Pomo people alive in this day and age.|$|E

2500|$|UP 844 is a 4-8-4 Northern type express {{passenger}} {{steam locomotive}} (class FEF-3). [...] It {{was the last}} steam locomotive built for UP {{and has been in}} continuous service since its 1944 delivery. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> the engine as the No. 8444, since an extra '4' was added to its number in 1962 to distinguish it from a diesel numbered in the 800 series. It regained its rightful number in June 1989, after the diesel was retired and donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada. A mechanical failure occurred on June 24, 1999, in which the boiler tubes from the 1996 overhaul, being made of the wrong material, collapsed inside the boiler and put the steam locomotive out of commission. The UP steam crew successfully repaired it and returned it to service on November 10, 2004. It was rebuilt and returned to service in 2016. It is the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 2014 {{the results}} of the study were {{published}} in the journal Resuscitation. Among those who reported a perception of awareness and completed further interviews, 46 per cent experienced a broad range of mental recollections in relation to death that were not compatible with the commonly used term of NDEs. These included fearful and persecutory experiences. Only 9 per cent had experiences compatible with NDEs and 2 per cent exhibited full awareness compatible with OBEs with explicit recall of 'seeing' and 'hearing' events. One case was validated and timed using auditory stimuli during cardiac arrest. According to Caroline Watt [...] "The one ‘verifiable period of conscious awareness’ that Parnia was able to report did not relate to this objective test. Rather, it was a patient giving a supposedly accurate report of events during his resuscitation. He didn’t identify the pictures, he described the defibrillator machine noise. But that’s not very impressive since <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> what goes on in an emergency room setting from seeing recreations on television." ...|$|E

In an article Seigenthaler wrote for USA Today in late 2005, he said, [...] "I am interested in letting <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool." [...] He also pointed out that the false information had been online for over four months before he was aware of it, and that he had not been able to edit the article to correct it. After speaking with Wikipedia co-founder, Jimmy Wales, Seigenthaler said: [...] "My 'biography' was posted May 26. On May 29, one of Wales' volunteers 'edited' it only by correcting the misspelling of the word 'early.' For four months, Wikipedia depicted me as a suspected assassin before I erased it from the website's history Oct. 5. The falsehoods remained on Answers.com and Reference.com for three more weeks." [...] Editing Wikipedia, he suggested, would lend it his sanction or approval, and he stated his belief that editing the article was not enough and instead he wanted to expose [...] "incurable flaws" [...] in the Wikipedia process and ethos.|$|E
