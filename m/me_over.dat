25|$|Wilson and Robertson had a {{very brief}} {{handover}} meeting at the War Office, at which Robertson (by Wilson’s account) was “grumpy and ungracious & said {{he had nothing to}} say – and indeed said nothing”. Wilson later recalled (in his last letter as CIGS, to Rawlinson (13 Feb 1922)) that he “walked out without handing <b>me</b> <b>over</b> anything in particular; there was indeed a box of matches in the top right-hand drawer and some feathers for pipe-cleaning, or the remains of some of the Staff”.|$|E

25|$|Satisfying the {{constant}} demand for new musical content on the LSU gridiron {{was a small}} cadre of young aspiring student composers and arrangers which included Bill Conti, who would later gain first fame by penning Gonna Fly Now, the theme song popularized by the 1976 hit film Rocky. During his tenure, Tyra introduced Hey, Fightin' Tigers, an adaptation of Hey, Look <b>Me</b> <b>Over</b> from the 1960 musical Wildcat! by Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh. This team spirit song - later adopted by the LSU Golden Girls as their introductory theme - continues to be used at LSU athletic events today.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

Christus is known to have signed six extant works, sometimes with the text [...] "PETR XPI ME FECIT" [...] (Petr Xpi made <b>me).</b> <b>Over</b> the next century sketches of Christus' biography were constructed, as art historians – notably Panofsky – slowly disentangled his works from those of van Eyck.|$|E

500|$|On October 30, 1613, Kepler {{married the}} 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger. Following {{the death of}} his first wife Barbara, Kepler had {{considered}} 11 different matches over two years (a decision process formalized later as the marriage problem). He eventually returned to Reuttinger (the fifth match) who, he wrote, [...] "won <b>me</b> <b>over</b> with love, humble loyalty, economy of household, diligence, and the love she gave the stepchildren." [...] The first three children of this marriage (Margareta Regina, Katharina, and Sebald) died in childhood. Three more survived into adulthood: Cordula (born 1621); Fridmar (born 1623); and Hildebert (born 1625). According to Kepler's biographers, this was a much happier marriage than his first.|$|E

[...] He shopped the story to Vertigo Comics and met comic book artist Kent Williams, whose illustrations impressed him. Aronofsky hired Williams to create the graphic novel, and Ari Handel, co-writer for the film, provided Williams with research, photographs, and images on [...] "Mayans, astronomy, pulsars, and all kinds of cool stuff" [...] for the graphic novel's design.

Brian Jacks of MTV complimented the show's focus on whale conservation, writing, [...] "Leave it to the hard-hitting folks at South Park to do more for conservationism than fifteen cable reality shows put together." [...] Josh Modell of The A.V. Club said the episode was unfunny and mocked a television series that was [...] "culturally insignificant" [...] and not particularly well-known. Modell wrote, [...] "The show's star, Paul Watson, seems to have really pissed off South Park's creators Parker and Stone [...] Fine, but could you make me laugh a few times while you beat <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the head with information about a guy that I couldn't care less about?" ...|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to <b>me</b> <b>over</b> the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was giving}} up {{hope of finding}} Judy when she arrived in his new camp. [...] "I couldn’t believe my eyes.

[...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E

Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. I am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I was like this is a beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won <b>me</b> <b>over</b> because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E
