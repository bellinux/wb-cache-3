5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{he worked}} in the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney, where he {{produced}} a laboratory <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cavity magnetron. In September 1942, he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons for radar sets. In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bombs.|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the moist air {{equation}} of state. There are equations of state discussed in the article, i. e. the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> ideal gases, the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> real gases and the model based on the virial equation of state. The evaluation of sound speed based on the ideal mixture concept is mentioned. The sound speed calculated by the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> ideal gases is compared with the sound speed calculated by using the model based on the concept <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> real gases. The comparison of enthalpy end entropy based on the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> ideal gases and the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> real gases is performed. It is shown that the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> real gases deviates from the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal mixture <b>of</b> ideal gases only {{in the case of}} high pressure. An impossibility of the definition of partial pressure in the mixture of real gases is discussed, where the virial equation of state is used...|$|R

5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt}} to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
5|$|In 916, at {{what would}} {{have been the end of}} his third term as Khitan Grand Khan, Abaoji made a number of changes moving the Khitan state closer to the model of {{governance}} used by the Chinese dynasties. He assumed the title of Celestial Emperor and designated an era name, named his oldest son Yelü Bei as his successor, and commissioned the construction of a Confucian temple. Two years later he established a capital city, Shangjing (上京), which imitated the <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Chinese capital city.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} between the Milne <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expanding universe, and the current (Einstein's) <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expanding universe was that Milne did not assume a priori that the universe has a homogeneous matter distribution.

5|$|The {{theory that}} the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first {{proposed}} by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).

5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution.
