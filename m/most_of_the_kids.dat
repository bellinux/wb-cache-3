2500|$|While {{the strip}} {{in its early}} years resembles its later form, there are {{significant}} differences. The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or rugby football. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways.|$|E
60|$|The boy stopped. Hendricks {{lowered his}} gun. The boy stood silently, looking at him. He was small, not very old. Perhaps eight.

At dawn, Charlie Bowdre emerged to feed the horses and was riddled with rifle slugs by Garrett's posse, which had surrounded the building in the night. Later that day, Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> and his partners gave up. After being riddled with bullets he fell back into the doorway where, at <b>the</b> urging <b>of</b> Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> to 'take a few of them with you when you die', Bowdre made a valiant exit. Unfortunately he was already too weak and near death at that point and couldn't get his gun out of his holster.

50|$|Toots Pye, Sidney's twin sister, is {{the only}} girl in Class 2B. Although she is a tomboy, she is more {{feminine}} than Minnie the Minx.

What allowed her to stay on the show {{for as long as she}} did, besides her natural TV talents (even more remarkable given the fact that she had no acting experience beforehand), was the fact that she looked much younger than she actually was, and could pass for a teenager well into her twenties.|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a study}} of a smallholder goat production system in the Boane district, southern Mozambique. Goat keepers (n = 65) were selected and their goats (Landim breed) (n = 770) were recorded and monitored over two years (1993 – 1995). Goat numbers per household were small (9. 7) and raised under a traditional management system. Females outnumbered males and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male <b>kids</b> {{were removed from the}} flock before nine months of age. Age of first kidding was on average 390 days. Litter sizes varied between 1. 44 and 1. 87 and the percentage multiple births (54 %) corresponded well with reported values. The mortality rate increased proportionally among twins as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> twin births increased. This study provided a base-line survey <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> information can be used in future projects of this nature. ______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

40|$|Goat's milk, {{considered}} {{a substitute for}} cow's milk, has a high nutritional value. However, goat's milk contains various allergens, predominantly β-lactoglobulin (BLG). In this study, we employed the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to target the BLG locus in goat fibroblasts for sgRNA optimization and generate BLG knock-out goats through co-injection of Cas 9 mRNA and small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into goat embryos at the one-cell stage. We firstly tested sgRNA editing efficiencies in goat fibroblast cells, and approximately 8. 00 %- 9. 09 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells were modified in single sgRNA-guided targeting experiment. Among <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> <b>the</b> genome-targeting efficiencies <b>of</b> single sgRNA were 12. 5 % (10 ng/μL sg 1) and 0 % (10 ng/μL sg 2) and efficiencies of dual sgRNAs were 25. 0 % (25 ng/μL sg 2 +sg 3 group) and 28. 6 % (50 ng/μL sg 2 +sg 3 group). Relative expression of BLG in BLG knock-out goat mammary glands significantly (p < 0. 01) decreased {{as well as other}} milk protein coding genes, such as CSN 1 S 1, CSN 1 S 2, CSN 2, CSN 3 and LALBA (p < 0. 05). As expected, BLG protein had been abolished in <b>the</b> milk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BLG knock-out goat. In addition, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> targeted <b>kids</b> were chimeric (3 / 4), and their various body tissues were edited simultaneously. Our study thus provides a basis for optimizing <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> goat milk, which can be applied to biomedical and agricultural research...|$|R
