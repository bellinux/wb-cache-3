500|$|Because the {{relationships}} between the members of the family tree are uncertain, it is difficult to identify the features inherited from the last common ancestor of all molluscs. For example, it is uncertain whether the ancestral mollusc was <b>metameric</b> (composed of repeating units)â€”if it was, that would suggest an origin from an annelid-like worm. Scientists disagree about this: Giribet and colleagues concluded, in 2006, the repetition of gills and of the foot's retractor muscles were later developments, while in 2007, Sigwart concluded the ancestral mollusc was <b>metameric,</b> and it had a foot used for creeping and a [...] "shell" [...] that was mineralized. In one particular branch of the family tree, the shell of conchiferans is thought to have evolved from the s (small spines) of aplacophorans; but this is difficult to reconcile with the embryological origins of spicules.|$|E

2500|$|Centipedes (from Latin prefix , [...] "hundred", and , [...] "foot") are {{arthropods}} {{belonging to}} the class Chilopoda of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group which also includes Millipedes and other multi-legged creatures. Centipedes are elongated <b>metameric</b> creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. Centipedes {{are known to be}} highly venomous, and often inject paralyzing venom. Despite the name, centipedes can have a varying number of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes always have an odd number of pairs of legs. Therefore, no centipede has exactly 100 legs. A key trait uniting this group is a pair of venom claws or forcipules formed from a modified first appendage. Centipedes are [...] predominantly carnivorous.|$|E
60|$|Section 144. In {{contrast}} to <b>metameric</b> segmentation is the antimeric repetition of radial symmetry (Section 142), {{in which each}} ray of the star is called an antimere. It is possible to have bilateral symmetry without a <b>metameric</b> arrangement of parts, as in the mussel and the cuttle-fish; but <b>metameric</b> segmentation without complete or reduced bilateral symmetry does not occur.|$|E
60|$|Section 143. We {{also see}} in various organs of the rabbit, and {{especially}} in the case of the limbs and vertebral column, what is called <b>metameric</b> segmentation, that is, a repetition of parts, one behind the other, along the axis of the body. Thus the bodies and arches of the vertebrae repeat each other, and so do the spinal nerves. The renal organ of the rabbit, some time before birth, displays a <b>metameric</b> arrangement of its parts; but this disappears, as development proceeds, into the compact kidney of the adult. But the <b>metameric</b> segmentation in the rabbit's organism is not nearly so marked as that of an earthworm, for instance, which is visibly a chain of rings. If the student wants a perfect figure of <b>metameric</b> segmentation he should think of a train of precisely similar carriages, or a string of beads. One bead, one carriage, one vertebra, would be a metamere.|$|E
60|$|Section 145. We {{are now in}} a {{position}} to appreciate the fact that the old and more popularly know division of animals into vertebrata and invertebrata scarcely represents the facts of the case, that the primary division should be into protozoa and metazoa, and that the vertebrata are one of several groups of metazoa with a fundamental bilateral symmetry and imperfect <b>metameric</b> segmentation.|$|E
6000|$|... (a) A {{skeletal}} axis (the vertebral column) {{between its}} central [...] nervous {{system and its}} body cavity. In the adult rabbit this [...] consists of a chain of vertebrae, but in the embryo (i.e., the [...] young rabbit before birth) it is represented by a continuous chord, [...] the notochord, and it remains as such {{in some of the}} lowest [...] vertebrata throughout life. In other words, in these lower [...] vertebrata, the vertebral axis is not <b>metameric.</b>|$|E
60|$|Section 37. But as {{certainly}} {{as we have}} no such <b>metameric</b> segmentation, as this older view implies, in the brain-case of the frog, so quite as certainly is <b>metameric</b> segmentation evident in its branchial arches. We have the four gill slits of the tadpole and their bars repeating one another; the hyoid bar in front of these is evidently of a similar nature; and that the ear drum is derived from an imperforate gill slit is enforced {{by the presence of}} an open slit (the spiracle) in the rays and dog-fish in an entirely equivalent position. Does the mouth answer to a further pair of gill slits, and is the jaw arch (palato-pterygoid + Meckel's cartilage) equivalent to the arches that come behind it? This question has been asked, and answered in the affirmative, by many morphologists, but not by any means by all. The cranial nerves have a curious similarity of arrangement with regard to the gill slits and the mouth; the fifth nerve forks over the mouth, the seventh forks over the ear drum, the ninth, in the tadpole and fish, forks over the first branchial slit, and the tenth is, as it were, a leash of nerves, each forking over one of the remaining gill slits. But this matter will be more intelligible when the student has worked over a fish type, and need not detain us any further now.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metameric</b> matches {{are quite}} common, {{especially}} in near neutral (grayed or whitish colors) or dark colors. As colors become brighter or more saturated, {{the range of}} possible <b>metameric</b> matches (different combinations of light wavelengths) becomes smaller, especially in surface colors.|$|E
50|$|The word {{metamerism}} {{is often}} incorrectly used {{to indicate a}} <b>metameric</b> failure rather than a match, or incorrectly used to describe {{a situation in which}} a <b>metameric</b> match is easily degraded by a slight change in conditions, such as a change in the illuminant.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Metameric</b> matches {{made between}} two light sources provide the {{trichromatic}} basis of colorimetry. For any given light stimulus, {{regardless of the}} form of its spectral emittance curve, there always exists a unique mixture of three [...] "primary" [...] lights that when added together, or added to the stimulus, will be an exact <b>metameric</b> match.|$|E
5000|$|Absolute true-color {{rendering}} is impossible. There {{are three}} {{major sources of}} color error (<b>metameric</b> failure): ...|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in the spectral compositions of two <b>metameric</b> stimuli {{is often referred to}} as the degree of metamerism. The sensitivity of a <b>metameric</b> match to any changes in the spectral elements that form the colors depend on the degree of metamerism. Two stimuli with a high degree of metamerism are likely to be very sensitive to any changes in the illuminant, material composition, observer, field of view, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Color matches made in {{the paint}} {{industry}} are often aimed at achieving a spectral color match rather than just a tristimulus (<b>metameric)</b> color match under a given spectrum of light. A spectral color match attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good <b>metameric</b> match with a low degree of metamerism, and thereby reducing {{the sensitivity of the}} resulting color match to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{illuminant}} <b>metameric</b> {{failure is}} sometimes {{used to describe}} situations where two material samples match when viewed under one light source but not another. Most types of fluorescent lights produce an irregular or peaky spectral emittance curve, so that two materials under fluorescent light might not match, {{even though they are}} a <b>metameric</b> match to an incandescent [...] "white" [...] light source with a nearly flat or smooth emittance curve. Material colors that match under one source will often appear different under the other.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis for}} nearly all commercially {{available}} color image reproduction processes such as photography, television, printing, and digital imaging, {{is the ability to}} make <b>metameric</b> color matches.|$|E
5000|$|Some plants, {{particularly}} grasses, {{demonstrate a}} rather clear <b>metameric</b> construction, {{but many others}} either lack discrete modules or their presence is more arguable. Phyton theory has been criticized as an over-ingenious, academic conception which bears little relation to reality. Eames (1961) concluded that [...] "concepts of the shoot as consisting {{of a series of}} structural units have been obscured by the dominance of the stem- and leaf-theory. Anatomical units like these do not exist: the shoot is the basic unit." [...] Even so, others still consider comparative study {{along the length of the}} <b>metameric</b> organism to be a fundamental aspect of plant morphology.|$|E

5000|$|Observer <b>metameric</b> failure {{can occur}} because of {{differences}} in color vision between observers. The common source of observer <b>metameric</b> failure is colorblindness, {{but it is also}} not uncommon among [...] "normal" [...] observers. In all cases, the proportion of long-wavelength-sensitive cones to medium-wavelength-sensitive cones in the retina, the profile of light sensitivity in each type of cone, and the amount of yellowing in the lens and macular pigment of the eye, differs from one person to the next. This alters the relative importance of different wavelengths in a spectral power distribution to each observer's color perception. As a result, two spectrally dissimilar lights or surfaces may produce a color match for one observer but fail to match when viewed by a second observer.|$|E
50|$|Approximate true-color images {{gathered}} by spacecraft are an example where images {{have a certain}} amount of <b>metameric</b> failure, as the spectral bands of a spacecraft's camera are chosen to gather information on the physical properties of the object under investigation, and are not chosen to capture true-color images.|$|E
50|$|In {{vascular}} plants, {{the shoot}} system differs fundamentally from the root system {{in that the}} former shows a <b>metameric</b> construction (repeated units of organs; stem, leaf, and inflorescence), while the latter does not.

50|$|Making <b>metameric</b> matches using {{reflective}} {{materials is}} more complex. The appearance of surface colors {{is defined by}} the product of the spectral reflectance curve of the material and the spectral emittance curve of the light source shining on it. As a result, the color of surfaces depends on the light source used to illuminate them.|$|E
5000|$|In biology, {{metamerism}} is {{the phenomenon}} of having a linear series of body segments fundamentally similar in structure, though not all such structures are entirely alike in any single life form because some of them perform special functions.In animals, <b>metameric</b> segments {{are referred to as}} somites or metameres. In plants, they are referred to as metamers or, more concretely, phytomers.|$|E
50|$|Finally, field-size <b>metameric</b> {{failure occurs}} because the {{relative}} {{proportions of the}} three cone types in the retina vary {{from the center of}} the visual field to the periphery, so that colors that match when viewed as very small, centrally fixated areas may appear different when presented as large color areas. In many industrial applications, large field color matches are used to define color tolerances.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{and other}} {{chordates}} are conspicuous examples of organisms that have metameres intimately grouped into tagmata. In the Chordata the metameres of each tagma are fused {{to such an}} extent that few repetitive features are directly visible. Intensive investigation is necessary to discern the metamerism in the tagmata of such organisms. Examples of detectable evidence of vestigially <b>metameric</b> structures include branchial arches and cranial nerves.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} a <b>metameric</b> failure would be for example {{an image of a}} green tree which shows a {{different}} shade of green than the tree itself, a different shade of red for a red apple, a different shade of blue for the blue sky, and so on. Color management (e.g. with ICC profiles) can be used to mitigate this problem within the physical constraints.|$|E
50|$|He practised a {{wide range}} of traumatological and {{surgical}} techniques, both for war injuries and civil purposes, contributed to the modernisation of surgery in Spain and participated actively in the reorganisation of the Spanish Military Health system in the 1920s. Due to his early accidental death, his pioneering work in epidural anesthesia (or <b>metameric</b> anesthesia as he called it) went unnoticed for many years outside of Spanish speaking countries.|$|E

5000|$|Normally, {{material}} attributes such as translucency, gloss or {{surface texture}} {{are not considered}} in color matching. However geometric <b>metameric</b> failure can occur when two samples match when viewed from one angle, but then fail to match when viewed from a different angle.

50|$|The {{body plan}} of the Yorgia and other proarticulates is unusual for solitary (non-colonial) metazoans. These {{bilateral}} organisms have a segmented <b>metameric</b> body, but left and right transverse elements (isomers) are organized in an alternating pattern relatively to the axis of the body - they are not direct mirror images. This phenomenon is described as the symmetry of gliding reflection, which is a characteristic {{also found in the}} similar Spriggina. Some proarticulates (Yorgia, Archaeaspinus) demonstrate obvious asymmetry of left and right parts of the body. Yorgiaâ€™s initial right isomer is the only one which spreads far towards {{the left side of the}} body.|$|E
