40|$|We {{describe}} our research—its approach, {{results and}} products—on Danish {{emergency medical service}} (EMS) field or “pre-hospital ” work in minor and <b>major</b> <b>incidents.</b> We discuss how commitments to participatory design and attention to the qualitative differences between minor and <b>major</b> <b>incidents</b> address challenges identified by disaster sociologists when designing for <b>major</b> <b>incidents.</b> Through qualitative research and participatory design, we have examined the features of EMS work and technology use in different emergency situations {{from the perspective of}} multiple actors. We conceptualize victims in incidents—and particularly in <b>major</b> <b>incidents,</b> where on-site medical assessments is highly incomplete—as boundary objects over which the complex and imperfect work of coordination is done. As an outcome of our participatory design approach, we describe a set of designs in support of future EMS work.

5|$|The ride {{originally}} operated {{with three}} trains designed by Premier Rides. Each one consisted of six cars {{for a total}} capacity of thirty-six. The trains were shortened to five cars before the 2006 season. After the ride's first <b>major</b> <b>incident,</b> the trains were replaced altogether with lighter models before the ride reopened the following season. The loop was also removed during this time.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a man {{suffered}} a fatal head injury on his yacht amid rough seas and high winds. The Solent Coastguards flew out {{to rescue the}} man, but he was declared dead on the scene. Twenty vessels competing in the 2014 EXE Sails GP14 World Championships were caught in high winds produced by the storm and capsized in the Strangford Lough. A nearby hospital declared a <b>major</b> <b>incident</b> and the coast guard rushed to rescue the 97sailors stranded in the water. Only one person suffered injuries, but all were treated for hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|The Health Protection Agency and the <b>Major</b> <b>Incident</b> Investigation Board {{provided}} {{advice to}} prevent incidents {{such as these}} in the future. The primary need is for safety measures {{to be in place}} to prevent fuel escaping the tanks in which it is stored. Added safety measures are needed for when fuel does escape, mainly to prevent it forming a flammable vapour and stop pollutants from poisoning the environment.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>major</b> <b>incident</b> was on 22 July, {{when the}} British {{administrative}} and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in {{to take charge of}} the search for survivors and secure the part of the building left standing. Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety-one victims. To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23July.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Nürnberg {{took part in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War without <b>major</b> <b>incident.</b> After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she was used to lay defensive minefields off the German coast. She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine-layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by a British submarine in December 1939. She was thereafter used as a training ship in the Baltic Sea for {{most of the rest of}} the war, apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943. In January 1945, she was assigned to mine-laying duties in the Skaggerak, but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A <b>major</b> <b>incident</b> occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Nürnberg {{participated in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War; she completed her patrols without <b>major</b> <b>incident</b> and returned to Germany in mid-1937. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, {{she was used to}} lay defensive minefields off the German coast in the North Sea. She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine-layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by the British submarine Salmon on 13 December 1939. After repairs were completed in early 1940, Nürnberg returned to active duty as a training ship in the Baltic Sea. She performed this role for {{most of the rest of}} the war, apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943. In January 1945, she was assigned to mine-laying duties in the Skaggerak, but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, the first <b>major</b> <b>incident</b> {{of the game}} {{occurred}} when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to pick out a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E
