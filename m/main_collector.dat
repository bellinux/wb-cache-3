Legally the football pools collectors were agents of the entrants, not the pools company.

50|$|Because of its poor discharge, the Miljacka {{is known}} for its {{peculiar}} smell and brown waters. Miljacka river cascades, which regulate the waterbed and enrich the water with oxygen, are a twirling trap for plastic scraps, stranded balls, car tires and various waste. The <b>main</b> <b>collector</b> that drains the fecal matter is parallel with the flow of Miljacka up to its mouth to the river Bosna. The sewer system is not connected to the <b>main</b> <b>collector,</b> causing leakage of fecal matter directly into the waters of Miljacka on several places. Due to Bosnian War water treatment was stopped and plant equipment looted preventing local government {{to deal with the issue}} as estimations to repair the wastewater plant run between 50 and 60 million euros.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{current work}} {{presents}} a bibliometric discussion on articles published worldwide concerning kaolinite flotation in international journals from 1992 to 2015. In total, 39 articles {{were selected from}} Elsevier's database, SciVerse ScienceDirect. This work allowed to recognize and identify which are the thematic and methodological trends that are being used, {{in addition to the}} <b>main</b> <b>collectors</b> used in kaolinite flotation. The results show that a significant amount of articles is produced by Chinese authors, especially from 2013, as China is the second highest aluminum producer in the world, and kaolinite is the reject in the reverse flotation process of diaspore. The results showed the difficulty of working with kaolinite flotation individually and confirmed that there is scientific collaboration among authors. Bibliometric analysis showed that the reagents used in kaolinite flotation tests are mostly derived from cationic nitrogenated compounds. Additionally, best recovery results from kaolinite flotation occurred in acidic media...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of voucher specimens in genetic resource documentation is briefly discussed {{and the scientific}} herbarium of the Agronomy Institute Cluj-Napoca is presented. The first centuria of this Herbarium was edited in 1880, the <b>main</b> <b>collectors</b> and organizers were B. Pater, I. Prodan, Al. Buia and A. Nyarady. The development of the herbarium was connected with {{the foundation of the}} first independent Experiment Station of Medicinal Plants (1904) and the organization of the Seed Testing Station in Cluj (1884). In the first period of its existence the herbarium served for floristic research and for the preservation of voucher specimens cultivated on experimental fields; the second period was a truly floristic one, the third was characterized by floristics and weed research. The present period started in the early 70 th-was influenced by genetic conservation strategies. The main Herbarium collection contains at present 27. 175 registered specimens and about 11. 100 unregistered sheats...|$|R
40|$|River Runoff Particularities in the Transylvanian Depression. The Transylvanian Basin is {{the widest}} {{and the best}} {{individualized}} area with negative morphology in the Carpathian range, which covers 10. 5 % of the Romanian territory (237, 5000 km 2). Because of its central position in the Carpathian-Danubian-Pontic area, the Transylvanian Basin {{is a place of}} convergence for several geographical elements, among which the rivers and the human potential are especially important. The junction between the mountain frame and the depression, with its geo-morphological, geological and climatic particularities is reflected by the differentiation of the drainage system on the two categories of rivers: foreign and local, highly different as far as both the volume of water transported and the leakage regime is concerned. The river system from the basin has three <b>main</b> <b>collectors,</b> all with a different orientation: Somes to the north, Mures to the west and Olt to the south...|$|R

50|$|Jostedøla (or Jostedalselva) is a river {{which runs}} through the Jostedalen valley in the {{municipality}} of Luster in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. The Jostedøla river begins near the Fåbergstølen mountain farm where the runoff from the great Jostedalsbreen glacier and the lakes Austdalsvatnet and Styggevatnet comes together in the Jostedalen valley. It then flows south for about 50 km, past the village of Jostedal, and finally empties into the Gaupnefjorden (a small arm off of the Sognefjorden) at the village of Gaupne. The river is the <b>main</b> <b>collector</b> of water for a 804 km2 watershed area. The river is great for fishing trout and some salmon.|$|E

50|$|In {{most places}} a system {{designed}} for 5 successive days of no sun provides enough storage {{for all but}} a few days in a hundred years. Heat can be stored over a number of days using a large container of water. An 8-foot cube of water in the basement might store 15 kL of water, which is heated using a copper tube with fins in the collector. The performance of this can be further improved by putting the finned tube inside another layer of glazing {{at the back of the}} <b>main</b> <b>collector,</b> allowing the temperature to build up more than the surrounding air stream.

40|$|European scholars, colonial administrators, missionaries, bibliophiles {{and others}} were the <b>main</b> <b>collectors</b> of Malay books in the nineteenth century, both in {{manuscript}} or printed form. Among these persons were many well-known names {{in the field of}} Malay literature and culture like Raffles, Marsden, Crawfurd, Klinkert, van der Tuuk, von Dewall, Roorda, Favre, Maxwell, Overbeck, Wilkinson and Skeat, to name only a few. Their collections were often handed over to public libraries where they form {{an important part of the}} relevant Oriental or Southeast Asian manuscript collections. Therefore the knowledge of the intellectual culture of the Malay Peninsula and the Malay World in general depended very much on these manuscripts and printed books collected often by chance or in a rather unsystematic way. The collections reflect in a strong sense the interests of its administrative or philologist collectors: court histories, genealogies of aristocratic lineages, law collections (adat-istiadat as well as undangundang) or prose belles-lettres build a vast bulk of these collections, while Islamic religious texts and poetry forms popular in the 19 th century (especially syair) are fairl...|$|R

2500|$|Overview Urban {{water supply}} in China is the {{responsibility}} of [...] "cities" [...] under complex arrangements that differ substantially from one city to the other. The term [...] "City" [...] has a dual and confusing meaning in China. It is used here to refer to the main urban area of a municipality, prefecture, or county. Cities are governed by a [...] "leading group" [...] under the leadership of a mayor, who is assisted by various [...] "bureaus", or departments. Services are usually provided by municipally owned water bureaus [...] and wastewater bureaus (sometimes referred to as utilities despite the relatively limited autonomy that these companies enjoy). Water and wastewater bureaus are typically separate from each other. In larger cities, services are further unbundled: There may be a separate raw water bureau that transports water from far-away sources and sells it to the municipal water bureau for distribution. Likewise on the wastewater side, larger cities may have several district drainage bureaus in charge of parts of the city, a wastewater bureau in charge of the <b>main</b> <b>collectors,</b> and a third bureau in charge of wastewater treatment.|$|R
