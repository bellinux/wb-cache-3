5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital inclination to our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E

We opted for this formula rather than the Raw/Max(Raw) formula essentially because {{of the existence of}} <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> which differ from zero. If all <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> for all components were zero both formulas would be equivalent and would generate identical normalized values.|$|R
50|$|Tolerance stackups or {{tolerance}} stacks {{are used}} to describe the problem-solving process in mechanical engineering of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and tolerances. Typically these dimensions and tolerances are specified on an engineering drawing. Arithmetic tolerance stackups use the worst-case maximum or <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> of dimensions and tolerances to calculate the maximum and minimum distance (clearance or interference) between two features or parts. Statistical tolerance stackups evaluate the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> based on the absolute arithmetic calculation combined with some method for establishing likelihood of obtaining the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>values,</b> such as Root Sum Square (RSS) or Monte-Carlo methods.|$|R

25|$|The {{extreme value}} theorem of Karl Weierstrass states that a {{continuous}} real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>value.</b> More generally, a lower semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its minimum; an upper semi-continuous function on a compact set attains its maximum.|$|E
25|$|If the {{potential}} is bounded from below, meaning there is a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the variational principle, as follows. (See also below).|$|E

25|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of such systems {{depends on the}} choice of {{reference}} frame: the reference frame that gives the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of that energy {{is the center of}} momentum frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the invariant mass of the system as a whole.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the high}} {{permittivity}} supports high capacitance values in small devices. Class 2 capacitors are significantly smaller than class 1 devices at the equal rated capacitance and voltage.

25|$|Fluids {{that have}} low {{electrical}} conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine {{as fast as}} they are separated and hence electrostatic charge accumulation is not significant.

25|$|In {{computational}} phylogenetics, tree alignment is {{the problem}} of producing a multiple sequence alignment, which can be used to analyse a set of sequences with evolutionary relationship using a fixed tree. Essentially, tree alignment is an algorithm for optimizing phylogenetic tree by calculating the edit distance to achieve the <b>minimum</b> <b>value.</b> To be specific, phylogenetic tree shows an evolutionary relationship between different species and taxa joined together are assumed to have the same ancestor.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{charging}} mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine {{as fast as}} they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant.

25|$|It {{does not}} seem likely that {{standards}} for copper wire purity will increase beyond the current <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> of 101% IACS. Although 6-nines copper (99.9999% pure) has been produced in small quantities, it is extremely expensive and probably unnecessary for most commercial applications such as magnet, telecommunications, and building wire. The electrical conductivity of 6-nines copper and 4-nines copper (99.99% pure) is nearly the same at ambient temperature, although the higher-purity copper has a higher conductivity at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, for non-cryogenic temperatures, 4-nines copper will probably remain the dominant material for most commercial wire applications.|$|E

25|$|It is more {{accurate}} to speak of ozone depletion in middle latitudes rather than holes. Total column ozone declined below pre-1980 values between 1980 and 1996 for mid-latitudes. In the northern mid-latitudes, it then increased from the <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> by about two percent from 1996 to 2009 as regulations took effect {{and the amount of}} chlorine in the stratosphere decreased. In the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, total ozone remained constant over that time period. There are no significant trends in the tropics, largely because halogen-containing compounds have not had time to break down and release chlorine and bromine atoms at tropical latitudes.|$|E

Provincial unions are reimbursed by the NZRU $50,000 for every contracted All Black on their books who goes to the 2015 World Cup. If that All Black becomes available for any reason, the union has to pay back a pro-rata fee to the NZRU {{to gain access to the}} player. All Blacks unavailable due to test commitments do not count towards the salary cap.|$|E
25|$|The simplex {{algorithm}} {{applied to}} the Phase I problem must terminate with a <b>minimum</b> <b>value</b> for the new objective function since, being the sum of nonnegative variables, its value is bounded below by 0. If the minimum is 0 then the artificial variables can be eliminated from the resulting canonical tableau producing a canonical tableau equivalent to the original problem. The simplex algorithm can then be applied to find the solution; this step is called PhaseII. If the minimum is positive {{then there is no}} feasible solution for the Phase I problem where the artificial variables are all zero. This implies that the feasible region for the original problem is empty, and so the original problem has no solution.|$|E

To perform such an estimate, we can simply define a training set and evaluate these values while executing the algorithm over this training set. The code fragment 3.4 demonstrates how to calculate the maximum value for a matrix variable.
