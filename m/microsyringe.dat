50|$|Experimental {{preparation}} {{requires that}} the trough and barriers be thoroughly cleaned by a solvent such as ethanol to remove any residual organics.

The amphiphilic molecules dissolved in solvent are slowly dropped onto the liquid surface using a <b>microsyringe,</b> with care being taken to spread it uniformly across the surface. Some time must be taken to allow for evaporation of the solvent, and the spreading of the amphiphile. The Wilhelmy plate to be used must be absolutely clean. A platinum plate must stripped of any organics with a solvent or heated by a flame.

50|$|There {{are mainly}} two methods for loading samples onto FD emitters: the emitter-dipping {{technique}} and the syringe technique. Emitter-dipping technique {{is simple and}} commonly used in most laboratories. In this technique, the solid samples are dissolved or suspended in a suitable medium, and then an activated emitter (usually a tungsten wire with many microneedles) is dipped into the solution and drawn out again. When the wire {{is removed from the}} solution, the solution of a volume about 10−2 μl adheres to the microneedles (an average length of 30 μm) or remains between them. The other technique, syringe technique, applies to the compounds which are less concentrated than 10−5 M. A droplet of the solution from a <b>microsyringe</b> which is fitted to a micromanipulator is deposited uniformly on the microneedles. After evaporation of the solvent, the procedure for the two techniques can be repeated several times to load more samples. The syringe technique has the advantage that measured volumes of the solution can be accurately dispensed on the center of the wire.|$|E

40|$|When {{encapsulated}} microbubbles {{are subjected}} to high-amplitude ultrasound, the following phenomena have been reported: oscillation, translation, coalescence, fragmentation, sonic cracking and jetting. In this paper, we explain these phenomena, based on theories that were validated for relatively big, free (not encapsulated) gas bubbles. These theories are compared with high-speed optical observations of insonified contrast agent microbubbles. Furthermore, the potential clinical applications of the bubble-ultrasound interaction are explored. We conclude {{that most of the}} results obtained are consistent with free gas bubble theory. Similar to cavitation theory, the number of fragments after bubble fission is in agreement with the dominant spherical harmonic oscillation mode. Remarkable are our observations of jetting through contrast agent microbubbles. The pressure at the tip of a jet is high enough to penetrate any human cell.

5000|$|In a GC analysis, a known {{volume of}} gaseous or liquid analyte is {{injected}} into the [...] "entrance" [...] (head) of the column, usually using a <b>microsyringe</b> (or, solid phase microextraction fibers, or a gas source switching system). As the carrier gas sweeps the analyte molecules through the column, this motion is inhibited by the adsorption of the analyte molecules either onto the column walls or onto packing materials in the column. The {{rate at which the}} molecules progress along the column depends on the strength of adsorption, which in turn depends on the type of molecule and on the stationary phase materials. Since each type of molecule has a different rate of progression, the various components of the analyte mixture are separated as they progress along the column and reach the end of the column at different times (retention time). A detector is used to monitor the outlet stream from the column; thus, the time at which each component reaches the outlet and the amount of that component can be determined. Generally, substances are identified (qualitatively) by the order in which they emerge (elute) from the column and by the retention time of the analyte in the column.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this letter}} is to present an {{original}} experimental technique to study weak shock wave in a minitube. Thus, we designed an apparatus that can be connected to any classical shock tube in order to characterize high speed flows induced by the shock wave transmission in minitubes. We proposed appropriated measurements based on high speed strioscopy coupled with pressure sensors. Two minitube diameters are considered: 1. 020 0. 010 and 0. 480 0. 010 mm. We realized preliminary experimental and numerical campaigns with an incident shock wave Mach number at 1. 12 0. 01. The generation of a microshock wave was observable in the two minitubes. For the smallest minitube, we found an attenuation {{of the strength of}} the shock wave with a decrease of 1. 8 % of the Mach number. The recent researches in the fluids mechanics of micro-systems let us foresee the advances that may allow the min-iaturization of microvalves, micronozzles, or micropumps. 1 In these microdevices the ratio between lateral surfaces and volume could be extremely greater than that in macrodevices and, as a consequence, increases the energy exchanges. If we focus on the domain of the microflows of gas, many studies have been proposed by the scientific community since the past two decades. 2, 3 Previous studies were carried in our team to treat microfluidic flows with low velocity regime. The aim of these studies was to characterize the gas/wall interactions through the slip velocity in the slip regime and the estimation of accommodation coefficients from hydrody-namics to free molecular regime Knudsen number 0. 001, 50. 4, 5 Moreover, these studies allowed us to develop experimental techniques to deal with microflows at low speed. 6 However, the applications in high speed regime are numerous, for example, in microwave rotors where shock waves are efficiently used to transfer energy. 7 Nevertheless, the shock propagation in microchannel is not yet well studied and need to be better understood to increase microsystem efficiency. Even if we can note recent analytical modeliza-tion study, such as Mirshekari and Brouillette's one, 8 there is an important lack of experiments dealing with the high speed flows, with or without shock wave. To our knowledge, the only working device devoted to the high speed gaseous flows in microchannels is that developed by Udagawa, Garen, and their co-workers in Refs. 9 and 10. Their apparatus is based on the use of a quickly deformable opening valve that initially separates the microchannel from the high pressure chamber. In previous studies, we numerically investigated the possibility to transmit a shock wave into a microchannel. 11 In this work, several simulations have been realized to consider the influence of the microchannel dimensions. Besides, we designed an original apparatus based on the use of a generic microvalve to generate microshock waves. 12 However, before building this whole device, we decided to use our classical shock tube facilities in order to study weaker microshock waves and to bring additional validations for our code CARBUR Ref. 13 IUSTI, Marseille, France to deal with microfluidics phenomena. Thus, the present letter is dedicated to the presentation of the new experimental technique and the results we obtained both experimentally and numerically. First of all, we describe how we adapted a minitube to our classical shock tube T 80 Ref. 14 and what types of measures have been done. Then, we present the results of experiments and simulations and we conclude and give the main perspectives of this work. As the simplest device to generate shock wave is a shock tube, our idea is to connect a minitube {{to the end of a}} classical shock tube. A shock tube allows one to study compress-ible flows with a good repeatability and with an easy control of the shock strength. With this principle, one can deal with the shock wave transmission and high speed flow generation in a microsystem. In this context, we use our T 80 facility with a high speed shadowgraph video recording diagnostic. We use mirrors with a diameter equals to 0. 3 m and a focal length of 3 m. The video is recorded with the digital camera fastcam SA 1 of Photron, San Diego, CA. All the experiments were made with air, and because the minitube makes a connection between the shock tube and the ambient air, the pressure P 1 was atmospheric pressure, 1 0. 01 10 5 Pa, and the temperature was the ambient temperature, 300 2 K. In these conditions, the maximum of incident shock strength we can reach with our facility is equal to M s = 1. 5 0. 01. One can note that it is smaller than shock wave strength expected by the other device we designed in Ref. 12. Minitubes' overall dimensions are given by Fig. 1. The minitubes are realized with commercial <b>microsyringes.</b> We only keep the cylindrical glass tube of the <b>microsyringes,</b> cut at the required dimensions. The main dimensions of minitubes are, for mini-tube 1, its length is equal to 81. 24 0. 05 mm and its diameter was measured at 1. 020 0. 010 mm.

It involves inoculation of seedlings in pots with an aq. suspension of sporangia applied by a <b>microsyringe.</b> Infection was greatest in seedlings inoculated before the first leaf unfolded and sharply decreased when the seedlings were inoculated at a later stage. The technique, which is more effective than field inoculation in producing downy mildew, resembles natural infection but allows inoculum uniformity and does not affect normal host activity. It is valuable for checking the reliability of field-identified resistance and for detecting high levels of resistance in key materia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new microfabrication technique for bender-type electromechanical actuators made of an elastomeric electroactive polymer. The technique {{is based on}} a computer-controlled deposition of the active material with a <b>microsyringe.</b> The paper describes the developed microfabrication system and proposes a simple deposition model. The realization of solid-state unimorph bender actuators made of polyurethane as electrolyte and a mixture of carbon black and polyurethane as electrodes is presented. Prototype actuators fabricated both with the new technique were driven with electrical field of 100 V/μm and showed bending angles higher than 30 °. In this way, we have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} fabricate polyurethane based microactuators using a polyurethane/carbon black composite such as device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new noninvasive {{measurement}} method for tracking {{the tendency of}} mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the radial artery. The designed system consists of a tonometer, a <b>microsyringe</b> device, and a model-based fuzzy logic controller. The modified flexible diaphragm tonometer is to detect the continuous blood pressure waveform and vessel volume pulse. A precise mathematical model describing {{the interaction between the}} tonometer and artery is derived. To reach accurate measurement without distortion, a model-based fuzzy logic control system is designed to compensate the change of MAP by applying a counter pressure on the tonometer chamber through the <b>microsyringe</b> device. The proposed control system consists of a linear predictor, a Kalman filter, and a synthetic fuzzy logic controller (SFLC). The linear predictor is to estimate the MAPs changing tendency based on the identified arterial pressure–volume model and then to beat-to-beat adjust the function of SFLC. The Kalman filter is to reduce the physiologic and measurement disturbance of the vessel volume oscillation amplitude (VOA). The SFLC is composed of three parallel subcontrollers, each of which is a simple fuzzy logic controller, for processing the three changing states of the MAP: ascending, descending, and stabilizing states, respectively. The design of the fuzzy rules in each subcontroller is based on the oscillometric principle saying that the arterial vessel has the maximum compliance when the detected vessel volume pulse reaches its maximum amplitude. Simulation results show that, for the real physiologic MAP with changing rates up to 20 or 20 mm-Hg/minute, the model-based SFLC can beat-to-beat adjust the tonometer’s chamber pressure to follow the tendency of MAP accurately. Index Terms—Blood pressure, compliance, oscillometry, tonometer, vessel volume pulse. I...|$|E
