40|$|AbstractIn recent years, several {{economists have}} argued that the sharp loss of {{competitiveness}} of the Brazilian industry was caused by a strong exchange rate appreciation. However, other economists have attributed this loss of competitiveness to the dismal growth of labor productivity in the Brazilian industrial sector. The present paper proposes to estimate the differential impacts of variations in exchange rate and labor productivity on the Brazilian <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> measured by the coefficient of import penetration of total demand for manufacturing goods. We start by developing a simple theoretical model to investigate under what conditions the impacts of an exchange rate depreciation and an increase in labor productivity would differ. We test the theoretical implications of the model by means of a GMM panel data analysis focusing on 17 manufacturing sectors in the period between 1996 and 2011. Our results suggest that both variables matter to explain the coefficient of import penetration. Nevertheless, labor productivity has the strongest negative impact on the market share of imported goods, even after controlling for sector fixed-effects...|$|E

40|$|The oil {{industry}} does {{not play a}} major role in the Ukrainian energy sector and has smaller economic and political significance than the gas, coal and nuclear sectors. The issues linked to the Ukrainian fuel sector are rarely given publicity in the mass media. Meanwhile, a comprehensive analysis reveals that there has been a painful and durable collapse in this strategic branch of the economy. What once was a powerful Ukrainian refining sector has been plunged into deep crisis for years. Only one out of the six existing refineries is currently in operation, using only a small section of its production capacity. For years all the refining companies have suffered from underinvestment, have not been modernised and have been unable to produce fuels in the quantities and at the quality required by the market. Another problem that has remained unresolved for years is the supply of crude oil to be processed. As a result, Ukrainian refineries are the most outdated in Europe, and the oil processing output in Ukraine has reached a record-low level of around 2. 5 million tonnes annually. At the same time, the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> fuels over the past few years has reached 80 – 85 % of total consumption.

40|$|The Agricultural Act of 2014 (Public Law 113 - 79) amended {{legislation}} {{regarding the}} U. S. catfish inspection program to include “all fish {{of the order}} Siluriformes,” encompassing imported species: basa, tra, and pangasius. Furthermore, the amendment finalized the transition of catfish and catfish-like product inspection responsibilities to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), leaving all other fish species under FDA inspection. The shift in responsibility produces tighter food safety mandates for domestically produced and imported catfish, which some argue acts as an administrative trade barrier protecting the U. S. catfish industry. Since domestic producers were likely subject to similar standards under FDA inspection, the cost of compliance is likely higher for international fish farmers who mostly operate in low-income countries. We analyze the potential trade distortions of the regulation change on domestic catfish production and imported products. Furthermore, we analyze {{the impact of the}} new regulation on the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> fish products relative to domestic production. The reformed legislation will likely decrease market competition from imported catfish-like products.

Cyprus had to reinvent itself as a wine producer after receiving a double blow: losing its main product, sherry, as a result of nomenclature protection by the European Union and the loss of its largest market after the fall of communism. The objective here is to examine the product (wine) and how it may be improved and upgraded for a more sophisticated market. Product quality and branding then immediately rise to the fore but to ensure that all the issues are being properly addressed, soundings were taken from local, Greek and international wine professionals as well as local consumers. There are 52 wineries in Cyprus but the industry is controlled by four main companies and tied mainly to a local grape variety, Mavro. The grapes are grown by people independent of the wineries and this has been a long-standing issue [...] affecting wine quality [...] as has the distance between where the grapes are grown and the wineries themselves. The methodology involved focus groups, depth interviews and an e-mail survey. Respondents were local consumers and wine experts who fell into three groups: local Cypriot, Greek and International.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to obtain}} basic data for policy development and R&D to sharpen competitiveness in domestic agricultural machinery industry by analyzing the recent status of demand and supply for tractor, rice transplanter(riding type), and combine. Methods: Basic data from 199, 275 units of tractor, rice transplanter (riding type), and combine was offered by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and Korea Agricultural Machinery Industry Cooperative. Those agricultural machines were supplied by the government’s loan support from 2003 to 2012. Results: Recent supply of tractor is only 13, 000 units or so per annum, thereby being stagnated. Rice transplanter and combine in 2012 corresponded to 3, 810 units and 2, 490 units, respectively. The domestic <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the <b>imported</b> agricultural machinery accounted for 60. 0 % in tractor, 99. 5 % in saddle rice transplanter, and 80. 9 % in combine, thereby having been sharply increased 33. 1 %p, 42. 0 %p and 53. 6 %p compared to the ones in 2003.

40|$|ABSTRACT. New {{findings}} from plant-level surveys show trade liberalization has op-posite effects on product variety and cost reduction within firms. I explain the tradeoff between firm investments in product variety and cost reduction with a monopolistic competition model of brand differentiation. Firms can make many different products within a brand. When a firm introduces a new product, it eats its own <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> existing products more than <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> other firms. <b>Import</b> competition induces firms to ease intra-firm cannibalization by narrowing product variety. Foreign market access allows firms to make products cheaply {{by investing in}} cost-reducing processes. These conflicting forces provide sharp predic-tions {{for the effects of}} trade liberalization on investments in product variety and production processes of firms. Examining Thai manufacturing firms, I show that intra-firm cannibalization is empirically relevant and trade liberalization has the predicted effects on product and process innovation during Thai tariff changes of 2003 - 2006. Thai tariff cuts reduce process innovation among exporters. Less export-oriented firms selling branded products increase product innovation while more export-oriented firms reduce product innovation in response to a Thai tariff cut. These results highlight the role of brand differentiation in unbundling the relationship between trade and innovation. Acknowledgment.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} is the lack of knowledge of millers' preferences for noodle wheat in Asia, where noodle wheat is an expanding market segment. Data for the study are from interviews and questionnaires completed by millers in South Korea and Japan. Two different methodologies were applied [...] stated preference methods and semantic differential scales. Consistent results are seen from each method. Millers' choices of wheat with varying characteristics were analysed with multinomial logit models. These estimates are used to identify millers' preferred product profiles for various types of wheat and flour. Estimates are reported in the paper for millers' preferences for intrinsic quality features and trade contract terms for major types of wheat. Marginal analysis also yielded comparisons of millers' preferences in the two nations. In contrast to Australia and the United States, Canada does not produce or market a wheat variety that corresponds well to millers' preferred noodle wheat product profiles in terms of the wheat characteristics of falling number, protein level or dockage. Nor is Canada identified by millers in either of these nations as a preferred supplier of noodle wheat. Canada has a minor <b>share</b> <b>of</b> wheat exports to Korea but holds an appreciable <b>share</b> <b>of</b> Japanese wheat <b>imports.</b> However, Canada's <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> Japanese wheat <b>imports</b> may be more reflective of Japan's current regulated import process, rather than millers' preferences.

40|$|Reports {{from the}} USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) suggest that EU beef {{production}} will be lower in 2003 {{as a result}} of a reduction in both the dairy and beef herds. However, EU beef exports are expected to increase as import restrictions arising from animal disease problems in the EU are lifted. Sales from intervention stocks are likely to continue into 2003. Some beef bought in under the 'special purchase scheme' has already been sent abroad as food aid (to North Korea). It is expected that the market effects of the BSE crisis will continue to fade in 2003 with implications for poultry and pork consumption in the EU. Beef prices in some EU countries have returned to pre-BSE levels. In the long term, however, beef consumption is expected to decline as consumers in France and the UK switch to other meats. Germany, Spain, Ireland and Italy could, however, see some marginal increase in beef consumption. In budgetary terms EU expenditure in the meat sector is expected to grow {{as a result of}} higher export refund allocations to make EU meat exports price competitive, and increased direct aid premiums arising form the Agenda 2000 reforms.

40|$|The {{trade of}} {{softwood}} lumber between the United States and Canada {{is one of}} the major forest products trade flows in the world. Since 1996, exports from the four major softwood lumber producing provinces in Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec) into the US have been regulated by the voluntary export restraint (VER) as defined within the “Softwood Lumber Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America” (SLA). The SLA allows Canadian producers to export up to 14. 7 billion board feet (bbf) of softwood lumber without export fee and imposes high export fees on volumes exceeding the limit. The SLA is a temporary resolution of the trade dispute between the two countries that has lasted for more than fifteen years and is set to expire on March 31 st, 2001. The objective of this study is to determine if the expected effects of the SLA on the US softwood lumber market during the period 1996 - 1999 have actually occurred. The study discussed four possible direct effects and five possible indirect effects that the SLA might have had on the US softwood lumber market from a simple economic model and a review of the literature. The expected direct effects include: 1) a regulated volume <b>of</b> softwood lumber <b>imports</b> into the US from the four major provinces in Canada, 2) an increase in the price of softwood lumber in the US, 3) an increase in US softwood lumber production, and 4) a decrease in US softwood lumber consumption. The expected indirect effects of the SLA include: 1) a shift in the composition of countries exporting softwood lumber into the US, 2) an upgrade in the quality of softwood lumber exported from the four major Canadian provinces into the US, 3) an increase in the volume of softwood logs and value-added wood products exported from Canada into the US, 4) some attempts by Canadian manufacturers to avoid the export permit requirement under the SLA, and 5) an increase in the use of alternative products (both wood and nonwood) as substitutes for softwood lumber in the US. The study also provides a discussion of the alternative solutions that might be implemented upon the expiration of the SLA on March 31 st, 2001 and a discussion of desirability/undesirability of the SLA based upon future softwood resource availability in the US. DIRECT EFFECTS Since the implementation of the SLA, softwood lumber exports from the four major provinces into the US have been restricted below the volume imported before the implementation of the SLA in 1995. While the two fixed bases (the “established base” without export fee, and the “lower fee base” with a $ 50 /thousand board feet (mbf) export fee) were mostly filled, the exported volume under the “upper fee base,” with a $ 100 /mbf export fee, appeared to fluctuate in response to price changes in the US. In spite of the shift of softwood lumber production from western to eastern Canada, the composition of exported volume among the four major provinces has been consistent. An analysis of the price data shows that the SLA has increased the price of softwood lumber products in the US relative to Canada. A comparison of the price trends of identical softwood lumber products (i. e., eastern SPF 2 x 4 s, KD, # 1 and 2) in two closely located markets (i. e., Toronto and Boston) demonstrates this two-tiered price structure. The price trends show that since the implementation of the SLA, the price for softwood lumber in Boston has been nearly 15 % higher than for the identical product sold in Toronto. However, there was virtually no difference in the price of softwood lumber in these two markets during the period leading up to the implementation of the SLA (August 1994 – March 1996). Despite the relative price increase in the US, softwood lumber consumption in the US has substantially increased throughout the period due to strong economic growth. Domestic softwood lumber production has also increased slightly faster than consumption during the implementation of the SLA. As a result, the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> softwood lumber declined from 36. 4 % of total US softwood lumber consumption in 1995 to 35. 2 % in 1999. INDIRECT EFFECTS In addition to the direct effects that the SLA has had on the softwood lumber market in the US, it has also had several indirect, and unintended, effects as well. Strong demand for softwood lumber in the US, coupled with restricted exports from the four major provinces in Canada, provided other foreign suppliers with an opportunity to enter and compete in the US market. While softwood lumber exports from the four major provinces have been relatively stable, the SLA-exempt provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) took advantage of their position to increase their softwood lumber exports into the US from 1. 4 bbf during the first year of the SLA to 2. 9 bbf during the fourth year. As a result, the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the SLA-exempt provinces in total Canadian softwood lumber exports to the US jumped from 7. 9 % during the first year of the SLA to 15. 6 % during the fourth year. Similarly, exports from non-Canadian countries have jumped from 389 million board feet (mmbf) to 912 mmbf during the same period. As a result, the <b>share</b> <b>of</b> other countries in US softwood lumber imports has increased from 2. 3 % to 4. 8 %. In spite of a report by industry analysts that Canadian forest products companies in the four provinces have shifted their softwood lumber exports to higher-grade products, no upward trend of Canadian products price relative to domestic products in the US was observed. <b>Imports</b> <b>of</b> value-added lumber such as siding and flooring, which are covered by the SLA, seemed to increase only marginally. To avoid the voluntary export restrictions specified in the SLA, some Canadian producers appear to have responded to the SLA by increasing their exports of softwood logs and value-added wood products to the US. US <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> softwood logs from Canada have increased substantially since the implementation of the SLA, increasing from 148, 000 m 3 in 1995 to almost 1. 1 million m 3 in 1999. In addition, <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> value-added wood products, such as windows, doors, and roof trusses, have also increased dramatically, although this increase can be partly attributed to the strong US housing market. In addition, some Canadian producers have attempted to have their lumber products reclassified as remanufactured lumber products by making slight product modifications, since remanufactured lumber products are exempt from the export permit requirement under the SLA. The main product modifications have been to predrill, notch, or rougher-head the studs. As a result, exports of products under HS code 4418. 90 (builders’ joinery and carpentry of wood), which include these modified studs, increased substantially. However, these products are generally used as ordinary studs after trimming or planing the modified parts. The US Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports (CFLI) has appealed the classification of these products to the US Customs Office as an illegal attempt to circumvent the SLA. While the appeals by the CFLI were successful in having rougher-headed studs reclassified as softwood lumber, the other appeals are still being considered at this time. Finally, by increasing the price and price volatility of softwood lumber in the US, the SLA may have contributed to the ongoing process of substitution of softwood lumber by wood and non-wood alternative materials. However, the extent to which the SLA has contributed to the process of material substitution is difficult to evaluate. FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR THE US-CANADA SOFTWOOD LUMBER TRADE There are four possible options that might be implemented at the expiration of the SLA on March 31 st, 2001. These options include: 1) an extension of the current agreement, 2) the imposition of a countervailing duty by the US, 3) “fair trade” with major changes in the stumpage pricing system employed in Canada, or 4) “free trade” and the elimination of the SLA. Recent events in both Canada (with regards to the recent lowering of stumpage prices in BC) and the US (with regards to the position of the CFLI) suggest that the implementation of options 3) and 4) are unlikely. Given the current political situation in both countries, with presidential elections occurring in early November 2000 in the US and national elections occurring in late November in Canada, it is possible that the two governments might decide to extend the SLA for a short period of time. However, the CFLI insists that it will seek some type of countervailing action if Canada fails to address the stumpage price issue appropriately following the expiration of the SLA. Given the inequities that some Canadian lumber manufacturers perceive with the existing SLA, it is likely that at least some producers in Canada would prefer to see the SLA expire and be replaced with a countervailing duty, since this would impose no limit on the volume of softwood lumber that they could export to the US. Considering the restrained domestic timber supply and the uncertain future availability of Canadian softwood lumber, it is important for the US to build a cooperative relationship with Canada in order to provide secure softwood lumber supply...|$|R
