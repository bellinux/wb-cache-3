40|$|Nine {{chemically}} defined inoculation diluents, with compositions ranging from 0. 85 % NaCl to 35 % <b>marine</b> <b>salts,</b> {{were used to}} evaluate the influence of diluent composition on the biochemical profiles of 30 marine and estuarine bacterial strains, including species of Vibrio, Aeromonas, Allomonas, and Photobacterium. Results demonstrated that a 20 % <b>marine</b> <b>salts</b> diluent enabled the characterization of halophilic strains normally nonreactive by the API 20 E system. Furthermore, the use of 20 % <b>marine</b> <b>salts</b> showed that certain environmental isolates, identifiable as Vibrio parahaemolyticus by the recommended clinical inoculation procedure, were Vibrio vulnificus. An analysis of the profiles provided by the nine diluents indicates that the API 20 E system, modified by the use of a diluent composed of 20 % <b>marine</b> <b>salts</b> and incubated at 22 degrees C, can provide a reliable tool for the rapid characterization of marine and estuarine bacterial isolates...|$|R

60|$|Captain John Sears, of Suet, was {{the first}} per-son {{in this country who}} {{obtained}} pure <b>marine</b> <b>salt</b> by solar evaporation alone; though it had long been made in a similar way on the coast of France, and elsewhere. This was in the year 1776, at which time, on account of the war, salt was scarce and dear. The Historical Collections contain an interesting account of his experiments, which we read when we first saw the roofs of the salt-works. Barnstable county is the most favorable locality for these works on our northern coast,--there is so little fresh water here emptying into ocean. Quite recently there were about two millions of dollars invested in this business here. But now the Cape is unable to compete with the importers of salt and the manufacturers of it at the West, and, accordingly, her salt-works are fast going to decay. From making salt, they turn to fishing more than ever. The Gazetteer will uniformly tell you, under the head of each town, how many go a-fishing, and the value of the fish and oil taken, how much salt is made and used, how many are engaged in the coasting trade, how many in manufacturing palm-leaf hats, leather, boots, shoes, and tinware, and then it has done, and leaves you to imagine the more truly domestic manufactures which are nearly the same all the world over.|$|E
60|$|The {{waters of}} the Dead Sea are thus in the {{condition}} of having already deposited almost all their gypsum, {{as well as the}} greater part of the salt they originally contained. They are, in fact, much like sea water which has been boiled down till it has reached the state of a thick salty liquid; and though most of the salt is now already deposited in a deep layer on the bottom, enough still remains in solution to make the Dead Sea infinitely salter than the general ocean. At the same time, there are a good many other things in solution in sea water besides gypsum and common salt; such as chloride of magnesia sulphate of potassium, and other interesting substances with pretty chemical names, well calculated to endear them at first sight to the sentimental affections of the general public. These other by-contents of the water are often still longer in getting deposited than common salt; and, owing to their intermixture in a very concentrated form with the mother liquid of the Dead Sea, the water of that evaporating lake is not only salt but also slimy and fetid to the last degree, its taste being accurately described as half brine, half rancid oil. Indeed, the salt has been so far precipitated already that there is now five times as much chloride of magnesium left in the water as there is common salt. By the way, it is a lucky thing for us that these various soluble minerals are of such constitution as to be thrown down separately at different stages of concentration in the evaporating liquid; for, if it were otherwise, they would all get deposited together, and we should find on all old salt lake beds only a mixed layer of gypsum, salt, and other chlorides and sulphates, absolutely useless for any practical human purpose. In that case, we should be entirely dependent upon <b>marine</b> <b>salt</b> pans and artificial processes for our entire salt supply. As it is, we find the materials deposited one above another in regular layers; first, the gypsum at the bottom; then the rock-salt; and last of all, on top, the more soluble mineral constituents.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} kept in brackish water aquaria. It is a shoaling fish that needs to be in groups of three and can grow up to 12 inches, but more commonly 8 inches in aquaria. The biggest requirement for this fish is that as a juvenile it resides in mild brackish water, but travels downstream to ocean, which means as it grows, it needs to be acclimated to increasing specific gravity or salinity. To mimic this in the home aquarium, it should be started at 3-4 tablespoons of <b>marine</b> <b>salt</b> per gallon of water for juveniles. An extra tablespoon would then be added monthly during water changes, the salt should always be dissolved completely in a separate container. It should be continued until about a cup of <b>marine</b> <b>salt</b> per gallon is being added, which is the normal marine salinity. To be more accurate, a swing handle or a floating hydrometer should be used to accurately measure the specific gravity, that needs to be raised by 0.002 every month, starting from 1.008 for juveniles to 1.023-1.024 for adults. It may be kept with other marine fish in an FOWLR marine aquarium, provided it is large enough.|$|E

5000|$|The Yarra River {{has been}} derogatively called [...] "the river that runs upside down", a jibe at its high turbidity.

The particles are kept suspended by the turbulence in some parts of the middle and lower sections of the river. When the river water combines with <b>marine</b> <b>salts</b> as it enters Port Phillip, the suspended particles clump together and sink.

Factor (i) results in a predominance of Na-Cl waters near the coast, and may also be partially responsible (via proton displacement from soil ion-exchange sites by marine cations) for lower pH values in near-coastal waters. Further inland, the importance of <b>marine</b> <b>salts</b> decreases and waters become dominantly Ca-(Na) -HCO 3.
