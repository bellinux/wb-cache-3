50|$|It {{could soon}} be seen that <b>macro</b> <b>{{indicators}}</b> alone are unable to cover many social topics, because the main scource of these indicators was official statistics which does not carry out opinion and attitude surveys. In analogy to the American situation it was attempted to develop a social survey covering subjective and objective topics at the same time, and thus can be mutually related: this instrument was the „Welfare Survey“ („Wohlfahrtssurvey“). The central publication - based on exploitations of this survey - was „Quality of Life in the Federal Republic of Germany: Objective Living Conditions and Subjective Well-being“ („Lebensqualität in der Bundesrepublik: Objektive Lebensbedingungen und subjektives Wohlbefinden“) (1984). Many other publications using this data source followed, up to the current „Data Report“ („Datenreport“). The central theoretical concept of this work was quality of life-research according to the US-American model. The development of panel studies during the 1980s, like the German Socio-Economic Panel, offered the possibility to integrate questions asked in the welfare surveys into this panel study, thus being able to show the evolution of quality of life over the life course.|$|E

Probably related to that developed his interest in long-term trends of social change at the macro level which he thematized in his habilitation thesis. Obviously he came in touch with modernization research which was just en vogue in the USA in the 1960s. This was the origin of his first works on modernization theory and the edited volume „Theories of Social Change“ (Theorien des sozialen Wandels). On the one hand it was envisioned to empirically verify such theories by a historical-comparative data collection {{on the development of}} west European societies; for this purpose, together with Peter Flora, Zapf applied for the HIWED-project (Historical Indicators of West European Democracies). On the other hand stood the implementation of social indicators research in Germany; the origin of the latter research also lies in the USA of the 1960s. The SPES-project was believed to develop a system of social <b>macro</b> <b>indicators.</b> Main products of this work were the „Sociological Almanac“ („Soziologische Almanach“ and the edited volume „Living Conditions in the Federal Republic of Germany“ („Lebensbedingungen in der Bundesrepublik“) (1977, 21978); the latter book used the instrument of social indicators in order to apply it to the Federal Republic of Germany. The nucleus of the volume is a so-called „Social Indicator Table“ („Sozialindikatorentableau“) with several hundred indicators which were quantified in the work that followed. A historically much more extended perspective was to look at the evolution of German living conditions from the 19th century to the present: this was done in the book „Changing Living Conditions in Germany: Welfare Development since Industrialization“ („Wandel der Lebensbedingungen in Deutschland: Wohlfahrtsentwicklung seit der Industrialisierung“) (1982).|$|E

30|$|In model 2, {{the income}} gap between {{destination}} and original provinces is {{included as a}} <b>macro</b> <b>indicator</b> in the model. Consistent with Dustmann (2003), this indicator is negative and statistically significant. Since migrants {{are considered to be}} a low-income group in the cities (UNFPA 2010), the increase in their income also leads to increasing living cost. Therefore, {{they are more likely to}} shorten their lengths of migration to reduce cost. The negative sign and significance of this variable can also explain that the narrowing income gap between destination and original provinces increases the length of migration. The narrowing of the income gap resulted from the higher income growth in original provinces in comparison to the growth of income in destination places.|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{inflation}} forecasting literature examines {{the ability of}} macroeconomic indicators to accurately predict mean inflation. For the period after 1984, existing empirical evidence largely suggests that the likelihood of accurately predicting inflation using macroeconomic indicators is no better than a random walk model. We expand the scope of inflation predictability by exploring whether macroeconomic indicators are useful in predicting the distribution of inflation. We consider six commonly used <b>macro</b> <b>indicators</b> and core/non-core versions of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) deflator as measures of inflation. Based on monthly data and for the forecast period after 1984, we find {{that some of the}} <b>macro</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as unemployment rate and housing starts, provide significant out-of-sample predictability for the distribution of future core inflation. The analysis of the quantiles of the predictive distribution reveals interesting patterns which otherwise would be ignored by existing inflation forecasting approaches that rely only on forecasting the mean. We also illustrate the importance of inflation distribution forecasting in evaluating some events of policy interest by focusing on predicting the likelihood of deflation...|$|E

40|$|Financial and {{monetary}} stability represent elements of maximum importance at international and national levels, through risks borne by neglecting this subject, both for practitioners and for academic environment and researchers. Lack of financial {{and monetary}} stability {{can lead to}} the manifestation of tensions, vulnerabilities and risks which might seriously affect the process of financial intermediation and even growth. The problem of tensions can be formulated by the reverse analysis of monetary and financial stability, covering multiple aspects of institutional nature, of payment systems, but also of the sphere of financial markets functioning. For this reason, an exogenous-endogenous analysis, allowing the identification of internal and external tensions, vulnerabilities and risks of money market, plays a crucial role in ensuring financial and monetary stability, monetary indicators being able to contain, in their developments, stabilizing or destabilizing elements for monetary and financial markets and for economy.

Such evaluation can employ aggregate indicators of impact (a macro approach) and/or more disaggregated information (a micro approach). Each has its place. Changes in population and population structure provide a key <b>macro</b> <b>indicator</b> {{of the success}} of {{rural development}} policy, since individuals reveal the attractiveness of rural areas by ?voting with their feet?. By using additional data on the factors that attract people to rural areas, the targeting of rural development policy can be improved. Policymakers frequently need to examine specific policy initiatives in detail to determine their impact, if any, and how and why they achieve their effects. The example of farm diversification policy in the EU illustrates that information obtained from case studies can help not only to elaborate the impact of policy but also illuminate how that impact is generated. Without complementary in-depth inquiry, scope for making sense of quantitative indicators, which have been the primary focus of evaluation in the EU, is limited; but without a broad base of measurement, the usefulness of insights derived from case study analysis is also restricted.
