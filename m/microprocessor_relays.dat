Inter-ties were connected through the transmission lines to lighten every city and village, thus making the whole system complex. This complex system required a robust protection, so that a fault in one place does not cause the unfaulted region to trip or series of trip undesirably, which may otherwise cause a situation of blackout.

40|$|Protective relays are {{important}} parts of the power system. The protection guards valuable equipment, and protective relays {{play a vital role}} in performing the task. The relay detects fault conditions within an assigned area, opens and closes output contacts to cause the operation of other devices under its control. The relay acts to operate the appropriate circuit breakers to prevent damage to personnel and property. To ensure consistent reliability and proper operation, protective relay equipment must be evaluated and tested. The importance of the relay evaluation issue is linked to capability to test the relays and relaying systems using very accurate waveform representation of a fault event. The purpose of testing protective relays is to ensure correct operation of the relay for all possible power system conditions and disturbances. To fulfill this purpose, relay testing in varying network configurations and with different fault types is required.

40|$|The second {{harmonic}} inrush restraint function of transformer differential relays maintains {{security of the}} differential protection during transformer inrush events. The typical setpoint for the {{second harmonic}} restraint is the relay manufacturer’s default or recommended setting of 20 % of fundamental current, with some adjustment based on operating experience. However, some operating situations may result in levels of second harmonic current lower than 20 % during inrush, and levels may be as low as 5 %. This lower level of second harmonic current requires a lower inrush restraint setting that may impact the tripping time of the differential element for fault conditions. In addition, inrush restraint is typically performed on a per-phase basis, so a loss of security is possible if inrush restraint performs incorrectly on only one phase of the protected transformer. This paper provides several examples of actual events where loss of security occurred due to incorrect settings of the second harmonic restraint function, or due to mis-application of cross-phase blocking. Based on the information from these events, the paper directly discusses considerations and recommendations for setting the second harmonic restraint to maintain security during transformer inrush including a discussion of traditional and adaptive inrush restraint techniques. The paper also includes recommendations on when to apply cross-phase blocking techniques such as 1 -out-of- 3 blocking, 2 -out-of- 3 blocking and average restraint blocking methods.

Therefore, power systems designers are seeking to apply digital devices to handle the increasing complexity of power system, which improve the cost and usability. Subsequently, the digital technology has appeared in the protection system of <b>microprocessor</b> <b>relays</b> since 1980 and developing to those with communications interfaces in the a 990 s [20]. Today, digital relays have featured with high speed communication, which helped in replacing wires for safety interlocking, control and also circuit breakers tripping action. Furthermore, there are many applications of digital relays in transmission and generation system protection due to their flexibility, high performance level, and capability of operating under different temperatures compared to the classical electromechanical relays. Therefore, this study focuses on the digital protection device, (e.g. OUFR) to be coordinated with LFC for MG dynamic security. There are several studies have dealt this problem from the short circuit fault side only such as, the optimized time-based coordination of conventional over-current relays; which is the earliest protection technique for utility grids including micro-grids [21]. This method has a limit in its ability of multi-relay protection because of its high sensitivity to components parameters in high fault levels. Sheng et al. [22] presented a multi-agent method depend on assumptions of high fault current levels. However, this method has been developed to island the MG for any fault in the utility grid and also disconnecting most of distributed generations (DGs) for faults within the MG. Furthermore, some studies handled the frequency protection problems such as; Laghariet et al. [23] applied an intelligent computational technique for load shedding of the power system under faulted conditions. Moreover, Komsan and Naowarat [24] discussed the same issue by using the rate of change under frequency relay to improve the load shedding scheme in MGs. Further, Freitas et al. [25] presented a comparative study of the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and vector surge relays for distributed generation applications. However, they faced a very hard task in relays coordination as their design may not detect the islanded conditions within the required time. Teimourzadeh et al. [26] introduced a new Region of Attraction (ROA) based protection zone for the detection of MG security status. However, the proposed approach is an efficient index for providing a quick detection of MG security status. Jose Vieira et al. in [27] proposed the coordination of ROCOF and under/over frequency relays. However, this presented coordination has a drawback, which it did not compensate the frequency fluctuations within the allowable frequency limit due to the action of the relay is energized when the system frequency become out of the allowable limit. Such a problem can be overcome by designing the proposed coordination strategy of LFC and digital OUFR for an islanded MG system dynamic security.|$|E
