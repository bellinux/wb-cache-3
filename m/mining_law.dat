The law created the legal framework supportive of the subsequent privatisation of large state-owned companies, notably in the energy and telecommunications sectors. In the 1990s, the concession system introduced by the <b>Mining</b> <b>Law</b> was extended into the infrastructure sector – highways, ports and airports – which had traditionally {{been part of the}} so-called public works carried out by the State.|$|E
25|$|Heap leach is {{significantly}} cheaper than traditional milling processes. The low costs allow for lower grade ore to be economically feasible (given {{that it is}} the right type of ore body). Environmental law requires that the surrounding ground water is continually monitored for possible contamination. The mine will also have to have continued monitoring even after the shutdown of the mine. In the past mining companies would sometimes go bankrupt, leaving the responsibility of mine reclamation to the public. Recent additions to the <b>mining</b> <b>law</b> require that companies set aside the money for reclamation before the beginning of the project. The money will be held by the public to insure adherence to environmental standards if the company were to ever go bankrupt.|$|E

Consequently, such ventures and contracts are immune from unilateral changes by any governmental authority in Peru without an appropriate legal or administrative remedy or arbitration by the Convenio Constitutivo del Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Differencias Relativas a Inversiones (Formal Consent of the International Center for Settlement of Relative Differences on Investments). Additionally, Peru enacted the Supreme Decree No. 047-2002-EF of April 2002 (import duties for capital goods) {{to reduce the}} duties paid to 7% from 20% and 12% on capital goods {{to be used in}} exploration and production of certain minerals, such as oil and gas in the Amazon region. The capital, goods, and services linked to minerals exploration benefited from the elimination of 18% sales tax when law No. 27623-EF was enacted in January 2002. Supreme Decree No. 015-2004-PGM of January 2004 (legal framework for decentralization) was established to use revenues from mineral production to maximize the well-being of the local communities through economic growth, environmental protection, and social development in a sustainable way. Supreme Decree No. 066-2005-EM of May 2006 (legal framework for creation of the Dirección de Gestión Social) was established to administer the Corporate Social Responsibility program in the mining sector.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Between 1993 and 2012, thirty-two {{countries}} around the world adopted community development in <b>mining</b> <b>laws.</b> This new public regulation approach to addressing mining’s impact goes beyond mitigating the negative effect of mining on local communities (such as through compensation arrangements and environmental laws), to requiring firms and/or states to ensure that mining translates into real, positive social and economic gains for mining-affected communities, thereby redressing the inequitable distribution of mining’s costs and benefits. In this dissertation, I examine variation in the adoption, design, and implementation of these laws. I argue that countries adopt community development requirements into their <b>mining</b> <b>laws</b> in order to signal to foreign investors about the property rights security of their mining projects. Community development in <b>mining</b> <b>laws</b> represent the harmonization of soft and hard law, and they enhance investment security by providing a distributive justice mechanism that addresses power and information asymmetries in company-community relations. States with low public goods provision are likely to “pass the buck” to firms in designing community development in <b>mining</b> <b>laws,</b> because firms are seen as an institutional substitute for the state. Finally, the implementation of community development in <b>mining</b> <b>laws</b> depends on good design. Benefit-sharing institutions that rely on unaccountable local institutions can enables corruption and elite capture among local elites, undermining developmental gains. I test my arguments using large-n statistical analysis as well as case studies of Sierra Leone and Ghana...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>mining</b> <b>law</b> to prevent water pollution quoted in the Wensley case, often ignored by the miners, attempts to prevent pollution of farmland included tree planting to deter cattle from grazing near mining operations - there are many examples of trees planted on the lines of veins in the old mining areas {{as well as the}} recent afforestation at Darley Bridge. Smelting mills were provided with chimneys to dissipate the fumes from the ore hearths. These were only partly successful as the mills were often sited in or near to settlements, which suffered from lead deposits from the chimneys. The mills also polluted the streams which powered their bellows. [...] Cupolas, described below, conveyed their emissions via tunnels to chimneys, which were often a considerable distance from the smelter. The limited success achieved by these efforts is exemplified by the naming of Belland Lane.|$|E

He had had to sink a well to stay in business. <b>Mining</b> <b>law</b> was cited by both sides. The miners quoted the custom which allowed them to wash their ore, while plaintiffs replied with the law which stipulated that sludge from washing should be emptied into [...] "some convenient place within their quarter cord (which is a space of seven yards and a quarter, or the fourth part of a meer, on each side of their vein)" [...] to prevent pollution of the adjacent land. The miners, who had carted their ore to the river, as being easier than carting water to their mine - their mine was dry and there is a steep hill from Wensley to the Derwent - lost their case.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century {{witnessed}} heavy public investments in dams in the Andes and associated irrigation infrastructure in the coastal region. For example, in the 1950s and 1960s, the San Lorenzo dam and Tinajones dam, the largest Peruvian dams, were built in the northern coastal region. Within the government the Ministry of Agriculture was given the responsibility to manage water resources, since irrigation was by far the largest water use. Its lead role was confirmed by the 1969 General Water Law No. 17752 (Ley General de Aguas—LGA) which defined the Ministry of Agriculture as the [...] "National Water Authority". However, other laws—such as the General Hydrocarbon Law (DL 26221), the General <b>Mining</b> <b>Law</b> (DS 014-92-EM), the Law for Electricity Concessions (DL 25844)—also dealt with water resources on a sectorally fragmented basis within a centralized administrative system that gave little or no decision-making power to stakeholders at the local level. There was no legal basis for integrated water resources management at the level of each river basin, and consequently there were no institutions to implement such an integrated management. This began to change in the early 2000s with the approval of a Decentralization Law, a Regional Government Law and a Municipalities Law. In 2003 the government began transferring powers to the newly created regional governments, including for water quality management and the operation and maintenance of major public infrastructure, despite the limited institutional capacity of regional governments. A draft national water resources management strategy prepared in 2004 (Estrategia Nacional para la Gestion de los Recursos Hidricos Continentales del Peru) aimed at promoting integrated water resources management through a new institutional and legal framework. In this spirit a National Water Authority (Autoridad Nacional del Agua – ANA) was established in 2006 and its role was strengthened through the 2009 Water Resources Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos – LRH). Implementation of the law and the creation of basin-level institutions with meaningful capacities and enforcement powers still remain a challenge.
