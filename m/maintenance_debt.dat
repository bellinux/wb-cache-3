40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the realities of {{implementing}} spanking new ideas in existing software systems. Information is provided both on the advantages and drawbacks of starting from scratch and basing yourself on an existing software asset to implement your IT future. The paper touches upon the need for tool support to refactor existing software systems so that implementing their IT future is enabled. An idea of how such refactory tools look like is given and pointers to technical research contributions are provided. Those tools aid in overcoming the <b>maintenance</b> <b>debt</b> built up over the years. It is argued that implementing the future in IT amounts {{to dealing with the}} past to a large extent.

40|$|Shifting {{population}} patterns, {{the rate}} of urbanization and the demands for higher levels of municipal services combined with many financial constraints facing Canadian municipalities, demand {{an increase in the}} sophistication of financial planning. Recurrent costs which are those costs recurring annually in the form of operating, <b>maintenance,</b> <b>debt</b> servicing and others costs required for the support of capital facilities require increased analysis if municipalities are to avoid the problems of over-expansion, under-financing and loss of productivity. By analyzing recurrent costs, municipalities will be able to assess the fiscal impact of capital expenditures and as such, meet the financial challenges of the future. All urban municipalities in Canada over the population of 75, 000 were surveyed to determine the following: 1) the number of municipalities which analyze recurrent costs 2) the type of recurrent costs analyzed 3) the estimated dollar impact of recurrent costs 4) the type of decision-making groups presented with recurrent cost information; and 5) the difference between those municipalities which analyze recurrent costs and those which do not. The results of the study indicated that the majority of urban municipalities analyze recurrent costs but many of the municipalities ignor very important recurrent costs in their analysis. The average recurrent cost of municipalities was estimated at 10 cents for every dollar of capital expenditure. Although this recurrent cost coefficient is reasonable when compared to other findings, caution should be exercixed with its use. Another study result indicates that although decision-making groups such as council and committees of council are presented with recurrent cost information, many important decision making groups are totally ignored. The final result indicates that small municipalities particularly Ontario counties with small capital budgets do not analyze recurrent costs. Also, regional location, population size, age or type of recurrent cost information analyzed do not affect the recurrent cost coefficient of a municipality...|$|E

40|$|Incessant power {{failures}} {{have caused}} irregular production and low utilization of resources in industries and educational institutions while the Nigerian government {{has also been}} embarrassed on several occasions when Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) switched off power during government official functions. The PHCN has thus become an object of ridicule and opprobrium for over two decades. The paper therefore sets out to examine and analyse relationships among characteristics of organisational environment and motivation for effective performance of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria Limited, a public enterprise established, financed and managed by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The paper utilized both primary and secondary sources of data and data collected were descriptively analysed {{with a view to}} seeking answers to the broad question of what factors within the perceived organisational environment of the PHCN are related in a positive or negative manner to its effective performance. The findings revealed that PHCN has to contend with internal and external environmental hostilities and constraints such as poor funding of the enterprise, corruption, excessive control by the Federal Government, vandalisation of its equipment by hoodlums, fraud, shady dealings, poor <b>maintenance,</b> erosion, <b>debts</b> owed it and irregular rainfall.

Because so many of the pawned victims were young women and girls, the change in policy toward pawnship, also resulted in a series of measures to ban child marriages.|$|R

50|$|In 2004 AWCO was {{the only}} water utility in Egypt {{generating}} revenue sufficient to cover all operation and <b>maintenance</b> costs and <b>debt</b> service. The ratio of revenues to operating costs was 150% in that year. This was achieved although residential water tariffs in Egypt are among {{the lowest in the}} Middle East and North Africa: In 2012, for the first 10 m3 per month the residential water tariff was only Egyptian Pound 0.23/m3 (US$0.04) and for the second block until 30m3 it was Egyptian Pound 0.31/m3 (US$0.05), and for the third block until 45m3 it was EP 0.41/m3 (US$0.06). Unmeterd residential tariffs vary between 3.50 and 6.80 Pound per month depending on the number of rooms of the apartment or house. Non-residential metered tariffs vary between 0.60 and 2.30 Pound per cubic meter. They thus are up to ten times higher than the lowest block of the residential tariff. The highest tariff categories apply to private schools and universities and to large industries. Average water consumption is around 300 liter/capita/day (45m3 per month for a family of five). It is thus higher than in {{other countries in the region}} or in Europe, which has a favorable impact on revenues. Sanitation tariffs are a surcharge of 35% to the water bill. Revenues for sanitation are passed on to the Alexandria Drainage Company after deduction of a service fee. ASDCO does not recover its operating costs.|$|R
40|$|Using the {{extensive}} microdata of the Credit Risk Database (CRD), established in 2001 by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), {{in this paper}} we analyze the determinants for the life duration until legal bankruptcy of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that have continually been saddled with excess liabilities and suffered recurring losses. We focus in particular on the debt structure of SMEs, clarifying the impact of the ratios and trends of trade credit and bank financing on the timing of legal bankruptcy. The results of this paper's analysis are set out below. First, the ratio of trade payables to total liabilities increases the probability of financially distressed SMEs' falling into legal bankruptcy. There is also a tendency for the ratio of trade credit to decline substantially several years prior to legal bankruptcy. In addition, the larger the degree of decline in trade credit, the shorter is the survival duration of a firm from the time of suffering financial distress to the time of legal bankruptcy. However, the ratio or trend of bank financing does not affect the survival duration. These findings conform to the following characteristics of trade credit. First, trade credit in the form of unsecured claims gives rise to a greater loss if the debtor firm goes bankrupt, and therefore suppliers granting such credit have the incentive to acquire advance corporate credit information more rapidly than banks that are secured creditors. Second, since suppliers have networks with other enterprises, it is possible to obtain credit information on debtor SMEs at a lower cost and more quickly than banks. Third, generally a firm does business with a large number of other suppliers and it is difficult for suppliers to conduct private negotiations among them on such matters as balance <b>maintenance</b> and <b>debt</b> forgiveness. In addition to debt structure, the better a company's corporate fundamentals, for example total asset turnover and ordinary income ratio, the longer will be the duration of its life. Profitability has a stronger effect on medium-sized enterprises than on smaller firms. In addition, SMEs with high fixed-asset ratios and substantial liquidity in hand have a high survival probability and their survival duration is long. On the other hand, SMEs that are relatively large in scale, those with high ratios of interest-bearing liabilities and those with a high proportion of trade credit accounted for by bills payable have low survival probability and a short survival duration. Finally, the paper confirms that financially distressed SMEs that have been relieved by the government support measures for reviving SMEs, such as credit guarantees and the special credit guarantee program for small businesses, have a high probability of survival in the short term, and have long life duration. ...|$|R

The rate {{of water}} {{services}} should ensure financial sustainability of the aqueduct, considering the possibilities of paying users without limiting access to water. In Costa Rica, although ARESEP defined a calculation methodology, this {{does not apply to}} all providers. In addition, the form of payment does not guarantee equal treatment between users of the same category as the amount per cubic meter is not the same for everyone recently, is trying to incorporate an efficiency factor, however, it depends on the development of goals for reduction of UFW. Clearly, not all providers have the financial or technical capacity to quantify this type of requirements. In the case of municipalities, these are not regulated remaining at liberty to estimate the rate. Therefore, this study looked at the design of a methodology of tariff calculation for the Aqueduct of the Municipality of Paradise existing tariff structures were analyzed and a methodology, which was validated through expert consultation was proposed. In addition, a survey of willingness to pay regarding the environmental cost was applied. He defined a base fee includes administrative costs and a fee according to consumption including operating costs, and <b>maintenance,</b> investment and <b>debt</b> service as well as an environmental cost. Within the cost of operating and maintaining an efficiency factor regarding infrastructure leakage index (ILI) it was included. a subsidy for low-income users are also incorporated. It was found that administrative costs represent 28. 3 %, the operating and maintenance 57. 1 %, the investment and debt service 12. 2 % and 2. 4 % environmental cost. The amount of the fee represents an increase of 24. 0 % compared to the present, this mainly because the current rate is three years upgrade, coupled with existing objects of expenditure that have not been coveredInstituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica...|$|R
