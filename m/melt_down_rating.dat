5000|$|The {{effective}} {{rate of fire}} of the MG34 is listed at 150 rounds per minute while the MG42 achieves a slightly higher 154 rounds per minute. [...] Note that the current MG42, now named MG3 also shows multiple rates of fire with the high rate being 1,100-1,200 rpm and the low rate being 700-800 rpm on World Guns. No machinegun can fire sustained for very long before <b>melting</b> <b>down.</b> The effective <b>rates</b> of fire of the MG34/42 were higher than allied weapons, but the RPM is not a huge factor in this, the ability to change barrels is. Standard bolt weight is 900 g. while the light bolt is 650 g.|$|R
40|$|The eight-year {{record of}} mass balance of Peyto Glacier is {{correlated}} to meteorological data measured near the glacier and at Lake Louise 30 km to the south. The period investigated includes {{the highest and}} lowest accumulations for the past 40 years. The primary controls of net annual balance are seen to be {{the depth of the}} winter snow pack and the temperature record during the summer. Extensive summer snowfalls in the ablation area can slow <b>down</b> <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> very considerably and affect the net annual balance positively. The variable nature of winter accumulation and its influence on snowline retreat and ice melt is illustrated by three years' data...|$|R
