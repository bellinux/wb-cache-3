5|$|Aymer Vallance was {{commissioned}} {{to produce the}} first biography of <b>Morris,</b> published in 1897, after Morris' death, as per the latter's wishes. This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William <b>Morris</b> (1899) in which he provided a sympathetic portrayal of <b>Morris</b> that largely omitted his political activities, treating them as a passing phase that <b>Morris</b> overcame.|$|E
5|$|Born in Litchfield County, Connecticut, James <b>Morris</b> {{spent his}} early life hoping and {{training}} to be a minister. However, after graduating from Yale College, <b>Morris</b> accepted a commission of First Lieutenant from the Continental Army and joined the fight for American Independence. <b>Morris</b> was captured during the Battle of Germantown {{and spent most of}} the remaining war in captivity. Upon his release, <b>Morris</b> was promoted to the rank of Captain and supported Alexander Hamilton in the Siege of Yorktown. When he returned from the war, <b>Morris</b> began and ran an academy that trained both boys and girls together, a rarity at the time.|$|E
5|$|Born in Walthamstow, Essex, to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family, <b>Morris</b> {{came under the}} strong {{influence}} of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university, he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and <b>Morris</b> designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, <b>Morris</b> founded a decorative arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others: the <b>Morris,</b> Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Becoming highly fashionable and much in demand, the firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with <b>Morris</b> designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, <b>Morris</b> assumed total control of the company, which was renamed <b>Morris</b> & Co.|$|E
5|$|James <b>Morris</b> died in 1820. In 1859, Morris's {{hometown}} of South Farms, Connecticut was renamed <b>Morris</b> in his honor.|$|E
5|$|James <b>Morris</b> {{was born}} to Deacon James <b>Morris</b> Jr. and Phebe Barns <b>Morris</b> in South Farms, Connecticut on January 19, 1752.|$|E
5|$|The James <b>Morris</b> Museum {{is located}} {{in the center of the}} town of <b>Morris</b> and {{contains}} original artifacts and writings of James <b>Morris.</b>|$|E
5|$|The city {{is home to}} {{thirteen}} <b>morris</b> dance teams - {{thought to}} be one of the highest concentration of sides in the country. Nearly all forms of the dance are represented in the city, including Cotswold (Five Rivers <b>Morris,</b> Pecsaetan <b>Morris,</b> Harthill <b>Morris,</b> Lord Conyer's <b>Morris</b> Men, Sheffield City <b>Morris,</b> William <b>Morris),</b> border (Boggart's Breakfast), North West (Yorkshire Chandelier, Silkstone Greens, Lizzie Dripping), rapper (Sheffield Steel Rapper) and Yorkshire Longsword.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of The <b>Morris</b> Academy remains intact {{on the grounds}} of James <b>Morris</b> Elementary School, in <b>Morris.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pisco sour {{originated}} in Lima, Peru. It {{was created by}} bartender Victor Vaughen <b>Morris,</b> an American who had moved to Peru in 1904 {{to work in a}} railway company in Cerro de Pasco. <b>Morris</b> relocated to Lima in 1915 and, a year later, opened a saloon—Morris' Bar—which became popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. Chilean historian Gonzalo Vial Correa also attributes the pisco sour's invention to Gringo <b>Morris</b> from the Peruvian <b>Morris</b> Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William <b>Morris.</b> <b>Morris</b> often experimented with new drinks, and developed the pisco sour as a variety of the whiskey Sour.|$|E
5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, <b>Morris</b> {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests—Barnes was injured {{for the other}} two Tests. As one of three on-tour selectors, <b>Morris</b> {{was a member of}} the leadership group along with Bradman and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett.|$|E
5|$|Actress Lana <b>Morris</b> (1930–1998) {{was born}} in Ruislip.|$|E
5|$|After Denard Robinson {{left for}} the NFL, sophomore Russell Bellomy, the only {{scholarship}} quarterback on the roster other than Devin Gardner, endured a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury. The injury left the team without a healthy backup who had ever taken an official snap. True freshman <b>Morris</b> competed with redshirt freshman walk-on Brian Cleary for the backup role. On August 22, 2013 as a true freshman, <b>Morris</b> was named backup quarterback to redshirt junior Gardner. He made his debut for the 2013 team in the season opener against Central Michigan. Passing for 59 yards on 4-for-6 passing, {{he was one of}} 11 true freshmen to play in the game for Michigan. <b>Morris</b> also played in the Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry on November 2 against the 2013 Michigan State Spartans, completing only one pass (on three attempts) for six yards. Gardner suffered a turf toe injury prior to the 2013 team's 2013 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl against Kansas State. With Gardner held out of practices, <b>Morris</b> got extensive work. <b>Morris</b> started in place of Gardner in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, compiling 196 yards on 2438 passing.|$|E
5|$|After being rested for the eight-wicket {{win over}} Hampshire, <b>Morris</b> {{rectified}} his technical problem, and success followed against Sussex. After the hosts had been rolled for 86 {{in their first}} innings, <b>Morris</b> dominated an opening partnership of 153 with Brown, who made only 44 before becoming {{the first man to}} fall. <b>Morris</b> added a further 189 for the second wicket with Bradman before he fell for 184 at 2/342. He had struck 26 fours, laying the platform for Australia's total of 5/549 declared and eventual innings victory. He was to hit five more first-class centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|After the 4–0 series {{win over}} England, which was Bradman's {{farewell}} series, <b>Morris</b> became Australia's vice-captain and {{was expected to}} be its leading batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first series in the post-Bradman era, a tour to South Africa that saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By the end of the South African tour, <b>Morris</b> had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. <b>Morris</b> was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. Later in his life, <b>Morris</b> served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|After the break, <b>Morris</b> added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after <b>Morris</b> dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and <b>Morris</b> had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with <b>Morris</b> on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|As a redshirt {{freshman}} for the 2015 Wolverines, Speight began {{the season as}} a backup to Jake Rudock and Shane <b>Morris.</b> Speight made his Michigan debut on September 12, 2015, taking kneel-down snaps in the closing minutes of a victory over Oregon State. Asked why he played Speight instead of <b>Morris</b> {{at the end of}} the Oregon State game, head coach Jim Harbaugh explained that he did not want to burn Morris's redshirt year on a meaningless snap, emphasizing that <b>Morris</b> remained his No. 2 quarterback.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of <b>Morris.</b> This was despite <b>Morris</b> leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, <b>Morris</b> remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the next season, <b>Morris</b> was not made Australian captain despite being the {{incumbent}} vice-captain. Instead, he remained as deputy as Victoria's Ian Johnson was recalled to the team and assumed the captaincy. There was speculation that the two Queensland board members voted for <b>Morris,</b> the three New South Wales delegates voted for Miller, while the remainder voted Johnson. When England returned to Australia in 1954–55, <b>Morris</b> made his first Test century in almost four years during the opening Test at Brisbane. After English skipper Len Hutton won the toss and controversially sent Australia in, <b>Morris</b> made 153 to lay the foundation for a score of 8/601 declared and an innings victory. This included a partnership of 202 runs with Neil Harvey. The pair scored at a rate of nearly four runs per over, despite both players being repeatedly struck by the bowling of Frank Tyson, who was regarded as the fastest bowler of his era. Those were the only centuries made by Australian batsmen for the entire series, and <b>Morris</b> was covered in bruises; he deliberately used his body to fend off short-pitched balls rather than risk a catch.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{eventually}} bowled England out for 441, {{leaving them}} {{a target of}} 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but <b>Morris</b> again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled <b>Morris</b> for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out <b>Morris</b> with an inswinger. <b>Morris</b> had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised <b>Morris,</b> feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with <b>Morris</b> on 10. Barnes and <b>Morris</b> took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} <b>Morris</b> shuffled around the crease. At one stage, <b>Morris</b> scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, <b>Morris</b> unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. <b>Morris</b> fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, <b>Morris</b> dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers <b>Morris</b> and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted {{the players on}} the second day. Barnes and <b>Morris</b> took the score to 73 before Laker removed <b>Morris.</b> Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E
5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with <b>Morris</b> in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which <b>Morris</b> lofted into the crowd for six. <b>Morris</b> stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with <b>Morris</b> on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was first-choice as an opener with Arthur <b>Morris</b> {{throughout}} the Test series, {{although it was}} not until the Third Test that they had a first-wicket partnership of any substance. <b>Morris</b> had broken into the team as an opener after an injury sidelined Bill Brown for the entire season.|$|E
5|$|Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} <b>Morris</b> as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener, but made only one, and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. <b>Morris</b> and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell. Miller joined <b>Morris</b> and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E
5|$|Ben Palmer, the {{director}} of the first Inbetweeners film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film Man Up, so <b>Morris</b> and Beesley directed The Inbetweeners 2. Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and nervous about the direction of <b>Morris</b> and Beesley due to their lack of experience in the position.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, <b>Morris</b> found it {{necessary}} to formalize his instruction and construct a proper Academy building. The estimated cost was $1200, so <b>Morris</b> enlisted wealthy residents of Litchfield and South Farms.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2016 season, <b>Morris</b> {{announced}} that he would be transferring from Michigan for the 2017 football season. On January 21, 2017, he announced he would join the Central Michigan Chippewas. <b>Morris</b> entered the season with an unresolved status following a quarterback battle with redshirt freshman Tony Poljan; both were expected to play in the opener against Rhode Island. <b>Morris</b> ended up playing the majority of the opening triple overtime victory. In week 2, <b>Morris</b> posted 467 yards passing and 5 touchdowns in an upset victory against Kansas. The performance earned <b>Morris</b> recognition as the Mid-American Conference West Division Player of the Week and as one of eight NCAA finalists for the weekly Manning Award for quarterback performances.|$|E
5|$|Foster, <b>Morris.</b> Being Comanche.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip <b>Morris</b> was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip <b>Morris</b> employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip <b>Morris,</b> Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip <b>Morris,</b> and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's {{tenure at}} Davis Polk {{is best known}} for her work as a defense {{attorney}} for Philip <b>Morris</b> during major litigation, including both civil lawsuits and U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil racketeering probes. She became a senior associate while working on Philip <b>Morris</b> litigation. While this time in her career has proven controversial, Gillibrand indicates her work for Philip <b>Morris</b> allowed her to take on multiple pro bono cases defending abused women and their children, as well as other cases defending tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 117/2 and {{together}} with <b>Morris</b> saw Australia to the close at 153/2. <b>Morris</b> was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four. Hassett was on 10.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 2/117 and {{together}} with <b>Morris</b> saw Australia to the close at 2/153. <b>Morris</b> was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, <b>Morris</b> registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and <b>Morris</b> took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and <b>Morris</b> had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five, before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.|$|E
5|$|Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} <b>Morris</b> as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He {{was unable to}} make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, and Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. <b>Morris</b> and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett was beaten in flight by Young and was caught by Washbrook. Miller joined <b>Morris</b> and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while <b>Morris</b> was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, <b>Morris</b> scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from <b>Morris</b> with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Hamilton {{submitted}} the Report on the Establishment of a Mint to the House of Representatives. Many of Hamilton's ideas {{for this report}} were from European economists, resolutions from Continental Congress meetings from 1785 and 1786, and from people such as Robert <b>Morris,</b> Gouverneur <b>Morris</b> and Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|In 1871 <b>Morris</b> & Co. were {{responsible}} for the windows at All Saints, designed by Burne-Jones for Alfred Baldwin, his wife's brother-in-law. The firm was reorganized as <b>Morris</b> & Co. in 1875, and Burne-Jones continued to contribute designs for stained glass, and later tapestries until the end of his career.|$|E
