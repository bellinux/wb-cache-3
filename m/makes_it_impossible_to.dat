5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} absent from another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth, {{the assignment of}} some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia (MACN) in Buenos Aires, with one tooth in the Museo de La Plata (MLP) in La Plata, Argentina, has been thoroughly described; while there are additional Ferugliotherium fossils from the La Colonia Formation, {{they have not been}} described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of Ferugliotherium <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> determine its dental formula with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of the}} lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with Sudamerica, which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that Ferugliotherium may also have had four lower molars.|$|E

5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|No genetic {{studies to}} date have {{correlated}} these prehistoric remains to any modern breed. What has been studied are Y-chromosomes (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) obtained from Exmoor ponies. The Y-chromosome is passed on through the male line, and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses, except for a second Y-chromosome haplotype found in China, suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to the original genome of the domestic horse. The Exmoor pony shares this general Y-chromosome haplotype. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA is passed on though the female line, and shows far more variation than Y-DNA, indicating {{that a large number}} of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds. Some mtDNA-haplotypes have been found in DNA samples obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits, while other mtDNA-haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses, from both living individuals and archeological finds. The Exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre-domestication mtDNA-haplotypes, but these are also found in different breeds all around the world. Currently, for the British Isles, there are only three DNA archeological samples available, all from Ireland. Although wild horses were abundant after the last ice age, the lack of sufficient pre-domestication DNA samples <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> determine the contribution of the wild horses of the British Islands to modern breeds, including the Exmoor pony. A 1995 study of morphological characteristics, the outward appearance of organisms, indicated that the Exmoor, Pottock, and Tarpan have an extremely close resemblance; these breeds were consistently grouped together in the results from several analyses, with the Exmoor showing the closest relationship to the Tarpan of all the breeds studied, at 0.27; the next-closest breeds to the Tarpan were the Pottock and Merens, both with a genetic distance from the Tarpan of 0.47. The distance between the Exmoor and Pottock was 0.37, and between the Exmoor and Merens was 0.40; a significantly wider gap than the distance between the Exmoor and Tarpan.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, John Foster, a {{specialist}} on the Morrison Formation, suggested {{the possibility of}} niche partitioning between Ornitholestes and its contemporary Coelurus, which was within the same size range. He theorized that big-eyed Ornitholestes might have been specialized for nocturnal hunting, while Coelurus may have focused on those prey species that were active during the day. Foster noted, however, that this hypothesis was largely speculative; a lack of preserved skull material from Coelurus <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> verify whether its eyes were proportionally smaller than those of Ornitholestes.|$|E
25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them.

It also makes {{it very difficult to}} distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.

25|$|The Notitia {{does not}} record {{the number of}} personnel.
