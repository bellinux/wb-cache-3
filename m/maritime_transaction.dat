40|$|Historically, Anglo-American courts {{refused to}} enforce {{arbitration}} agreements, jealously guarding their dispute resolution monopoly. During {{the early twentieth}} century, merchants and attorneys began seeking legislation requiring courts to defer to arbitration. The United States Abitration Act took effect January 1, 1926 and has remained essentially unchanged. It was written with the implicit assumption {{that it would be}} invoked by commercial actors having relatively equal bargaining power and emotive appeal to a jury. The Act says nothing to direct the court 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry concerning the quality of either party 2 ̆ 7 s assent to the arbitration clause other than requiring a written arbitration agreement and referring to grounds for revocation available at common-law. Section 1 of the Act broadly defines key terms used subsequently in the Act. Section 2 provides that written agreements to arbitrate, whether part of an initial contract in commerce or in a <b>maritime</b> <b>transaction</b> or a separate agreement pertaining to such a contract, “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. ” The Act supplies the substantive rules for deciding whether to uphold an arbitration agreement, stay judicial proceedings, compel arbitration, confirm the award, vacate the award, or alter the award. Although there is some possibility of exception, the prevailing view is that even strong state statutory policies do not override the Act. Although the Act is considered substantive law, it imposes many procedural requirements upon the parties seeking to promote or attack arbitration. The Act also promotes arbitration by providing that litigation may be stayed by the court until completion of the arbitration. The court must first be “satisfied that the issue involved is referable to arbitration. ” Section 4 authorizes federal courts to compel arbitration if a party refuses to honor an arbitration agreement. The Act states that any contractually specified method of arbitration shall be followed and provides subpoena power to the arbitrator. Sections 9, 10, and 11 deal with the confirmation, vacation, or modification of arbitration awards. The court must grant an order confirming the award unless the court finds the case to meet one of several narrow grounds. The courts have generally accorded these exceptions confined scope due to the limited enumerated grounds, the language of the section, and the Act 2 ̆ 7 s goal of encouraging arbitration...|$|E

5000|$|Like O'Connor, he {{read the}} text of the FAA closely and found no implied {{authority}} over the states. [...] "The FAA treats arbitration simply as one means of resolving disputes that lie within the jurisdiction of the federal courts; it makes clear that the breach of a covered arbitration agreement does not itself provide any independent basis for such jurisdiction. Even the Southland majority was forced to acknowledge this point ..." [...] That majority, according Thomas, had offered only one real response: its argument that Congress would have extended it to all contracts if it meant for the FAA to be procedural. He offered the possibility that Congress may have instead believed [...] "there was no federal interest in doing so unless interstate commerce or <b>maritime</b> <b>transactions</b> were involved. This conclusion is far more plausible ..." ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{no secret}} that {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) has become {{an important part of}} the contemporary American legal system. Compared to full-fledged judicial proceedings, ADR methods, including arbitration, offer a more cost-effective alternative. Both private and public entities have embraced the chance to address legal disputes while using resources more effectively. In 1998, for example, President Clinton issued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies encouraging the use of ADR “[a]s part of an effort to make the Federal Government operate in a more efficient and effective manner. ” In spite of all of the benefits of ADR, concerns about the innate fairness of these methods of dispute resolution still abound. Nowhere are such concerns more evident than in the context of arbitration agreements between large, sophisticated entities and individual consumers. Despite concerns as to the implicit fairness of ADR, the enforcement of arbitration agreements in American courts has been markedly strengthened by one important piece of legislation: the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The FAA was proclaimed as “[a]n Act [t]o make valid and enforceable written provisions or agreements for arbitration of disputes arising out of contracts, <b>maritime</b> <b>transactions,</b> or commerce among the States or Territories or with foreign nations. ” This single piece of legislation has been the subject of a number of Supreme Court cases, including the important Southland Corp. v. Keating decision. In Southland, the Supreme Court held that the FAA applies in state courts and preempts conflicting state law. On December 14, 2015, the Supreme Court added an additional chapter to the history of the FAA through its decision in DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia. The Supreme Court in DIRECTV held that California law making arbitration waivers unenforceable is preempted by the FAA...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} that indicators for different port characteristics have {{a statistically significant}} and strong impact on international maritime transport costs. It reports on empirical work on trade among 16 Latin-American countries. The database incorporates 75, 928 observations, which comprise practically all <b>maritime</b> trade <b>transactions</b> in containerizable goods on most intra-Latin-American trade routes for the year 2002. The regressions incorporate the main classical explanatory variables of maritime transport costs, such as unit cargo value, volume per transaction, geographical distance, bilateral trade volume, and trade balances. It further looks at six indicators for different port characteristics as possible additional determinants of international transport costs. It is found that indicators for port efficiency, port infrastructure, private sector participation, and inter-port connectivity have significant impacts on international maritime transport costs. The estimated elasticity for port efficiency is the highest of all port-related variables; doubling port efficiency {{in a pair of}} ports has the same impact on international transport costs as halving the distance between them would have. ...|$|R

5000|$|If, as O'Connor had argued, the FAA {{was merely}} {{procedural}} law, why would Congress have limited it to <b>maritime</b> and interstate <b>transactions?</b> [...] "We therefore view the 'involving commerce' requirement in § 2, {{not as an}} inexplicable limitation {{on the power of}} the federal courts, but as a necessary qualification on a statute intended to apply in state and federal courts." [...] O'Connor's interpretation would lead to forum shopping, Burger wrote: We are unwilling to attribute to Congress the intent, in drawing on the comprehensive powers of the Commerce Clause, to create a right to enforce an arbitration contract and yet make the right dependent for its enforcement on the particular forum in which it is asserted. And since the overwhelming proportion of all civil litigation in this country is in the state courts, we cannot believe Congress intended to limit the Arbitration Act to disputes subject only to federal court jurisdiction. Such an interpretation would frustrate congressional intent to place [...] "an arbitration agreement [...] [...] [...] upon the same footing as other contracts, where it belongs."In creating a substantive rule applicable in state as well as federal courts, Congress intended to foreclose state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements. We hold that § 31512 of the California Franchise Investment Law violates the Supremacy Clause.|$|R
