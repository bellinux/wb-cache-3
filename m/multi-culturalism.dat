25|$|Multiculturalism and {{the state}} of inter-ethnic {{relations}} in Canada is relaxed and tolerant, allowing ethnic or linguistic particularism to exist unquestioned. In metropolitan areas such as Toronto and Vancouver, there is often a strong sense that multiculturalism is a normal and respectable expression of being Canadian. Canada is also considered a mosaic because of the <b>multi-culturalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|After World War II, the Yemeni {{population}} declined, {{partly due}} to migrations to other industrial areas such as Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield. However, {{the main reason for}} the reduction in numbers {{was the end of the}} shipping industry and the need for sailors as coal burning ships decreased in numbers. Today, the Yemeni population of South Shields numbers around 1,000. Many Yemeni sailors married local women and became integrated with the wider community, resulting with a migrant population less distinct than in other mixed communities across the UK. The Yemeni are the first, settled Muslim community in Britain and have been used to justify <b>multi-culturalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{has been}} also {{considered}} a real social phenomenon reflecting more {{the consequences of}} a lack of income than the lack of income per se (Ferragina et al. 2016). According to Townsend: humans are social animals entangled in a web of relationships, which exert complex and changing pressures, as much in their consumption of goods and services as in any other aspect of their behaviour (Townsend 1979). This idea has received theoretical support from scholars and extensive testimony from people experiencing poverty across the globe (Walker 2014). Participation and consumption have become ever more crucial mechanisms through which people establish and communicate their identity and position in society, increasing the premium attached to resources needed to participate (Giddens 1991). In addition, the concept of social exclusion has been added to the lexicon of poverty related terms, describing the process by which people, especially those on low incomes, can become socially and politically detached from mainstream society and its associated resources and opportunities (Cantillon 1997). Equally western society have become more complex with ethnic diversity, <b>multi-culturalism</b> and life-style choices raising the possibility that a single concept of poverty as conceived in the past might no longer apply (Ferragina et al. 2016).|$|E
500|$|Since Fear of a Black Planet {{was first}} released, {{it has been}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} and most important hip hop albums of all time, as well as a culturally significant work. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that [...] "as a piece of music, this is the best hip-hop has ever had to offer", calling it [...] "a remarkable piece of modern art, a record that ushered in the '90s in a hail of <b>multi-culturalism</b> and kaleidoscopic confusion". Alex Ross cited it as one of [...] "the most densely packed sonic assemblages in musical history", while [...] Q said it [...] "achieved the near impossible by being every bit as good as its predecessor". In the opinion of Kembrew McLeod, Public Enemy had worked with production equipment that would seem primitive decades later but still managed to invent new [...] "techniques and workarounds that electronics manufacturers never imagined". Sputnikmusic staff writer Nick Butler said the album remained an enduring and vital work in a genre that [...] "has a habit of moving at such a pace that records date in a matter of years".|$|E

2500|$|Bailey's {{ideas about}} race were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a {{cultural}} anthropologist and ethnographer, who {{in a survey}} of modern Neopaganism in Russia, drew particular attention to [...] "... groups [...] take an extremely negative view of <b>multi-culturalism,</b> object to the 'mixture' of kinds, [...] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration." [...] Shnirelman saw some of Bailey's ideas on race as similar to the racism he perceived in the writing of Julius Evola, saying that [...] "... racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its [...] "Jewish inheritance" [...] and reject the [...] "Jewish Bible" [...] as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius." ...|$|E

50|$|Toby Archer detects a {{difference}} between the European and American wings of the movement. The American wing emphasizes an external threat, essentially terrorist in nature. The European wing sees a cultural threat to European traditions stemming from immigrant Muslim populations.

He acknowledges the movement’s conservative defense of human rights {{and the rule of law}} but he believes by rejecting progressive policy it rejects much of what Europe is today.|$|E
