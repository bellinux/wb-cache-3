25|$|Many modern bridges, made {{of steel}} or {{reinforced}} concrete, often bear some of their load by tension within their structure.

25|$|Bhushan {{says that}} he envisages a {{transparent}} and honest legal system, where people can negotiate their own cases without the need of any lawyers. In 1990, {{he and his father}} formed the Committee on Judicial Accountability (CJA) to fight corruption in the judiciary. The organisation comprised some lawyers and ex-judges. Prashant Bhushan started focusing <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> issue in 1993, after the Supreme Court Justice V. Ramaswami was not impeached by parliament on corruption charges. In 2007, the Bhushans expanded CJA to include citizens and form the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reform (CJAR).|$|E

25|$|Animal Boy is {{the ninth}} studio album {{released}} by the American punk band the Ramones through Sire Records on May 19, 1986. Due to conflicts within the group, the album features less of lead singer Joey Ramone, both in performing and writing, and less of lead guitarist Johnny Ramone. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote and sang <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album than previous albums, and Richie Ramone became the first drummer to write songs for the band. The album spawned four singles, all of which charted on the UK Singles Chart. In addition to singles, the band promoted their album by making a music video which parodied the benefit concerts Live Aid and Hands Across America.|$|E

500|$|Rhythmically, Tchaikovsky {{sometimes}} {{experimented with}} unusual meters. More often, {{he used a}} firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements—a [...] "synthetic propulsion," [...] as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music. (For <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> please see Repetition below.) ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest on his radio program On Air With Ryan Seacrest, Gaga described [...] "Hair" [...] as an up-tempo club record, with Bruce Springsteen overtones to it. She also revealed the involvement of Clarence Clemons playing sax on the record. Other influences included metal bands like Kiss and Iron Maiden on the melody. She revealed some of {{the lines of the}} song on Seacrest's show, [...] "This is my prayer, that I'll die living just as free as my hair", adding that the composition of [...] "Hair" [...] was interesting since it was juxtaposing saxophone with a dance record. In {{an interview}} with radio station Z-100 she added, [...] "Some of those themes are explored <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album. To put my money where my mouth is." [...] Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was the music of E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen; to her they represented a different genre of music, at the same time encompassing all the different elements of it. She ultimately decided to ask Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument.|$|E
500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, repetition was {{a natural}} part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it {{is an integral part of}} Russian music. His use of sequences within melodies (repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice) could go on for extreme length. The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements. By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building [...] "into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity," [...] as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement.
