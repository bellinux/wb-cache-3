50|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>marketing-mix</b> modeling was also accelerated {{due to the}} focus from Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 that required internal controls for financial reporting on significant expenses and outlays. Marketing for consumer goods can be in excess of a 10th of total revenues and until the advent of <b>marketing-mix</b> models, relied on qualitative or 'soft' approaches to evaluate this spend. <b>Marketing-mix</b> modeling presented a rigorous and consistent approach to evaluate <b>marketing-mix</b> investments as the CPG industry had already demonstrated. A study by American Marketing Association pointed out that top management {{was more likely to}} stress the importance of marketing accountability than middle management, suggesting a top-down push towards greater accountability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marketing-mix</b> {{modeling}} {{can help}} marketing leaders optimize how they spend marketing budgets {{to maximize the}} impact on brand awareness or on sales. Managing brands for value creation will often involve applying <b>marketing-mix</b> modeling techniques in conjunction with brand valuation.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>{{marketing}}-mix</b> models {{suggest a}} marketing tactic {{has a positive}} impact on sales doesn't necessarily mean it has {{a positive impact on}} long-term brand equity. Different marketing measures impact short-term and long-term brand sales differently and adjusting the marketing portfolio to maximize either the short-term or the long-term alone will be sub-optimal. For example the short-term positive effect of promotions on consumers’ utility induces consumers to switch to the promoted brand, but the adverse impact of promotions on brand equity carries over from period to period. Therefore the net effect of promotions on a brand’s market share and profitability can be negative due to their adverse impact on brand. Determining marketing ROI on the basis of <b>marketing-mix</b> models alone can lead to misleading results. This is because <b>marketing-mix</b> attempts to optimize <b>marketing-mix</b> to increase incremental contribution, but <b>marketing-mix</b> also drives brand-equity, which {{is not part of the}} incremental part measured by <b>marketing-mix</b> model- it is part of the baseline. True 'Return on Marketing Investment' is a sum of short-term and long-term ROI. The fact that most firms use <b>marketing-mix</b> models only to measure the short-term ROI can be inferred from an article by Booz Allen Hamilton, which suggests that there is a significant shift away from traditional media to 'below-the-line' spending, driven by the fact that promotional spending is easier to measure. But academic studies have shown that promotional activities are in fact detrimental to long-term marketing ROI (Ataman et al., 2006). Short-term <b>marketing-mix</b> models can be combined with brand-equity models using brand-tracking data to measure 'brand ROI', in both the short- and long-term. Finally, the modeling process itself should not be more costly than the resulting gain in profitability; i.e. it should have a positive Return On Modeling Effort (ROME).|$|E

50|$|<b>Marketing-mix</b> models use {{historical}} {{performance to}} evaluate marketing performance {{and so are}} not an effective tool to manage marketing investments for new products. This is because the relatively short history of new products make <b>marketing-mix</b> results unstable. Also relationship between marketing and sales may be radically different in the launch and stable periods. For example the initial performance of Coke Zero was really poor and showed low advertising elasticity. In spite of this Coke increased its media spend, with an improved strategy and radically improved its performance resulting in advertising effectiveness that is probably several times the effectiveness during the launch period. A typical <b>marketing-mix</b> model would have recommended cutting media spend and instead resorting to heavy price discounting.|$|E

5000|$|Marketing mix {{models were}} more popular {{initially}} in the CPG industry and quickly spread to Retail and Pharma industries {{because of the}} availability of Syndicated Data in these industries (primarily from Nielsen Company and IRI {{and to a lesser extent}} from NPD Group). Availability of Time-series data is crucial to robust modeling of <b>marketing-mix</b> effects and with the systematic management of customer data through CRM systems in other industries like Financial Services, Automotive and Hospitality industries helped its spread to these industries. In addition competitive and industry data availability through third-party sources like Forrester Research's Ultimate Consumer Panel (Financial Services), Polk Insights (Automotive) and Smith Travel Research (Hospitality), further enhanced the application of <b>marketing-mix</b> modeling to these industries.

50|$|In {{relation}} to the bias against equity building activities, marketing budgets optimized using <b>marketing-mix</b> models may tend too much towards efficiency because <b>marketing-mix</b> models measure only the short-term effects of marketing. Longer term effects of marketing are reflected in its brand equity. The impact of marketing spend on equity is usually not captured by <b>marketing-mix</b> models. One {{reason is that the}} longer duration that marketing takes to impact brand perception extends beyond the simultaneous or, at best, weeks-ahead impact of marketing on sales that these models measure. The other reason is that temporary fluctuation in sales due to economic and social conditions do not necessarily mean that marketing has been ineffective in building brand equity. On the contrary, it is very possible that in the short term sales and market-share could deteriorate, but brand equity could actually be higher. This higher equity should in the long run help the brand recover sales and market-share.|$|E
50|$|Further, most {{approaches}} to <b>marketing-mix</b> models try {{to include all}} marketing activities in aggregate at the national or regional level, {{but to the extent}} that various tactics are targeted to different demographic consumer groups, their impact may be lost. For example, Mountain Dew sponsorship of NASCAR may be targeted to NASCAR fans, which may include multiple age groups, but Mountain Dew advertising on gaming blogs may be targeted to the Gen Y population. Both of these tactics may be highly effective within the corresponding demographic groups but, when included in aggregate in a national or regional <b>marketing-mix</b> model, may come up as ineffective.|$|E

The correct albeit rigorous approach would be to determine what dealers to combine into 'addable' common groups based on overlapping 'trade-areas' determined by consumer zip codes and cross-shopping information. At the very least 'Common Dealer Areas' can be determined by clustering dealers based on geographical distance between dealers and share of county sales. <b>Marketing-mix</b> models built by 'pooling' monthly sales for these dealer clusters will be effectively used to measure the impact of dealer advertising effectively.|$|E

40|$|Companies spend {{millions}} of dollars on advertising to boost a brand's image and simultaneously {{spend millions}} of dollars on promotion that many believe calls attention to price and erodes brand equity. We believe this paradoxical situation exists because both advertising and promotion are necessary to compete effectively in dynamic markets. Consequently, brand managers need to account for interactions between marketing activities and interactions among competing brands. By recognizing interaction effects between activities, managers can consider interactivity trade-offs in planning the <b>marketing-mix</b> strategies. On the other hand, by recognizing interactions with competitors, managers can incorporate strategic foresight in their planning, which requires them to look forward and reason backward in making optimal decisions. Looking forward means that each brand manager anticipates how other competing brands are likely to make future decisions, and then by reasoning backward deduces one's own optimal decisions in response to the best decisions to be made by all other brands. The joint consideration of interaction effects and strategic foresight in planning <b>marketing-mix</b> strategies is a challenging and unsolved marketing problem, which motivates this paper. This paper investigates the problem of planning marketing mix in dynamic competitive markets. We extend the Lanchester model by incorporating interaction effects, constructing the <b>marketing-mix</b> algorithm that yields <b>marketing-mix</b> plans with strategic foresight, and developing the continuous-discrete estimation method to calibrate dynamic models of oligopoly using market data. Both the <b>marketing-mix</b> algorithm and the estimation method are general, so they can be applied to any other alternative model specifications for dynamic oligopoly markets. Thus, this dual methodology augments the decision-making toolkit of managers, empowering them to tackle realistic marketing problems in dynamic oligopoly markets. We illustrate the application of this dual methodology by studying the dynamic Lanchester competition across five brands in the detergents market, where each brand uses advertising and promotion to influence its own market share and the shares of competing brands. Empirically, we find that advertising and promotion not only affect the brand shares (own and competitors') but also exert interaction effects, i. e., each activity amplifies or attenuates the effectiveness of the other activity. Normatively, we find that large brands underadvertise and overspend on promotion, while small brands underadvertise and underpromote. Finally, comparative statics reveal managerial insights into how a specific brand should respond optimally to the changes in a competing brand's situation; more generally, we find evidence that competitive responsiveness is asymmetric. continuous-discrete estimation, dynamic competition, interaction effects, <b>marketing-mix</b> planning, strategic foresight, two-point boundary value problem...|$|E

40|$|Many {{companies}} have often forgotten that promotion {{is an element}} of <b>marketing-mix.</b> Therelore their promotional campain has not always been as effective as it could be. In designing and developing marketing communication one should consider all elements of <b>marketing-mix</b> as well as all promotional tools.

The major thrust of promotional strategy is generally thought of in terms of four explicit promotional elements, i. e., advertising, personal selling, sales promotion and public relations. However, it is necessary to emphasize at the ouset that these four explicit elements work in conjunction with other components of the <b>marketing-mix.</b> The other elements in the mix — product, price and place — not only inlluence the manner in which one can handle the explicit promotional tools, but can also convay a type of communication impact of their own.

40|$|Entertainment {{products}} such as movies, DVDs and video games have short life-cycles: demand is usually highest immediately following the product release and declines rapidly in subsequent weeks. Since marketers have to set advertising schedules for such products prior to launch, it is critical for them to obtain an accurate assessment of the demand responsiveness to advertising before any sales data become available. This paper introduces the problem of forecasting advertising responsiveness as a critical ingredient in marketers ’ new product introduction decision support systems. The paper also solves the “slope endogeneity ” problem that arises from private information possessed by managers about the heterogeneous effects of <b>marketing-mix</b> variables on sales. Such endogeneity {{is different from the}} “intercept endogeneity ” problem (which has been widely recognized in the literature) due to private information about the linear demand shifters regardless of endogenous variables. To correct for the slope endogeneity bias, we develop a conceptually simple controlfunction approach that is amenable to multiple endogenous variables and the advertising carryover effect, and we apply this approach to the U. S. DVD market. Our results suggest that advertising responsiveness varies substantially across DVD titles and that the estimated <b>marketing-mix</b> elasticities would be seriously biased if the slope endogeneity problem is ignored. In addition, as the first empirical study of the demand drivers and <b>marketing-mix</b> effects in the DVD market, our analysis yields findings of substantial interest to both researchers and managers involved in entertainment marketing...|$|E
