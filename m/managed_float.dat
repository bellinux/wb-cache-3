5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the <b>managed</b> <b>float</b> regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E

The author {{argues that the}} best regime choice for such economies would be <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> plus, where "plus" is shorthand for a framework that includes inflation targeting and aggressive measures to discourage currency mismatching. Goldstein argues that if <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> were enhanced in this way, it would retain the desirable features of a flexible rate regime while addressing the nominal anchor and balance-sheet problems that have historically underpinned a "fear of floating" and handicapped the performance of <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> in emerging economies. The author also shows why <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> plus is superior to four alternative currency-regime options [...] an adjustable peg system, a "BBC (basket, band, crawl) regime," a currency board, and dollarization. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{exchange}} rate {{has been linked}} to the US dollar since the 1950s. Several regimes were adopted including initially the conventional peg in the sixties, regular crawling peg in the seventies and the eighties and crawling bands in the nineties. Over that time period, there were several {{exchange rate}} markets including black market, parallel market and the official market.

25|$|The rupee was pegged to the British pound until 1982, {{when the}} {{government}} of General Zia-ul-Haq changed it to <b>managed</b> <b>float.</b> As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982–83 and 1987–88 {{and the cost of}} importing raw materials increased rapidly, causing pressure on Pakistani finances and damaging much of the industrial base. The Pakistani rupee depreciated against the United States dollar until the turn of the century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar. The State Bank of Pakistan then stabilized the exchange rate by lowering interest rates and buying dollars, in order to preserve the country's export competitiveness.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{analyzes}} {{the differences in}} managing exchange rate fluctuations in an inflation-targeting monetary framework {{in the case of}} (former) transition economies. Differences in managing the exchange rate fluctuations are identified according to the extent of managing as hard (dirty) versus soft <b>managed</b> <b>floating,</b> on the one hand, and according to direct managing via foreign exchange interventions and indirect managing via interest rate policy, on the other hand. Hard versus soft <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> (sub) regimes are related to inflation-targeting (sub) regimes: hard <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> with light inflation targeting and soft <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> with strict or full-fledged inflation targeting. Two main motives for managing exchange rate fluctuations are emphasized in the paper: exchange rate pass-through and financial euroization. The direct and indirect managing of exchange rate fluctuations, exchange rate pass-through, and financial euroization, are investigated with vector autoregression (VAR) /vector error correction (VEC) models in the case of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Serbia, in the period of combining flexible exchange rate regimes and an inflation-targeting monetary regime.

25|$|On 21 July 2005, Bank Negara {{announced}} {{the end of}} the peg to the US dollar immediately after China's announcement of {{the end of the}} renminbi peg to the US dollar. According to Bank Negara, Malaysia allows the ringgit to operate in a <b>managed</b> <b>float</b> against several major currencies. This has resulted in the value of the ringgit rising closer to its perceived market value, although Bank Negara has intervened in financial markets to maintain stability in the trading level of the ringgit. This task is made easier by the fact that the ringgit has been non-tradeable outside Malaysia since 1998, which coincided with its pegging to the US dollar, a restriction that was not removed when it was de-pegged in July 2005.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis beginning in July 1997 in Thailand spread into Indonesia as foreign speculative investors pulled-out their investments, sucking US dollar liquidity in Indonesia and causing severe depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah. In the private sector, many Indonesian corporations had been borrowing heavily in lower-interest US dollar denomination while their revenues were mostly in rupiah; their debt rapidly increased as the US dollar appreciated, leaving many companies virtually bankrupt. These companies desperately sold rupiah and bought US dollars, causing the rupiah's value to drop from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. Efforts {{by the central}} bank to defend its <b>managed</b> <b>float</b> regime by selling dollar had little impact and instead drained Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves, forcing the government to free-float the currency and seek liquidity aid from IMF (International Monetary Fund).|$|E
25|$|Under a fixed {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank accommodates those flows by buying up any net inflow of funds into the country or by providing foreign currency funds to the foreign exchange market to match any international outflow of funds, thus preventing the funds flows from affecting the exchange rate between the country's currency and other currencies. Then the net change {{per year in the}} central bank's foreign exchange reserves is sometimes called the balance of payments surplus or deficit. Alternatives to a {{fixed exchange}} rate system include a <b>managed</b> <b>float</b> where some changes of exchange rates are allowed, or at the other extreme a purely floating exchange rate (also known as a purely flexible exchange rate). With a pure float the central bank does not intervene at all to protect or devalue its currency, allowing the rate to be set by the market, and the central bank's foreign exchange reserves do not change, and the balance of payments is always zero.|$|E
30|$|The dual {{exchange}} rate system was then {{replaced by a}} <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> system in 1977. Under this system, the {{exchange rate}} was linked to a basket of currencies. The <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate system was finally replaced by an independent float regime on January 23, 2001. The CBSL took a landmark step towards liberalizing the foreign exchange market by allowing commercial banks to determine the exchange rate according to the market forces of currency demand and supply. However, the CBSL retained its power to intervene on the foreign exchange market when required.|$|R
40|$|Pegged {{exchange}} rates in capital importing countries partially 'socialised' {{the risks of}} international borrowing. A corollary of <b>managed</b> <b>floating,</b> therefore, is a reallocation of risk bearing to private capital markets.

As an explanation for this disappointing outcome, the analysis highlights the implications of <b>managed</b> <b>floating</b> for equity demand when corporate debt is high.

25|$|Following the Asian {{financial}} crisis in 1998 the currency devaluated to UAH 5.6 = USD 1.00 in February 2000. Later, {{the exchange rate}} remained relatively stable at around 5.4 hryvnias for 1 US dollar and was fixed to 5.05 hryvnias for 1 US dollar from 21 April 2005 until 21 May 2008.
