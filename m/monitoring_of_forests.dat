50|$|While {{working as}} a forest {{researcher}} in East Kalimantan, Indonesia in 1989, Smits encountered a baby orangutan in a cage in a market, and later returned to find it abandoned on a rubbish heap. This was a turning-point in his career: taking the orangutan home, he nurtured it back to health. He was soon given other orangutans to look after, {{and the work of}} rescuing, rehabilitating and releasing orangutans into the wild developed into what was to become the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation. For over twenty years Smits has worked for the survival of this threatened species of ape, during which time his work has also broadened out into the related areas of sustainable farming, reforestation and remote <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests.</b> He travels widely, raising awareness of the issues surrounding deforestation in Borneo and the plight of the orangutan, also showing how it has been possible on a relatively small scale to reverse the great damage that is being done to the orangutan and its environment. He became a senior advisor to the Ministry of Forests in Indonesia and has been knighted in the Netherlands.|$|E

SAR systems are suitable for that purpose due to their weather independence and sensitivity for changes in time series. The TanDEM-X mission delivers global datasets of a single-pass SAR interferometer, which provides more information in comparison to normal X-band SAR acquisitions.

This unique long-term, large-scale perspective has yielded many surprising findings. Even far from the impacts of deforestation and degradation, the remote Amazon forests are changing. They have gained biomass, trees are growing faster, and they are dying faster. These changes are affected by climate change, and the accelerating carbon fluxes are themselves feeding back on the rate of global climate change. Neither has biodiversity been untouched by these changes.

Estimating the impacts of climate change on mountain boreal forests requires a more complete accounting of tree growth/climate interaction. We used both remote sensing and field data. Field measurements were made from the upper to lower timberline of dark deciduous forest in 2005 and 2012. The remote sensing datasets were generated from LANDSAT scenes of different dates (19. 08. 1988, 25. 06. 1992 and 18. 08. 2011).

The objective of this Forest Focus regulation was to establish a community scheme for harmonised, broad-based, comprehensive and long-term monitoring of European forest ecosystems. Amongst others, the Forest Focus programme addressed the monitoring of climate change and C sequestration. As part of that programme, a project was conducted aiming at the mapping of C sequestration at the regional scale. Thereby, the results derived by different methodical approaches applied to the same data should be compared. This paper is based on this project and deals with a climate biomonitoring method for mapping the C storage in humus layer, living forest trees/dead wood and mineral soil, using available forest monitoring data collected in North Rhine-Westphalia, one of 16 German federal states.|$|E

The results presented here are from the Biodiversity module in which various aspects of forest biodiversity, including species composition, structural elements and deadwood, were assessed over 3379 plots in Europe. As a test of practical indicators of forest biodiversity the project was successful, and the project has produced a common baseline on forest biodiversity information where changes over time and space can be monitored in the future. This is of particular relevance to the EU biodiversity policy and {{for the assessment of}} the new 2020 biodiversity goals.

40|$|This study {{develops}} a modelling framework for utilizing very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery for monitoring stocks of above-ground biomass (AGB) in a tropical forest in Southeast Asia. Three different texture-based methods (grey level co-occurrence metric (GLCM), Gabor wavelets and Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO)) {{were used in}} conjunction with two different machine learning (ML) -based regression techniques (support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) regression). These methods were implemented on both 50 -cm resolution Digital Globe data extracted from Google Earth™ (GE) and 8 -cm commercially obtained VHR imagery. This study further examines the role of forest biophysical parameters, such as ground-measured canopy cover and vertical canopy height, in explaining AGB distribution. Three models were developed using: (i) horizontal canopy variables (i. e., canopy cover and texture variables) plus vertical canopy height; (ii) horizontal variables only; and (iii) texture variables only. AGB was variable across the site, ranging from 51. 02 Mg/ha to 356. 34 Mg/ha. GE-based AGB estimates were comparable to those derived from commercial aerial imagery. The findings demonstrate that novel use of this array of texture-based techniques with GE imagery can help promote the wider use of freely available imagery for low-cost, fine-resolution <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> parameters at the landscape scale...|$|E
