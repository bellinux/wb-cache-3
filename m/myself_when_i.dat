But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|On February 2, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada's health care system. According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale, [...] "It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province." [...] Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada. On February 8, 2010, it {{was reported}} that Williams' surgery had been successful. On his return, Williams later defended his choice saying: [...] "I did not sign away my right to get the best possible health care for <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> entered politics". Williams said although he had [...] "the utmost confidence" [...] in his own province's health care system, his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami to undergo [...] "a very specialized piece of surgery [...] somebody who's doing this {{three or four times a}} day, five, six days a week." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I Made It" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Tye Tribbett and David Outing. Prior to its release on her album The Definition Of... (2016), Fantasia {{had played a}} portion of the song on Periscope and revealed to her fans that she worked with Tribbett. In the video, she incorrectly reported that she had handled the songwriting by herself. Tribbett explained its concept and his collaboration with Fantasia to Christine Thomasos of The Christian Post, saying: [...] "We've been talking about working together for a minute. So when the opportunity came {{it was kind of like}} a no brainer". He said that he instantly agreed to work with Fantasia after receiving a phone call to write a song for her. Fantasia had contacted Tribbett at the suggestion of music executive Ron Fair. Prior to the writing process, Tribbett had asked to [...] "do it on [...] terms" [...] and [...] "maintain the integrity of his message" [...] by creating an inspirational gospel record. He used Fantasia's testimony, as well as his own experiences with God, as inspiration for the lyrics. He described the song as the result of a close connection between Fantasia and himself: [...] "I basically just combined testimonies between her and <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote the song and it resonated so richly with her, her audience and with everybody." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt {{resigned}} as the Lions' head coach on January 12, 1973. At {{a press conference}} announcing his decision, Schmidt said, [...] "I really don't enjoy coaching anymore. [...] It {{got to be a}} burden more than a fun-loving game. I promised my family and <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started coaching that I would get out when it stopped being fun. Unfortunately, it's reached that point." [...] In six years under Schmidt, the Lions compiled a 43–34–7 record and finished in second place each year from 1969 to 1972.|$|E

When he was imprisoned his views changed. [...] "Since my imprisonment I have not killed a single thing... having experienced such worry and danger <b>myself,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt just like a fowl waiting in the kitchen, I can no longer bear to cause any living creature to suffer immeasurable fright and pain simply to please my palate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what I promised <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finished The Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon got used to the adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E

2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for <b>myself,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> start {{thinking}} about my birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I was learning to walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as [...] "the merry age".|$|E
2500|$|Her posthumous book, The Life of the Mind (1978, {{edited by}} Mary McCarthy), {{remained}} incomplete. [...] During Arendt's {{tenure at the}} New School, in 1974, she presented a graduate level Political Philosophy class entitled, [...] "Philosophy of the Mind". It was during these class lectures that Arendt crystallized her concepts. The class was based on her working draft of [...] "Philosophy of the Mind", which was later edited to [...] "Life of the Mind". Arendt's working draft of Philosophy of the Mind was distributed to graduate students at the New School during her visiting professorship in 1974. Also, stemming from her Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, her last writing focused on the mental faculties of thinking and willing. In a sense, Life of the Mind went beyond her previous work concerning the [...] In her discussion of thinking she focuses mainly on Socrates and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between Me and Myself. This appropriation of Socrates leads her to introduce novel concepts of conscience (which gives no positive prescriptions, but instead, tells me what I cannot do if I would remain friends with <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> re-enter the two-in-one of thought where I must render an account of my actions to myself) and morality (an entirely negative enterprise concerned with non-participation in certain actions {{for the sake of}} remaining friends with one's self).|$|E

2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) by Xi Zuochi (習鑿齒) further {{described}} this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens {{were impressed with}} him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border, [...] "If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we'll lose the war without even having to fight. I hope that you can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters." [...] The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised détente and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners {{to cross the border}} and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions in the Mian (沔) area at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said, [...] "This medicine is of fine quality. I prepared it myself. I haven't tried it <b>myself</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard that you're ill so I sent it to you." [...] Lu Kang's subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu's medicine because they were worried that Yang might harm him, but Lu ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu replied, [...] "Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. If I do not live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu." [...] However, there were some who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that Lu and Yang were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.|$|E
