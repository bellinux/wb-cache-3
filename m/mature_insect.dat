60|$|Whilst {{reflecting}} on the beauty of many butterflies, {{it occurred to me}} that some caterpillars were splendidly coloured; and as sexual selection could not possibly have here acted, it appeared rash to attribute the beauty of the <b>mature</b> <b>insect</b> to this agency, unless the bright colours of their larvae could be somehow explained. In the first place, it may be observed that the colours of caterpillars do not stand in any close correlation with those of the <b>mature</b> <b>insect.</b> Secondly, their bright colours do not serve in any ordinary manner as a protection. Mr. Bates informs me, as an instance of this, that the most conspicuous caterpillar which he ever beheld (that of a Sphinx) lived on the large green leaves of a tree on the open llanos of South America; it was about four inches in length, transversely banded with black and yellow, and with its head, legs, and tail of a bright red. Hence it caught the eye of any one who passed by, even at the distance of many yards, and no doubt that of every passing bird.|$|E
60|$|Insects {{sometimes}} have their antennae or legs in a monstrous condition, the larvae of {{which do not}} possess either antennae or legs; and in these cases, as Quatrefages (22/52. See his interesting work 'Metamorphoses de l'Homme' etc. 1862 page 129.) believes, we are enabled to see the precise period at which the normal progress of development was troubled. But {{the nature of the}} food given to a caterpillar sometimes affects the colours of the moth, without the caterpillar itself being affected; therefore it seems possible that other characters in the <b>mature</b> <b>insect</b> might be indirectly modified through the larvae. There is no reason to suppose that organs which have been rendered monstrous have always been acted on during their development; the cause may have acted on the organisation at a much earlier stage. It is even probable that either the male or female sexual elements, or both, before their union, may be affected in such a manner as to lead to modifications in organs developed at a late period of life; in nearly the same manner as a child may inherit from his father a disease which does not appear until old age.|$|E
60|$|As we {{see that}} those {{variations}} which under domestication appear at any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the same period;--for instance, in {{the seeds of the}} many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult;--so in a state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of profitable variations at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different from those which concern the <b>mature</b> <b>insect.</b> These modifications will no doubt affect, through the laws of correlation, the structure of the adult; and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours, and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvae. So, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life, shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so, they would cause the extinction of the species.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} the replication and tissue distribution of the alphavirus Sindbis in the mosquito Aedes albopictus. Parenteral inoculation of virus resulted in an acute infection accompanied by rapid virus replication and a persistent infection, during which total virus production was reduced. Acute and persistent phase virus RNA synthesis, virus production, and organ-specific distribution of infection were determined over an 18 -day incubation period. Organs were classified as refractory (ovarioles, Malpighian tubules), cleared (head ganglia), transient (salivary glands, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and thoracic muscle), or persistent (fat bodies-hemolymph, hindgut, and tracheole-associated cells) according to the onset, peak, and duration of Sindbis virus antigens within that particular organ. Virus was identified in respiratory tissue by immunological and ultrastructural methods. This represents a novel tropism for an alphavirus. These findings demonstrate that the cells of <b>mature</b> <b>insect</b> organs respond differently to virus infection. Correlations among virus replication, virus RNA synthesis, and organ-specific clearing of a pantropic infection were observed. We suggest that the underlying temporal and spatial kinetics that characterize this virus-invertebrate interaction may reflect a mechanism for the modulation of the arbovirus titer seen in the mosquito host...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the <b>mature</b> <b>insect</b> trachea requires a complex series of cellular events, including tracheal cell specification, cell migration, tubule branching, and tubule fusion. Here we describe {{the identification of the}} Drosophila melanogaster dysfusion gene, which encodes a novel basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) –PAS protein conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans, insects, and humans, and controls tracheal fusion events. The Dysfusion protein functions as a heterodimer with the Tango bHLH-PAS protein in vivo to form a putative DNA-binding complex. The dysfusion gene is expressed in a variety of embryonic cell types, including trachealfusion, leading-edge, foregut atrium cells, nervous system, hindgut, and anal pad cells. RNAi experiments indicate that dysfusion is required for dorsal branch, lateral trunk, and ganglionic branch fusion but not for fusion of the dorsal trunk. The escargot gene, which is also expressed in fusion cells and is required for tracheal fusion, precedes dysfusion expression. Analysis of escargot mutants indicates a complex pattern of dysfusion regulation, such that dysfusion expression is dependent on escargot in the dorsal and ganglionic branches but not the dorsal trunk. Early in tracheal development, the Trachealess bHLH-PAS protein is present at uniformly high levels in all tracheal cells, but since the levels of Dysfusion rise in wild-type fusion cells, the levels of Trachealess in fusion cells decline. The downregulation of Trachealess is dependent on dysfusion function. These results suggest the possibility that competitive interactions between basic helix-loop-helix–PA...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the fat body to {{synthesize}} lipid during development of the adult male desert locust has been investigated by following the rates of incorporation of labelled glucose, trehalose, acetate, and citrate into fat body lipid. There is a small increase in lipogenesis during the first 3 days of adult life, but the major period of lipogenesis occurs between day 5 and day 7. The <b>mature</b> <b>insect</b> then maintains a relatively high capacity for lipogenesis. The patterns of glucose and trehalose incorporation into lipid are {{similar to that of}} acetate, thus the insect has the capacity to convert carbohydrate to lipid during development. Citrate incorporation parallels the acetate incorporation and is thought to be an important intermediate in the conversion of carbohydrate to lipid in the locust. The amounts of these metabolites oxidized for energy production in relation to the amounts converted to lipid during development was also investigated. The capacity of the fat body for lipid oxidation during development was investigated by following the rate of breakdown of labelled palmitate to acid soluble material and CO 2. The ability to oxidize lipid is low during the first 6 days of adult life, then increases rapidly between day 6 and day 8, and remains at a high level until 14 days. From these results {{it is clear that the}} fat body synthesizes lipid during the first 7 days of adult life and subsequently oxidizes this accumulated lipid. These overall changes in metabolism can be correlated with the changes in the lipid content of the fat body and changes in the activities of enzymes associated with lipogenesis measured in previous work. The ability of flight muscle to oxidize both lipid and carbohydrate for energy production was also investigated by measuring the rate of oxidation of labelled trehalose and palmitate by this tissue. It was found that flight muscle has the capacity to oxidize both lipid and carbohydrate at all stages of development. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: N...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} three {{laboratory experiments}} aimed to establish how long NeemAzal-T/S can protect the seedlings against the weevils, {{and if the}} effective lifespan of insecticide could be prolonged by mixing the emulsion with the adjuvant Nu-Film 17. Tests with mature {{as well as with}} young, immature insects, have established the efficiency of protection against the damages caused by the large pine weevil when the treatment was conducted with 5 %, 10 % and 20 % NeemAzal-T/S (having 1 % azadirachtin A), as well as with a mixture of 20 % NeemAzal and 10 % Nu-Film 17. The insect feeding has been affected by all treatments and the magnitude of effect has increased with the concentration of insecticide, but it has also been influenced by the gender and physiological state of the weevils. In <b>mature,</b> post oviposition <b>insects,</b> females have been more sensitive to insecticide than males, and the opposite was true in young, immature weevils, as well in <b>mature</b> <b>insects</b> during oviposition. The best results have been achieved with 20 % NeemAzal and 10 % Nu-Film 17 against the male young weevils. A good protection (efficacy higher than 75 %) is possible only a few days after treatment, but sufficient protection is achieved after two weeks, because most of the wounds are superficial, without severe impact on the plants. Consequently, we suppose that treating the seedlings with 20 % NeemAzal (or higher concentrations) at time intervals shorter than two weeks, during the periods with high rates of feeding, will keep the damages and seedling losses at a normal level. The efficiency could be improved and the period between treatments prolonged by mixing NeemAzal with Nu-Film. Field experiments are necessary to validate our conclusions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn many sexually <b>mature</b> <b>insects</b> egg {{production}} and oviposition are tightly coupled to copulation. Sex-Peptide is a 36 -amino-acid peptide synthesized in the accessory glands ofDrosophila melanogastermales {{and transferred to}} the female during copulation. Sex-Peptide stimulates vitellogenic oocyte progression through a putative control point at about stage 9 of oogenesis. Here we show that application of the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene mimics the Sex-Peptide-mediated stimulation of vitellogenic oocyte progression in sexually mature virgin females. Apoptosis is induced by 20 -hydroxyecdysone in nurse cells of stage 9 egg chambers at physiological concentrations (10 − 7 M). 20 -Hydroxyecdysone thus acts as an antagonist of early vitellogenic oocyte development. Simultaneous application of juvenile hormone analogue, however, protects early vitellogenic oocytes from 20 -hydroxyecdysone-induced resorption. These {{results suggest that the}} balance of these hormones in the hemolymph regulates whether oocytes will progress through the control point at stage 9 or undergo apoptosis. These data are further supported by a molecular analysis of the regulation of yolk protein synthesis and uptake into the ovary by the two hormones. We conclude that juvenile hormone is a downstream component in the Sex-Peptide response cascade and acts by stimulating vitellogenic oocyte progression and inhibiting apoptosis. Since juvenile hormone analogue does not elicit increased oviposition and reduced receptivity, Sex-Peptide must have an additional, separate effect on these two postmating responses...|$|R

Prof. Huxley applies the same principle in accounting for the remarkable, though normal, differences in the arrangement of the nervous system in the Mollusca, in his paper on the Morphology of the Cephalous Mollusca in 'Phil. Transact.' 1853 page 56.) that this may constantly be observed with monstrosities in the animal kingdom; and Moquin-Tandon (25/2. 'Elements de Teratologie Veg.' 1841 page 13.) remarks, that, as with plants the axis cannot become monstrous without in some way affecting the organs subsequently produced from it, so axial anomalies are almost always accompanied by deviations of structure in the appended parts. We shall presently see that with short-muzzled races of the dog certain histological changes in the basal elements of the bones arrest their development and shorten them, and this affects the position of the subsequently developed molar teeth. It is probable that certain modifications in the larvae of insects would affect the structure of the <b>mature</b> <b>insects.</b> But we must be careful not to extend this view too far, for during the normal course of development, certain species pass through an extraordinary course of change, whilst other and closely allied species arrive at maturity with little change of structure.|$|R
