His search leads him to David Park, and he tracks him down using an illegal <b>modification</b> <b>record</b> on his car. Dominic arrives at Park's {{apartment}} first and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park and Park becomes the F.B.I.'s new informant. Park gets Brian into a street race. Brian selects a modified 2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 from the impound lot. Dominic races in his modified 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454. Gisele Yashar, the liaison for Braga, reveals that the winner will become the last driver on a team that traffics heroin between the Mexico-United States border. Dominic wins by bumping Brian's car while it is in nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his power as an F.B.I. agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.|$|E

An investigation of graphical notations was carried out to highlight important features of abstract specifications in order to overcome some of the refinement problems. The chosen notation, HOOD (Hierarchical Object Oriented Design) method was used to provide an overview {{of the structure of the}} specification and identify important data flows through a specification. A few features of the HOOD notation are unsuitable for use on large specifications and there may be an overhead in using the notation but it has been shown to be useful. HOOD can be recommended as a way of focusing on the structure of the specification and the dependencies between components.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the health effects}} of low-dose radiation on cardiologists exposed to scattered radiation while performing cardiac catheterization (CC) in a hospital setting from 2003 to 2006. Methods: We performed a 4 -year retrospective study on 2, 292 medical doctors, using claims data from all contracted hospitals of the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Taiwan. We gathered statistical data regarding radiation-related diseases using the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical <b>Modification</b> <b>record</b> numbers of each doctor. Results: Of the 2, 292 doctors evaluated, 1, 721 were aged 35 – 50 years and the remaining 571 were aged 51 – 65 years. There were 892 cardiologists who performed CC (experimental group), and the majority of these (733 / 892, 82. 17 %) were aged 35 – 50 years. There were 1, 400 medical doctors who performed no CC from 2003 to 2006 (control group). A total of 988 of these belonged to the 35 – 50 years age group and 412 to the 51 – 65 years group. In the 35 – 50 years group, the controls had significantly more medical visits for hematological and thyroid cancer (p < 0. 05), skin disease (p < 0. 001), and acute upper respiratory tract infection (p < 0. 001) compared with the experimental group. In contrast, cardiologists who performed catheterization had more cataracts compared with the control group, but this difference was not significant. Conclusion: Doctors who did not perform CC had more visits for radiation-related diseases than those who performed catheterization. In the experimental group, cardiologists aged 35 – 50 years who were exposed to radiation during CC had more visits for cataracts than the control group. We recommend that radiation protection concepts be emphasized to cardiologists, and that hospital managers be obligated to upgrade angiography equipment because the newer models have less scattered radiation...|$|E

However, {{few studies have been}} carried out on the taphonomic signatures of wolves (Canis lupus) in their natural settings. From 2001 to 2007, 56 wolf feeding places were studied in 2 geographic areas of Poland (Bialowieza, Bieszczady). We recorded ecological aspects such as prey selection, time span of carcasses use, scavengers' activity and the identification of prey from ungulate hairs found in scats, and taphonomic considerations, such as the number and type of bone remains, intensity of tooth modification on carcasses and the effect of digestion on skeletal elements observed in scats. Localities studied included kill sites (4 C. capreolus and 20 C. elaphus in Bialowieza, 29 C. elaphus in Bieszczady) and scavenging sites (10 B. bonasus carcasses in Bialowieza).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of ten-year long geochemical monitoring carried out in the area hit by the 1997 – 98 Umbria–Marche seismic sequence (Northern Apennines, Italy) showing the advancement in our understanding of the reciprocal relationships between fluids and tectonic structures in this area. Long-term geochemical monitoring has allowed us to define the geochemical features of the gas phase and to model its origins and interactions. All the released gases, including dissolved and venting gases, have predominantly crustal origin and have suffered from substantial modifications in their geochemical features. The whole seismogenic process is considered to be responsible for the <b>modifications</b> <b>recorded</b> over a wide time interval, including the production of CO 2 from mechanical stress on carbonate rocks. We interpret the modifications occurred to the gas phase during the 1997 – 98 period as related to faulting activity, while those recorded {{after the end of the}} seismic crisis are interpreted as being a consequence of the crustal relaxation. The data show that it is almost impossible to interpret the temporal variation without coupling long-term geochemical monitoring and knowledge of the genetic features of the fluids. Therefore the information coming from the circulating fluids is a powerful tool to better understand the physical processes governing the faulting activity...|$|R

40|$|Sex {{differences}} {{in the distribution of}} vertebral degenerative and plastic change were examined and compared within and between samples of 51 individuals from the historically and ethnographically documented 16 th– 19 th century site of Ensay, the Outer Hebrides, and 59 individuals from the medieval site of Wharram Percy, the Yorkshire Wolds. Both populations have a known gendered division of labor between males and females and known activity-related stresses on the spine. Osseous changes normally associated with degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis) of the apophyseal facets and osteophytosis of the vertebral bodies were scored and reported separately. Inter- and intrasite differences were found in the frequency and distribution of osseous change down the spine. Overall, the Ensay sample was more highly stressed than that from Wharram Percy. Furthermore, differences between males and females at Ensay could be identified as relating to different types of activities. Distinctions between males and females at Wharram Percy were less marked, suggesting broadly similar lifestyles. These results accorded with expectations regarding contrasting levels of activity-related stress at the two sites and the division of labor between males and females. In particular, the prevalence and distribution of facet remodeling, facet sclerosis/eburnation, and osteophytosis in Ensay females could be related to load-bearing using creels (a form of basket), which disrupted “normal” patterns of osseous change along the spine. Importantly, morphologically distinct osseous <b>modifications</b> <b>recorded</b> on the apophyseal facets produced dissimilar distributions, suggesting that they may have different etiologies. These results highlight the need for a high degree of discrimination in recording, analyzing, and exploring activity-related osseous chang...|$|R
