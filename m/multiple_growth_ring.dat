40|$|The {{value of}} growth rings as proxy data for climate {{reconstruction}} was studied in two miombo woodland species in eastern Africa. Growth rings, marked by terminal parenchyma, were visually detectable on carefully prepared stem discs of Isoberlinia tomentosa and Brachystegia spiciformis, dominant {{species of the}} miombo woodland in north-western Tanzania. However, the presence of <b>multiple</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> anomalies rendered cross-dating of the growth ring series between trees difficult. Cross-dating succeeded for eight out of thirteen samples for Isoberlinia tomentosa, but was unsuccessful for Brachystegia spiciformis. A mean series of 38 years was calculated for Isoberlinia tomentosa only. Monthly precipitation, monthly maximum air temperature and monthly SOI-value (Southern Oscillation Index) correlated significantly with tree ring widths of the mean series. These correlations are strong indicators of the annual character of the growth rings. They also suggest that Isoberlinia tomentosa provides an appropriate paleoclimatic record for dendroclimatic reconstruction. status: publishe...|$|E

Development of tree-ring records in this region has been limited by the occurrence of bi- or multimodal rainfall regimes, causing the development of <b>multiple</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> that cannot be dated with confidence. In this study, we identified annual rings in 30 Juniperus procera trees from northwest Ethiopia by dendrochronology and AMS radiocarbon dating. Carbon isotope ratios(4 series) and ring widths (73 series) were measured. The carbon isotope series did not contain strong trends possibly attributable to increased anthropogenic atmospheric CO 2 concentrations or the juvenile effect. Both carbon isotope values and ring widths were strongly correlated with Blue Nile baseflow, and from composite chronology indices (r= 0. 75, p < 0. 01), a preliminary reconstruction of Blue Nile baseflow back to AD 1836 was developed. Subsample signal strength remained above 0. 85 for most of the reconstruction. Uncertainty bands were relatively narrow and the reliability of the preliminary reconstruction was confirmed by correspondence with reported years of drought and famine. The preliminary reconstruction is characterized by an exceptional decline in baseflow during the late AD 1960 s. Flows recovered during the late 1990 s.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{formation}} of annual <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> {{has been confirmed}} for several mangrove species in the last decade, among which is the Rhizophora mangle. However, the record of annual rings for this species was made in a region with high hydric seasonality, a widely recognized induction factor of annual rings in tropical species. In this sense, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of annual <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in R. mangle in the mangroves of Guaratiba (Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil), a region with low hydric seasonality. For this purpose, the crossdating technique was applied in ten trees collected with known age (seven years). The <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> are characterized by alternating layers of low vessel density (earlywood) and high vessel density (latewood). Multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> width variation is driven by precipitation, water surplus, water deficit and water storage. Crossdating analysis confirmed the existence of annual <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in the R. mangle in Guaratiba. This discovery in a region with low hydric seasonality increases the dendrocronological potential of this species and suggests the importance of biological factors (eg. phenological behavior) as complementary inductors for the {{formation of}} <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in this species...|$|R
