40|$|Background: Asthma {{is one of}} {{the chronic}} {{diseases}} that generate an impact on quality of life and major health care expenses. Aim: To evaluate the impact of asthma on primary attention expenses, the health related quality of life (HRQOL) and the sanitary resources use. Material and Methods: Follow up of a cohort of 56 asthmatic children aged 6 to 14 years (56 % women), during 12 months. The severity and the impact of the disease on HRQOL was assessed using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) video questionnaire and the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) respectively Costs were derived from the number of <b>medical</b> <b>attentions,</b> hospital admissions, medication requirements, school absenteeism among patients and work absenteeism among caregivers. Results: Patients required twice the number of <b>medical</b> <b>attentions</b> than the general population. Fourteen percent of children had severe asthma. Compared with subjects without severe asthma, the latter required more attentions (3. 8 and 9. 7 attentions per year respectively, p< 0. 01), had a lower PAQLQ score (4. 1 ± 0. 11 and 5. 2 ± 1 respectively, p< 0. 05) and a higher school absenteeism (10 and 27 days per year respectively, p < 0. 01). Medication use was not different between patients with and without severe asthma. They early cost per patient was $ 106, 550 (Chilean pesos). Conclusions: Asthma has a great impact on HRQOL and the use of primary attention resources, specially those children with severe asthma...|$|R

Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia [en línea]. 2010, vol. 85, n. 4 p. 461 - 468. ISSN 0365 - 0596. BACKGROUND: Significant associations have been described between climatic factors and human health, which can occur in dermatologic diseases too. OBJECTIVE: To {{determine the influence of}} the climatic factors on the <b>medical</b> <b>attentions</b> of dermatologic diseases in a general hospital in Lima (Peru). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Observational study which was carried out in a national hospital between January 2004 and December 2007. The diagnoses were classified according to the ICD- 10 system. The climate information was provided by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration from USA(NOAA). RESULTS: 3 294 patients were included in the study, the average age was 35. 4 ± 20. 7 years old, and 53. 2 % were females. The "El Niño" phenomenon was associated with an increase in the prevalence of actinic keratosis (p= 0. 002), viral warts (p= 0. 001) and rosacea (p= 0. 014). The "La Niña" phenomenon was associated with a reduction in viral warts (p= 0. 026). Spring was associated with an increase of dermatitis (p= 0. 003), and summer was associated with an increase of benign neoplasms (p= 0. 049). CONCLUSION: The climatic variations influenced the occurrence of certain dermatologic diseases. The present study may represent an orientation guide to specialists and general practitioners identifying the most common dermatologic diagnoses and thus enabling better preparation to treat these cases in determined seasons of the year...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Parents and Health Care Workers have {{traditionally}} attributed {{a variety of}} symptoms to teething in young children. Some of these symptoms may however connote underlying serious medical condition in a child. There is little evidence to support these beliefs despite their implications on management of a symptomatic teething child. This study therefore seeks determine the beliefs and problems mothers associate with teething in Enugu, South-east Nigeria. Findings A cross-sectional survey involving sixty mothers presenting at a Children's clinic in Enugu metropolis using questionnaire. More than 90 % of the respondents thought that babies can experience medical problems {{as a result of}} teething. The commonest medical problems perceived to be associated with teething were fever (71. 7 %), loose stools (58. 3 %) and vomiting (35 %). Conclusion Mothers still associate a variety of symptoms of childhood illnesses to teething and this association is not evidence based and could lead to delayed interventions, increased morbidity and mortality of children. It is important therefore that mothers and health workers caring for young children are educated on the need to seek prompt <b>medical</b> <b>attentions</b> in a symptomatic child. </p...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{technology}} based pervasive healthcare {{has been}} proposed in many applications such as disease management and accident prevention for cost saving and promoting citizen’s wellbeing. However, the emphasis so far is on the artefacts with limited attentions to guiding {{the development of an}} effective and efficient solution for pervasive healthcare. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a framework of multi-agent systems design for pervasive healthcare by adopting the concept of pervasive informatics and using the methods of organisational semiotics. The proposed multi-agent system for pervasive healthcare utilises sensory information to support healthcare professionals for providing appropriate care. The key contributions contain theoretical aspect and practical aspect. In theory, this paper articulates the information interactions between the pervasive healthcare environment and stakeholders by using the methods of organisational semiotics; in practice, the proposed framework improves the healthcare quality by providing appropriate <b>medical</b> <b>attentions</b> when and as needed. In this paper, both systems and functional architecture of the multi-agent system are elaborated with the use of wireless technologies such as RFID and wireless sensor networks.

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance.
