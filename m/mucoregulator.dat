40|$|Metabolic {{transformation}} of the <b>mucoregulator</b> and bronchodilator 7 -(1, 3 -thiazolldln- 2 -ylmethyl) theophylllne was studied In vitro with a rat liver microsomal preparation contaIning a NADPH-generatlng sys-tern. The only metaboifte observed was 7 -theophyllinacetaldehyde. In contrast to previous literature pointing out the chemical nature of 2 -substituted thiazolidine ring cleavage, the formation of 7 -theo-phylllnacetaldehyde was mediated by monooxygenase-dependent oxidation. Possibly an unstable sulfoxide was the first metabOliC product, rapidly converted to 7 -theophyllinacetaldehyde by hydroly-sis. The sulfoxidation was apparently catalyzed mainly by fiavin-Containing monooxygenases, as selective thermal inactivation and methymazole significantly reduced the rate of formation of the me-taboifte. No N 1 -dealkylatlon pathway producing theophylline was detected, indicating a high regioseleetivfty in In vitro metabolism, due to the nueleophilicfty of the sulfur atom...|$|E
40|$|Mucus {{hypersecretion}} is {{a clinical}} feature of severe respiratory {{diseases such as}} asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Airway mucosal infection and/or inflammation associated with these diseases often gives rise to inflammatory products, including neutrophil-derived DNA and filamentous actin, in addition to bacteria, apoptotic cells and cellular debris, that may collectively increase mucus production and viscosity. Mucoactive agents have been the medication of choice {{for the treatment of}} respiratory diseases in which mucus hypersecretion is a clinical complication. The main purpose of mucoactive drugs is to increase the ability to expectorate sputum and/or decrease mucus hypersecretion. Many mucoactive drugs are currently available and can be classified according to their putative mechanism of action. Mucoactive medications include expectorants, <b>mucoregulators,</b> mucolytics and mucokinetics. By developing our understanding of the specific effects of mucoactive agents, we may result in improved therapeutic use of these drugs. The present review provides a summary of the most clinically relevant mucoactive drugs in addition to their potential mechanism of action...|$|R
