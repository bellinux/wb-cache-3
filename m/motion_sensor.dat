5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{devices that}} use {{various forms of}} {{technology}} to detect movement. The technology typically found in <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> to trigger an alarm includes infrared, ultrasonic, vibration and contact. Dual technology sensors combine two or more forms of detection {{in order to reduce}} false alarms as each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Traditionally <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are an integral part of}} a home security system. These devices are typically installed to cover a large area as they commonly cover up to 40ft with a 135&#176; field of vision.|$|R

If, for example a thief breaks into your car and attempts to steal it, the tracking system can be triggered by the immobiliser unit or <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> being activated. A monitoring bureau, will then be automatically notified that the unit has been activated and begin tracking the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|On February 5, 2009, Publix {{opened its}} 1,000th store in St. Augustine, Florida, {{allowing}} {{the company to}} become one of only five U.S. grocery retailers to operate that many stores. The St. Augustine store is among Publix's first stores designed to be energy-efficient. The store includes <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> lights throughout the store, including on the freezer doors, and an overhead light system that can be controlled by each department.|$|E
25|$|The Don's Edition {{features}} a more basic {{form of the}} gesture-based BlackHand control scheme seen in the Wii version. The game uses the SIXAXIS' <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> functionality in interrogations and, to a limited degree, during melee combat. As in the Wii, if the player wishes to lift someone from their knees, they simply pull the controller upwards. Swinging the controller {{from side to side}} swings the enemy likewise. Slamming someone against a wall is accomplished by pushing the controller away from the player. Unlike in the Wii version, however, where shooting and driving were handled using the Wii Remote, in The Don's Edition, shooting and driving are controlled using the analog sticks.|$|E

40|$|Smartwatches enable many novel {{applications}} and are fast gaining popularity. However, {{the presence of}} a diverse set of on-board sensors provides an additional attack surface to malicious software and services on these devices. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of key press inference attacks on handheld numeric touchpads by using smartwatch <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> as a side-channel. We consider different typing scenarios, and propose multiple attack approaches to exploit the characteristics of the observed wrist movements for inferring individual key presses. Experimental evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf smartwatches and smartphones show that key press inference using smartwatch <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> is not only fairly accurate, but also comparable with similar attacks using smartphone <b>motion</b> <b>sensors.</b> Additionally, hand movements captured by a combination of both smartwatch and smartphone <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> yields better inference accuracy than either device considered individually...|$|R

It {{also features a}} dedicated volume slider and a wireless switch, which turns on or off wireless communications. The touchscreen can be interacted with either the user's finger or a stylus bundled with the handheld. There is also a six-axis <b>motion</b> <b>sensor,</b> which includes a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. Through the Circle Pad Pro accessory the system has access to a second Circle Pad and trigger buttons (ZL, ZR).|$|E

Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 2.7 million apps published in 2017.

25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic video displays. The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E

25|$|The Wii U, the {{successor}} to the Wii, was released {{during the holiday season}} of 2012 worldwide. The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support high-definition graphics. The Wii U's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad, which features an embedded touchscreen. Each software title may be designed to utilize this touchscreen as being supplemental to the main TV, or as the only screen for Off-TV Play. The system supports most Wii controllers and accessories, and the more classically shaped Wii U Pro Controller. The system is backward compatible with Wii software and accessories; this mode also utilizes Wii-based controllers, and it optionally offers the GamePad as its primary Wii display and <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> bar. The console has various online services powered by Nintendo Network, including: the Nintendo eShop for online distribution of software and content; and Miiverse, a social network which can be variously integrated with games and applications. As of 31 March 2017, worldwide Wii U sales had totaled 12.80 million hardware units and 84.04 million software units.|$|E

There {{is no reason to}} suppose that the visual system contains <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> dedicated to the analysis of second-order motion. Current psychophysical and physio- logical data indicate that local <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are selective for orientation and spatial frequency but they do not eliminate any of the three main models—the Reichardt de- tector, the motion-energy filter, and gradient-based sensors. Both psychophysical and physiological data suggest that both broadly oriented and narrowly oriented <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are important in the early analysis of motion in two dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Lighting and {{ventilation}} {{represent the}} majority of the air conditioning loads in office buildings in hot humid climates. Use of <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> is one way to minimize the energy used for these loads. This paper describes the methods used for simulating a case study building with <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> installed and the monitoring of system on-off statistics related to occupant patterns. It also describes the development of the Monte Carlo model used to predict the on-off status of sensors. The building using the <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> is compared to a building that controls the lights and ventilators by a conventional pre-programmed schedule. The conventional methods of simulation were shown to generate misleading information regarding electric demand charges and life-cycle costs of the building. When comparing to actual use patterns, the Monte Carlo process was shown to represent an adequate way to represent the on-off patterns. Computer simulations further demonstrate the potential life cycle cost savings from the use of the <b>motion</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

[...] The games use the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control {{the actions of the}} on-screen ball pit. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat or bowling ball. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball {{consists of}} batting and pitching, with all of the fielding and baserunning handled by the Wii.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: To {{review the}} clinimetric quality of <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> {{used to assess}} {{physical}} activity in healthy children and adolescents (2 – 18 years). Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and SpycINFO. The clinimetric quality of two pedometers (Digi-Walker, Pedoboy), four one-dimensional accelerometers (LSI, Caltrac, Actiwatch, CSA/ActiGraph), and three three-dimensional accelerometers (Tritrac-R 3 D, RT 3, Tracmor 2) was evaluated and compared using a 20 -item checklist. Results: Overall, {{the quality of the}} studies (n = 35), and therefore the level of evidence for the reproducibility, validity, and feasibility of the <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> was modest (mean = 6. 4 ± 1. 6 out of 14 points). There was strong evidence for a good reproducibility of the Caltrac in adolescents (12 – 18 years), a poor reproducibility of the Digi-Walker in children (8 – 12 years), a good validity of the CSA/ActiGraph in children and adolescents (8 – 18 years), and a good validity of the Tritrac-R 3 D in children (8 – 12 years). Conclusions: The CSA/ActiGraph and the Caltrac are the only <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> in which the reproducibility, validity, and feasibility have been examined in different age groups. Further studies of the reproducibility of <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> in preschool children, improvement of the quality of clinimetric studies, and evaluation of the acceptability of <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are warranted...|$|R
