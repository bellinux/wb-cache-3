5|$|In Yao's {{first game}} in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an Asian {{cultural}} stereotype. Yao was not {{angry with the}} promotion {{because he was not}} familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had never seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> American invention.|$|E
5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> anti-Nazi hero.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns {{demands for}} Maggie to be arrested, {{but he is}} {{dismissed}} by Wiggum, who says no jury would convict a baby for a crime. Marge also adds the shooting <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely {{to know how to}} operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E

5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} {{references}} to Chapman earlier than his obituary notice but, given his age, he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> active player from c.1715 until possibly c.1740, presumably playing for Chertsey, or perhaps Croydon, and for Surrey as a county.|$|E

25|$|The unmoved mover {{argument}} asserts that, {{from our}} experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) {{we can see that}} there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another thing, so there must be an unmoved mover.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 15th/early 16th-century Middle Cornish play Beunans Ke, Arthur's sword is called Calesvol, which is {{etymologically}} an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh Caledfwlch. It is unclear if {{the name was}} borrowed from the Welsh (if so, it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> early loan, for phonological reasons), or represents an early, pan-Brittonic traditional name for Arthur's sword.|$|E

25|$|In {{ancient times}} the lower {{course of the}} Liffey is {{believed}} to have formed part of the boundary between the provinces, or overkingdoms, of Leinster and Mide (though there is some conflicting evidence which suggests that the boundary was actually marked by another river, the Tolka, which now discharges into Dublin Bay about a kilometre north of the Liffey). Áth Cliath, which belonged to Leinster, <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> important trading place thanks to its strategic location on this political boundary.|$|E
25|$|In 811 {{the monastery}} was {{devastated by the}} Vikings but the {{destruction}} was not permanent and the annals of the monastery continued to be recorded for several following centuries. After the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1179, Tallaght and its appurtenances were confirmed to the Diocese of Dublin and became {{the property of the}} Archbishop. The complete disappearance of every trace of what <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> extensive and well organised monastic settlement can only be accounted for by the subsequent history of the place, the erection and demolition of defensive walls and castles, and the incessant warfare and destruction that lasted for hundreds of years.|$|E

Once elected or appointed, a council member must continue to reside within his or her districts throughout their term.

25|$|A {{great deal}} of care has gone into the {{construction}} of the Kashivisvanatha Temple in Lakkundi, which deifies Shiva. This temple has a unique feature: a small Surya (Sun) shrine faces the main shrine on the west. There is a common platform between both, which <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> open mandapa originally. Hence, the Kashivisvanatha Temple has an entrance on the east side and south side of the mandapa. The entrance doorway and the towers are covered with close intricate carvings. The shikhara (dome) is in the North-Indian style and it looks like a lathe must have been used to make the complex circular pillars.|$|E
25|$|The stellar {{classification}} of Van Maanen 2 is DZ8, where the DZ prefix indicates {{the presence of}} elements heavier than helium in its spectrum—what astronomers term metals. Indeed, this star is the prototype for white dwarfs of this class. Based upon physical models of white dwarfs, elements with mass greater than helium should sink below the photosphere of the star, leaving only hydrogen and helium to be visible in the spectrum. Hence, for heavier elements to appear, there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> external source. It {{is unlikely that the}} heavy elements were obtained from the interstellar medium. Instead, the surface of the star was likely polluted by circumstellar material, such as by the remains of a rocky, terrestrial planet.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 1917, {{the palace}} was {{declared}} {{to be part}} of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family. This <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the private apartments as the most badly damaged area of the palace. The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.|$|E

25|$|As a general, Chares {{has been}} charged with rashness, {{especially}} in the needless exposure of his own person; this said he appears to have been, during the greater portion of his career, the best commander that Athens had. In politics, we see him connected throughout with Demosthenes. Morally he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> incubus on any party to which he attached himself, notwithstanding the assistance he might sometimes render it through the orators whom he is said to have kept constantly in pay. His alleged profligacy, which was measureless, he unblushingly avowed and gloried in, openly ridiculing the austere Phocion. His bad faith passed into a proverb; and his rapacity was extraordinary, even amidst the system then prevailing, when the citizens of Athens would neither fight their own battles nor pay the men who fought them, and her commanders had to support their mercenaries as best they could. His triumphal career under the banners of the republic may be seen as a symptom of the decline of Athens' values and power.|$|E

Under pressure from Washington and the Continental Congress, politicians worked to smooth over the incident while d'Estaing was in good spirits when Lafayette arrived in Boston. D'Estaing even offered to march troops overland to support the Americans: [...] "I offered to become a colonel of infantry, under the command of one who three years ago was a lawyer, and who certainly <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> uncomfortable man for his clients".|$|E

The function of this building after it was incorporated into Al-Adil's new walls, and thus after losing its defensive function, remains unclear as the archaeological analysis did not reveal any in situ material from which the building's use could be reconstructed.|$|E
