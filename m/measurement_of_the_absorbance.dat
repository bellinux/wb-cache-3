40|$|Accurate pH {{measurements}} in polar {{waters and}} sea ice brines require pH indicator dyes characterized at near-zero and below-zero temperatures and high salinities. We present experimentally determined {{physical and chemical}} characteristics of purified meta-Cresol Purple (mCP) pH indicator dye suitable for pH measurements in seawater and conservative seawater-derived brines at salinities (S) between 35 and 100 and temperatures (T) between their freezing point and 298. 15 [*]K (25 [*]°C). Within this temperature and salinity range, using purified mCP and a novel thermostated spectrophotometric device, the pH on the total scale (pHT) can be calculated from direct <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absorbance</b> ratio R <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dye in natural samples as pHT=−log(kT 2 e 2) +log(R−e 11 −Re 3 e 2) Based on the mCP characterization in these extended conditions, the temperature and salinity dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molar absorptivity ratios and −[*]log(kT 2 e 2) of purified mCP is described by the following functions: e 1 [*]=[*]− 0. 004363 [*]+[*] 3. 598 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 T, e 3 /e 2 [*]=[*]− 0. 016224 [*]+[*] 2. 42851 [*]×[*] 10 − 4 T[*]+[*] 5. 05663 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 (S[*]−[*] 35), and −[*]log(kT 2 e 2) = − 319. 8369 [*]+[*] 0. 688159 S − 0. 00018374 S 2 [*]+[*](10508. 724 [*]−[*] 32. 9599 [*]S[*]+[*] 0. 059082 S 2) T− 1 [*]+[*](55. 54253 [*]−[*] 0. 101639 [*]S) ln T[*]− 0. 08112151 T.

40|$|A {{screening}} method, {{which allows}} the simple and rapid determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flavanolic composition <b>of</b> plant and food extracts, has been developed. The method {{is based on a}} postcolumn chemical reaction with p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde with detection at 640 nm after HPLC separation and <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UV <b>absorbance</b> at 280 nm in a diode array detector. This approach allows one not only to obtain <b>the</b> flavanol profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples but also to characterize the compounds present in the chromatograms through their A 640 /A 280 absorbance ratio combined with the retention time and the UV spectrum. <b>The</b> advantages <b>of</b> this procedure are shown by applying it to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flavanol composition <b>of</b> some beverages, including red wine, beer, apple cider, and sour cherry and blackthorn fruit liqueurs.
