30|$|The Roman Baths {{appear to}} have {{extensive}} microbial mat communities submerged beneath the water surface, some with striking blue-green patches. There are also filamentous ‘hairy’ brown mats that grow around evolved gas bubbles. These eventually create gelatinous balloons-like structures that rise to the surface, anchored to the microbial mat below by filamentous ‘ropes’. A bright orange <b>muddy</b> <b>residue,</b> possibly caused by bacteria, detritus and iron hydroxide precipitates form a thick layer (~ 2 - 3 cm), between the mats and stone surfaces. In addition to iron, the spring water contains high concentrations of calcium, sulphate, sodium and chloride (Kellaway, 1991). There are also visible mineral deposits, which form dependant on water agitation, cooling and oxygenation (Kellaway, 1991). Water analyses of the Great Bath (GB) and Kings Bath (KB) show that the abiotic conditions in the baths have remained stable since records began in 1874 (see Additional file 1 : Table S 2, for full water analysis). The temperature of the Great Bath and Kings Bath were 39.0 °C and 45.0 °C respectively, measured 30 cm below the surface.|$|E
40|$|The spring squall of 1991 about {{political}} correctness on campus has passed, {{leaving behind a}} <b>muddy</b> <b>residue</b> in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s political rhetoric. Although the squall initially may have seemed to develop from a detached interest in campus developments, it rapidly {{became clear that the}} campaign against 2 ̆ 2 political correctness 2 ̆ 2 was this year 2 ̆ 7 s version of conservative concern about liberalism in the universities. The timely publication of Dinesh D 2 ̆ 7 Souza 2 ̆ 7 s Illiberal Education, and D 2 ̆ 7 Souza 2 ̆ 7 s understandable efforts to promote the book 2 ̆ 7 s sales by publishing op-ed articles and appearing on news programs, offered a continuing newshook for stories {{about political}} correctness. Conservatives took up the attack on political correctness, until it worked its way into President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s commencement speech at the University of Michigan. Predictably, the conservative appropriation of the attack on political correctness has obscured more than it has clarified. I intend this essay mostly to lay out precisely what ought to be at issue. Given the conservative domination of the discourse, much of what follows attempts to show how overblown or distorted the conservative characterization of the issue is. I draw upon my experience as an academic in a law school, and therefore focus on some incidents in the literature on political correctness that arose in law schools, although I will also bring in other incidents as appropriate...|$|E
