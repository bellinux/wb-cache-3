In the end, in 988 Ibn Killis prevailed upon al-Aziz to oust Bakjur, and an army was sent against the allies. The Fatimid commander, <b>Munis,</b> took Ramlah, but the Jarrahids withdrew north towards Damascus. <b>Munis</b> recruited the other Arab tribes, rivals of the Tayy, in his ranks, and in a battle at Dariya, near Damascus, his forces defeated the troops of Bakjur and Mufarrij. This forced Bakjur to relinquish his post on 29 October and retreat with his followers north to Raqqa on the Euphrates. Mufarrij and his men followed Bakjur, and in 989 are recorded as attacking yet another Hajj caravan in north Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), {{concentration and}} bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as <b>munis,</b> the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda.

According to the {{historian}} <b>Munis</b> Faruqui, Mu'azzam deliberately failed in his mission. In 1683, he was ordered by Aurangzeb to march to the Konkan region to prevent the still rebellious Akbar from fleeing the country, but again Mu'azzam's [...] "half-hearted" [...] mission failed to achieve the assigned goal. Nevertheless, the emperor still persisted in entrusting his son with responsibilities, and in 1687, Aurangzeb ordered Mu'azzam to march against the sultanate of Golconda. Within weeks, the emperor's spies intercepted treasonous messages exchanged between Mu'azzam and Abul Hasan, the ruler of Golconda. This was something {{which could not be}} mistaken for incompetence; it was clearly treason. Aurangzeb charged Mu'azzam with treason and imprisoned him; his harem was [...] "shipped off to faraway Delhi", and the ladies were also charged with treason. Mu'azzam's loyal servants were moved by his father into the imperial service, and the remaining servants were sacked. Aurangzeb forbade Mu'azzam to cut his nails or hair for six months, gave orders depriving him of [...] "good food or cold water." [...] He was not to meet anybody without his father's prior consent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transfers}} of Muni's was planned in mid-2006 by Mayor Thomas M. Menino. [...] This plan {{was met with}} heavy protest from the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association.

6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} of those ancient books that I have met with is the Laws of Menu. According to Sir William Jones, [...] "Vyasa, the son of Parasara, has decided that the Veda, with its Angas, or the six compositions deduced from it, the revealed system of medicine, the Puranas or sacred histories, and the code of Menu, were four works of supreme authority, which ought never to be shaken by arguments merely human." [...] The last is believed by the Hindoos [...] "to have been promulged {{in the beginning of}} time, by Menu, son or grandson of Brahma," [...] and [...] "first of created beings"; and Brahma is said to have [...] "taught his laws to Menu in a hundred thousand verses, which Menu explained to the primitive world in the very words of the book now translated." [...] Others affirm that they have undergone successive abridgments for the convenience of mortals, [...] "while the gods of the lower heaven and the band of celestial musicians are engaged in studying the primary code."--"A number of glosses or comments on Menu were composed by the <b>Munis,</b> or old philosophers, whose treatises, together with that before us, constitute the Dherma Sastra, in a collective sense, or Body of Law." [...] Culluca Bhatta was one of the more modern of these.|$|E
50|$|Muniandi is a {{regional}} Tamil guardian deity. The deity Muniandi {{refers to the}} <b>Munis</b> worshipped by the Tamil people. Muni refers to a class of guardian deities which are classified as Siva Gana. They are servants of the Supreme God Siva and his female half Sakthi. The <b>Munis</b> could refer to former warriors, kings or sages who achieved {{the status of a}} Muni after their human death. Some of the <b>Munis</b> worshipped were created as <b>Munis</b> and did not go through the human life cycle.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} on {{the origins of}} these <b>Munis.</b> There are also mythological stories passed down orally for generations. According to one of the oldest oral tradition, the <b>Munis</b> were created to protect Goddess Sakthi in the form of Goddess Pachaiamman against 7 Arakar Veerars (Demonic Warriors - Asuras). Various Pachaiamman temples in Tamil Nadu, India has statues for these <b>Munis.</b>|$|E
50|$|These <b>Munis,</b> their {{lifestyle}} and spiritual pursuit, likely influenced the Sannyasa concept, {{as well as}} the ideas behind the ancient concept of Brahmacharya (bachelor student). One class of <b>Munis</b> were associated with Rudra. Another were Vratyas.|$|E
50|$|The deity is also popular {{amongst the}} Tamil {{diaspora}} outside Tamil Nadu. In Malaysia, Muniandi worship {{was started by}} Tamil migrants who had the <b>Munis</b> as their Kula Deivam. The family temples which {{were built in the}} estates and villages later turned into public temples. Eventually, more people started worshipping these <b>Munis</b> and it became popularised. Most modern day Malaysian or even Singaporean Hindus are hereditary worshippers of these <b>Munis.</b> Moreover, they have accepted this deity as one of the main deities of worship.|$|E
50|$|<b>Munis</b> wrote many {{articles}} and books in his life, {{the best known}} being A Second Communist Manifesto {{and a history of}} the Spanish Civil War, which remains untranslated into English. <b>Munis</b> is considered to have become a left communist following his break with the Fourth International.|$|E

50|$|After the war <b>Munis</b> {{settled in}} Paris and began {{publishing}} a new periodical Revoluciòn, which proclaimed its official {{break with the}} Fourth International in November 1948. By 1949 his following was calling itself the Grupo Comunista Internacionalista de España. In 1951 <b>Munis</b> and J. Costa returned to Spain to organize an underground movement {{in the wake of}} the Barcelona tramway strike. They were unsuccessful and arrested by the Francoist authorities in 1952 and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. <b>Munis</b> was released in 1957 and returned to Paris, where he began publishing a new organ, Alarma. With the relaxation of the Francoist regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the <b>Munis</b> group was able to establish a small following within Spain, though <b>Munis</b> himself continued to live in France. By the time of Franco's death, in the mid-1970s this group numbered about 50 people. However, differences between the exiles in Paris and the younger personnel in Barcelona precipitated a purge by the exiles of the Spanish group until there were only two or three members left in 1983.|$|E
