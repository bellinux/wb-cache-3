5|$|Its North American {{distribution}} {{encompasses a}} range extending north from North Carolina to Florida, west to Texas and south to <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America. In 2008, {{it was reported}} {{for the first time}} in the Upper Potaro and Upper Ireng River Basins in Guyana. It has also been collected from New Zealand, Asia (including China, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan), and possibly Australia.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have {{found evidence of}} domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Chalciporus piperatus occur singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground. The fungus occurs {{naturally}} in or near coniferous or beech and oak woodlands, often on sandy soils. Fruit bodies appear in Europe in late summer and autumn from August to November. The fungus is widespread across North America, fruiting from July to October in the eastern states and from September to January on the Pacific Coast. It is found in <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America. In Asia, it has been collected from Pakistan, West Bengal (India), and Guangdong Province (China). In South Africa, it is known from the southwestern Cape Province and the eastern Transvaal Province.|$|E

5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} {{long-lasting}} upper-level low persisted across <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America. On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua. It {{moved around the}} upper-level low, bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America. The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, moving over western Cuba as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm on May 31. Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1, when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is known}} from eastern Canada, south to Florida and west to Minnesota in the United States, and into <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America. Its European {{distribution}} is widespread; it is relatively common in many regions, but rare or almost absent in others. In Asia, it has been recorded from the vicinity of Dashkin in the Astore District of northern Pakistan, and as far east as China, {{where it has been}} recorded from Hebei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, and Korea.|$|E
5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E

5|$|The current naming scheme {{began with}} the 1978 season, one year before the Atlantic basin (and which anomalously used the list {{that will be used}} next in 2018, rather than the one for 2020). As with the Atlantic basin, it uses {{alternating}} women's and men's names, and also includes some Spanish and a few French names. Before then, only women's names were used. Because Eastern Pacific hurricanes mainly threaten western <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America, the lists contain more Spanish names than the Atlantic lists.|$|E
5|$|The first twelve {{seasons of}} Degrassi: The Next Generation have been {{released}} on DVD. The box sets are released in Canada by Alliance Home Entertainment. In the United States, FUNimation Entertainment released the first six seasons and Echo Bridge Entertainment released seasons seven through twelve. Each season boxset includes extra features such as pictures, karaoke sessions, audition tapes, bloopers, deleted scenes and more. In Australia, seasons 1 to 4 were released by Umbrella Entertainment in 2010 and 2011. These DVDs are compatible with the region 4 code, which is in use in Australia, New Zealand, Oceania, <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> and South America.|$|E
5|$|Several storms made {{landfall}} {{or directly}} affected land. Hurricanes Dean and Felix made landfall at Category5 intensity, causing severe damage {{in parts of}} <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America, respectively. Both storm names, as well as Noel, {{the name of a}} hurricane that affected the Caribbean, were retired from the naming list of Atlantic hurricanes. The United States was affected by five cyclones, although the storms were generally weak; three tropical depressions and only two tropical storms, Barry and Gabrielle, and one hurricane, Humberto, made landfall in the country. Elsewhere, three storms directly affected Canada, although none severely. The combined storms killed at least 423people and caused about $3billion (2007USD, $ USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|Stan was {{associated}} with a large area of loosely organized but very heavy shower activity existing over <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America during this time. Torrential rainfall in this area caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides which were responsible for at least 1,662 deaths in six countries; 1,500 of these casualties occurred in Guatemala alone. Initially, more than a thousand deaths were attributed to Hurricane Stan, but the National Hurricane Center postulates that all but less than 100 of the deaths were more related to the larger weather event. This was not definitively confirmed in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Stan, though it is certain that only 80-100 deaths resulted from the direct effects of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is {{a species}} of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south {{through most of the}} coastal New World tropics. This {{particular}} ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black wing tips that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was once}} widely {{believed}} that coyotes are recent immigrants to southern <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> America, aided in their expansion by deforestation, Pleistocene and Early Holocene records, as well as records from the pre-Columbian period and early European colonization show that the animal was present in the area long before modern times. Nevertheless, range expansion did occur south of Costa Rica during the late 1970s and northern Panama in the early 1980s, following the expansion of cattle-grazing lands into tropical rainforests. The coyote is predicted to appear in northern Belize in the near future, as the habitat there is favorable to the species. Concerns have been raised of a possible expansion into South America through the Panamanian Isthmus, should the Darién Gap ever be closed by the Pan-American Highway. This fear was partially confirmed in January 2013, when the species was recorded in eastern Panama's Chepo District, beyond the Panama Canal.|$|E
