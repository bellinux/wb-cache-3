25|$|The {{concept of}} torque, also called <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> couple, {{originated}} with {{the studies of}} Archimedes on levers. The term torque was apparently introduced into English scientific literature by James Thomson, the brother of Lord Kelvin, in 1884.|$|E

Whether intending to shoot at that <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> to club Reid aside is uncertain. Reid raised his left arm to block the fast-approaching barrel. It struck and cut his arm, {{but he managed to}} grab the barrel and yank it away from the general direction of his head and press it downward. The Daily Alaskan wrote that Reid grabbed the rifle barrel without being cut, but that during the scuffle, Smith pulled it free and hit Reid’s arm as he swung the rifle at Reid again.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{tetrapods}} with limbs, plesiosaurs {{must have}} had a certain gait, a coordinated movement pattern of the, in this case, flippers. Of the infinite number of possibilities, in practice attention has been largely directed {{to the question of whether}} the front pair and hind pair moved simultaneously, so that all four flippers were engaged at the same <b>moment,</b> <b>or</b> in an alternate pattern, each pair being employed in turn. Frey & Riess in 1991 proposed an alternate model, which would have had the advantage of a more continuous propulsion. In 2000, Theagarten Lingham-Soliar evaded the question by concluding that, like sea turtles, plesiosaurs only used the front pair for a powered stroke. The hind pair would have been merely used for steering. Lingham-Soliar deduced this from the form of the hip joint, which would have allowed for only a limited vertical movement. Furthermore, a separation of the propulsion and steering function would have facilitated the general coordination of the body and prevented a too extreme pitch. He rejected Robinson's hypothesis that elastic energy was stored in the ribcage, considering the ribs too stiff for this.|$|E

40|$|On one hand, {{eliciting}} subjective probabilities (fractiles) is {{a well-established}} procedure. On the other hand, {{knowledge of a}} subjective variable's central <b>moments</b> <b>or</b> distribution function is often assumed. However, the problem of converting elicited fractiles into the required <b>moments</b> <b>or</b> distribution function has been largely ignored. We show that this conversion problem is far from trivial, and that {{the most commonly used}} conversion procedures often produce huge errors. Alternative procedures are proposed; the `Tocher's curve' and `linear function of fractiles' methods are shown to be much more accurate than the commonly used procedures. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
500|$|Since {{an atomic}} nucleus {{consists}} of a bound state of protons and neutrons, the magnetic moments of the nucleons contribute to the nuclear magnetic <b>moment,</b> <b>or</b> the magnetic moment for the nucleus as a whole. [...] The nuclear magnetic moment also includes contributions from the orbital motion of the nucleons. [...] The deuteron has the simplest example of a nuclear magnetic moment, with measured value 0.857µN. [...] This value is within 3% of {{the sum of the}} moments of the proton and neutron, which gives 0.879µN. In this calculation, the spins of the nucleons are aligned, but their magnetic moments offset because of the neutron's negative magnetic moment.|$|E

He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that [...] "whether it's a quiet <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> in action, we [...] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters." [...] A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all." ...|$|E

500|$|Around 1895, {{football}} {{was introduced in}} the Philippines by English sportsmen. [...] In addition, some Filipinos sent to college in Hong Kong and China returned home and taught their friends {{a little bit about the}} game of football. [...] Within a year, there were two or three football clubs established in Manila. In 1898, the U.S. Navy battleship Maine was anchored in Havana harbor to protect the Americans from a riot between Cuba and Spanish officers, and after the ship sank resulting in significant casualties, the Americans declared war against Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War. They damaged every ship in Manila Bay, This ended Spanish colonization of the Philippines, and replaced the colonizing Spaniards with Americans. When the war broke out, those football teams disbanded and abandoned the city, either to save themselves and their families from the bombardment they expected at any <b>moment,</b> <b>or</b> to cast their lot with the Filipino troops outside the city limits. After the war when peace reigned again, six football teams were formed, among them the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, and the Manila Jockey Club. In 1906, the Sandow football team was established (further developed as Sandow Athletic Club in 1909).|$|E

[...] A delegation of eight, led by Antônio Carlos de Andrada carrying this declaration, proceeded to the Imperial Palace of São Cristóvão to ask if Pedro II would accept or reject the early declaration of his majority. Pedro II asked for the opinion of Itanhaém, Friar Pedro Mariana and Araújo Viana (pawns of the [...] "Courtier Faction"), who convinced him to accept and thus prevent new disorders in the country. The emperor would say years later that the Liberals had taken advantage of his immaturity and inexperience.

Variety magazine's Justin Chang thought that Blitz displayed a [...] "terrific ability to embrace people's idiosyncrasies, real or fictitious" [...] and called the cast a [...] "strong ensemble", commending Thompson, Kendrick and D'Agosto in particular.
