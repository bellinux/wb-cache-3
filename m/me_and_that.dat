5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was budgeted at US$3 million, {{slightly}} more than the US$2–2.5 million budgeted in typical Mad Men episodes. The pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where principal photography lasted for two days. Most of the production crew were previously part of The Sopranos. After filming concluded in New York, production moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from the one in New York. According to Abraham, Los Angeles contained a continuity that {{was related to the}} show.

She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>that</b> is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E
500|$|For years Wałęsa vehemently denied {{collaborating with}} the {{communist}} secret police and dismissed the incriminating files as forgeries created by the SB to compromise him. Wałęsa also denies that during his presidency he removed documents incriminating him from the archives. Until 2008 he denied having ever seen his secret police file. After {{the publication of the}} book SB a Lech Wałęsa in 2008, he said that while he was president [...] "I did borrow the file, but didn't remove anything from it. I saw there were some documents there about <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they were clearly forgeries. I told my secretaries to tape up and seal the file. I wrote 'don't open' on it. But someone didn't obey, removed the papers, now casting suspicion on me."

500|$|Joel Torre, who portrays Mario [...] "Tatang" [...] Maghari in the film, {{had already}} been cast before Matti's script revision; Angel Aquino plays his wife Lulette and Empress Schuck portrays his {{daughter}} Tina.

[...] Matti asked Piolo Pascual {{to play the role of}} Attorney Francis Coronel Jr; Shaina Magdayao plays his wife Nicky and Michael de Mesa portrays his father-in-law Congressman Manrique. The role of Daniel was originally written for John Lloyd Cruz, who was interested but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts; it went instead to Gerald Anderson. After a discussion between Pascual and Anderson about the film, Anderson signed on for the role. Anderson had only two weeks to film his scenes as he was occupied with a soap opera shoot at the time. Dawn Jimenez appeared in her acting debut as Anderson's girlfriend Diane.|$|E

Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design....

500|$|In April 2008, Samson {{became a}} {{political}} correspondent on Fox News Channel's late-night talk show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. She had made several previous appearances on the show, and in 2007 had endorsed New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's Republican presidential candidacy. September 2008 saw {{the unveiling of}} her debut album, Possession, and her first single, a title track co-written by Samson during the breakup of her marriage. Commenting {{on the theme of}} the song, she said, [...] "People see me nude and having sex and think they know <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I'm available, but I'm no more available than Angelina Jolie". Later in the month, she had a cameo role on The Daily Show, in which she portrayed CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric in a commercial for a fictional action-adventure show. In the appearance, Samson asks Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones, [...] "Hey, Jones, you really think you've got the balls for that story?" [...] She began writing a sex-advice column for the adult entertainment site XCritic.com in June 2009, having previously written such columns for Men’s Fitness magazine and AdultFriendFinder.com.

500|$|... "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock, {{piano and}} power ballad, {{inspired}} by Lee's love for Evanescence and personal reflection on her past struggles. She revealed that after deciding {{to take a}} break, she {{spent a lot of}} time with her husband and having a simpler life away from her band, but still feeling like she was not [...] "whole". Instead, she felt lost and missed her work with the band and the writing process. Later, she decided to write the song as an apology to her fans for being gone for so long. Starting with piano and Lee's vocals, the song slowly builds, [...] "layering on stirring strings, booming timpani and, at the climax, some thunderous guitar chords" [...] as stated by James Montgomery of MTV News. He further stated that the song had similarities with the song [...] "Jóga" [...] (1997) by Icelandic recording artist Björk which Lee confirmed by saying, [...] "That's a big inspirational song for me. That's a song through my life that I've listened to a whole bunch. And to me, Björk, what makes her style are the strings, the orchestral elements, and that passion that it creates. ... It makes your heart pour out. That totally inspired <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> song inspired me."

500|$|Davey's debut album, Something Ilk, was {{recorded}} at {{a studio in}} Wales, produced by Ben Hillier whose previous credits included Blur and Elbow, and released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "high on presence and very low on filler" [...] and gave it three out of five stars. Hot Press remarked, [...] "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached". The Irish Independents Paul Byrne described it as [...] "one of the best Irish albums of 2004". Davey performed a nationwide tour in September 2004. She also supported Graham Coxon and Supergrass during tours they undertook that year. The singer later dismissed Something Ilk, saying [...] "I think the record company [...] thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> album is very much other people's idea of what I should sound like. [...] I didn't have the confidence {{to say no to}} some of the things [...] suggested". Davey claimed not to [...] "know my arse from my elbow when I signed for them" [...] and did not like performing those songs in a live arena. Despite this, the Irish Independent described her as [...] "very talented—far more so than [...] Hayes" [...] but regretted that she had [...] "failed to find an audience for her fine debut Something Ilk".|$|E
500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> was death." ...|$|E

500|$|On 14 May, with Estádio da Luz nearly sold-out, Benfica {{received}} Sporting for a title-deciding Lisbon Derby. The high-pressure {{match was}} unlocked in the 83rd minute when Luisão jumped higher than Ricardo and {{headed in the}} winning goal. Trapattoni tried to calm excess confidence by saying Benfica still had not won the league title. Two days after the game, in an interview to Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport, Trapattoni announced his intention to leave Benfica {{at the end of}} the season and return to Italy. On 22 May, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bessa to face Boavista, needing just one point to win the title. Benfica scored the opening goal with a penalty from Simão. Boavista equalized minutes later but the score remained drawn, ensuring the title for Benfica, their first in ten years and 31st overall. Trapattoni said, [...] "Winning is always hard. This title was amazing and one of the most important of my career. It was won in a new culture for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> makes it even better." [...] In the last game of the season, the 2005 Taça de Portugal Final, Benfica's Simão opened the scoring but allowed Vitória de Setúbal to score twice, losing Benfica their ninth tournament final. The loss also prevented a double for Benfica; it would have been their first since 1987. Two days after the defeat, Trapattoni confirmed he was leaving Benfica for personal reasons, ending his one-year tenure in Portugal.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E
500|$|In 1813, {{with the}} tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously {{consider}} the question of Charlotte's marriage. [...] The Prince Regent and his advisors decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. [...] Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself {{and many of the}} guests. [...] Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers. [...] Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. [...] According to Charlotte, [...] "He spoke as if he had the most improper ideas of my inclinations. [...] I see that he is compleatly [...] poisoned against <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he will never come round." [...] She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry [...] "the Orange or the Cheese" [...] (a reference to Gloucester cheese), [...] "Slender Billy" [...] or [...] "Silly Billy". [...] The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that [...] "I could not quit this country, as Queen of England still less" [...] and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to [...] "visit his frogs solo". [...] However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. [...] She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.|$|E
