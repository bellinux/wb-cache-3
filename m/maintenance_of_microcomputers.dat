This study investigated the perceptions of nursing deans concerning the level <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> literacy currently expected of students in baccalaureate nursing programs. The deans identified in this study represent baccalaureate nursing programs accredited by the National League of Nursing (NLN). This study also identified deans' plans for future implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills for their baccalaureate nursing programs. A questionnaire was mailed to all 398 listed deans of NLN accredited baccalaureate nursing programs throughout the United States. Of those distributed, 295 (74. 1 % return rate) were completed, returned, and identified as usable questionnaires. Part I of the questionnaire consisted of 10 items requesting demographic data. Part II of the questionnaire requested participants to indicate the level <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills currently expected of their students and the level of future implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> instruction being planned for their nursing programs. Frequencies, percentages and medians were tabulated. The chi square goodness of fit, Spearman rho, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to test hypotheses. Conclusions based on the findings of the study were as follows: (1) deans of baccalaureate nursing programs currently expected low levels <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills for students; (2) they are planning more implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills for the future; (3) the proportion of nursing faculty with microcomputer skills was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills currently expected and the plans for future implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> instruction; (4) the number <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> available was significantly related to the level of microcompter knowledge and skills currently expected and the plans for future implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> instruction; (5) the number of software packages available was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills currently expected; (6) the presence of a faculty member responsible for coordinating microcomputer instruction was significantly related to the level <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> knowledge and skills currently expected...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The burgeoning {{interest}} in the use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> {{in the education of}} special needs students raises a number of new issues for program administrators. Reactions of special education administrators to microcomputer technology in terms of the development of policies and practices governing adoption and use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> were investigated. A repre-sentative sample of special education administrators in a 4 -county area in Southern California responded to a comprehensive survey dealing with several aspects <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> tech-nology. Levels <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> varied widely across districts. with half the sample reporting no special education ownership of microcqmputers while others had acquired a number of machines. Decision-making policies and practices indicated high levels of cooperation between special and regular education programs in acquiring hardware and software and in providing teacher training. Implications for subsequent directions for microcom-puter innovation are discussed. In particular. training efforts for special education personnel need to become more specific to the instructional uses <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> with special needs students. SUSANR.

40|$|The civil {{engineering}} industry generally regards new methods and technology {{with a high}} amount of scepticism, preferring to use traditional and trusted methods. During the 1980 s competition for {{civil engineering}} consultancy {{work in the world}} has become fierce. Halcrow recognised the need to maintain and improve their competitive edge over other consultants. The use of new technology in the form <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> was seen to be one method to maintain and improve their repuation in the world. This thesis examines the role <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> in civil engineering consultancy with particular reference to overseas projects. The involvement of civil engineers with computers, both past and present, has been investigated and a survey of the use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> by consultancies was carried out, the results are presented and analysed. A resume of the state-of-the-art <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> technology was made. Various case studies were carried out in order to examine the feasibility <b>of</b> using <b>microcomputers</b> on overseas projects. One case study involved the examination of two projects in Bangladesh and is used to illustrate the requirements and problems encountered in such situations. Two programming applications were undertaken, a dynamic programming model of a single site reservoir and the simulation of the Bangladesh gas grid system. A cost-benefit analysis of a water resources project using microcomputers in the Aguan Valley, Honduras was carried out. Although the initial cost <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> is often small, the overall costs can prove to be very high and are likely to exceed the costs of traditional computer methods. A planned approach for the use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> is essential in order to reap the expected benefits and recommendations for the implementation of such an approach are presented...|$|R

The problem investigated in this study was: What is the current status <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> curricular use in selected Illinois elementary and secondary schools? The following research questions were examined: What types <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> instructional applications are in use? at what grade levels? in what subject areas? with what courseware sources? with what time dimensions of use by students and teachers? and with what types of students (e. g., gifted, regular, special education) ?A questionnaire was mailed to elementary and secondary teachers in Illinois who were known to be instructional users <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers.</b> Questions were designed to examine microcomputer applications utilized for instructional purposes. Each of the instructional applications was cross-tabulated with grade level, subject area, courseware sources, time dimensions of use, and types of students. As a result of the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) Elementary and secondary teachers used microcomputers to teach microcomputer operations, but were planning future use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> for tutor and drill modes of learning. (2) Current use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> was concentrated at high school grade levels, although current use at the intermediate and junior high school grade levels was almost as substantial as reported for grades 9 - 10. (3) Arithmetic/mathematics was reported as the predominant subject area where microcomputers were currently used. Language arts and spelling held the next highest ranking. (4) Teachers were most likely to use their own programming as a courseware source, followed by using courseware from a hardware vendor.

This study culminated in the use of a modification of the Negotiated Order of Withdrawal (NOW) interest-bearing checking accounts interview schedule developed by Nord and Tucker. Interviews were conducted at five separate sites in a selected school district using this schedule. After analysis of the written and recorded data, case studies of the process <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputer</b> use were developed for each site. The case studies were analyzed for similarities and differences pertaining to the research questions. The stages reached and/or completed in the composite change model at each site were identified. ^ It was found that the adoption of a change model is advantageous in the process of implementation of the use <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> in educational administration in a school district. The development of a formal coordinated plan for the administrative uses <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> should have a high priority. The assessment <b>of</b> needs for <b>microcomputer</b> use, the planning of necessary staff training and the evaluation of progress of implementation should be developed from the district plan for the implementation process to be successful. ^ The process <b>of</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>microcomputers</b> in administration in the school district studied has valuable lessons for similar implementations in other school districts. A list of recommendations is given, the most significant of which is that a change model such as the composite change model should be followed.
