40|$|Abstract only. In the {{standard}} economic approach to optimal allocation, aggregate economic benefit is maximised where the sustainable harvest is allocated so that <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefits</b> are equal. The model assumes a known sustainable harvest. It also assumes optimal intrasectoral allocation in each sector. The Western Australian West Coast demersal fishery, like many fisheries, {{is based on}} a common fish stock exploited by both commercial and recreational fishers. A multispecies fishery, it includes prize species such as dhufish and pink snapper that are iconic for recreational fishers and highly regarded commercial table fish. Recent stock assessments have concluded that stocks are under threat and significant restrictions have been placed on both commercial and recreational fishers. The management framework must now deal simultaneously with reducing aggregate harvests and achieving optimal allocation. This paper applies the economic model of optimal allocation to establish a benchmark allocation for the iconic species baldchin groper, pink snapper and dhufish, using survey based estimates of the marginal economic surplus from commercial and recreational fishing. Current restrictions are evaluated against this benchmark economic optimum to determine how well they align with the model and what adjustments might be appropriate. Empirical lessons based on data collected from commercial and recreational fishers in the fishery are used to also consider whether the basic economic model of allocation is itself in need of refinement to deal with the current circumstances, in particular the changes in recreational fishing behaviour that might involve switching effort to the less constrained non iconic species...|$|R

The cost-benefit analysis was done in three separate scenarios, where each scenario included different variables. This was done in order to see which impact each of the variables had, and in turn evaluate the policy measures and results based on this. With the assumption that an electric vehicle has a lifetime of 14 years and an annual driving distance of 13. 000, the marginal socioeconomic net present value was estimated to be 262. 956 NOK for choosing an electric vehicle instead of a conventional vehicle, given today´s policy measures throughout the lifetime.

A two years field experiment {{was performed to}} estimate interference of T. portulacastrum and C. rotundus and to evaluate the role of allelopathic water extracts for effective weed management in maize. Five plant water extracts in ten binary combinations were foliar applied in triplicated randomized complete block design. Plots treated with commercial herbicide atrazine and weedy check (control), were also maintained for comparison. The highest density of both weed species was observed at 45 days after sowing (DAS) while weed dry biomass was higher at 60 DAS. Binary combination of sorghum-sunflower depicted greater suppression for weed density, dry biomass and persistence index (88 - 92 % for T. portulacastrum and 65 - 81 % for C. rotundus) as compared with weedy check. This treatment combination has also recorded an enhancement of 125 % in crop resistance index, 84 % in leaf area index and 41 % in crop growth rate at 60 - 75 DAS thus, leading to 51 % improvement in grain yield.

40|$|For {{the past}} 30 years, the {{conventional}} wisdom has been that executive compensation packages should include very large proportions of incentive pay. This incentive pay orthodoxy has become so firmly entrenched that the current debates about executive compensation simply {{take it as a}} given. We argue, however, that in light of evolving corporate governance mechanisms, the <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefit</b> of incentive-laden pay packages is both smaller than appreciated and getting smaller over time. As a result, the assumption that higher proportions of incentive pay are beneficial is no longer warranted. A number of corporate governance mechanisms have evolved to duplicate incentive pay’s positive incentive effects, thereby reducing its marginal benefit. Most significantly, a newly robust CEO labor market has made incentive pay largely redundant in focusing CEO attention on stock prices. In addition, while the marginal benefit of incentive pay has been overstated, its costs are significant and often overlooked. As a result, we believe that the net overall effect of incentive pay on shareholder wealth is now either minimally positive or even negative. We also argue that, given the strength of the corporate governance mechanisms discussed in the Article, attempts to improve company performance by “fixing” incentive pay structures are unlikely to succeed. Nevertheless, the trend towards greater and greater incentive pay continues unabated. This resiliency, however, is not surprising even in a competitive market. In the past,the incentive pay orthodoxy was justified because the corporate governance mechanisms were not as robust. Incentive-laden contracts therefore became the key marker for “good governance” in the compensation context. In addition to the stickiness of that status quo, incentive pay’s staying power has been supported by private interests who benefit from the conventional view of its efficacy. As a result of the incentive pay orthodoxy, executives receive greater pay, boards bear less responsibility for that pay, and compensation consultants and experts garner more attention. On the other hand, there is no constituency with a significant incentive to soberly assess the benefit of incentive pay that is not afflicted with informational disadvantages or collective action problems...|$|E

Because of high machinery costs, variable profit margins, and increasing competition, agribusiness managers continually seek methods to maintain profitability and manage risk. One relatively new method is jointly owning and sharing machinery. Contract design issues to enhance horizontal linkages between firms through machinery sharing are addressed. Specifically, costs and depreciation sharing between two firms entering into a joint machinery ownership contract are examined. Two, two-player models, a Nash equilibrium game theoretical model and an applied two-farm simulation model are used to determine impacts of machinery sharing on firms engaged in machinery sharing. The Nash equilibrium model determines theoretical optimal sharing rules for two generic firms. Using the Nash equilibrium model as the basis, the two-farm simulation model provides more specific insights into joint harvest machinery sharing. Both models include contractual components that are uniquely associated with machinery sharing. Contractual components include penalty payment structure for untimely machinery delivery and the percentages of shared costs paid and depreciation claimed paid by each firm. Harvesting windows for each farm and yield reductions associated with untimely machinery delivery are accounted for within the models. Machinery sharing can increase the NPV of after tax cash flows and potentially reduce risk. Sharing will, however, not occur if own marginal transaction costs and/or marginal penalty costs associated with untimely machinery delivery are too large. Further, if the marginal costs of sharing are small relative to own <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefits,</b> sharing will not occur. There are potential tradeoffs between the percentage of shared costs paid and the percentage of shared depreciation claimed depending on each farms? specific tax deductions. Harvesting window overlaps help determine the viability of machinery sharing. Farms may be better off sharing larger, more efficient machinery than using smaller machinery even when harvest must be delayed. Percentages of shared costs, depreciation, and tax deductions have important tax implications that impact the after tax cash flows and should be considered when negotiating machinery sharing contracts...|$|R

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the School of Technology University of Wolverhampton in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe deficiency of sub-Saharan Africa urban land use planning regimes has received extensive discussion in the literature. As yet, little is known of the extent and magnitude of {{the economic impact of}} these planning regimes on the economic wellbeing of individuals and the society. This situation is further compounded by the lack of simplified and bespoke methodologies for calibrating economic impacts of planning policies even in the developed world where there are relatively huge volumes of organised data. This study aims to prescribe a simplified quantitative methodology, which is subsequently employed to gauge the economic impacts of these regimes. It proceeds on the central argument that planning regimes in the sub-region are weak with low compliance with planning regulations, partly because they do not provide incentives for property owners/developers/land users. The study adopts a cross-sectional survey strategywith questionnaires and administrative data extraction to procure the requisite data from Accra, Ghana to feed the devised methodological framework. The study establishes that Ghana’s urban land use planning regime, in its current form, imposes huge cost on residential property owners compared to its benefits; it creates a disincentive for property owners. A substantial amount of this cost emanates from pipe-borne water, and tarred roads and concrete drain infrastructural facilities. It is further established that the cost of title formalisation requirement constitutes a huge portion of the cost on express requirements under the planning regime. A major portion of this cost results from the cost other than official fees. However, on individual basis the requirement generates <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefit.</b> Incidental costs for the other express requirements, architectural design and building permit are also substantial. In terms of benefits, tarred roads and concrete drains, formalised title, electricity and pipe-borne water, individually, are found to generate the most benefits under the planning regime.

These include formulation of planning policies on the basis of providing incentives to property owners/developer/land users, strategies for reduction of infrastructural and amenities costs, as well as incidental cost relating to compliance with the subject planning regime express requirements...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model that {{is capable of}} explaining the existence of sustainable common pool resource equilibria in the absence of external regulation. We combine ideas from the literature on social norms in an iterative game theory framework to establish the existence of multiple sustainable common pool equilibria. Summary: Consider a highly stylized common pool resource (CPR) allocation problem where individual agents have the opportunity to comply or defect from some benchmark behavior. For example, a recreational boater can choose to dispose of trash overboard or haul the trash to shore, or perhaps a polluting firm can choose to meet or exceed a governmental standard for emissions. Traditional neo-classical models of common pool resource allocations predict that rational self-interested agents will tend to over-exploit the CPR in the absence of external regulation. A number of recent studies have documented the existence of common pool resource outcomes that contradict this commonly held belief. In recent years, social norms have been gained much attention from the economists as an important driving force of individual behavior. A number of studies on the management of common pool resources (CPR) through endogenous institutions have argued for the importance of social norms in maintaining efficient, sustainable allocations in the absence of external regulation (Ostrom (1992), Bromley (1992), Baland and Platteau (1996)). Despite the empirical documentation of potentially sustainable outcomes, theoretical explanations remain in their infancy. Since Hardin's(1968) seminal work on the 'tragedy of the commons', a number of models based on neo-classical economics have tried to explain the existence of common pool resource equilibria consisting of partial compliance or defection (Sethi and Somanathan (1996), Haab and McConnell (2002)). Of particular interest, evolutionary models of compliance, which incorporate the behavioral outcomes of others into individual decision making, have proven popular in explaining collective behavior problems associated with sustainable CPR outcomes. However, these evolutionary models fail to incorporate two commonly observed characteristics of common pool resource decision environments: partial compliance equilibria and costly sanctioning behavior. Haab and McConnell (2002) develop a rudimentary evolutionary model of compliance behavior and show that heterogeneous distributions of compliance costs across a population can result in a less than full compliance equilibrium. The model of Haab and McConnell ignores the possibility of endogenous sanctioning of deviant behavior. Other evolutionary models of common pool behavior assume altruistic motives for sanctioning or costless sanctioning. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a theoretical explanation for partial compliance equilibria in a common pool resource allocation problem with and without endogenous sanctioning behavior. First, the theoretical possibility of partial compliance equilibrium with exogenous sanctioning behavior and fully observable agent behavior, is presented. Next we introduce uncertainty into the model through the incomplete observation of agent behavior to examine why some agents willingly commit costly sanctioning behaviors. We show that even in the presence of costly, endogenous sanctioning, multiple CPR equilibria exist, including a stable partial compliance equilibrium. Finally, we compare the resulting CPR equilibria to determine the socially efficient outcome, and compare the costs of various policies of achieving such outcomes. An Overview of the Model and Outcomes: Reconsider the stylized CPR problem where individual decision agents can choose to undertake some behavior or not (a binary decision). Assume there are two types of agents: defectors and compliers. Further, compliers can be divided into sub-samples of sheer compliers and enforcers. Defectors do not follow the socially accepted norm and can be punished (sanctioned) by compliers when detected. Sheer compliers follow the social norm but pay a compliance cost (e. g. time value of waste disposal). Enforcers, a subset of compliers, willingly sanction defectors but pay a sanctioning cost (e. g. monitoring cost). The primary difference between the current model and other evolutionary models of behavior is found in the payoff function of the agents. We assume that agents can incur an internal cost of defection (e. g. humiliation) when an agent commits defecting behavior whether or not he is detected. Several studies (Coleman (1987), Kerr et al. (1994), Carwford and Ostrom (1995) and T. C Haab and K. E. McCornell (2001)) have already examined this internal cost. Further, the agent can earn a benefit through enhanced reputation by complying. (Hamilton (1964), Axelrod (1984), Nowak and Simund (1998) and Leimar and Mammerstein (2001)) Internal cost increases as the number of complier increases. Reputation only can be earned when compliance behavior is observed by others thus the size of community of CPR and the proportion of compliers are important. The benefits to defection increase as the number of compliers increases. For example, in a fishery, the more agents complying with the efficient fishing effort the more fish defectors can catch. However, the internal cost to defection increases as the number of compliers increases. The difference between this defecting benefit and defecting cost (internal cost + inflict from sanctioning) increases as the number of compliers increases. On the other hand, the marginal reputation benefit is increasing for low levels of compliance but after some level of compliers, reputation increases at the decreasing rate. A representative individual will compare the <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefit</b> of defection to the marginal reputation of compliance and will choose to defect if the <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefit</b> of defection is greater than the marginal payoff to compliance. A partial compliance equilibrium is sustainable because for compliance populations above the point where the marginal net benefits of defection exceed the marginal net benefits of compliance, the marginal net benefits of defection are greater than the marginal net benefits of compliance, leading to increasing defection. For compliance populations below the point where the marginal net benefits of defection equal the marginal net benefits of compliance, the marginal net benefits of defection are less than the marginal reputation of compliance leading to increasing compliance. With sufficient exogenous sanctioning behavior, by government or authorized party, the marginal net defecting benefit can be reduced thereby achieving a less than full compliance (or full defection) equilibrium. In practice, it's possible that the sanctioning behavior is enforced by endogenous members. The interesting features of this endogenous sanctioning behavior are that it is not only sufficient to maintain sustainable level of CPR but also enforced by rational individuals who would not sanction unless there were a reward. When individual behavior can be observed fully or partially, sanctioning behavior is rewarded in a form of reputation or prestige. Thus there may be sufficient incentive to overcome costly sanctioning behavior. In some environments where information of individual behavior is uncertain, people have incentive to monitor others' strategies in order not to be fooled in the next stage of game. Therefore it can be easily inferred that there is positive relationship between costly sanctioning behavior and earning reputation or getting information of others' behavior, which depends on the availability of information of others' behaviors. In conclusion, with the assumption of sufficient internal cost for defecting behavior and reputation for compliance behavior, a less than full compliance equilibrium with exogenous sanctioning can be explained. Even with endogenous sanctioning, a stable partial compliance equilibrium is possible if people have the incentive to either gather information on other's behavior (in the hidden action case) or to earn reputation in partially observable action case.

However, CO 2 sequestration is not a perfect substitute for CO 2 abatement because CO 2 may leak back into the atmosphere (thus imposing future climate change impacts) and because CO 2 sequestration requires energy (thus producing more CO 2 and depleting fossil fuel resources earlier). Here we use analytical and numerical models to assess the economic efficiency of CO 2 sequestration and analyze the optimal timing and extent of CO 2 sequestration. The economic efficiency factor of CO 2 sequestration can be expressed as {{the ratio of the}} <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> <b>benefits</b> of sequestering CO 2 and avoiding CO 2 emissions. We derive an analytical solution for this efficiency factor for a simplified case in which we account for CO 2 leakage, discounting, the additional fossil fuel requirement of CO 2 sequestration, and the growth rate of carbon taxes. In this analytical model, the economic efficiency of CO 2 sequestration decreases as the CO 2 tax growth rate, leakage rates and energy requirements for CO 2 sequestration increase. Increasing discount rates increases the economic efficiency factor. In this simple model, short-term sequestration methods, such as afforestation, can even have negative economic efficiencies. We use a more realistic integrated-assessment model to additionally account for potentially important effects such as learning-by-doing and socio-economic inertia on optimal strategies. We measure the economic efficiency of CO 2 sequestration by the ratio of the marginal costs of CO 2 sequestration and CO 2 abatement along optimal trajectories. We show that the positive impacts of investments in CO 2 sequestration through the reduction of future marginal CO 2 sequestration costs and the alleviation of future inertia constraints can initially exceed the marginal sequestration costs. As a result, the economic efficiencies of CO 2 sequestration can exceed 100 % and an optimal strategy will subsidize CO 2 sequestration that is initially more expensive than CO 2 abatement. The potential economic value of a feasible and acceptable CO 2 sequestration technology is equivalent – in the adopted utilitarian model – to a one-time investment of several percent of present gross world product. It is optimal in the chosen economic framework to sequester substantial CO 2 quantities into reservoirs with small or zero leakage, given published estimates of marginal costs and climate change impacts. The optimal CO 2 trajectories in the case of sequestration from air can approach the pre-industrial level, constituting geoengineering. Our analysis is silent on important questions (e. g., the effects of model and parametric uncertainty, the potential learning about these uncertainties, or ethical dimension of such geoengineering strategies), which need to be addressed before our findings can be translated into policy-relevant recommendations.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} that facilitates a direct {{test of the}} homevoter hypothesis, which posits that homeowner/voter support for a public good project is positively related to the project’s expected effect on property values. First, we estimate how events that indicate an increasing probability that the public good project will be undertaken impact local residential property values before the referendum is held. These pre-vote impacts are considered noisy signals to homeowners about the market’s assessment of the <b>net</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of the project. Second, we aggregate these market signals to the precinct level and relate them to precinct-level voting results concerning the proposed project. We apply this method to the 2004 referendum in Arlington, Texas, concerning a publicly subsidized stadium to host the NFL Dallas Cowboys. The analysis supports the homevoter hypothesis and establishes a possible methodology for future evaluations in this small but growing empirical literature. economic impact, event studies, sports, property values, stadiums...|$|R

This paper addresses the diversity of water users and uses that currently exists in rural areas, and especially focuses on the competition for water that may result from such a diversity {{in a context of}} water scarcity, and from the diversity of objectives formulated by the public authorities. The paper first briefly describes the current institutional arrangements regarding access to water. It also presents the situation in rural areas where farming communities and the mining sector are interacting on water- and labour-related matters. The paper then presents a case study whereby these two sectors have embarked into a negotiation process on water rights transfer, under the auspices of several public role players. It proposes an analysis of the case study through a standard environmental economics model. The model considers the <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> private <b>benefit</b> (MNPB) generated by mining activities and the associated marginal returns to water (MRW). The transfer of water from farmers to mines results in a loss in crop production potential by the fanners and the subsequent loss of income and potential for development. Such a loss can be considered the opportunity cost of water for smallholders. If not compensated, it represents a proxy of the externality associated with the water transfer. The model first highlights the difference in terms of water productivity in the two sectors, and its consequences if a system of transferable licenses is adopted. Then, some policy options (taxes, standards, subsidies) are tested and discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This chapter explores details {{behind the}} phenomenal {{increase}} in global crude oil produc-tion {{over the last}} century and a half and the implications if that trend should be reversed. I document that a key feature of the growth in production has been exploitation of new geographic areas rather than application of better technology to existing sources, and sug-gest that the end of that era could come soon. The economic dislocations that historically followed temporary oil supply disruptions are reviewed, and the possible implications of that experience for what the transition era could look like are explored. 2 1 Oil prices and the economics of resource exhaustion. One of the most elegant theories in economics is Hotelling’s (1931) characterization of the price of an exhaustible natural resource. From the perspective of overall social welfare, production today needs to be balanced against the consideration that, once consumed, the resource will be unavailable to future generations. One option for society would be to produce more of the commodity today, invest the current <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>net</b> of extractio...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of economic methodology {{to the problem}} of terrorism is discussed. Theoretical and empirical results are discussed with particular focus on the September 11 attack and the retaliatory response by the United States. Economists have relied on the rational agent model to derive testable hypotheses regarding the behavior of terrorists. The rational agent model postulates that terrorists respond to incentives, including media publicity, and the model predicts that when the <b>net</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> from one type of terrorist activity is diminished, terrorists will substitute into alternative modes of terrorism. Empirical results demonstrating that such substitutions indeed occur are discussed. Therefore, policy designed to reduce a particular form of terrorism, such as increased airport security to prevent airplane hijackings, may simply result in terrorists choosing alternative modes of terrorism. Empirical evidence demonstrating that terrorism is cyclical in nature is also discussed. Evidence on substitution and cycles suggests that following temporary reduction in terrorist activity after retaliation against terrorists and their infrastructure, terrorists are able to successfully regroup and attack using alternative means. Therefore, the current US focus on fighting terrorism on all fronts and over the long haul is the correct approach. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Does it pay to work? Given {{the number}} and {{complexity}} {{of federal and state}} tax and transfer systems, this is a tough question to answer. The problem is greatly {{compounded by the fact that}} what one earns in one year alters not just current taxes and transfer payments in that year, but in future years as well. Thus, understanding the net effective tax on work and the changes in this taxation associated with policy reforms requires an intertemporal model capable of carefully determining tax and transfer payments at each stage of the life cycle. This study uses ESPlanner, a financial planning software program, to study the net work tax levied on workers with different earnings capacities. ESPlanner smooths households' living standards subject to their capacities to borrow. In so doing, it makes highly detiled, year-by-year federal and state income tax and Social Security benefit calculations. To produce a comprehensive net work tax measure, we added to ESPlanner all other major transfer programs. We focus on lifetime average and <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> work-tax rates, which are measured by comparing the present values of lifetime spending from working through retirement both in the presence and in the absence of all tax-transfer programs. We form these tax rates for young stylized married workers. We report seven findings. First, our fiscal system is highly progressive. Households earning the minimum wage receive 18 cents in <b>benefits</b> <b>net</b> of taxes for every dollar they earn. In contrast, households with million dollar salaries pay 54 cents in taxes <b>net</b> of <b>benefits</b> pe r dollar earned. Second, progressively is primarily restriced to the bottom end of the income distribution. Average net work tax rates of middle class households are relatively high compared with those of the rich. Third, while the poor face negative average taxes, they face significant positive <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> taxes on working. Indeed, a minimum wage household that chooses to work is forced to surrender 34 cents of every dollar earned in net taxes. Those with earnings that exceed 1. 5 times the minimum wage face <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> taxes on full-time work above 50 percent. Fourth, low-wage workers face confiscatory tax rates on switching from part-time to full-time work. Fifth, the same is true of secondary earnings spouses in low- wage households with low incomes. Six, the <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> tax on working is particularly high for young households with low incomes. Seventh, average and <b>marginal</b> <b>net</b> work tax rates are relatively insensitive to the assumed rate of real wage growth and the discount rate. And eighth, major tax reforms, such as switching from income to consumption taxation, can have an significant affect on the fiscal system's overall progressivity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined OBJECTIVES: To {{calculate}} comparative incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per quality-adjusted life year, QALY) and <b>net</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> for retigabine as add-on {{treatment for}} patients with uncontrolled focal seizures as compared to add-on lacosamide treatment and no add-on treatment, respectively. MATERIALS & METHODS: Calculations were performed using a validated decision-tree model. The study population consisted of adult patients with focal-onset epilepsy in published randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials of retigabine or lacosamide. Healthcare utilization and QALY for each treatment alternative were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using the specification of this model {{as a basis for}} Monte Carlo simulations. 2009 prices were used for all costs. RESULTS: Results were reported for a 2 -year follow-up period. Retigabine add-on treatment was both more effective and less costly than lacosamide add-on treatment, and the cost per additional QALY for the retigabine no add-on (standard) therapy comparison was estimated at 2009 € 15, 753. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY of € 50, 000, the <b>net</b> <b>marginal</b> values were estimated at 2009 € 605, 874 for retigabine vs lacosamide and 2009 € 2, 114, 203 for retigabine vs no add-on, per 1, 000 patients. The probabilistic analyses showed that the likelihood that retigabine treatment is cost-effective is at least 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost per additional QALY, for the retigabine vs no add-on treatment comparison, is well within the range of newly published estimates of willingness to pay for an additional QALY. Thus, add-on retigabine treatment for people with focal-onset epilepsy with no/limited response to standard antiepileptic treatment appears to be cost-effective...|$|R
