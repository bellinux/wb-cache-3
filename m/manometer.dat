40|$|Background: No {{evidence}} exists from randomized trials to support using cloud-based <b>manometers</b> integrated with available physician order entry systems for tracking patient blood pressure (BP) {{to assist in}} the control of renal function deterioration. We investigated how integrating cloud-based <b>manometers</b> with physician order entry systems benefits our outpatient chronic kidney disease patients compared with typical BP tracking systems. Methods: We randomly assigned 36 chronic kidney disease patients to use cloud-based <b>manometers</b> integrated with physician order entry systems or typical BP recording sheets, and followed the patients for 6 months. The composite outcome was that the patients saw improvement both in BP and renal function. Results: We compared the systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), and renal function of our patients at 0 months, 3 months, and 6 months after using the integrated <b>manometers</b> and typical BP monitoring sheets. Nighttime SBP and DBP were significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group. Serum creatinine level in the study group improved significantly compared with the control group after the end of Month 6 (2. 83  ±  2. 0 vs. 4. 38  ±  3. 0, p =  0. 018). Proteinuria improved nonsignificantly in Month 6 in the study group compared with the control group (1. 05  ±  0. 9 vs. 1. 90  ±  1. 3, p =  0. 09). Both SBP and DBP during the nighttime hours improved significantly in the study group compared with the baseline. Conclusion: In pre–end-stage renal disease patients, regularly monitoring BP by integrating cloud-based <b>manometers</b> appears to result in a significant decrease in creatinine and improvement in nighttime BP control. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria were found to be improved nonsignificantly, and thus, larger population and longer follow-up studies may be needed...|$|R

25|$|Macroscopically, the gas {{characteristics}} measured {{are either}} {{in terms of}} the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied pneumatic chemistry for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the macroscopic properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube <b>manometer</b> which looks like a test tube {{in the shape of the}} letter J. Boyle trapped an inert gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of mercury, thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an inverse relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the product was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.|$|E

Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the <b>manometer</b> with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E
