40|$|A Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law {{exists in}} Japan. This law was {{effective}} since 1949 and minor revision {{has been made}} a number of time. However, a major revision of this law was made in 1988 and was effective for school year 1990. The purposes of this study are following: 1) To clarify the status of curricula for the pre-service training of lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education before and after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law; 2) To Compere and to clarify the differences of new curricula from old ones; and 3) To find out the trends and probrems of curricula for the pre-service training of science teachers. The main results were as follows; 1) There is a variety of professional education curricula for lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education. 2) In 1990, the average number of credits for Science Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoka-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) was not different as compared with the case of 1988. However, the legal number of credits for Laboratories as a part of Science Subjects was changed from 4 to 8 after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law. And actual number of credits for these subjects increased according to the law. The doubling of the number of credits for Laboratories meets with the approval of over 600 f the institutions. However, there is no backing of collateral increase of faculty members and budget, therefore a heavy burden must necessarily be imposed on science faculty members. 3) The number of credits for Professional Teaching Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoshoku-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) increased after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law. However, the number of credits for Methodology of Science Teaching (2 ̆ 7 Rika-Kyoikuho 2 ̆ 7), which is an integrative subject in pre-service training courses for science teachers, decreased. Though other science education subjects are offered in most of the institutions, yet students will have no time to study these subjects, because of Laboratories and Professional Teaching Subjects with the exception of Methodology of Science Teaching. ...|$|R
