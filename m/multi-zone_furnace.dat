40|$|We have {{developed}} a continuous process {{for the production of}} open-surface BSCCO- 2212 tape using a long <b>multi-zone</b> <b>furnace</b> which places no limits on conductor length. Critical current measurements at 77 K and 4. 2 K, up to 10 T, suggest that this is a viable method of obtaining conductor with homogeneous properties over long lengths. I-c values above 90 A (4. 2 K, 0 T) have been achieved, comparable with the same conventionally-processed material...|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} {{process has been}} developed {{for the production of}} unlimited lengths of BSCCO- 2212 open-surface conductor using a long <b>multi-zone</b> <b>furnace.</b> Dip-coated tape is pulled through a partial-melting/annealing temperature profile, forming phase-pure, well-aligned 2212. Critical currents of 85 - 108 A at 4. 2 K, 0 T have been achieved, comparing well with identical tape in a conventional heat-treatment Highly homogeneous properties are obtained since every part of the tape receives an identical heat-treatment, avoiding the thermal gradients experienced across wind-and-react coils...|$|E

To decrease deep-level trapping and improve detector performance, high-purity commercial raw materials will be further zone refined to reduce impurities. The purified materials will then be compounded into a charge for crystal growth. The crystals will be grown in the programmable <b>multi-zone</b> <b>furnace</b> (PMZF), which was designed and built at Northrop Grumman’s Bethpage facility to grow CZT on Space Shuttle missions.

40|$|A {{two-level}} {{system engineering}} design approach to integrated control and supervision of industrial <b>multi-zone</b> <b>furnaces</b> has been elaborated and tested. The application {{case study is}} the three-zone 25 MW RZS furnace plant at Skopje Steelworks. The integrated control and supervision design is based on combined use of general predictive control optimization of set-points and steady-state decoupling,at the upper level, and classical two-term laws with stady-state decouling, at the executive control level. This design technique exploits the intrinsic stability of thermal processes and makes use of constrained optimization, standard non-parametric time-domain process models, identified under operating conditions, using truncated k-time sequence matrices, controlled autoregressive moving average models. Digital implementations are sought within standard computer process control platform for practical engineering and maintenance reasons...|$|R

40|$|A <b>Multi-Zone</b> Muffle-Tube <b>Furnace</b> was designed, built, {{and tested}} {{for the purpose of}} {{providing}} an in-house experience base with tubular furnaces for materials processing in microgravity. As such, it must not only provide the desired temperatures and controlled thermal gradients at several discrete zones along its length but must also be capable of sustaining the rigors of a Space Shuttle launch. The furnace is insulated to minimize radial and axial heat losses. It is contained in a water-cooled enclosure for purposes of dissipating un-wanted residual heat, keeping the outer surfaces of the furnace at a 'touch-safe' temperature, and providing a rugged housing. This report describes the salient features of the furnace, testing procedures and results, and concluding remarks evaluating the overall design...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide new furnace {{technology}} to accommodate microgravity research studies and commercial applications in material processes, research has been initiated {{on the development of}} the Programmable-Multi-zone Furnace (PMZF). The PMZF is described as a multi-user materials processing furnace facility that is composed of thirty or more heater elements in series on a muffle tube or in a stacked ring-type configuration and independently controlled by a computer. One of the aims of the PMZF project is to allow furnace thermal gradient profiles to be reconfigured without physical modification of the hardware by creating the capability of reconfiguring thermal profiles in response to investigators' requests. The future location of the PMZF facility is discussed; the preliminary science survey results and preliminary conceptual designs for the PMZF are presented; and a review of <b>multi-zone</b> <b>furnace</b> technology is given...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscience and {{nanotechnology}} {{has become}} one of the most active research areas for decades; new approaches for nanoscale fabrication are of fundamental importance in the advancement of science and technology, these developments in methodology stimulated numerous research activities. Thermal evaporation, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition and other synthetic routes have enabled the synthesis of inorganic nanoscale materials with various morphologies. These nanomaterials form the building blocks for a range of uses such as nanoscale devices, energy storage, sensors and nanomedicine. Physical evaporation synthetic route plays a key role in inorganic nanomaterial growth. In this approach, materials are first evaporated and then condensed to form solid materials. Thermal evaporation is one of the widely used methods; it is a simple and an effective way for the synthesis of nanostructures during the last decade. This method is usually processed in a tube furnace, in which the source materials are vaporized at an elevated temperature and the vapour phase(s) condense(s) under certain conditions. Since tube furnace is used as heating element, it is not applicable for the source materials with low volatility or high melting point (3 ̆e 1800 ℃), and if the temperature gradient is low (approximately 20 °C/cm) even in a <b>multi-zone</b> tube <b>furnace,</b> which is the driving force for atom movement in most cases. A laser ablation method was developed by using a pulsed laser as secondary heating element; the target materials were ablated by the laser beam, creating a dense, hot vapor of plasma species. In the case of growing nanowires - the hot vapor condenses into nanometer diameter catalytic cluster as the species cool through collisions with the buffer gas. The clusters define the size and direct the growth of the crystalline nanowires by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. This method ablate target materials with high melting point into gas phase, but the temperature gradient for the nanomaterial growth mainly depends on the tube furnace, it has been successfully applied on the nanowires growth of C, Si and Ge. The objective of this work was to study the nanocrystal growth of ZnO with high crystallinity and clean surface by a new physical evaporation method. This method based on the utilization of high temperature yield by focused light beam and the large temperature gradient formed in the growth chamber. The starting material can be pure material or a mixture with catalyst materials in a crucible free condition. The work in this thesis is directed to the growth study and characterization of nanosized ZnO. ZnO nancrystal and nanostructure with various morphologies have been successfully grown by this new method. A systematic and detailed growth study has been carried out, relating to the influence of growth conditions on the morphology and phase structure of the synthesized product(s). The physical properties of selected samples with typical morphologies were studied. The growth mechanisms of ZnO nanocrystals by this method have also been investigated. This new method has shown some unique features and could be adapted for growing nanocrystals and nanostructures of other materials, particularly for the materials that can absorb infrared easily. In this thesis, after a literature review on the ZnO nanomaterials growth, a systematic study on growth impact factors will be reported. The experiments demonstrate that pure phase ZnO nanocrystals with diversify morphologies could be obtained on Si substrate by using light heating evaporation method. Targets of ZnO containing 2...|$|R
