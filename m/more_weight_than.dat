5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} he faced Sir Hugo, Orvieto, El Diablo and Frank Marsh in the Limekiln Stakes at the Newmarket Houghton meeting. Orme started the 4/5 favourite, and with two furlongs to run he {{strode into the}} lead. Without even being asked for an effort, he won easily by three lengths from El Diablo, with Sir Hugo in third. The next day he won the Subscription Stakes easily from Porridge, after leading from the start and never being caught. He raced again the next day, his third race in as many days, in a Free Handicap Sweepstakes over ten furlongs where he faced five opponents. Orme started as the 4/6 favourite, Bushey Park was at 5/1. Next in the betting came El Diablo, The Lover and Therapia all priced at 100/12. Bushey Park led {{in the early stages}} until Orme went into the lead with about two furlongs left to run. El Diablo overtook Orme in the final 100 yards and beat him by one and a half lengths. The Lover {{finished}} in third place, three quarters of a length behind Orme. Orme had to carry 16 pounds <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> El Diablo and 22 pounds more than The Lover.|$|E

25|$|Often the {{arrangement}} was made more complex by {{the complexity of}} the piers themselves, so that it was not piers and columns that alternated, but rather, piers of entirely different form from each other, such as those of Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, where the nature of the vault dictated that the alternate piers bore a great deal <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> the intermediate ones and are thus very much larger.|$|E
25|$|Pony breeds have {{developed}} {{all over the}} world, particularly in cold and harsh climates where hardy, sturdy working animals were needed. They are remarkably strong for their size. Breeds such as the Connemara pony, are recognized {{for their ability to}} carry a full-sized adult rider. Pound for pound ponies can pull and carry <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> a horse. Draft-type ponies are able to pull loads significantly greater than their own weight, with larger ponies capable of pulling loads comparable to those pulled by full-sized draft horses, and even very small ponies able to pull as much as 450 percent of their own weight.|$|E
25|$|Monospaced typefaces {{function}} {{better for}} some purposes because their glyphs {{line up in}} neat, regular columns. No glyph is given any <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> another. Most manually operated typewriters use monospaced fonts. So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only monospaced fonts (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in monospaced cells) in their configuration. Monospaced fonts are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see. Monospaced fonts may also {{make it easier to}} perform optical character recognition.|$|E

25|$|Eleanor's {{first race}} {{occurred}} on 20 April in Newmarket at the First Spring meeting where she beat the filly Miss Fuery and won 250 guineas. The Epsom Derby, held on 21 May, was her second career start, which she won against 9 colts {{and one other}} filly while carrying 110 pounds. A colt by Fidget (owned by Lord Egremont) was second and the Duke of Grafton's filly Remnant sired by Trumpetor was third. On {{the day after the}} Derby, Eleanor won the 550-guinea Epsom Oaks from Lord Grosvenor's filly Rosamond and four other horses. At Ascot, she finished second in a 215-guinea sweepstakes to a colt sired by Asparagus (later named Teddy the Grinder) while carrying 7 pounds <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> the other racers as a handicap for her wins in the Derby and the Oaks. At the First October meeting in Newmarket, Eleanor won 700 guineas in a match race with Miss Fuery. In her last engagement of the season, Eleanor beat the Duke of Grafton's colt Flambeau in a 200-guinea match race.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{reservations}} about the self-contradictory sources, Eyton concluded that the foundation date lay between 1130 and 1138 and that {{the founder of the}} abbey “in all respects was the first William Fitz-Alan.” However, William FitzAlan's grant of the Preston Boats fish weir, around 1135, was clearly not a foundation grant: there was already a small but growing community when it was made. The Victoria County History account tends to give <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> Eyton to the possibility of an earlier origin. Augustinian communities often began as small gatherings around a noted hermit before growing into established monasteries, or even small religious orders: the Abbey of Arrouaise in northern France, which had a Shropshire community at nearby Lilleshall Abbey, is an example. At Haughmond, the remains of a very modest early church were discovered beneath the floor of the later, more ambitious building, during the 1907 excavations: this may date back to the time of Prior Fulk or earlier. Despite these reservations and qualifications, the most recent account of William Fitz-Alan, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, simply treats him as the founder of the abbey, and it was certainly he who placed it on a secure basis, even if he was not the originator.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

500|$|Ann Powers of Spin also commended the album's concept, {{as well as}} the band's songwriting, saying: [...] "Until now, Manson's ideas carried <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> his music, but Antichrist Superstars sound {{matches the}} garish grandiosity of his arguments. Its 16 songs rock like '70s Sabbath-style metal, but harder; the {{arrangements}} echo Queen in operatic scope but are more intense; the mood owes its vampiric chill to Bauhaus, but [...] actually bites the vein." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album would be considered the band's definitive statement, but was critical of Reznor's production, saying: [...] "Though the sonic details make [...] an intriguing listen, it's not as extreme as it could have been—in particular, the guitars are surprisingly anemic, sounding like buzzing vacuums instead of unwieldy chainsaws." ...|$|E

[...] Stephen Badsey, analysing trends in television programmes about the war remarked that Blackadder Goes Forth as a popular comedy series was subject to particular criticism from historians, remarking that the series [...] "consciously traded on every cliche and misremembered piece of history about the Western Front, and was influential enough to draw a surprising degree of angry criticism from professional historians as a result." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{more than}} a century France {{maintained}} colonial rule in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including Sharia laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance {{that they did not have}} under French law. Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties. Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the Manifesto of the Algerian People, which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000"meritorious" [...] Muslims. During a reform effort in 1947, the French created a bicameral legislature with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims; but gave a European's vote equal seven times <b>more</b> <b>weight</b> <b>than</b> a Muslim's vote. Paramilitary groups such as the National Liberation Front (Front de Libération nationale, FLN) appeared, claiming an Arab-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the Algerian War, in 1954.|$|E
