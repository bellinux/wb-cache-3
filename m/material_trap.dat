40|$|The precise {{value of}} the mean neutron lifetime, τ_n, plays an {{important}} role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is a key input for predicting the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and is used to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. There is a 3. 9 standard deviation discrepancy between τ_n measured by counting the decay rate of free neutrons in a beam (887. 7 ± 2. 2 s) and by counting surviving ultracold neutrons stored for different holding times in a <b>material</b> <b>trap</b> (878. 5 ± 0. 8 s). The experiment described here eliminates loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with <b>material</b> <b>trap</b> walls and neutrons in quasi-stable orbits rapidly exit the trap. As a result of this approach and the use of a new in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here (877. 7 ± 0. 7 (stat) + 0. 3 /- 0. 1 (sys) s) is the first measurement of τ_n that does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.

40|$|Ultracold {{neutrons}} (UCN) are neutrons of {{very low}} energies, enough to undergo total reflection from a given surface at any angle of incidence. As a result, {{they can be}} confined to a <b>material</b> <b>trap</b> when their kinetic energies are smaller than the Fermi potential of the trap material. However, they can be lost from the trap via nuclear capture reaction and thermal inelastic scattering from the trap surface. They can also be lost by quasi-elastic scattering when the energy gain is sufficient to exceed the Fermi potential. ^ Possible models of UCN quasi-elastic scattering are interactions with hydrogen diffusing in an impurity surface layer or with surface waves of a liquid. Using two different experimental methods we investigated both the energy-loss and the energy-gain side of quasi-elastic scattering from a Fomblin grease surface. Fomblin is a perfluorinated polymer. We also measured the up-scattering effects for various Fomblin liquids {{as a function of}} temperature and energy transfer. For a new Fomblin oil, the measured quasi-elastic up-scattering probability tends to be negligible at low temperature T 3 ̆c 150 K. ^ We performed storage lifetime measurements using UCN traps coated with the new oil.

The relative merits of two MS ionization interfaces (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, APCI, and atmospheric pressure photoionization, APPI) were also compared for the MS identification and quantification of these analytes. APCI {{was found to be}} superior in cases where both alternatives are applicable. A major drawback when applying APPI is that no signal is obtained for the cyclic nitramines and nitrate esters. Using APCI, a wide spectrum of unstable compounds can be determined in a single analysis, and the feasibility of using large volume samples (up to 100 mL) in combination with the sensitivity of the MS detection system provide method detection limits ranging from 2. 5 pg/mL (for 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene and 2, 6 -diamino- 6 -nitrotoluene) to 563 pg/mL (for pentaerythritol tetranitrate, PETN), with repeatability ranging from 2 to 7 %. Other chemornetric parameters such as robustness, selectivity, repeatability, and intermediate precision were also evaluated in the validation of the extraction methods for use in water analysis. Tests with untreated groundwater and drinking water samples, spiked with 20 ng of the analytes, yielded results similar to those obtained with high purity water samples. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|On the Central Coast of California, through {{collaborative}} planning across state, local, {{and federal}} resources agencies, including NMFS, the NOAA Restoration Center, and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), the Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County (RCD SCC) and NRCS planned and implemented eight innovative large wood log structures along two reaches of San Vicente Creek in Davenport, California. The project fulfills a key recovery {{action at the}} southern extent of for the imperiled Central California Coast (CCC) Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The project was collaboratively developed and designed through the Integrated Watershed Restoration Program (IWRP) with significant input from NMFS and CDFG fisheries biologists. Permitting was facilitated through a Permit Coordination program brokered by the RCD SCC. Prior to construction in Fall 2011, the stream resembled a 2 ̆ 2 bowling alley 2 ̆ 2 , with straightened reaches of uniform bed material, high velocities, minimal wood cover and pools, and adverse habitat conditions for young coho and steelhead. The large wood log project on San Vicente Creek is {{a unique opportunity to}} increase channel complexity for CCC Coho salmon and test recovery strategies in a stream with year round ocean access, high summer base flows, cool summer temperatures, limited diversions, proximity to the larger Scott Creek watershed, and recent successful implementations of alcove, pond, and backwater restoration. This presentation will discuss the engineering and collaboration to install and anchor large wood in San Vicente Creek. Over time the large wood is expected to create local scour pools and cover for salmonids, sort bed <b>material,</b> <b>trap</b> volunteer wood, and activate the low flood plain through deflection and channel obstruction. During construction, the NRCS design engineer and the SCC RCD staff worked closely with the contractor to optimize wood placement and anchoring, while minimizing impacts to the riparian corridor. The site will be monitored intensively by the RCD SCC and NOAA 2 ̆ 7 s Southwest Fisheries Science Center for 5 and 10 years, respectively.

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{profiles of}} disc galaxies are {{built by the}} <b>material</b> <b>trapped</b> around stable periodic orbits, which form their "skeletons". According to this, {{the knowledge of the}} stability of the main families of periodic orbits in appropriate 3 D models, can predict possible morphologies for edge-on disc galaxies. In a pilot survey we compare the orbital structures which lead to the appearance of "peanuts" and "X"-like features with the edge-on profiles of three disc galaxies (IC 2531, NGC 4013 and UGC 2048). The subtraction from the images of a model representing the axisymmetric component of the galaxies reveals the contribution of the non-axisymmetric terms. We find a direct correspondence between the orbital profiles of 3 D bars in models and the observed main morphological features of the residuals. We also apply a simple unsharp masking technique in order to study the sharpest features of the images. Our basic conclusion is that the morphology of the boxy "bulges" of these galaxies can be explained by considering disc <b>material</b> <b>trapped</b> around stable 3 D periodic orbits. In most models these building-blocks periodic orbits are bifurcated from the planar central family of a non-axisymmetric component, usually a bar, at low order vertical resonances. In such a case the boxy "bulges" are parts of bars seen edge-on. For the three galaxies we study the families associated with the "peanut" or "X"-shape morphology are most probably bifurcations at the vertical 2 / 1 or 4 / 1 resonance.
