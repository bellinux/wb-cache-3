25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environment,</b> 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E
2500|$|The actual wire {{employed}} in voice coil winding {{is almost always}} copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environment,</b> aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|E
40|$|Agile {{manufacturing}} {{has become}} a topic of great interest {{over the past several}} years. The entire domain of modeling and analyzing different types of agile <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environments</b> and systems, however, remain largely unexplored. The objective of this research is to provide fundamental insight into how manufacturing systems should be designed and reconfigured over time in order to cope with different agile <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environments.</b> To achieve this objective, three approaches are developed and integrated into one simulation-based model. The first approach is used to model different agile <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environments.</b> The second approach is used to define various ways in which manufacturing systems can be designed and reconfigured (i. e., design/reconfiguration strategies). The third comprises the cost and objective functions used to measure system performance when different design/reconfiguration strategies are used in different agile <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environments.</b> Based upon the assumptions adopted during this thesis, the experimental work performed suggests that despite the fact that agility incurs high costs, agile manufacturing systems are indeed necessary for certain <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environments</b> in which product life cycles are shor...|$|R

2500|$|A {{notified}} body, in the European Union, is {{an entity}} {{that has been}} accredited by a Member State to assess whether a product {{to be placed on}} the market meets certain preordained standards. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environment</b> and processes associated with it. [...] For example, a notified body may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{production}} {{increased significantly}} in the United States during World War II, and industrial accidents soared. Winning the war took precedence over safety, and most labor unions were more concerned with maintaining wages {{in the face of}} severe inflation than with workplace health and safety. After the war ended, however, workplace accident rates remained high and began to rise. [...] In the two years preceding OSHA's enactment, 14,000 workers died each year from workplace hazards, and another 2 million were disabled or harmed. Additionally, the [...] "chemical revolution" [...] introduced a vast array of new chemical compounds to the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>environment.</b> [...] The health effects of these chemicals were poorly understood, and workers received few protections against prolonged or high levels of exposure. While a few states, such as California and New York, had enacted workplace safety as well as workplace health legislation, most states had not changed their workplace protection laws {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
