40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} surface quality of mould steel with {{high-speed}} wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) method, which is conducted in gas to improve the accuracy of finish cut, and compares the surface quality in atmosphere and in emulsion dielectric. Experiment results showed that WEDM in atmosphere offers advantages such as better surface roughness and higher material removal rate. The relationship about winding speed and worktable feed on WEDMed surface quality in semi-finishing cut and finishing cut had been obtained. <b>Morover,</b> <b>a</b> new attemption was successful in applying dry WEDM in multiple cut to improve surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|Hazards due to {{landslides}} cause huge sufferings {{to human}} and substantial {{economic and environmental}} losses throughout the world. For {{the assessment of the}} landslide hazard, different methodological approaches are proposed. They are mainly grouped into two: qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative methods eliminate the problem of subjectivity of the qualitative methods. On the other hand, qualitative methods have simpler methodological procedures. Among the quantitative methods, statistical techniques {{are one of the most}} popular ones. This study aims at providing a comprehensive comparison of quantitative and qualitative landslide hazard assessment maps, as well as proposing a new approach to enhance the performance of qualitative methods. The conventional statistical analysis can only produce, average and global parameter estimates for the whole study region. However, there are local variability in the factors causing landslides due to spatial correlation; i. e. geographically nearby units will have similar characteristics, while the ones, which are farer apart will have less similar properties. Therefore, as regression methods based on ordinary least square estimation, they are lack in modelling the spatial correlation structure of the parameters. For this reason, in this study ordinary logistic regression (OLR) is extended by spatial regression (SR) techniques for landslide hazard assessment. <b>Morover,</b> <b>a</b> heuristic approach is developed for obtaining the susceptibility map based on assigning weights to landslide causing factors. In this approach a weight rating system is adapted, where weights were assigned to different causitive factors. In both of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, slope, aspect, curvature, which are derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM), lineaments and vegetation index, which are extracted from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellit...|$|E
40|$|A phase {{transition}} model for porous media in consolidation is studied. The model {{is able to}} describe the phenomenon of fluid-segregation during the consolidation process, i. e., the coexistence of two phases differing from fluid content inside the porous medium under static load. Considering pure Darcy dissipation, the dynamics is described by a Cahn-Hilliard-like system of partial differential equations (PDE). The goal, here, is to study {{the dynamics of the}} formation of stationary fluid-rich bubbles. The evolution of the strain and fluid density profiles of the porous medium is analyzed in two physical situation: fluid free to flow through the boundaries of the medium and fluid flow prevented at one of the two boundaries. <b>Morover,</b> <b>an</b> analytic result on the position of the interface between the two phases is provided.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of mutual cooperation is studied in a spatially extended evolutionary prisoner's dilemma {{game in which}} the players are located on the sites of cubic lattices for dimensions d= 1, 2, and 3. Each player can choose {{one of the three}} strategies: cooperation (C), defection (D) or Tit for Tat (T). During the evolutionary process the randomly chosen players adopt one of their neighboring strategies if the chosen neighbor has higher payoff. <b>Morover,</b> <b>an</b> external constraint imposes that the players always cooperate with probability p. The stationary state phase diagram are computed by both using generalized mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. Nonequilibrium second order phase transitions assosiated with the extinction of one of the possible strategies are found and the corresponding critical exponents belong to the directed percolation universality class. It is shown that forcing externally the collaboration does not always produce the desired result. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{coherent}} oscillations between two coupled quantum states of a Bose-Einstein condensate in two-dimensional space at zero temperature. In {{the system we}} consider, weak interparticle repulsive interactions occur between the particles in state one only, while the state two particles remain non-interacting. Analytical as well as numerical solution of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii and Schroedinger equations reveals various regimes of oscillational dynamics for the relative quantum phase and population imbalance between the two subsystems of the condensate. We show that, depending on the energy detuning between the two states, the system can exhibit modified harmonic and anharmonic Rabi oscillations or can transit to the regime analogous to internal a. c. Josephson effect. <b>Morover,</b> at <b>a</b> certain value of energy detuning, the internal oscillations are fully suppressed. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to construct a distributed clustering algorithm based upon spatial data correlation among sensor nodes and perform data accuracy for each distributed cluster at their respective cluster head node. Design Procedure/Approach: We investigate that due to deployment of high density of sensor nodes in the sensor field, spatial data are highly correlated among sensor nodes in spatial domain. Based on high data correlation among sensor nodes, we propose a non -overlapping irregular distributed clustering algorithm with different sizes to collect most accurate or precise data at the cluster head node for each respective distributed cluster. To collect the most accurate data at the cluster head node for each distributed cluster in sensor field, we propose a Data accuracy model and compare the results with Information accuracy model. Finding: Simulation results shows that our propose Data accuracy model collects more accurate data and gives better performance than Information accuracy model at the cluster head node for each respective distributed cluster in our propose distributed clustering algorithm. <b>Morover</b> there exist <b>a</b> optimal cluster of sensor nodes which is adequate to perform approximately the same data accuracy achieve by a cluster. Practical Implementation: Measuring humidity and moisture content in an agricultural field, measuring temperature in physical environment.
