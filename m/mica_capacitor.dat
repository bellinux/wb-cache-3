25|$|The higher {{permittivity}} {{resulted in}} much higher capacitance values, {{but this was}} coupled with relatively unstable electrical parameters.

25|$|Even in {{the early}} years of Marconi's {{wireless}} transmitting apparatus, porcelain capacitors were used for high voltage and high frequency application in the transmitters. On the receiver side, the smaller <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors</b> were used for resonant circuits. <b>Mica</b> dielectric <b>capacitors</b> were invented in 1909 by William Dubilier.

50|$|William Dubilier (July 25, 1888 - July 25, 1969) was an American {{inventor}} in {{the field}} of radio and electronics. He demonstrated radio communication at Seattle's Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition on June 21, 1909; ten years before the first commercial station operated. A graduate of Cooper Union, {{he was the first to}} use sheets of naturally occurring mica as the dielectric in a <b>capacitor.</b> <b>Mica</b> <b>capacitors</b> were widely used in early radio oscillator and tuning circuits because the temperature coefficient of expansion of mica was low, resulting in very stable capacitance - <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors</b> are still used where exceptional temperature stability is needed.|$|R

5000|$|Silver <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are high}} precision, stable and {{reliable}} capacitors. They {{are available in}} small values, and are mostly used at high frequencies and in cases where low losses (high Q) and low capacitor change over the time is desired.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic plate {{capacitors}} {{are usually}} favoured due to extremely low inductance and low cost. Where precision is needed, silver <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors</b> offer superior precision and stability.

50|$|Now obsolete, {{these were}} {{in use in}} the early 20th century. They {{consisted}} of sheets of mica and copper foil sandwiched together and clamped. These had even worse tolerance and stability than other clamped <b>capacitors</b> since the <b>mica</b> surface is not perfectly flat & smooth.

25|$|Mica is {{a natural}} {{material}} and not available in unlimited quantities. So in the mid-1920s the deficiency of mica in Germany and the experience in porcelain—a special class of ceramic—led in Germany to the first capacitors using ceramic as dielectric, founding a new family of ceramic capacitors. Paraelectric titanium dioxide (rutile) {{was used as the}} first ceramic dielectric because it had a linear temperature dependence of capacitance for temperature compensation of resonant circuits and can replace <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors.</b> 1926 these ceramic capacitors were produced in small quantities with increasing quantities in the 1940s. The style of these early ceramics was a disc with metallization on both sides contacted with tinned wires. This style predates the transistor and was used extensively in vacuum-tube equipment (e.g., radio receivers) from about 1930 through the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Planté also {{investigated}} {{the differences between}} static electricity and dynamic electricity (i.e., from batteries). As part of this investigation, Planté invented a mechanical device that he called the Rheostatic Machine. The Rheostatic Machine used a bank of <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors,</b> a clever rotating commutator {{and a series of}} contacts to alternately charge a bank of capacitors in parallel (from a high-voltage battery source) and then connect the capacitors in series. This arrangement multiplied the battery voltage by the number of capacitor stages to obtain very high voltages. By rapidly rotating the shaft, a series of high-voltage sparks many centimetres long could be generated rapidly. This device was a mechanical predecessor of the modern-day Marx generator. Using this device, Planté explored the electrical breakdown of air, the formation of Lichtenberg figures, and the behaviour of thin wires when pulsed by high electric currents.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The precise {{measurement}} of a capacitance difference or ratio {{in a digital}} form {{is very important for}} capacitive sensors, for CMOS process characterization {{as well as for the}} realization of precise switched-capacitor data converters, amplifiers and other circuits utilizing ratioed capacitors. This thesis introduces design techniques for on-chip capacitor ratio testing and sensor readout that utilize sigma-delta modulation and integrate the sensor capacitors into the modulator. Several single-ended circuits are introduced, and the correlated-double-sampling (CDS) technique is used in the circuits to reduce the non-ideal effects of opamps. Several simple calibration schemes for clock-feedthrough cancellation are also introduced and discussed. A fully-differential implementation is also described and various common-mode feedback schemes are discussed and analyzed. Simulation and experimental results show that these circuits can provide extremely accurate results even in the presence of non-ideal circuit effects such as finite opamp gain, opamp input offset and noise, and clock-feedthrough effect from the switches. To verify the effectiveness of the circuits and simulations, two prototype chips containing a single-ended realization and a fully-differential one were designed and fabricated in a 1. 2 μm CMOS technology. Two off-chip <b>mica</b> <b>capacitors</b> were used in the test circuits, and the measured results show that very accurate results can be obtained using these circuit techniques even with off-chip noise coupling and large parasitic capacitances...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} concept of pulsed plasma {{thruster}} (PPT) micropulsing. Micropulsing was a premise behind a power processing unit (PPU) and an energy storage unit (ESU) design that for certain mission profiles, it was advantageous to operate a PPT at lower energy but higher frequency rather than at a higher energy but lower frequency. This premise allows for reductions in the ESU volume and mass without paying a penalty in thrust. To complete the evaluation, an independent spark plug initiation unit, a {{high voltage power supply}} and a variety of <b>mica</b> foil <b>capacitors</b> at 2. 6, 5, 10, and 20 capacitance were used to conduct a series of tests on a single PPT to map performance levels of thrust, impulse bit, efficiency and specific impulse over a comparable power range. Testing at NASA Glenn Research Center was conducted with breadboard PPT hardware. The test results showed that operating in the lower energy ESU micropulsing mode produced similar thrust levels to a higher energy ESU operating at high power level. Further testing however showed a reduction in specific impulse and efficiency when the smaller capacitances were used at the highest power levels. This would require more fuel mass for a mission that was predominately high power, potentially negating the ESU mass savings. Therefore, micropulsing is advantageous where most of a mission profile occurs at low power, but retains the ability to conduct high thrust maneuvers when necessary...|$|R
