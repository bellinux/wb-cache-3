50|$|Drilling was {{performed}} using a conventional core wireline {{system with a}} <b>drill</b> <b>derrick,</b> protected by a cover against the rough climate. Sea ice was 2 m thick with a water depth of 150 - 300 m below. Four overlapping drill cores at three sites reflect in excellent quality the geological history and glaciation of the Antarctic during the last 34 million years.|$|R

5000|$|The Upper <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick</b> {{is located}} in a half timbered {{building}} and was restored by a local initiative from 2006 until 2009 and is a Museum since. The Lower <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick,</b> directly adjacent to the Brine Reservoir, is still operating and is pumping brine. A small timbered structure was erected over the first brinewell in 1668 which survived until the 1960 and was taken away than to make room for a wider road intersection at Solstraße and Severshuser Weg. It was called [...] "Solhaus" [...] and reconstructed a few meters from the original site in 1992.The old administrative building, Faktoreihaus, of the than state owned salt works was constructed in 1694. It is located on Solstraße and survives in only slightly altered form. On the right hand side of the building is the chapel used for church services until today (2014). The protruding part of the office building was made so that the officers had {{a good view of the}} works area. The building got it´s present form after a rebuild in 1910. There are a few other buildings around Salinenplatz which have been erected in conjunction with the salt works.|$|R
2500|$|With {{critical}} support structures burned away, {{and with}} nothing to support the heavier structures on top, the platform began to collapse. One of the cranes collapsed, followed by the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick.</b> The generation and utilities Module (D), which included the fireproofed accommodation block, slipped into the sea, taking the crewmen huddled inside with it. The largest part of the platform followed it. [...] "Rescue 138" [...] lands on Tharos [...] {{and picks up the}} 12 non-essential personnel, before leaving for Ocean Victory.|$|R

2500|$|World Saga {{was taken}} to Hitachi Zosen {{shipyard}} in Sakai, Japan, where all but the forward two-thirds of the tanker's hull were scrapped. The remaining section was reinforced with 7,000 tonnes of additional steel and strengthened against ice with 13,000 tonnes of concrete that formed a [...] thick inner hull. A new 4,000-ton topside with <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick,</b> cranes, helipad and accommodation block was installed {{on top of the}} ice-strengthened hull. The drilling unit was given the name SSDC, short for single steel drilling caisson.|$|R

50|$|The {{oil field}} was {{discovered}} in 1998 by the Ocean America semi-submersible, <b>mobile</b> <b>drilling</b> rig operating in a water depth of 1870 m. The discovery was later confirmed by wells drilled by GSF C.R. Luigs and Glomar Explorer. Production started in October 2007.|$|R
50|$|Jack-up <b>Mobile</b> <b>Drilling</b> Units (or jack-ups), as {{the name}} suggests, are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered, much like jacks. These MODUs (<b>Mobile</b> Offshore <b>Drilling</b> Units) are {{typically}} used in water depths up to 120 m, although some designs can go to 170 m depth. They are designed to move from place to place, and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a {{rack and pinion gear}} system on each leg.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{exploration}} {{is performed}} {{in a number of}} ways, {{one of the most common}} being <b>mobile</b> <b>drilling</b> platforms or ships that are moved from area to area as needed to drill into the seabed to find out what deposits may or may not lie beneath it.|$|R

50|$|Small <b>mobile</b> <b>drilling</b> rigs {{are also}} used to drill or bore piles. Rigs can range from 100 ton {{continuous}} flight auger (CFA) rigs to small air powered rigs used to drill holes in quarries, etc. These rigs use the same technology and equipment as the oil drilling rigs, just on a smaller scale.|$|R
50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, {{coiled tubing}} refers to a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a <b>Mobile</b> Offshore <b>Drilling</b> Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self-contained coiled tubing rig can be used.|$|R
50|$|The rig {{was built}} as a <b>mobile</b> <b>drilling</b> unit at a French shipyard, and {{delivered}} to Stavanger Drilling in July 1976. The floating drill rig was not used for drilling purposes but served as a semi-submersible 'flotel' providing living quarters for offshore workers. By 1978, additional accommodation blocks had {{been added to the}} platform, so that up to 386 persons could be accommodated.|$|R
50|$|The first {{offshore}} <b>mobile</b> <b>drilling</b> platform was the Hayward-Barnsdall Breton Rig 20, first {{operated in}} 1949. This rig had {{evolved from the}} inland drilling barges which were used to drill in marshes and protected waters in up to 10 feet of water. The Breton Rig 20 was 160 feet by 85 feet, and could work in 20 feet water depth.|$|R

To its left sits a mound of pipes, while a smoke stack of five sits {{directly}} behind it. Four other oilrigs {{can be seen in}} the left background behind the first derrick, each with a variety of construction equipment at its base, and two other five-fold stacks {{can be seen in the}} distance. The second derrick in the row has what appears to be a small shelter built into its base, beside which lie several house-like structures to the right. In the left foreground, a stair built into a soil mound leads down toward several pump-like structures. The distance is lined with dune-like mounds of land...|$|R
5000|$|On May 12, {{the same}} day Port Commissioners filed an appeal of the city's land use permit decision, Shell's {{drillship}} Noble Discoverer arrived in Everett, Washington {{on its way to}} Bellingham, Washington. The ship, [...] is a Liberian-flagged Sonat Discoverer-class drillship built in 1966 by Namura Shipbuilding and owned by Noble Corporation, weighing , 514 ft long with a 175 ft tall <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> capable of <b>drilling</b> in 1000 ft of water to a drilling depth of 20000 ft. It was met by 10 protesters in kayaks, along with a Greenpeace motorboat carrying reporters. The kayakers displayed banners reading [...] "ShellNo.org" [...] and [...] "Arctic drilling = climate chaos". The Everett protest was described by one kayaktivist as [...] "just a warm up" [...] for the upcoming event in Seattle.|$|R

5|$|Underground mine shafts, some {{reaching}} depths over , {{were created}} for the extraction of metal ores. Borehole <b>drilling</b> and <b>derricks</b> were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt. The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines. Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via carburetor chambers and exhaust pipes.|$|R
