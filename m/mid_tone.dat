25|$|The {{representation}} of tone. Most non-linguistic transcriptions of Mixtec {{do not fully}} record the tones. When tone is represented, acute accent over the vowel is typically used to indicate high tone. <b>Mid</b> <b>tone</b> is sometimes indicated with a macron over the vowel, {{but it may be}} left unmarked. Low tone is sometimes indicated with a grave accent overt the vowel, but it might be left unmarked, or it might be indicated with an underscore to the vowel.|$|E
25|$|The onset k is not written, {{so that a}} rime letter (V) {{written by}} itself is read as kV. Nor is the rime au (on <b>mid</b> <b>tone)</b> written, so that an onset letter (C) written by itself is read Cau, except {{following}} a bare rime, as otherwise these could {{be read as a}} single syllable. The absence of an onset, however, is indicated with a null-onset letter. Again, this is similar to an abugida, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed.|$|E
25|$|Tlingit {{has eight}} vowels, four vowels further {{distinguished}} formally by length. However, the length distinction is often {{in terms of}} tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an acute accent, e.g. áa, and low tone is unmarked, e.g. aa. The Southern and Transitional dialects have a <b>mid</b> <b>tone</b> which is unmarked and additional low tone which {{is marked by a}} grave accent, e.g. àa.|$|E

In the second example, the Low tone of the first syllable of ọ̀bẹ is not as easily deleted; it causes a downstep (marked by , a lowering of subsequent tones. The ease with which the <b>Mid</b> <b>tone</b> gives way is attributed to it not being specified underlyingly. Cf. Bamgboṣe 1966:9 (who calls the downstep effect 'the assimilated low tone').) Every syllable must {{have at least one}} tone; a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones. Contour tones (i.e. rising or falling tone melodies) are usually analysed as separate tones occurring on adjacent tone bearing units (morae) and thus have no phonemic status. Tones are marked by use of the acute accent for high tone ( [...] , [...] ), the grave accent for low tone ( [...] , [...] ); Mid is unmarked, except on syllabic nasals where it is indicated using a macron ( [...] , [...] ); ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{historical}} murmured consonant (voiced aspirate consonant) in word {{initial position}} became tenuis {{and left a}} low tone on the two syllables following it: ghoṛā [...] "horse". A stem-final murmured consonant became modally voiced and left a high tone on the two syllables preceding it: māgh [...] "October". A stem-medial murmured consonant which appeared after a short vowel and before a long vowel became modally voiced and left a low tone on the two syllables following it: maghāuṇā [...] "to have something lit".

2500|$|Pahawh Hmong is a non-segmental {{script that}} {{indicates}} syllable onsets and rimes, such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants. Thus {{it is not}} segmental and cannot be considered an abugida. However, it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Most syllables are written with two letters in the order rime–onset (typically vowel-consonant), {{even though they are}} pronounced as onset-rime (consonant-vowel), rather like the position of the [...] vowel in Devanagari, which is written before the consonant. Pahawh is also unusual in that, while an inherent rime [...] (with <b>mid</b> <b>tone)</b> is unwritten, it also has an inherent onset [...] For the syllable , which requires {{one or the other of}} the inherent sounds to be overt, it is [...] that is written. Thus it is the rime (vowel) that is basic to the system.|$|E

50|$|Tone {{terracing}} {{is a type}} of phonetic downdrift, {{where the}} high or <b>mid</b> <b>tones,</b> but not the low tone, shift downward in pitch (downstep) after certain other tones. The result is that a tone may be realized at a certain pitch over a short stretch of speech, shifts downward and then continues at its new level, then shifts downward again, {{until the end of the}} prosodic contour is reached, at which point the pitch resets. A graph of the change in pitch over time of a particular tone resembles a terrace.|$|R
50|$|However, a phonetic downstep occurs {{between any}} two {{adjacent}} mid tones as well. In fact, a high tone {{is defined as}} any tone {{that is at the}} same pitch as a preceding high or mid tone; a <b>mid</b> <b>tone</b> will always be lower in pitch than a preceding high or <b>mid</b> <b>tone.</b> The result is that every instance of a mid or low tone shifts {{the upper end of the}} pitch range downward, until all pitches are reset at the end of the prosodic melody.|$|E
5000|$|The high-mid tone is only {{marginally}} contrastive. Its two main sources are from tone sandhi rules, as {{the outcome of}} a <b>mid</b> <b>tone</b> before another <b>mid</b> <b>tone,</b> and {{the outcome of a}} low-falling tone after a <b>mid</b> <b>tone.</b> However, these changes do not occur in all compounds where they might: for instance wo [...] "bear" [...] + mop [...] "mother" [...] regularly forms wo mox [...] "female bear", but vi [...] "jackal" [...] + mop [...] "mother" [...] forms vi mop [...] "female jackal" [...] without sandhi. The syntax creates other contrasts: tone sandhi applies across the boundary between object and verb, so is present in SOV clauses like mu jy lu ti shex [...] "Mujy looks for Luti", but is absent in OSV clauses like mu jy lu ti shep [...] "Luti looks for Mujy".
