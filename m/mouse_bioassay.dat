40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} isolate and {{genotype}} T.  gondii from Brazilian wildlife. For this purpose, 226 samples were submitted to <b>mice</b> <b>bioassay</b> and screened by PCR based on 18 S rRNA sequences. A total of 15 T.  gondii isolates were obtained, including samples from four armadillos (three Dasypus novemcinctus, one Euphractus sexcinctus), three collared anteaters (Tamandua tetradactyla), three whited-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari), one spotted paca (Cuniculus paca), one oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), one hoary fox (Pseudalopex vetulus), one lineated woodpecker (Dryocopus lineatus) and one maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus). DNA from the isolates, originated from <b>mice</b> <b>bioassay,</b> {{and from the}} tissues of the wild animal, designated as “primary samples”, were genotyped by PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP), using 12 genetic markers (SAG 1, SAG 2, alt.

40|$|Objective: We {{analyzed}} retrospectively {{the relevance}} of 4 years of quality control on homemade culture medium with the mouse IVF and zygote bioassay. Design: In vitro or in vivo fertilized mouse oocytes were cultured in each batch of medium. Two-cell-stage and expanded blastocyst development was recorded for each batch of medium. Data on fertilization and embryo quality obtained in human in vitro fertilization were recorded for each batch IVF treatment cycles for male infertility and cycles with sperm microinjection were excluded. Results: Human oocyte fertilization dropped from 60 to 54 %, respectively, from 57 to 41 % in a significant way (P < 0. 05 resp. P < 0. 01) and the human mean embryo score decreased from 4. 17 ± 1. 21 to 3. 69 ± 1. 06 (P < 0. 05) when media were used with a low two-cell-stage development (≤ 75 %) for the mouse zygote or <b>mouse</b> IVF <b>bioassay.</b> The pregnancy rate was not affected.

Typical CNS spongiform degeneration was observed by histopathology and presence of PrP(res) could be detected both by Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays, confirming for this model {{the absence of an}} interspecies barrier to BSE infection. Differences in incubation times post-inoculation depend upon the expression level of boPrP(C) and the amount of prions in the inoculum. In the absence of clinical signs, pathognomonic markers of disease could be detected as early as 150 or 196 days post-inoculation by IHC and Western blot analysis, respectively. This result indicates that prion infectivity in experimental <b>mouse</b> <b>bioassays</b> can be measured earlier by assessing immunologically the presence of PrP(res) in brains from inoculated animals. Although these transgenic mice were also susceptible to sheep scrapie prion infection, the extent of incubation times was considerably longer and PrP(res) was detected in only 70 % of inoculated mice.

The major in vivo effect of C 17 -SAMT on the mouse neuromuscular system was a dose- and time-dependent decrease of compound muscle action potential amplitude and an increased excitability threshold.
