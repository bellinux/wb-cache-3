5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and <b>marker</b> <b>buoys.</b> The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} moored surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> {{may be used}} to demarcate an area in which diving is taking place. This {{is more likely to be}} used by commercial, {{scientific}} or public service divers to cordon off a work or search area, or an accident or crime scene.|$|E

These may be moored, as a shotline, and indicate the general area with divers, or tethered to one of the divers by a line, indicating the location of the group to people at the surface. This type of buoy is usually brightly coloured for visibility, and may be fitted with one of the diving flag signals.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Bluenose faced Columbia, another American yacht newly {{designed}} and constructed {{to defeat the}} Canadian schooner. The International Fishermen's Trophy race was held off Halifax in 1923 and new rules {{were put in place}} preventing ships from passing <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> to landward. During the first race, the two schooners dueled inshore, the rigging of the vessels coming together. However, Bluenose won the first race. During the second race, Bluenose broke the new rule and was declared to have lost the race. Angus Walters protested the decision and demanded that no vessel be declared winner. The judging committee rejected his protest, which led Walters to remove Bluenose from the competition. The committee declared the competition a tie, and the two vessels shared the prize money and the title. The anger over the events led to an eight-year hiatus in the race.|$|E
500|$|The {{assaults on}} Zeebrugge and Ostend were {{eventually}} launched on 23 April, after twice being delayed by poor weather. The Ostend force arrived off the port shortly before midnight and made final preparations; the monitors took up position offshore {{and the small}} craft moved forward to begin laying smoke. Covering the approach, the monitors opened fire on German shore defences, including the powerful [...] "Tirpitz" [...] battery, which carried [...] guns. As a long range artillery duel developed, the cruisers began their advance towards the harbour mouth, searching for the <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> which indicated the correct passage through the diverse sandbanks which made navigation difficult along the Belgian coast.|$|E

500|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured from aluminium or steel alloys, and are normally fitted {{with one of}} two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to the regulator. Other accessories such as manifolds, cylinder bands, protective nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided. Various configurations of harness {{may be used to}} carry the cylinder or cylinders while diving, depending on the application. Cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume (known as water capacity) of between [...] and a maximum working pressure rating from [...] Cylinders are also available in smaller sizes, such as 0.5, 1.5 and 2 litres, however these are often used for purposes such as inflation of surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys,</b> drysuits and buoyancy compensators rather than breathing. Scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder, a pair of similar cylinders, or a main cylinder and a smaller [...] "pony" [...] cylinder, carried on the diver's back or clipped onto the harness at the sides. Paired cylinders may be manifolded together or independent. In some cases, more that two cylinders are needed.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{small boat}} (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12mm or 14mm rising chain {{attached}} to the [...] "anchor", and a bridle made from 20mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16mm combination steel wire material. [...] The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. [...] Old rail wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. [...] In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may {{be placed in a}} grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. [...] Ropes (particularly for <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> and messenger lines) should be [...] "non floating" [...] to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.|$|E
2500|$|Harder and Hake {{remained}} off Dasol Bay, {{searching for}} new targets. [...] Before dawn 24 August they identified {{what they thought}} was a Japanese minesweeper and the three-stack Siamese destroyer Phra Ruang. It was later found out to be Kaibokan CD-22 and PB-102 (ex-). [...] As Hake closed to attack, the destroyer turned away toward Dasol Bay. Hake broke off her approach, turned northward, and sighted Harders periscope about [...] dead ahead. Swinging southward, Hake then sighted the CD-22 about [...] off her port quarter swinging toward them. To escape the charging escort, Hake started deep and rigged for silent running. At 07:28 she heard 15 rapid depth charges explode in the distance astern. She continued evasive action that morning, then returned to the general area of the attack shortly after noon. She swept the area at periscope depth but found only a ring of <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> covering a radius of one-half mile.|$|E

2500|$|Uncontrolled rate of ascent can {{increase}} risk of decompression sickness and lung overexpansion injury even when diving within the no-stop {{limits of the}} decompression tables, so the skills of buoyancy control during ascent are important for diver safety and are included to some extent in all entry level training, but the criteria for competence vary among the certification agencies. Most, if not all, agencies require the diver {{to be able to}} limit ascent rate {{and to be able to}} achieve neutral buoyancy at a specified depth during an ascent without significantly overshooting the target depth, while using only a depth gauge or dive computer as a reference to depth and ascent rate, but this is a skill which requires considerable practice to master, and few learners can achieve true competence in the short time provided for practicing the skill in recreational entry level diver training. The skills involve venting the buoyancy compensator and where applicable, the dry suit at a rate which provides neutral or slight negative buoyancy at all stages of the ascent, or for highly skilled practitioner, just sufficient positive buoyancy to cause ascent at the desired rate, and neutral buoyancy when a stop is required. Most dry suits intended for scuba diving are fitted with an automatic dump valve, which can be adjusted to provide an approximately constant volume of gas in the suit, so the diver can concentrate on controlling ascent rate by venting the buoyancy compensator. These skills become critical when [...] decompression stops are required, and even divers with excellent buoyancy control will often make use of aids to ascent rate and depth control to reduce risk. Shot lines are used at all levels of diving, and are in common use during entry level training, as a visual aid to ascent rate and depth control, and as a fall-back physical aid. The skills of deploying and using surface <b>marker</b> <b>buoys</b> and decompression buoys are generally considered advanced skills for recreational divers, but may be considered entry level skills for professional divers.|$|E
