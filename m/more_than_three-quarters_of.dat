The procedures include marking, submucosal injection, circumferential mucosal incision and exforiation of the lesion along the submucosal layer.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted within 15 general practices across Rotterdam. The study population was all women older than 18 years of age attending general practice. Women were screened for sociodemographic factors, IPV and depression using the Composite Abuse Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: This study had {{a response rate of}} 63 % (221 of 352 women). Two hundred and fourteen women were included in the study of whom 41 % were migrants.

It is known that a child may get affected several times in a year; the incidence increases with the aggravation {{of a state of}} malnutrition. Aim: The study was aimed to assess the malnutrition and morbidity profile in underfive children in urban slum area of Nagpur. Material &amp; Methods: A house-to-house survey was conducted. By systematic random sampling 434 children below five years of age were included in the study. Every attempt was made to cover maximum number of children by giving 3 visits to them. Total 404 children were covered in the study. The information obtained from childâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s mother was filled in the proforma. Every child was subjected to thorough clinical examination in daylight, and anthropometric measurements. Hemoglobin estimation was done by using Sahliâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s haemoglobinometer and peripheral smear was prepared. Data was analyzed on Epi-Info Software 3. 2 version. Chi square test is used to test the significance. Result: It was observed that highest prevalence of morbidity was of anaemia (78. 71 percent), most of them were nutritional: followed by protein energy malnutrition (IAP classification) was 52. 23 percent, vitamin B deficiency (46. 53 percent), disease of respiratory system 32. 19 percent).

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{evaluating}} child feeding in Madagascar {{are scarce}} despite its importance in child growth {{during the first}} two years of life. This study assessed the associations between the WHO infant and young child feeding (IYCF) indicators and stunting and identified determinants of inappropriate child feeding practices. Methods The most recent Demographic and Health Survey was used including a total of 1956 infants aged 0 – 23 months. Logistic regressions were performed for the association between IYCF indicators and stunting and for the determination of risk factors for inappropriate feeding practices. Results The rates of initiation of breastfeeding within one hour after birth (77. 2 %), continued breastfeeding at one year (99. 6 %) and timely introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6 – 8 months (88. 3 %) were high. Exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months (48. 8 %), attaining minimum dietary diversity (22. 2 %) and consumption of iron-rich foods (19. 6 %) were relatively low. Higher length-for-age was associated with achieving minimum dietary diversity (p< 0. 01). The other indicators assessed (early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, timely introduction of complementary foods and consumption of iron-rich foods) were not associated with stunting. Infants born to mothers who had first given birth at an age younger <b>than</b> 19 were <b>more</b> likely not to be breastfed within one hour after birth, not to be exclusively breastfed and not to have the recommended dietary diversity. Infants whose mothers had low media exposure were at increased risk of being inappropriately fed. Low household wealth also was associated with higher odds of not meeting the minimum dietary diversity. Conclusions Despite almost total continued breastfeeding at one year and early initiation <b>of</b> breastfeeding by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three-quarter</b> <b>of</b> mothers, minimum dietary diversity scores were still low, confirming the need for more effective programs for improving child feeding practices in Madagascar. Improving dietary diversity in children aged 6 – 23 months may help reduce stunting.
