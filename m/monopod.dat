For the North American market a model dubbed the Graduate was added in tribute to the car's famous appearance in the 1967 film, The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{different}} types of <b>monopod</b> head available, and ball heads offer the most flexibility. They allow you to shoot in portrait or landscape orientation, and angle your camera to adjust for any sloping of the <b>monopod.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{place of}} or to {{supplement}} a tripod, some photographers use a one-legged telescoping stand called a <b>monopod</b> for convenience in setup and breakdown. A <b>monopod</b> requires the photographer {{to hold the}} camera in place, but because the <b>monopod</b> reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the camera, and also because the photographer no longer has to support {{the full weight of}} the camera, it can provide some of the same stabilization advantages as a tripod.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Monopods</b> {{appear in}} Aristophanes' play The Birds, first {{performed}} in 414 BC. They are described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he reports travelers' stories from encounters or sightings of <b>Monopods</b> in India. Pliny remarks {{that they are}} first mentioned by Ctesias in his book Indika (India), {{a record of the}} view of Persians of India which only remains in fragments. Pliny describes <b>Monopods</b> like this: ...|$|R

50|$|If you're {{shooting}} using a long, heavy telephoto lens, it's {{better to}} use a tripod mount ring. This fixes the <b>monopod</b> to the lens rather than the camera body, giving better balance and stopping the <b>monopod</b> from rotating in your hands {{as you try to}} position it.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Monopod</b> {{utilizes}} {{the same}} iStabilizer Mount technology {{to secure the}} device.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a tripod, <b>monopods</b> cannot {{support a}} camera independently. In {{the case of}} still cameras, this limits the shutter speed that can be used. They still allow lower shutter speeds than hand holding, and are easier to carry and use than a tripod. Because it confers less {{stability}} than a tripod, <b>monopods</b> may present difficulties when {{trying to get a}} good image with very low light photography, i.e. night time, and shots where you need a 100% stable camera for example shooting light trails or landscapes with extreme depth of field.|$|R
5000|$|Gitzo {{also used}} the term [...] "performance" [...] to {{distinguish}} tripods which offered multiple leg angles of 24° and 55° (plus an additional 80° leg angle on Inter Pro Studex, Pro Studex, and Tele Studex models), compared with [...] "standard" [...] tripods that had a fixed leg opening angle of 24°. [...] "Mountaineer" [...] tripods and <b>monopods</b> are manufactured with carbon fiber legs. [...] "Safari" [...] tripods and <b>monopods</b> (now discontinued) featured an olive drab finish and reversed legs, where the largest-diameter section is on the bottom, to improve environmental sealing.|$|R
5000|$|Also in The Chronicles of Narnia the Dufflepuds are dwarfs {{who have}} been {{transformed}} into <b>monopods</b> as a punishment. However, it ultimately transpires that they are happier with their new form.|$|R

5000|$|Hai-uri and Bi-Bloux are man-eating creatures {{which have}} only one leg and one arm, and travel by jumping, similar to the <b>monopods</b> in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia. Hai-uri is the male variant, while Bi-Bloux is female.|$|R

50|$|In some {{situations}} a tripod head {{may be used}} without a set of tripod legs. Heads can be attached to <b>monopods</b> to provide more versatility, or to a simple plate with a base mount for when {{the height of a}} full tripod is unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|Miller Camera Support Equipment is the {{commercial}} name of R. E. Miller Pty Ltd, an independent Australian manufacturer of tripods, fluid heads and various accessories for professional camera systems (dollies, spreaders and other camera supports such as <b>monopods</b> and pedestal systems).The company supplies ENG/EFP equipment to broadcast and government.|$|R
50|$|<b>Monopods</b> {{known as}} finnsticks {{are also used}} to steady {{high-power}} (typically, 10× or more) binoculars to permit a clear view without shake or wobble introduced by the user's hand and body movements. With the introduction of gyroscopically stabilized binoculars, the use of stabilizing supports for binoculars have declined in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Finnsticks {{are also}} commercially {{available}} and some binocular manufacturers provide an attachment for a finnstick (or a <b>monopod)</b> as an accessory.|$|E
50|$|Davy (49/30A) and Bessemer (49/23E) were {{developed}} by Amoco in 1995. Both are <b>monopod</b> installations. Both produce gas to Inde 49/23A.|$|E

5000|$|In 1992, Gitzo {{became part}} of the Vitec group, which also owns Manfrotto. Vitec are {{described}} in corporate literature as [...] "a multinational holding company specialised in supporting professional photographers, broadcasters and filmmakers." [...] 1992 also marked the discontinuance of products outside camera support systems, including tripods, <b>monopods,</b> and tripod heads.|$|R
5000|$|An {{adjustable}} sling {{is often}} fitted on the rifle, {{used by the}} sniper to achieve better stability when standing, kneeling, or sitting. The sniper uses the sling to [...] "lock-in" [...] by wrapping his non-firing arm into the sling forcing his arm to be still.Non-static weapon mounts, such as bipods, <b>monopods</b> and shooting sticks, are also regularly used to aid and improve stability and reduce operator fatigue.|$|R
50|$|Lucy soon {{sees the}} magician as a kind, wise fellow {{with a good}} sense of humor, hardly the terrifying sorcerer the Duffers made him out to be. He {{suggests}} that she try to convince the Duffers that their new appearance is nicer than their former one, which she succeeds in doing. The dwarfs rename themselves <b>Monopods,</b> but keep mixing it up with their old name and {{come to be known as}} Dufflepuds.|$|R
50|$|Monopods {{are often}} {{equipped}} with a ball swivel, allowing some freedom to pan and tilt the camera while the <b>monopod</b> remains relatively stationary.|$|E

50|$|Gitzo {{introduced}} the first professional carbon fiber tripod and <b>monopod</b> at Photokina in 1994. The Gitzo factory in Paris was expanded in 1996 to 6200 m2.|$|E
50|$|In the story, the Duffers or 'Dufflepuds', a {{tribe of}} monopodal dwarves, inhabit {{a small island}} {{near the edge of}} the Narnian world along with a Star magician named Coriakin, who {{transformed}} them into <b>monopods</b> as a punishment. They were so unhappy with their appearance that they made themselves invisible. Lucy Pevensie later made them visible again. They were (re)discovered by explorers from the Narnian ship the Dawn Treader which had landed on the island to rest and resupply.|$|R
50|$|To aid in {{capturing}} panned pictures, photographers use aids such as tripods and <b>monopods,</b> {{which make}} it easy to swing the camera along one plane, while keeping it steady in the others. A low budget option is to tie a piece of string around the lens, then to drop the other end to the floor and step on it to pull it taut. This will allow a little bit more stability and allow for smoother blur.|$|R
5000|$|Gitzo {{have used}} a variety of materials. Early Gitzo tripods and <b>monopods</b> were {{manufactured}} from aluminum alloys, finished in the characteristic 'noir décor' hammered grey powder coating process developed in the 1970s. In 1994, carbon fiber legs were introduced into the range. In 2004, Gitzo introduced a new [...] "basalt" [...] series with tubes manufactured from silica fibers drawn from crushed and melted basalt rock, touting its vibration-damping properties. By 2015, carbon fiber was the sole leg material offered.|$|R
