40|$|The {{influence}} of globalisation on banking business is expressed, mainly, in {{an increasing number}} of mergers and acquisitions which are occurring in the banking and financial services industries. Firstly, it {{is the result of a}}bolition of restrictions for foreign financial institutions’ entrance into domestic banking markets. Also, consolidation of banking capital is the result of a global crisis. Therefore, bank managers, directors and shareholders need to have a sense of the bank's value in order to make an informed decision about whether to remain independent or combine with another institution. In addition to evaluating an offer to sell, there are other instances in which institutions should know their market value. The value-based management skill is one of the main components of successful doing business today. Owners and managers should know whether their company is able to enhance value with the existing organisation structure. However, the concept of value makes sense only if it is possible to estimate it. Therefore, the problem of business valuation becomes extremely actual both for potential investors, and for owners of business. The objectives of the paper are to (i) study the experience of other countries in the area of valuation of commercial banks, (ii) identify most suitable valuation methods for application in emerging markets and (iii) develop a methodology of applying these methods to the valuation of a Latvian bank taking into account the specifics of Latvian banking sector. The publication includes description of the method of Discounted Cash flow (DCF method). The DCF methodology values a bank as the present value of the cash flows which the bank may distribute to shareholders. Thus, a valuation of a financial institution is undertaken by projecting the after tax business cash flows available to equity holders and discounting these cash flows at the cost of equity. Using this method, special attention should be paid to the following components: Cash flow forecasts. The DCF valuation is dependent on the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts used to generate the projected distributable cash flows. Various scenarios should be created in order to understand the impact on valuation of different outcomes and the value drivers which most heavily impact valuation. Distributable cash flow. The distributable cash flow is defined as the maximum amount which the bank may pay to its shareholders in any given year. The <b>maximum</b> <b>distributable</b> <b>amount</b> is determined by (i) the bank’s required capital ratio (capital divided by risk weighted assets); and (ii) the cash flows generated by operations. If a bank grows its risk weighted assets, it must retain at least part of its earnings to increase its capital thus reducing the distributable cash flows. Discount rate. The discount rate reflects the “riskiness” of a bank. It is the rate of return which an investor would expect from an investment into the bank. In the given paper two methods of discount rate determination are examined: Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) and build-up approach (method of risk summation). Terminal Value. The bank continues to generate valuable cash flows after the end of the forecast period. These cash flows are valued as the present value of perpetuity. The authors of the given article suggest practical recommendations for bank valuation considering specificity of Latvian banking business: (1) Algorithm of valuation using DCF method; (2) Model of factors influencing projected cash flows; (3) Recommendations for calculation of discount rate are given; (4) The express method for checking the reliability of the estimated value is suggested. The following recommendations can be used in any country with undeveloped stock market, and/or in case, if company’s shares are not quoted...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the scenario where a company C manufactures in bulk pure entangled pairs of particles, each pair intended for a distinct pair of distant customers. Unfortunately, its delivery service is inept - {{the probability that}} any given customer pair receives its intended particles is S, and the customers cannot detect whether an error has occurred. Remarkably, {{no matter how small}} S is, it is still possible for C to distribute entanglement by starting with non-maximally entangled pairs. We determine the <b>maximum</b> entanglement <b>distributable</b> for a given S, and also determine the ability of the parties to perform nonlocal tasks with the qubits they receive.

40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that two balance sheets, one {{at the beginning and}} one {{at the end of the}} period, and an income statements, together with its related retained earnings reconciliation statement, are raw materials for preparing the funds flow statement. The author has developed a new practice of preparing the statement directly from the accounts record, without balance sheets and other financial statements, for the purpose of presenting a method of reporting the flow of funds over any shorter period than a fiscal year A trial balance is prepared over a period on which the fund flow statement is intended to be made that consists of only entries of increase and decrease in every account based upon transactions taken place over the period. This trial balance may be called a " Funds Flow Trial Balance," which is defferent from the trial balance prepared under the usual accounting practice in that the former does not involve the figure of the beginning balance in each account The funds flow trial balance is the basic data with which the funds flow statement is provided, because this trial balance involves the same figures as the comparative balance sheet figures with which the funds flow statement is prepared under the traditional method. The funds flow trial balance can be prepared at any time, even in the middle of the fiscal year wherever the accounts record is available, without making financial statements, while it is only after the financial statements have been made that the comparative balance sheet figures can be provided. This method can be applied to the preparation of the fiscal fund flow statement, and it opens the way of determining the net income for the year from the fiscal funds flow statement. The author illustrates this process on a work sheet through which the reader may understand in more real feature the relationship between the flow of funds and of the income in a certain business entity. If the flow of funds could be presented with the revenue and expense on the financial statements, the latter would more clearly disclose the process of coming out the net income than they do at present and the more real extent of <b>distributable</b> <b>amount</b> of income would be measured. The author illustrates a form of combining the funds statement with the income statement and the retained earnings reconciliation statement, and combining the "Changes of Working 1 Capital" with the balance sheet...|$|R
