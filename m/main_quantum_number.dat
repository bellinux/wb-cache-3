Pauli realized that the Zeeman effect must be due only to the outermost electrons of the atom, and was able to reproduce Stoners shell structure, but with the correct structure of subshells, by his inclusion of a fourth quantum number and his exclusion principle (1925): It should be forbidden for more than one electron with the same value of the <b>main</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> n to have the same value for the other three quantum numbers k l, j ml and m ms. The Schrödinger equation, published in 1926, gave three of the four quantum numbers as a direct consequence of its solution for the hydrogen atom: this solution yields the atomic orbitals that are shown today in textbooks of chemistry (and above). The examination of atomic spectra allowed the electron configurations of atoms to be determined experimentally, and led to an empirical rule (known as Madelungs rule (1936), see below) for the order in which atomic orbitals are filled with electrons.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{relative}} rates of different charmonium states and introduce an improved model for mapping the continuous c¯c mass spectrum {{on the physical}} charmonium resonances. The theoretical description of charmonium production separates the hard and soft parts of the process based on the factorisation theorem in QCD. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) should be applicable for c¯c production, since the charm quark mass mc {{is large enough to}} make αs(m 2 c) a small expansion parameter. The formation of bound hadron states occurs through processes with small momentum transfers making αs large and preventing the use of perturbation theory. This forces us to use phenomenological models to describe the formation of charmonium states from perturbatively produced c¯c pairs. The Colour Evaporation (CEM) 1 and Soft Colour Interaction (SCI) 2, 3 models are based on a similar phenomenological approach, where soft colour interactions can change the colour state of a c¯c pair from octet to singlet. They employ the same hard pQCD processes to produce a c¯c pair regardless of its spin state. A colour singlet c¯c pair with an invariant mass below the threshold for open charm (mc¯c < 2 mD) will then form a charmonium state. Mapping c¯c pairs onto charmonium states is based on phenomenological parameters taken from comparison to data (CEM), or from spin statistics (SCI), the latter resulting in a fraction of a specific quarkonium state i with total angular momentum Ji and <b>main</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> ni given by fi...|$|E
40|$|Noncanonical {{quantization}} schemes {{have been}} proposed in quantum physics long time ago. Recalling some of them I associate these investigations to the quantum mechanical im-plications of the canonically inequivalent Hamilton formula-tions of classical Newtonian dynamics. As the simplest illus-tration of such alternative Hamiltonian descriptions I consider one dimensional system of two particles interacting harmoni-cally. Description of the motion of their center of mass is stan-dard and guarantees the Galilean covariance but the internal motion {{is described as a}} noncanonical oscillator for which the Hamiltonian and the total energy are not related by a simple proportionality. Alternative Hamiltonians lead to alternative Poisson structures which may be considered as classical ana-logues of the noncanonical quantum commutation rules. Gen-Concepts of Physics, Vol. I (2004) 11 erated alternative quantizations are consistent with the same Heisenberg equations of motion, i. e., they satisfy the Wigner principle of quantization. For the one dimensional harmonic oscillator the simplest noncanonical algebraic description is given in terms of the Lie algebra so(p, q), p+ q = 3. In such a case the Hamiltonian is still a linear function while the energy is a quadratic polynomial of the <b>main</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b> This leads to nonstandard termodynamical properties obeyed by such a noncanonical oscillator. The 3 -dimensional harmonic oscillator also has a noncanonical description given in terms of the simple Lie algebra, so(p, q), p+ q = 5 in the case under consideration. The most important physical consequence of such a description is the noncommutativity of the coordinate operators, interpreted to be an implication of the noncommu-tative geometry of the underlying spacetime...|$|E
40|$|One-dimensional {{particle}} {{states are}} constructed according to orthogonality conditions, without requiring boundary conditions. Free particle states {{are constructed using}} Dirac’s delta function orthogonality conditions. The states (doublets) depend on two quantum numbers: energy and parity (”+ ” or ”-”). With the aid of projection operators the particles are confined to a constrained region, in a way similar to the action of an infinite well potential. From the resulting overcomplete basis only the mutually orthogonal states are selected. Four solutions are found, corresponding to different non-commuting Hamiltonians. Their energy eigenstates are labeled with the <b>main</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> n and parity ”+ ” or ”-”. The energy eigenvalues are functions of n only. The four cases correspond to different boundary conditions: (I) the wave function vanishes on the boundary (energy levels: 1 +, 2 −, 3 +, 4 −, [...] .), (II) the derivative of the wavefunction vanishes on the boundary (energy levels 0 +, 1 −, 2 +, 3 −, [...] .), (III) periodic boundary conditions (energy levels: 0 +, 2 +, 2 −, 4 +, 4 − 6 +, 6 −, [...] .), (IV) periodic boundary conditions (energy levels: 1 +, 1 −, 3 +, 3 −, 5 +, 5 −, [...] .). Among the four cases, only solution (III) forms a complete basis {{in the sense that}} any function in the constrained region, can be expanded with it. By extending the boundaries of the constrained region to infinity, only solution (III) converges uniformly to the free particle states. Orthogonality seems to be a more basic requirement than boundary conditions. By using projection operators, confinement of the particle to a definite region can be achieved in a conceptually simple and unambiguous way, and physical operators can be written so that they act only in the confined region.

40|$|Cryogenic {{solid-state}} {{targets of}} rare gases {{as well as}} nitrogen and deuterium {{have been developed for}} the measurements of the energy loss of heavy ions in dense, laser produced plasmas. Free-standing targets with a thickness of 1 cm to 1 mm and planar foil-supported targets with a thickness of few hundred of microns have been produced using interchangeable, remotely controlled target growing chambers. The geometry of the targets is determined by the geometry of the growing chamber. In addition to this, work has been contributed to the construction of the portable cryogenic system used for growing the rare gas, nitrogen and deuterium crystals. The first laser plasma experiments were performed by irradiating free standing cubic nitrogen targets with the nhelix laser. Interferometric measurements revealed the electron density of the order of 10 ^ 19 cm^- 3. Additional experiments have been performed with thin foil-supported deuterium targets. The target foil was irradiated from both sides using the nhelix and PHELIX laser systems while the ion beam from UNILAC was used to study the interaction. The electron density values obtained for deuterium plasmas are similar to those for nitrogen plasmas. The outcome of these experiments paves the way to realize beam-plasma interaction experiments at Z 6, employing cryogenic targets. The projectiles of an ion beam transfer momentum and energy to the target particles by Coulomb interactions. The energy loss of the projectiles is therefore also dependent on the ionization energy of the targets. In plasmas the ionization energy of the target particles is determined by its temperature and density. With increasing plasma temperatures and pressures, one obtains a lowering of the ionization energy. This fact has already been established by several authors, however up to now the resulting approximations were too rough. Thus in the present work it is attempted to contribute to a more careful recalculation of the lowering of the ionization energy of dense hydrogen-like bound states. For this purpose the Jacobi-Pade approximation of relative energy level shifts is applied. There the relative energy level shift of the five-fold ionized carbon is determined by the difference between Coulomb and Debye potential and by the kinetic energy of the particles. The shift caused by the kinetic energy has to be found considering the momentum space of the particles, so that nine-fold integrals in phase space have to be calculated. Quantum physically, former numerical calculations for the energy shift were only performed for particle states with zero angular momentum <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers.</b> Presently, a detailed, to a large extent analytical analysis of the shift caused by kinetic energy is given for any angular momentum <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> enabling also an improved analysis of in future developed Jacobi-Pade formulae.
