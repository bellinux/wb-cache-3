50|$|Although {{usually the}} anion of the <b>mineralizer</b> is most active in {{dissolving}} the nutrient material, the cation also exerts an influence in some cases. The <b>mineralizer</b> can interact with impurities {{on the surface}} of the crystal and increase the growth rate. For example, the growth rate for sapphire (Al2O3) and zincite (ZnO) in potassium-containing solution (KOH, K2CO3) is higher in comparison to that in sodium-containing solution (NaOH, Na2CO3). This difference is not readily understood, but are attributed the interaction between potassium and an impurity absorbed on the surface.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxide mineralizers {{are also}} used to control the alumina/silica ratio of zeolites. A typical recipe for the {{production}} of a zeolite includes the <b>mineralizer,</b> the solvent, the seed crystal, a nutrient consisting of silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3), and a template. Templates are cations that direct the polymerization of the anionic building blocks to form a certain zeolite structure. Different templating cations lead to different zeolite structures. Typical templates include tetramethylammonium (TMA), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+). Different zeolites can also be formed by changing the ratios of the nutrient source, the type of <b>mineralizer</b> or the temperature and pH of the reaction. At high pH, zeolites with high alumina content are formed, because hydroxides prevent the ability of silica to condense and oligomerize through the reaction shown above. At lower pH, zeolites with high silica content are favored.|$|E

Cement and plant origin aggregates are hardly compatible, because water-soluble or alkaline environment soluble compounds inhibit cement hydration. To avoid harmful effect on cement hydration, it is necessary to mineralize FHS aggregates with complex <b>mineralizer</b> (which consists of Al 2 (SO 4) 3 and Ca(OH) 2) in order to minimize the impact of hydration retarders on cement hydration. Rational amount of super plasticizer for forming mixture is selected in accordance with viscosity of cement paste. Amount and ratio of <b>mineralizer</b> was selected according to kinetics of hydration temperature of forming mixture, compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). It was determined that the increase in the amount of <b>mineralizer</b> from 27 % to 54 % (estimated based on FHS mass) promotes the cement hydration, shortens the time needed to reach EXO maximum and increases its temperature, because the higher content of the Ca(OH) 2 participates in the process of dissolution and makes the EXO reaction faster. The highest acceleration of cement hydration in a composite sample is caused by optimum amount of component <b>mineralizer</b> which is 54 %. The lower content of component <b>mineralizer</b> did not completely bind sugar released from FHS, therefore, causing inhibition of cement hydration.

They are {{pertinent to the}} hydrology and biochemical cycling of high elevation ecosystems that supply drinking water to major metropolitan areas, and are undergoing change {{as a result of}} N deposition. As biological systems, they are virtually unstudied. In order to gain a basic understanding of these important systems, we studied the seasonal timing of C inputs and microclimate, and how they corresponded to microbial biomass dynamics, in vegetated and unvegetated soils from a high altitude talus slope at 3750 m in the Colorado Front Range. The soil microclimate was described by soil moisture and temperature measurements; C inputs were estimated with measures of eolian dust inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The biomass of different microbial functional groups (glutamate and salicylate <b>mineralizers</b> adapted to different temperatures) was estimated seasonally over 3 years. We found that the soil microclimate can be divided into three distinct seasons: Winter, with free water and temperature between 2. 9 and 0 8 C; spring, characterized by wet isothermal soils (0 8 C); and summer, characterized by hot (mean 10. 3 8 C; range 0 – 29. 3 8 C) dry soils occa-sionally wetted by precipitation. The highest OM inputs to unvegetated soils occurred in spring; PAR only reached soils in the summer.

40|$|Background: Gadolinium-doped ceria is an {{attractive}} electrolyte material for potential application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at intermediate temperatures typically with 10 %- 20 % substitution of Ce+ 4 by Gd+ 3. In particular, 10 % gadolinium-doped ceria {{seems to have the}} highest values of conductivities among the other dopant compositions. Methods: Nanosized powders of gadolinium-doped ceria were prepared by hydrothermal treatment using coprecipitate as a precursor and in the presence of 3 different <b>mineralizer</b> solutions. The powders obtained were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermal analysis, while the electrical behavior of the corresponding pellets were ascertained by AC impedance spectroscopy. Results: Nanocrystalline gadolinium-doped ceria powders with fluorite cubic crystal structure were obtained by hydrothermal treatment. Independent of the <b>mineralizer</b> used, these powders were able to produce very dense ceramics, especially when selecting an optimized sintering cycle.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Some {{parameters}} of the firing of kaolin around 900 ~ are examined: (1) firing shrinkage; (2) densification, hardening and textural evolution of kaolin ceramics.

A very good correlation is observed between shrinkage, final density (residual pore volume) and the strength of the fired clay product.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{compositional}} range and the ﬂexibility of the perovskite lattice, {{there are just}} a few successful examples of colored phases based on this crystal structure. The systems proposed in the literature as pigments encompass alkaline earth titanates – stannates – zirconates and yttrium or rare earth orthoaluminates (doped with transition metals such as Cr and V) and orthoferrites/orthocobaltites as well as alkaline earth or lanthanide Ta – Nb – Ti oxynitrides. The coloration mechanism and technological prospect of these perovskites are outlined, focusing on the only system manufactured at the industrial scale and currently used as ceramic red pigment: the Cr-doped (Y,REE) AlO 3. The color of these perovskites stems from intense absorption of the yellow-to-violet wavelengths by a band occurring at low Cr concentration when the pigment is synthesized with <b>mineralizers.</b> As the origin of such a band is still under debate, new experimental data are here provided. X-ray powder diffraction (associated with structural reﬁnements performed by the Rietveld method) and diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy experimental methods are employed to disclose the mechanism of incorporation of Cr and the role of different <b>mineralizers.</b> The effect of increasing chromium doping on the relaxation of the perovskite structure was investigated through the substitution of isovalent cations with different ionic radii (Cr 3 + after Al 3 + in yttrium orthoaluminates) as well as with almost equivalent ionic radii (Cr 3 + after Ga 3 + in La – Nd orthogallates). The effect of different <b>mineralizers</b> was appraised by adding a salt (chloride, ﬂuoride, or carbonate of Ca, Mg, Na, K, Ba, or La) to the precursor batch of the Y(Al,Cr) O 3 pigment. Although perovskites exhibit the weakest structural relaxation around Cr 3 + ion, meaning that the chromophore is highly “compressed” once in small concentration (i. e., particularly in orthoaluminates), the incorporation of Cr ions occurs with increasing covalency and polarizability of the Cr-O bond. This mechanism is not replicated in orthogallates, where the tiny difference of ionic radii between octahedrally coordinated Cr 3 + (0. 615 Å) and Ga 3 + (0. 62 Å) induces subtle changes in crystal structural and optical properties. Thus, the response to Cr incorporation in terms of both cell and octahedral site distortion is different in Y, La, and Nd perovskites. Final remarks highlight that the red color of Y(Al,Cr) O 3 is developed only in the presence of <b>mineralizers,</b> with Ca salts being the most effective. A little amount of calcium has to be incorporated at the cubic site and the charge mismatch between Y 3 + and Ca 2 + is likely compensated by oxygen vacancies. The intense absorption band responsible for the red color is thought to be originated by the occurrence of Cr 3 +–Ca 2 + pairs with a possible involvement of intervalence Cr 3 +–Cr 4 + charge transfer...|$|R

Mullite yield (%) amounted to 16. 5 for Li 2 CO 3, 18 LiF, 20. 7 MgF 2, 22. 5 MgO, 27. 7 CuF 2 and 29. 3 CuO, and 19. 7 (10 mol%) Li 2 CO 3, at 1000 ℃, and 16. 5 for Li 2 CO 3, 19. 5 LiF, 32. 7 MgF 2, 36. 7 MgO, 52. 0 CuF 2, 57. 3 CuO and 22. 6 (10 mo 1 %) Li 2 CO 3, at 1150 ℃, All rate curves obtained follow the Tammann equation, where the mullite yield increases linearly with log of time and reaches to a saturation αe at a time te. This rate equation does not coincide with those previously proposed, i. e. the pseudo-first order kinetics, the surface rate- and diffusion-determined reaction. Clearly the polarizability of cation and anion (Li : 0. 03, Mg : 0. 3, Cu : 3. 0 F : 0. 81 O : 3. 0 (A 3) of the added <b>mineralizers</b> have effect on the mullite yield. The larger the polarizability becomes, the more the mullite yield increases...|$|R
40|$|National Youth Natural Science Foundation of China [51302284, 6140031038]Wurtzite-structured {{aluminum}} nitride (AlN) hexagonal bipyramids were prepared via a carbothermal reduction nitridation method using alumina and carbon as the raw materials. The {{growth of the}} AlN hexagonal bipyramids {{is dominated by the}} vapor-solid (VS) mechanism with Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2 and Na 2 O acting as <b>mineralizers</b> under alternate gas pressures. The preferred growth direction of the AlN hexagonal bipyramids is [0001]. Photoluminescence spectra of the AlN hexagonal bipyramids showed near-band edge emission at 512 nm at room temperature. The AlN hexagonal bipyramids might be useful for optical micro-devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A highly active, monodispersed {{designer}} crystalline nanoparticulate TiO 2 {{has been}} impregnated onto the activated carbon surface under mild hydrothermal conditions (< 2500 C, P~ 40 bars) which finds the application as photocatalyst. Conventionally TiO 2 is prepared through solid state reactions, etc; further the hydrothermal impregnation of such particulates {{onto the surface}} layers of activated carbon has not been carried out either to. The hydrothermal technique provides an easy and one-step method to obtain monodispersed and well crystallized desired products and also eliminates the high temperature firing or pyrolysis required by the other methods. In the present study various hydrothermal experimental parameters like the starting precursors, <b>mineralizers,</b> temperature, etc., were taken into consideration for the impregnation experiments...|$|R
