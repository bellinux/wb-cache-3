Both sides had gunpowder weapons, but the Jin troops only used gunpowder arrows for destroying the city's <b>moored</b> <b>vessels.</b> The Song used fire arrows, fire bombs, and thunderclap bombs. Fire arrows and bombs were used to destroy Jin trebuchets. The thunderclap bombs were used on Jin soldiers themselves, causing foot soldiers and horsemen to panic and retreat.

[...] The Jin were forced to retreat and make camp by the riverside. In a rare occurrence, the Song made a successful offensive on Jin forces, and conducted a night assault using boats. They were loaded with gunpowder arrows, thunderclap bombs, a thousand crossbowmen, five hundred infantry, and a hundred drummers. Jin troops were surprised in their encampment while asleep by loud drumming, followed by an onslaught of crossbow bolts, and then thunderclap bombs, which caused a panic of such magnitude that they were unable to even saddle themselves and trampled over each other trying to get away. Two to three thousand Jin troops were slaughtered along with eight to nine hundred horses.|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of the MoorMasterTM system by Cavotec MSL in inland shipping is researched. It is an innovative mooring system using vacuum pads with active motion control, utilising a PID controller. A {{case study of}} a 110 m Large Rhine <b>vessel</b> <b>moored</b> directly beside the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (ARK) is performed. In order for the system to be suitable, the ship motions have to remain within certain mooring criteria, while passing vessels {{should not have to}} reduce speed. The forces on the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> caused by the passing vessels are simulated using ROPES, a numerical method based on a 3 D flow model, using the panel method. Three different passing vessels at three different passing distances are simulated. All passing vessels are simulated to sail at the maximum allowed speed in the ARK. Next, the manoeuvring model is used to set up the equations of motion of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel.</b> The external force consists of the forces calculated in the Ropes simulations and the modelled forces of the MoorMasterTM units. Solving these equations results in the ship motions. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringMaritime & Transport Technolog...|$|R

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of Fast Ferry public transport in the Netherlands a number of complaints about wake wash induced hindrance onboard <b>moored</b> <b>vessels</b> appeared. It was already possible to calculate the wake wash characteristics of fast sailing vessels, the progress of these waves in a waterway and their effect on <b>moored</b> <b>vessels.</b> This paper describes the full scale tests carried out to develop the missing relation between the wash induced motions of a moored vessel and the hindrance thereof. Many different combinations of moored ships, passing ships and shore configurations have been realised. An expert panel scored the hindrance due to the motions of the moored vessel. A guideline for maximum ship motions is developed from the results. With this guideline, it can be determined prior to {{the introduction}} of a new innovative vessel with reasonable accuracy if its wake wash will remain within acceptable limits. © 2009 : The Royal Institution of Naval Architects...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{standard}} numerical {{models are}} excellent and accurate tools {{for analysis of}} port plans and design. They link meteorological and oceanographic information to impacts on <b>moored</b> <b>vessels</b> and thereby provide the metocean conditions along the berths. By use of relevant motion and safety criteria for <b>moored</b> <b>vessels,</b> numerical modelling studies can assist the designer and the port owner to determine the optimal protection for the port operation. Operators and users of an exposed port or terminal will {{from time to time}} experience downtime due to adverse weather conditions. Downtime can be associated with strong currents in the approach channel and port entrance or with difficulties encountered for pilot assistance. It can also be due to excessive motions of the vessel resulting in suspension of loading/unloading by cranes or over ramps. If the port operator and the port user receive early information on conditions in and around the port and is able to interpret this information into expected conditions for arriving vessels {{they will be able to}} make prudent decisions on optimal and safe arrival at the port. This paper describes the use of numerical models and state-of-art-methods for ship motion analysis in combination with metocean forecast to build a web-based operational tool for vessels calling at ports and, terminal facilities. The systems present in a user friendly way the forecast exposure at the berths for the coming week which can guide the port operator to select the most suitable time for arrival and berthing and selecting the optimal berth for the planned loading/unloading operation...|$|E
