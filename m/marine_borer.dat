50|$|WPCs do not corrode and {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to rot, decay, and <b>Marine</b> <b>Borer</b> attack, {{though they do}} absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material. They have good workability and can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. WPCs are often considered a sustainable material {{because they can be}} made using recycled plastics and the waste products of the wood industry. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make wood-plastic composite difficult to recycle again after use. They can however be recycled easily in a new wood-plastic composite, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Another major selling point of these materials is their lack of need for paint. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, but are widely available in grays and earth tones. Despite up to 70 percent cellulose content (although 50/50 is more common), the mechanical behavior of WPCs is most similar to neat polymers. Neat polymers are polymerized without added solvents. This means that WPCs have a lower strength and stiffness than wood, and they experience time and temperature-dependent behavior. The wood particles are susceptible to fungal attack, though not as much so as solid wood, and the polymer component is vulnerable to UV degradation. It is possible that the strength and stiffness may be reduced by moisture absorption and freeze-thaw cycling, though testing is still being conducted in this area. Some WPC formulations are sensitive to staining from a variety of agents.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{creosote}} retention level on <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> attack {{and the effects}} of marine exposure in west coast estuaries on the migration of individual creosote components was determined by immersing test panels creosote-treated to five retention levels at three locations along the Pacific Coast. After one year of exposure, the AWPA specified reten-tion of 321 kg/m 3 effectively prevented <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> attack in Oregon estuaries, but several panels treated to 160 kg/m 3 suffered internal attack by shipworms (Bankia setacea). This species was also the most destructive borer of untreated control panels.

Gas chromatographic analyses of creosote component concentrations within test panels revealed an absence of significant migration of components from the panels after one year. However, levels of lower boiling point components in creosote extracted from the wood were substantially lower than those present in the original creosote. Hydrographic differences between sites did not appear to influence creosote component concentrations within the panels during the exposure period.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} organisms {{that have been}} {{isolated}} growing on wood materials submerged in marine aquatic environments. The concern is that any wooden structure placed in the water {{for an extended period}} of time becomes a target for one or more groups of wood degrading organisms. Initial invasion is by marine bacteria and fungi that decompose lignin and cellulose as a source of energy. The superficial infestation of wood by microorganisms is considered to play a minor role in wood degradation. The microbial decay is believed to enhance settlement of <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> larvae leading to subsequent deep attack of the wood. The most important agents of biodeterioration of wood in the sea are the marine wood boring animals. The most common woodborers belong to the crustacean genus Limnoridae (commonly called gribbles) and the mollusks of the family Teredinidae (commonly called shipworms) and Pholadidae. By burrowing into the wood they create internal tunnels. They feed on the wood while excavating the tunnels that also serve as their habitat. These organisms have been responsible for millions of dollars of damage annually to waterfront structures. Strategies to control these borers will be discussed. They include a pre-penetration technique that prevents infestation by placing a barrier around the wood or a post penetration approach that uses chemicals to kill the organisms that have settled before they cause structural damage.

40|$|Non-indigenous {{marine species}} {{are a major}} concern worldwide. For some species, {{insufficient}} historical and biogeographical data can leave their origin and patterns of dispersal difficult to determine. Among such species are marine wood borers. This thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining both historical and biological methods, to address <b>marine</b> <b>borer</b> impacts, management attempts, and their status in New Zealand. This research had two key components. Firstly, a historical review sought to improve the understanding and awareness of the historic impacts and responses to borers, with particular reference to New Zealand between 1850 and 1930. Marine wood borers have had profound impacts throughout history, responsible for significant structural and economic damage to wooden ships and marine infrastructure globally. In New Zealand, trade and economy {{played an important role}} in providing both the transportation vectors and infrastructure for marine wood borers to inhabit. Ongoing trialling of timber alternatives and chemicals for the preservation of infrastructure followed, with little success until the introduction of ferro-concrete in the early 1900 s. When considered in a global context, the New Zealand case study of borer impacts and management attempts highlights their significant role in environmental history. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) sequence analyses were used to examine the questionable invasion histories and status of common marine wood borers in New Zealand. It has been assumed that many marine wood borers invaded New Zealand via wooden ships. However, these purported introductions are historic, and the specific origins of many species are unclear. Species from three families and two phyla were collected around the North Island, New Zealand; Teredinidae (Bivalvia: Mollusca), Sphaeromatidae and Limnoriidae (Isopoda: Arthropoda). Low levels of genetic divergence (0 - 2 %) were found among the New Zealand populations of two species, Limnoria quadripunctata and Sphaeroma quoianum, suggesting a non-indigenous status. Limnoria quadripunctata also showed a close genetic affinity to populations in Chile, supporting a non-indigenous status, with its widespread distribution in New Zealand explained by multiple introductions. For Lyrodus pedicellatus, a lack of genetic affinity to conspecifics sequenced elsewhere (France), greater genetic diversity compared to the native Bankia australis, and evidence of population structuring among New Zealand locations, suggested L. pedicellatus may be native to New Zealand. Lyrodus pedicellatus from New Zealand was highly divergent (> 20 %) from global L. pedicellatus populations, suggesting that either identifications of specimens on global databases are incorrect, or the New Zealand species represents a morphologically undescribed cryptic congener. In conclusion, COI sequences provided a useful tool in elucidating the status of marine wood borers in New Zealand, and highlighted a need for taxonomic resolution of some species. Collectively the two chapters illustrate the knowledge gaps and lack of recognition surrounding marine wood borers, globally and in New Zealand. This research provides an extensive understanding of their significant historical role in marine environmental history and assists in re-evaluation of their current native or non-indigenous status in New Zealand...|$|E

Uses include posts, pilings, charcoal, and fuel. Despite growing in a marine environment, the dry wood is subject to attack by <b>marine</b> <b>borers</b> and termites. Like many species, it contains tannin in the bark and {{has been used to}} tan leather products.|$|R
