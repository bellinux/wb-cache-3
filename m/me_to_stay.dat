There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the podium}} ceremony, {{in which two}} Brazilian drivers participated {{for the first time}} since the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, the top three {{finishers}} appeared in the obligatory press conference. Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out. I guess they thought I could pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|E

500|$|In summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, {{attacker}} Enner Valencia, right-back (on {{loan from}} Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's [...] "more attractive and attacking playing style" [...] or [...] "the statistics [...] show {{the progress that}} West Ham have {{made in the last}} few months." [...] Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of the}} season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> either". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.|$|E
500|$|Hooker's vocal {{alternates}} between sung {{and spoken}} sections. [...] Commenting on Hooker's vocal sections, music historian Ted Gioia notes, [...] "The song has almost no melody. [...] Even less harmony. [...] In fact, {{it is hard}} to call it a song. [...] It's more like a bit of jive steam of consciousness in 4/4 time." [...] Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date {{back to the beginning of}} the blues. [...] The opening line [...] "My mama she didn't allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out all night long" [...] has origins in [...] "Mama Don't Allow", an old dance song. [...] Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles. [...] "Boogie No. 3" [...] by boogie-woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines, [...] "I don't care what Grandma don't allow, play my music anyhow, Grandma's don't 'llow no music playin' in here". Hooker's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry's Swing Club, but do not include the crucial mid-song hook [...] "Boogie, chillen'!" [...] before the guitar break, which gives the song its lyrical identity.|$|E
500|$|On September 20, 2001, dates were {{released}} {{along with the}} track listing of the album. The tour was slated to begin on October 26, 2001, but {{the opening of the}} show was pushed back until October 31 after Spears became ill and was prescribed five days of rest. The tour was postponed one more day due to production delays and finally kicked off at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Before the tour began, Spears announced she planned to give $1 of each ticket to the children of firefighters and police officers killed during the September 11 attacks. She also planned to sell merchandise and auction front row seats, hoping to raise $2million. On February 26, 2002, more North American dates {{were released}} through her official website to kick off in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. The second leg of the tour was sponsored by Samsung. In conjunction with entertainment company WFX, they offered [...] a cell-phone service that featured collectible merchandise and a membership card with access to backstage reports directly from Spears. She stated that [...] " [...] is an exciting new way for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> connected with my fans".|$|E

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E
500|$|Katherine Tina Valentine was {{introduced}} by former executive producer Edward J. Scott, born onscreen during the episode that aired July 30, 1990. She was portrayed by twins Darla and Sandra Greer from 1990 to 1991, with child actress Danielle Ryah taking over the role briefly in 1994. Upon the character's re-introduction as an adult by executive producer Maria Arena Bell on February 6, 2008, actress Elizabeth Hendrickson assumed the role. Hendrickson was previously known {{for her role as}} Maggie Stone on All My Children, one half of the iconic Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone lesbian supercouple. Having been offered the part in 2007 as a ten-episode guest stint, she was soon promoted to a contract status. Reflecting on her casting, Hendrickson described the process as a [...] "lovely surprise" [...] and said, [...] "I used to always watch Y when I was on AMC. I always liked {{the look and feel of}} the show, so I’ve always been a big fan. Chloe wasn’t even on the page when I came in for a chemistry audition." [...] As a result of the character's positive response, Bell decided to write Chloe's backstory which revealed her to be the daughter of long-running character Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) while also providing her with additional storyline. [...] "Everyone is so pleasant here and it's such a great, warm environment and it just feels really right. If they ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> that would be a blessing," [...] Hendrickson said, before being offered a contract. In March 2014, following increased speculation, Hendrickson confirmed her exit from the series, stating: [...] "I need to stretch my wings and fly into the unknown. The one thing that remains true and what I will hold close to my heart as I embark on this new adventure is that I will ALWAYS have you." [...] She made her last appearance on May 27, 2014. Hendrickson reprised the role for one episode on October 14, 2014 to commemorate the passing of Chloe's daughter, Delia. In October 2015, Hendrickson also reprised the role of Chloe from October 12 to 28.|$|E

5000|$|Girardin, one of Rousseau's many admirers, {{invited them}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at a cottage in his garden, {{and they did}} from May 1778.

2500|$|After the walk, Wallenda said it {{was more}} {{difficult}} than he had expected and that [...] "it took every bit of <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> focused". [...] He said that dust had accumulated in his contacts and called the walk unusually stressful. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity [...] "was a dream come true." [...] Skywire Live drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. [...] During the walk itself, viewership increased to 13 million.

2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I {{have no desire to}} simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E

2500|$|Currents {{has also}} been {{frequently}} characterised as a breakup album. Prior to recording, Parker {{made the decision to}} break up with French singer-songwriter Melody Prochet. Several songs on the album examine it from his angle as the instigator of the breakup, which consists of guilt and self-questioning. Parker downplayed the notion that the album was entirely aimed at former lovers, however, and likened it to an inner monologue: [...] "It's really me talking to myself, another part of myself... to my old self, the part of me that resists change and wants <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> as I am." [...] For Parker, the album meant [...] "looking forward and a sudden adoption of confidence." [...] The album's title reflects this, with currents being [...] "these unstoppable forces; the parts of you that are trying to change you." ...|$|E

Horn {{announced that the}} seventh and final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was to be split into two cinematic parts with Yates, once again, as the director. Yates spoke {{of the decision to}} appoint him {{as the director of the}} final films, remarking that [...] "they wanted to do a Harry Potter that felt ... more grown up. What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre thing is, I did one [...] and they asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> for three more, so obviously they liked something." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Vyjayanthimala again had to {{face the}} 1989 Tamil Nadu general election, this time she was opposed by Aladi Aruna of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. She again beat her {{opposition}} by nearly 12584 votes. Later in 1993, she was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India for a six-year term. In 1999, she has resigned from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress party. In her letter to the party's president Sonia Gandhi, she included the reason for her resignation where she said that: [...] "painfully watching the party drifting from its avowed principles after the death of Rajiv Gandhi, the party has lost touch with its grassroots and one can see {{day in and day out}} that sincere party workers are being steadily ignored." [...] she adds more; [...] "increasingly difficult to justify ourselves to the public and my conscience does not allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the party any longer". Later, she joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on 6 September 1999.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May, it was {{announced}} that Farage would continue to serve as the party’s leader, with the BBC reporting: [...] "Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a ‘great success’ and members had ‘unanimously’ rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation". Interviewed about his continued leadership by the BBC the following day, Farage said: [...] "I resigned. I said I'd resign. I turned up to the NEC meeting with letter in hand fully intending to carry that through. They unanimously said they didn't want me to do that, they presented me with petitions, signatures, statements from candidates saying it would be a bad thing for UKIP. So I left the meeting, went and sat in darkened room to think about what to do, and decided for the interest of the party I would accept their kind offer for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and tear up the letter."
