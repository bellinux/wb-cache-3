Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de <b>Marum.</b> <b>Marum</b> succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, but there is no evidence supports that identification.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, the Everett Mills {{was sold}} to the newly created Everett Mills Properties Incorporated at liquidation. The hard-won labor laws that went into effect {{as a result of}} the Bread And Roses strike made it cheaper to {{manufacture}} textiles in the unregulated Southern United States and Lawrence fell into decline. The Mill changed hands again in 1936 and was now owned by Russell T. Knight. For the next 45 years the mill building rented out parcels of real estate to smaller stores and manufacturing concerns including the <b>Marum</b> Knitting Hosiery Factory in 1938 and Cardinal Shoes in 1962 - which made 6-7,000 pairs of shoes daily. Both companies eventually outgrew their spaces and moved into their own facilities.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, N. Rouland {{constructed}} a silk-belted machine that rubbed two grounded tubes covered with hare fur. Edward Nairne developed an electrostatic generator for medical purposes in 1787 {{that had the}} ability to generate either positive or negative electricity, the first of these being collected from the prime conductor carrying the collecting points and the second from another prime conductor carrying the friction pad. The Winter machine possessed higher efficiency than earlier friction machines. In the 1830s, Georg Ohm possessed a machine similar to the Van <b>Marum</b> machine for his research (which is now at the Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany). In 1840, the Woodward machine was developed by improving the Ramsden machine, placing the prime conductor above the disk(s). Also in 1840, the Armstrong hydroelectric machine was developed, using steam as a charge carrier.|$|E

2500|$|In 1785, the Dutch chemist Martinus van <b>Marum</b> was {{conducting}} experiments involving electrical sparking above water {{when he noticed}} an unusual smell, which he attributed to the electrical reactions, failing {{to realize that he}} had in fact created ozone. A half century later, Christian Friedrich Schönbein noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of lightning. In 1839, he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it [...] "ozone", from the Greek word [...] (...) meaning [...] "to smell". For this reason, Schönbein is generally credited with the discovery of ozone. The formula for ozone, O3, was not determined until 1865 by Jacques-Louis Soret and confirmed by Schönbein in 1867.|$|E

6000|$|... 660. I {{intended}} to have followed this section by {{one on the}} secondary piles of Ritter, and the peculiar properties of the poles of the pile, or of metals through which electricity has passed, which have been observed by Ritter, Van <b>Marum,</b> Yelin, De la Rive, Marianini, Berzelius, and others. It appears to me that all these phenomena bear a satisfactory explanation on known principles, connected with the investigation just terminated, and do not require the assumption of any new state or new property. But as the experiments advanced, especially those of Marianini, require very careful repetition and examination, the necessity of pursuing the subject of electro-chemical decomposition obliges me for a time to defer the researches to which I have just referred.|$|E
50|$|Willem Anne Lestevenon {{was born}} in Paris, where his father, Mattheus Lestevenon, was an {{ambassador}} of the United Provinces to the King of France. In 1760 {{he was sent to}} Leiden to study law. Upon graduation in 1768 he became bailiff of the town and Barony of Breda. Ten years later, he moved to Haarlem and was appointed to the city's vroedschap and joined the Teylers Second Society (1780), where he supported Martinus van <b>Marum's</b> utilitarian approach of the natural sciences as he expected these sciences to be fundamental for the recovery of Haarlem's textile industry. Lestevenon was sent to the States from Holland in 1783 and then to the States General of the United Provinces in the following year.|$|R
50|$|It was Van <b>Marum's</b> {{dream to}} create a larger version, and he applied to the Teylers Stichting in 1783 for funding to create such a large {{instrument}} {{in the hope that}} it would add a valuable contribution to the science of electricity. On April 11 of that year his request was granted, and on May 7 Cuthbertson was employed who finished the device a year later and it was proudly installed on Christmas Eve. The machine performed above expectations and was only modified a few times to prevent leaks of the static charge. The study of electricity leakage led to many insights in the study of electricity. The machine was last modified in 1791. For the friction, cushions were used as an improvement over the mercury bath used in the earlier model. For a complete description of the electrostatic generator, an explanation was produced in 1868 by the Parisian author Adolphe Ganot (1804-1887).|$|R
5000|$|Though the {{observatory}} couldn't {{be used for}} precision measurements, it was still used for manual observations. The collection of the Teylers physical cabinet contains several telescopes and other devices that were used. Until 1817 {{the observatory}} also had a camera obscura, which was used for drawings of {{the view from the}} little tower. Though they have not survived, the Teylers archives have evidence that Vincent Jansz van der Vinne was paid 86 guilders for painting the [...] "walls and ceilings of the cupula". That was not the only artwork that early stargazers met with when they climbed the stairs. On the rooftop of the first staircase a vase was installed that was delivered by Jan Woortman in 1781. Though lost since, the vase {{can be seen in the}} painting of the courtyard of the Foundation house by Wybrand Hendriks. The vase was the trademark of Teyler, and is visible on the top of Van <b>Marum's</b> electrostatic generator as well.|$|R
60|$|Thus, {{if you go}} to {{a garden}} to buy flowers, plants, trees, and greens, if you know what you go about, know the names of flowers, or simples, or greens; know the {{particular}} beauties of them, when they are fit to remove, and when to slip and draw, and when not; what colour is ordinary, and what rare; when a flower is rare, and when ordinary--the gardener presently talks to you as to a man of art, tells you that you are a lover of art, a friend to a florist, shows you his exotics, his green-house, and his stores; what he has set out, and what he has budded or enarched, and the like; but if he finds you have none of the terms of art, know little or nothing of the names of plants, or the nature of planting, he picks your pocket instantly, shows you a fine trimmed fuz-bush for a juniper, sells you common pinks for painted ladies, an ordinary tulip for a rarity, and the like. Thus I saw a gardener sell a gentleman a large yellow auricula, that is to say, a running away, for a curious flower, and take a great price. It seems, the gentleman was a lover of a good yellow; and it is known, that when nature in the auricula is exhausted, and has spent her strengh in showing a fine flower, perhaps some years upon the same root, she faints at last, and then turns into a yellow, which yellow shall be bright and pleasant the first year, and look very well to one that knows nothing of it, though another year it turns pale, and at length almost white. This the gardeners call a run flower, and this they put upon the gentleman for a rarity, only because he discovered at his coming that he knew nothing of the matter. The same gardener sold another person a root of white painted thyme for the right <b>Marum</b> Syriacum; and thus they do every day.|$|E
