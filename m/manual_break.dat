40|$|In the {{development}} of annotations for a spoken database, an important issue is whether the annotations can be generated automatically with sufficient precision, or whether expensive manual annotations are needed. In this paper, the case of prosodic annotations is discussed, which was investigated on the CGN database (Spoken Dutch Corpus). The main conclusions of this work are as follows. First, {{it was found that}} the available amount of manual prosodic annotations is sufficient for {{the development}} of our (baseline, decision tree based) prosodic models. In other words, more manual annotations do not improve the models. Second, the developed prosodic models for prominence are insufficiently accurate to produce automatic prominence annotations that are as good as the manual ones. But on the other hand the consistency between manual and automatic break annotations is as high as the inter-transcriber consistency for breaks. So given the current amount of <b>manual</b> <b>break</b> annotations, annotations for the remainder of the CGN database can be generated automatically with the same quality as the manual annotations. 1...|$|E

Economic surplus model has been applied in a closed economic framework with the assumption of no spillover effects. The economic efficiency indicators such as NPV (486), IRR (44 %) and BCR (21. 83) have been found quite attractive. The technology (mechanical decorticator, kernel separator, oil extraction and filtration) has been found superior to conventional practices (traditional kolhu) on account of higher recovery of 11 per cent and cost reduction by 22. 41 per cent. Overall, net profit per unit {{in the case of}} improved technology has been estimated to be Rs 1. 34 lakh, which leads to a saving of Rs 55446 over the conventional practices.

40|$|Resurveys in six {{villages in}} Madhya Pradesh show that {{contrary}} to mainstream perceptions, seasonal/circular migration {{has become more}} accumulative for the poor {{over the last five}} years as new opportunities in urban areas have reduced the uncertainty of finding work, wages have increased and the dependence on contractors has declined. Furthermore, migration is attracting more women and upper castes as traditional restrictions related to <b>manual</b> work <b>break</b> down. Migration has brought greater returns to those with skills or strong social networks. Others, relying on contractors or facing discrimination, have not benefited as much. Nevertheless, migration is viewed by the poor as a strategy for improving household well-being.

40|$|Water body {{detection}} {{is necessary}} to generate hydro break lines, which are in turn useful in creating deliverables such as TINs, contours, DEMs from LiDAR data. Hydro flattening follows the detection and delineation of water bodies (lakes, rivers, ponds, reservoirs, streams etc.) with hydro <b>break</b> lines. <b>Manual</b> hydro <b>break</b> line generation is time consuming and expensive. Accuracy and processing time depend {{on the number of}} vertices marked for delineation of break lines. Automation with minimal human intervention is desired for this operation. This paper proposes using a novel histogram analysis of LiDAR elevation data and LiDAR intensity data to automatically detect water bodies. Detection of water bodies using elevation information was verified by checking against LiDAR intensity data since the spectral reflectance of water bodies is very small compared with that of land and vegetation in near infra-red wavelength range. Detection of water bodies using LiDAR intensity data was also verified by checking against LiDAR elevation data. False detections were removed using morphological operations and 3 D break lines were generated. Finally, a comparison of automatically generated break lines with their semi-automated/manual counterparts was performed to assess the accuracy of the proposed method and the results were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to relate}} {{embodiment}} to more distant spatiality. The vehicle is an ethnographic study in one pottery factory over a total of {{two and a half}} years of how potters encounter hazards to health and safety at work. Potters' experiences of the body and space differ from the body and space as imagined by medicine, the law and capital. Though these experiences are relatively coherent, in the wider context they carry little legitimacy and are seldom expressed. Each of three traditions, that of Marx, represented by H. Lefebvre, that of Weber and also Foucault, by B. Turner and that of Durkheim, by M. Douglas, provides a template for organising a different theme in the field notes: (1) the dialectic of real, imagined and lived spatialities, (2) the production of varied embodiment in employment and (3) the symbolic meanings of lived space. A link is made between spatiality and embodiment by considering what happens when the rhythms of <b>manual</b> work <b>break</b> down and ill-health or injury comes about.

40|$|Modeling the {{flexibility}} of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) requires the computation of mechanical properties from first principles, e. g., for screening of materials in a database, for gaining insight into structural transformations, and for force field development. However, this paper shows that computations with periodic density functional theory are challenged by {{the flexibility}} of these materials: guidelines from experience with standard solid-state calculations cannot be simply transferred to flexible porous frameworks. Our test case, the MIL- 47 (V) material, has a large-pore and a narrow-pore shape. The effect of Pulay stress (cf. Pulay forces) leads to drastic errors for a simple structure optimization of the flexible MIL- 47 (V) material. Pulay stress is an artificial stress that tends to lower the volume and {{is caused by the}} finite size of the plane wave basis set. We have investigated the importance of this Pulay stress, of symmetry breaking, and of k-point sampling on (a) the structure optimization and (b) mechanical properties such as elastic constants and bulk modulus, of both the large-pore and narrow-pore structure of MIL- 47 (V). We found that, in the structure optimization, Pulay effects should be avoided by using a fitting procedure, in which an equation of state E(V) (EOS) is fit to a series of energy versus volume points. <b>Manual</b> symmetry <b>breaking</b> could successfully lower the energy of MIL- 47 (V) by distorting the vanadium oxide distances in the vanadyl chains and by rotating the benzene linkers. For the mechanical properties, the curvature of the EOS curve was compared with the Reuss bulk modulus, derived from the elastic tensor in the harmonic approximation. Errors induced by anharmonicity, the eggbox effect, and Pulay effects propagate into the Reuss modulus. The strong coupling of the unit cell axes when the unit cell deforms expresses itself in numerical instability of the Reuss modulus. For a flexible material, it is therefore advisible to resort to the EOS fit procedure...|$|R

Beaches {{of the coastal}} lagoon known as Ensenada de La Paz in Baja California Sur, México, are bordered by sedimentary formations of cyanobacterial origin identified as pro-thrombolites (incipient thrombolites) that represent a first record for the region and México. Observed thrombolithic structures show grains of varied sizes embedded within a fine-grain micritic matrix, which may be surrounded by medium-grain cementing micrite. Different degrees of consolidation occur—some crumble easily, whereas others require some <b>manual</b> force to <b>break.</b> These pro-thrombolites consist of platforms > 20 cm thick and/or fragments of assorted sizes and forms.

The extension and wide distribution of pro-thrombolites around the La Paz lagoon suggests that these structures could have determined its evolution from an original (primitive) cove into a lagoon. That is, the formation of prothrombolites through the entrapment and binding of sediments may have eventually altered water circulation, promoting sand sedimentation causing {{the formation of the}} El Mogote sand bar. Likewise, pro-thrombolites may have formed large extensions of headlands through accretion.

5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy <b>manual</b> labour of <b>breaking</b> rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|R
500|$|With {{the need}} for {{expensive}} machinery and horses and for large numbers of workers at each mine, the traditional operation of mines by extended families or by individual entrepreneurs became impractical, and the new deep-level mines came under the ownership of groups of investors and of mining companies. A group of people known as a [...] "tribute team" [...] (often a single extended family) would bid {{for the right to}} work a specified portion of the mine; the men and older boys would dig in the appointed section, and the women, girls and young boys would dress the ore sent up by the men. In later years the practice of bal maidens dressing only the ore sent up by the men of their tribute team was abandoned, and they would instead be paid a flat wage by the mine owner to dress any ore sent up, and the tribute team which had sent up the ore would be billed for the work done. Typical work for a bal maiden in this period was picking ore from rubble, breaking and separating the ore, and carrying ore and metal. Generally girls under 12 would sort the ore, older girls would separate the ore, and grown women would carry out the heavy <b>manual</b> labour of <b>breaking</b> rocks with hammers and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. As the bal maidens of the smaller tribute teams often did not have the time to dress all the ore sent up, or it was not financially worthwhile to pay for the poorer quality ore to be processed, large quantities of poor quality ore were discarded unprocessed in waste heaps. On those occasions when improved extraction techniques or rises in the price of metals made it worthwhile to process this discarded ore, sometimes separate tribute teams would bid for the right to dress and process this rubble. As the practice of using tribute teams declined in the early 19thcentury, the mine owners themselves would hire bal maidens to dress this waste ore.|$|R
40|$|Motivation During {{research}} and development regarding next generation solar cells, many experiments are performed on multi-crystalline silicon (Si) wafers. One regular task is the separation of different areas of interest on a Si wafer. Separating multi-crystalline Si wafers implies one major challenge: Breaking the samples manually leads most often to a heap of Si crumbs which are only useful with limitations afterwards. This paper investigates the applicability of a novel wafer separation method, the thermal laser separation (TLS), on the separation of multi-crystalline Si wafers. TLS has already proven its applicability in the dicing of mono-crystalline Si wafers [1]. For the dicing of multi-crystalline Si, TLS will be compared to <b>manual</b> scribe and <b>break</b> and the mechanical wafer saw. E ach method is applied to wire saw cut multi-crystalline Si wafers. The methods are briefly described, experimental results are compared {{with each other and}} the separation methods are evaluated. Approach Samples of wire saw cut Si wafers (156 mm x 156 mm) are used to evaluate three separation methods. Each sample should be separated into squares of 20 mm edge length. For the sample preparation an accuracy of ap-prox. 100 μm in straightness is sufficient. The following separation methods are evaluated: Scribe and break: An initial scribe is applied manually {{at the edge of the}} samples with a diamond tip. The sam-ples are then broken manually by bending both sides of the sample around this initial scribe with tweezers. Mechanical wafer saw: Fast rotating (30. 000 rpm) diamond blades ar e used to separate the Si wafers by remov-ing material of the size of the blade width. Thermal Laser Separation [1]: The TLS process is a cleaving process that uses thermal-induced mechanical stress and which comprises two steps. To initiate the process, a small initial scribe is required, which is done with a diamond tool tip or with a special scribing laser (step 1). In this case, a diamond tool tip is used. The initial scribe gives the cleaving process a well-defined starting point. During the cleaving step (step 2), the material is heated up by a laser and directly after the laser spot the material is cooled down by a water aerosol. This combi-nation of heating up and cooling down the material results in a large temperature gradient inducing tensile stress inside the material. The ten sile stress opens a crack starting from the initial scribe and the crack is guided through the material by the movement of the laser-cooling combination. Sample preparation For the scribe and break no special preparation is necessary. As the mechanical wafer saw is a typical dicing technology, it is necessary to mount the wafers on dicing tape which has a sticky layer that holds the Si wafer on a thin metal dicing frame. In this case a UV tape is used. This tapes adhesiveness can be reduced by UV irradiating the tape after the dicing process. Separated samples can then be demounted manually. Even though the TLS-technology works also normally with dicing tape, it is not necessary to use it due to the fact that no external mechanical stress is applied to the samples compared to the mechan ical wafer saw. That is why the samples are just put on a vacuum chuck without special additional preparation. Results Results of separating multi-crystalline Si samples are shown in the figures below: Scribe and break (Figure 1) : The small arrows denote the manually applied diamond scribes. As can be seen from Figure 1 it is impossible to separate the samples into rectangular pieces. This process result does not fulfill the above specifications. Mechanical wafer saw (Figure 2) : With the mechanical saw it is possible to separate the samples into the speci-fied rectangular pieces with good straightness. Major drawback is the time-consuming sample preparation be-cause of the need for the mounting process prior to the separation and the demounting process after the separa-tion. Chipping a t the sample edges (indicated by the arrows) might reduce the breaking strength of the samples (currently under investigation). Thermal Laser Separation (Figure 3) : The TLS-process results also in rectangular pieces, but of lower straight-ness as the saw-result; compare arrow in Figure 3 (quantitative analysis ongoing). The TLS-process is less time-consuming, because no special preparation is necessary and the separation process works at high velocities up to 300 mm/s (wafer saw 10 mm/s in this case). Conclusion It was shown that for the preparation of multi-crystalline Si wafers as envisaged here, the TLS-technology pro-vides the fastest results with low preparation effort and, compared to the mechanical wafer saw, with a sufficient straightness. Investigations on the resulting bending strength and a quantitative analysis of the achieved straightness are being continued and will be presented in the final paper...|$|R
