25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly <b>minority</b> <b>school</b> districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a report {{concerning}} preliminary research on ethnic minority education in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in China. It focuses on a Mongolian minority group. Various problems are occurring in connection with development in the minority areas. Some of these relate to minority education. I discuss excessive consolidation of <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> in the pastoral area of Ujimchin. Ujimchin is a typical pastoral area in Inner Mongolia. There, as many as 55 % of the population are still living a pastoral nomadic way of life, in the West Ujimchin Banner. Until 2000 there were 25 <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> in the somus (somu is an administrative section within the banner). The statistics show {{that at the end}} of 2008, all the <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> were consolidated into 5 <b>minority</b> <b>schools.</b> Moreover, they were gathered in one balyasu (village). Because of their lifestyle, the pastoralists are not easy to contact within the balyasu. Also their children are hard to get to school in the balyasu, because it is too far way. When the little children are aged five or six they have to leave their parents, and live in school dormitories. Because of the <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> consolidation, the pastoralists have had to bear great economic expense. Many pastoral parents feel the excessive consolidation of the <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> is causing them great inconvenience. If the govemment wants to found or to consolidate schools in such pastoral areas, it has to consider the lifestyle of the people...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to analyze school psychologists 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on 27 parent involvement and empowerment activities focused upon improving students 2 ̆ 7 school success. A sample of 36 school psychologists from high and low <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> in a large urban school district rated {{the degree to which}} they believed the activities should be offered to parents and the extent to which they were feasible to implement over the next five years. The activities rated highest for offer and feasibility by psychologists at both high and low <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> were related to information dissemination and one-to-one meetings. The activities rated lowest for offer and feasibility by psychologists at both high and low <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> were related to systems change and time-intensive programming. Psychologists 2 ̆ 7 mean ratings for offer were generally higher than their mean ratings for feasibility of implementation. However, the mean ratings for offer and feasibility at high <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> tended not to be different from those ratings at low <b>minority</b> <b>schools.</b> Time was rated as the biggest barrier to implementation at both high and low <b>minority</b> <b>schools,</b> with current work responsibilities a close second. It is suggested that moving away from the traditional role of assessment and placement and towards prevention and intervention might reduce, if not eliminate, the time and current work responsibilities barriers and allow more school psychologists to implement home-school collaboration...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis clarifies {{the issue}} of Triadic nexus among Slovakia, Hungary and the Hungarian {{minority}} concerning education and economic access to areas inhabited by the Hungarian minority, which affect the graduates of <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> in the Slovak labor market.

The main focus is on the trilateral approach to {{the issue of}} education in the Slovak <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> in Hungarian language in case of teaching the state language. The consequences of the different trilateral relation approach to minority education can lead to inefficiency of <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> teaching Slovak language, which can, in conjunction with the current economic approach of Slovakia to the areas inhabited by the Hungarian minority, lead to migratory pressures on graduates of <b>minority</b> <b>schools</b> as for the choice of university studies and their employability.
