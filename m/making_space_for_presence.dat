40|$|In the {{continuing}} shift from engineered solutions towards more holistic methods of managing flood risk, spatial planning {{has become the}} primary focus of a conflict between land and water, water and people. In attempting {{to strike a balance between}} <b>making</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> water and <b>making</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> people, compromises are required. Through five case studies in the UK, this paper analyses the effectiveness of Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS 25) and the processes of negotiation that it promotes. This assessment allows us to draw conclusions on the nature of the compromises this kind of negotiation can achieve and the implications of this for flood risk management. What emerges is that the beneficial impacts of decisions to develop floodplain areas are given a proper hearing and sensible conditions imposed, rather than arguments to prevent such development remaining unchallenged...|$|R

40|$|<b>Making</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> rural {{gentrification}} and the gentrification {{of nature}} In {{a series of}} previous work I have sought to "make <b>space</b> <b>for</b> the study of rural gentrification " (Phillips 2005 a) by highlighting parallels which exist between observed urban transformations and changes occurring in the countryside, or at least within the British countryside, and also how rural researchers might draw upon and contribute to wide ranging theoretical debates concerning the significance and constitution of gentrification (see Phillips 1993; 2001 b; 2002 b; 2004; 2005 a). The term gentrification is often interpreted as a largely urban phenomena, with urban gentrification being a widely acknowledged research subject – even research frontier (Van Weesep 1994) - and having become a heterogeneous and contested discursive space, with highly divergent interpretations of gentrification being advanced and debated. In contrast, rural gentrification appears as a small, restricted and rather unremarkable discursive space. A {{relatively small number of}} people use the term rural gentrification, and when it is used is often accompanied with little or no justifying commentary: rural gentrification is either largely ignored or presented as a commonplace referent to some changes in contemporary rural life. <b>Making</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> rural gentrification does not, as noted in Phillips (2001 b), necessarily imply that rural researchers necessarily have to import all the ideas and practices of urban studies into the rural discursive space a...|$|R
