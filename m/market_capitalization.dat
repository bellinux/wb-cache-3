40|$|Published online: 28 August 2010 This study {{finds that}} returns to stocks with {{relatively}} high <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> lead returns to stocks with relatively low <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> in Australian industry portfolios.

However while that study found stronger lead–lag effects for industries with relatively small average <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> this study finds that industries with larger average <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> have stronger lead–lag effects. This may be caused by industry momentum created by positive news to the leader stocks of an industry, and implies investors can gain significantly by investing in the smaller firms of prominent industries, following an earlier shock to the corresponding leader stocks.

40|$|We {{introduce}} polynomial {{processes in}} the sense of [8] in the context of stochastic portfolio theory to model simultaneously companies' <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> and the corresponding market weights. These models substantially extend volatility stabilized market models considered by Robert Fernholz and Ioannis Karatzas in [18], in particular they allow for correlation between the individual stocks. At the same time they remain remarkably tractable which makes them applicable in practice, especially for estimation and calibration to high dimensional equity index data. In the diffusion case we characterize the joint polynomial property of the <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> and the corresponding weights, exploiting the fact that the transformation between absolute and relative quantities perfectly fits the structural properties of polynomial processes. Explicit parameter conditions assuring the existence of a local martingale deflator and relative arbitrages with respect to the market portfolio are given and the connection to non-attainment of the boundary of the unit simplex is discussed. We also consider extensions to models with jumps and the computation of optimal relative arbitrage strategies...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} robustly maximizing {{the growth rate of}} investor wealth in the presence of model uncertainty. Possible models are all those under which the assets' region $E$ and instantaneous covariation $c$ are known, and where additionally the assets are stable in that their occupancy time measures converge to a law with density $p$. This latter assumption is motivated by the observed stability of ranked relative <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations</b> for equity <b>markets.</b> We seek to identify the robust optimal growth rate, as well as a trading strategy which achieves this rate in all models. Under minimal assumptions upon $(E,c,p) $, we identify the robust growth rate with the Donsker-Varadhan rate function from occupancy time Large Deviations theory. We also prove existence of, and explicitly identify, the optimal trading strategy. We then apply our results in the case of drift uncertainty for ranked relative <b>market</b> <b>capitalizations.</b> Assuming regularity under symmetrization for the covariance and limiting density of the ranked capitalizations, we explicitly identify the robust optimal trading strategy in this setting.

5|$|The Knicks' success due to Lin's play {{reportedly}} {{contributed to}} the end of a dispute that had for 48 days prevented Time Warner Cable customers from watching Knicks games and other MSG Network programs. The <b>market</b> <b>capitalization</b> of the Madison Square Garden Company, the team's owner, rose by $250 million in February and $600 million by July 2012. The Knicks quickly began selling replicas of Lin's No. 17 jerseys and T-shirts, and the sales and traffic for its online store increased more than 3,000%; Lin's merchandise dominated the displays at Knicks stores, while those for the team's high-priced stars—Anthony, Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler—were moved to the sale racks. He had the best selling jersey in the NBA in February and March. For the one-year period ending April 2012, Lin had the second highest selling jersey in the league behind Derrick Rose. Both Nike and Adidas introduced Lin-related athletic apparel, and expected that his fame would help sales in China. His popularity was attributed with growing the NBA's popularity there since Yao Ming's retirement in the offseason; the audience for NBA games on television and online in China rose 39percent over the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Government {{policies}} shifted dramatically after 1965, {{becoming more}} favorable to economic expansion. In {{an effort to}} rehabilitate the economy, the government turned to those who possessed the capability to invest and expand corporate activity. Ethnic Chinese capitalists, called the , were supported by the military, which emerged as the dominant political force after 1965. Indigenous businessmen once again demanded greater investment support from {{the government in the}} 1970s, but legislative efforts failed to reduce ethnic Chinese dominance. In a 1995 study published by the East Asia Analytical Unit of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, approximately 73 percent of the <b>market</b> <b>capitalization</b> value of publicly listed companies (excluding foreign and state-owned companies) were owned by Chinese Indonesians. Additionally, they owned 68 percent of the top 300 conglomerates and nine of the top ten private sector groups at the end of 1993. This figure propagated the general belief that ethnic Chinese—then estimated at 3 percent of the population—controlled 70 percent of the economy. Although the accuracy of this figure was disputed, it was evident that a wealth disparity existed along ethnic boundaries. The image of an economically powerful ethnic Chinese community was further fostered by the government through its inability to dissociate itself from the patronage networks. The Hokchia group dominated the ethnic Chinese business scene during the Suharto government, although other groups emerged after 1998.|$|E
