5|$|The strongest {{storm of}} the season, Hurricane Twelve, was first {{identified}} as a tropical depression several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southwest</b> of Sonora, Mexico on October20. Tracking northeastward, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Late on October21, the storm underwent {{a brief period of}} explosive intensification, strengthening from a 50mph (85km/h) tropical storm to a 140mph (220km/h) Category 4 hurricane in roughly six hours. The hurricane maintained this intensity for a further six hours before making landfall near Mazatlán. Rapid weakening took place as the hurricane moved inland, with the system dissipating during the afternoon of October22.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Aletta was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical storm}} that killed 308people while meandering {{off the coast}} of Central America in May 1982. An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on May20, and into a tropical storm around noon on May21. The cyclone turned northeast, reaching its peak as a strong tropical storm on May23. Aletta meandered and gradually weakened, dissipating a few hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southwest</b> of Acapulco on May29. Moisture from the tropical system spread over Honduras and Nicaragua, causing flooding. Throughout the two countries, 308people were killed and total damage was at $457million (1982USD).

5|$|Hurricane Gladys was the {{farthest}} tropical cyclone from the United States {{to be observed}} by radar in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Carla in 1961. The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season, Gladys developed from a tropical wave while several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southwest</b> of Cape Verde on September22. Initially, the tropical depression failed to strengthened significantly, but due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, it became Tropical Storm Gladys by September24. Despite entering a more unfavorable environment several hundred {{miles east of the}} northern Leeward Islands, Gladys became a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scaleon September28. Shortly thereafter, the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening. Eventually, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ramon was a {{very intense}} Pacific {{hurricane}} that generated heavy rains in Southern California. The 19th named storm and final hurricane of the above-average 1987 Pacific hurricane season, Ramon originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in early October. On October5, a tropical storm had developed several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southwest</b> of Manzanillo, bypassing the tropical depression stage. Tropical Storm Ramon turned to the west-northwest after initially moving west. It intensified into a hurricane on October7. Two days later, Hurricane Ramon peaked in intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest and rapidly weakened over cooler waters. It weakened into a tropical storm on October11 and a depression on October12. Ramon dissipated shortly thereafter. While at sea, Ramon brought light rainfall to the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Hurricane Ramon produced heavy rainfall that caused flooding in California, indirectly contributing to five traffic-related fatalities. Rainfall was reported as far inland as Utah.|$|E

More than 19,000power outages {{were reported in}} the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway.

5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few <b>miles</b> <b>southwest</b> of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E
