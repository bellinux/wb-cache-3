2500|$|On 27 April 1598 Paget wrote from Liege to Thomas Barnes in London: I am unspeakably comforted {{that the}} queen {{inclines}} {{to listen to}} my humble suit. The profits of my land are worth £200 a year to myself; it is a lordship called Weston-upon-Trent. ... I cannot capitulate with the Queen; but the greater my offence has been, the greater is her mercy in pardoning and restoring me to my blood and living, showing the liberality which makes her famous, and obliging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> my life at her feet.|$|E

[...] Her approbation and unremitting kindness, when we were both very young indeed, kindled the latest sparks of genius to a flame, which she now gazes on with wonder and delight. [...] Let this not appear like vanity. [...] Recollect what I am, and you will find it proceeds from a better source. [...] She cannot have so much pleasure in seeing the plant she has so kindly cherished in such a thriving state, as I have in seeing the plant she has so kindly cherished in such a thriving state, as I have in seeing her united to a man every way worthy of her, and whose whole life is devoted to her happiness in short, they form a harmony seldom to be met with – their souls are in unison.

[...] "After I've had someone get New York on the long-distance 'phone {{and give the}} story to the papers you can explain, and they'll let you out. Surely to {{goodness}} you don't object, as a personal favour <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> {{an hour or two}} in a cell? Why, probably they haven't got a prison at all out in these parts, and you'll simply be locked in a room. A child of ten could do it on his head," [...] said Miss Silverton. [...] "A child of six," [...] she emended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] she said, [...] "the {{things you}} speak of do not exist any more between us. I am sorry, but I think you are narrow and suspicious. You have your own work to do. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> your time suspecting {{soldiers}} who have fought for their king and their country, of such a despicable crime." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mind, I'll {{go over to}} Wests' to-morrow," [...] he said. [...] "They pressed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> some time with them, and there are {{arrangements}} {{to be made on}} which they want my opinion. Edgar is taking up land in Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{some way}} we struck {{up quite a}} friendship, this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy <b>to</b> <b>me</b> from the first, and within two days of our meeting he came <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> at Lee. One thing led to another, and it ended in his {{inviting}} <b>me</b> out <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott.

60|$|Now it {{was that}} I gave silent thanks, because of what had seemed to me a {{hardship}} when my mother forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> so many hours each day in learning to use a quill, until I was able to write a clerkly hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so, Mr. Satterlee?" [...] she said gratefully.

60|$|He {{left at the}} end of {{the terms}} and I did not see him again until we were both young men. Then one day I ran against him in Oxford Street, and he asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come and <b>spend</b> a few days with his people in Surrey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{and asked}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come and <b>spend</b> {{a week with}} her when Sallie does.

60|$|The only porter {{told me that}} {{everyone}} in Xiormonez was asleep at that hour, and recommended <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> {{the night in the}} waiting-room, but I bribed him heavily; I offered him two pesetas, which is nearly fifteenpence, and, leaving the train to its own devices, he shouldered my bag and started off.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{no matter}} if you cannot," [...] would be the proper reply, [...] "since it {{certainly}} is wrong; {{you have made a}} mistake in adding, somewhere, but it is not worth while for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> two or three minutes apiece with all of you, to ascertain where.

6000|$|... "I'm {{very glad}} of that, Selina, {{but what was}} it? I'm sure {{it could not have}} come from poor Mrs Ellison, or the bishop's wife; and you seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> all your time in talking to them.

60|$|He allowed <b>me,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> the {{remainder}} of the night where I was, and I lay there worrying over the problem and lamenting my own failure.

I lay looking at it--and as I lay suddenly an idea flew like a bullet through my head and brought me quivering with excitement out of my couch. I raised the grim relic from where it had fallen. Yes, it was indeed so. The hand was the left hand of the Lascar.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008 Drover left Megadeth {{to focus}} on family life; the {{constant}} touring was starting to {{have a negative effect}} on him.

Commenting on leaving the band, Drover said [...] "I am aware of the rumors that I left Megadeth {{to focus on}} family life and my family life has always been my priority. In the end, I was unhappy with the situation, which magnified <b>me</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more time with my family and realizing that it's time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> move on to the next chapter in my musical career, I have a lot of great memories and met a ton of great people along the way, both fans and people in the industry." ...|$|R

60|$|It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after {{helping me}} to clean my house, was gone, well {{satisfied}} with the fee of a penny for her aid.

I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon before <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> as I would.|$|E
60|$|JUGGINS. I really cant {{leave it}} at that, sir. I assure you Ive no {{objection}} to young Mr Gilbey's going to prison.
