Currently, the researches on <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> with low flow and high head have been developed overseas. However, low efficiency and large size are the common disadvantages for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump.</b> In order to study the performance of high-speed <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump,</b> FLUENT is used to simulate the inner flow field of magnetic drive pumps with different rotate speeds, and get velocity and pressure distributions of inner flow field. According to analysis the changes of velocity and pressure to ensure the stable operation of pump and avoid cavitation. Based on the analysis of velocity and pressure, this paper presents the pump efficiency of magnetic drive pumps with different rotated speeds by calculating the power loss in impeller and volute, hydraulic loss, volumetric loss, mechanical loss and discussing the different reasons of power loss between the magnetic drive pumps with different rotated speeds. In addition, the magnetic drive pumps are tested in a closed testing system. Pressure sensors are set in inlet and outlet of magnetic drive pumps to get the pressure and the head, while the pump efficiency can be got by calculating the power loss between the input power and the outlet power.

Based on successful experiences for many years, magnetic drive pumps have been aggressively applied to improve the seal life for special services such as sulfur, caustic, ammonia, etc since 2005. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> has been preferred because of various advantages (easy maintenance, robust design, leak free, etc). However, we have faced important and didactic issues due to inappropriate operating procedures, protection systems and design. Unless the application and operation are taken into a consideration for special services like as molten sulfur and ammonia, the consequences of pump failure could result in devastating damage to pump parts and even fire. This case study will show how the bad actors were improved, lessons learned and guidelines for reliable operation. Users are reluctant to apply protection systems fully compliant with API 685 or vendor recommendations for non-hazardous services based on economic considerations. But they should consider providing minimum protection systems for special services, if not for all pumps...|$|E
50|$|Magnetically coupled <b>pumps,</b> or <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{vary from}} the {{traditional}} pumping style, as the motor is coupled to the pump by magnetic means rather than by a direct mechanical shaft. The pump works via a drive magnet, 'driving' the pump rotor, which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.7 They are often used where leakage of the fluid pumped poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since the pump shaft is not supported by bearings outside the pump's housing, support inside the pump is provided by bushings. The pump size of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW.|$|R

40|$|LectureIt {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that sealless <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> give total containment of the pumped process liquid, which {{in an industry}} where there are ever tightening environmental constraints on plant operation and increasing health and safety requirements, offers a real advantage of reliability and safety to users. However, as with any piece of process machinery, <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> are designed to operate within specific parameters and operation outside of these parameters can lead to reduced levels of reliability. Whilst traditional instrumentation (measurement of temperature or power) will assist in improving {{the reliability of the}} machine, these instruments are not monitoring the primary cause of the issue; instead they are monitoring the effect that the fault condition has on another part of the machine. By constantly monitoring the condition of the pumped liquid present in the internal flow regime of a magnetic-drive pump, it is possible to rapidly identify potential issues and react to them accordingly. Ultrasonic technology has been utilised to rapidly and accurately detect the presence of vapour in the liquid stream. The technology provides a precise and sensitive response to even the smallest change in phase, therefore improving the overall reliability of the machine. This paper presents an overview of the ultrasonic technology that has been utilised to monitor the condition of magnetic-drive centrifugal pumps, including highlights of extensive testing that has been carried out and some real world examples involving the application of this technology on volatile light hydrocarbon processes...|$|R

Silicon carbide bearings are known to be the least forgiving during dry running, but are still the best universal choice. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate means to extend the life of silicon carbide bearings in a dry running environment. A test rig was designed to simulate broken prime and drained pump dry run conditions. The test pump was a 1 ? x 1 x 8 ANSI <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> driven by a 15 hp 3600 rpm motor. Both sintered silicon carbide and 70 micron controlled porosity silicon carbide with Teflon lubricating strips were tested in conductive and nonconductive containment shells. Damage assessment was made after each test. Results of water tests show the robust pump design and proper bearing alignment is essential. Under broken prime conditions with a nonconductive containment shell, controlled porosity silicon carbide with Teflon lubricating strips ran for 4 ? hours without overheating, failure or damage. The broken prime dry run time for conductive containment shells is partly dependent upon the magnitude of eddy current heat generated and the time required to boil off the product lubricant; for the models tested, this time was approximately 32 to 35 minutes. Drained casing tests with nonconductive containment shells show a doubling of dry run time with controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon strips over that of sintered silicon carbide. A drained casing test with conductive containment shell configured with controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon lubricating strips had a dry run time of 36 minutes and underwent much less bearing damage than a broken prime test with sintered silicon carbide and conductive containment shell. The addition of controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon lubricating strips can add substantially to dry run life and help reduce damage to the product lubricated bearings...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> sealless <b>pumps.</b> The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back shroud, pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 85 Dry run {{failures}} in sealless pumps {{continue to be}} of major concern to users and, in some cases, have precluded the purchase {{of these types of}} pumps. Users are demanding robust pump designs that are more tolerant of dry running caused by system upsets and occasional operator error. Although silicon carbide is the best material choice for product lubricated bearings during normal wet operation, it will quickly overheat and seize in a matter of seconds, if allowed to run dry. There are other bearing material choices available, such as carbon-graphite and various polymer materials that will permit some degree of short term dry running, but sacrifices must be made in wear resistance, chemical inertness, and/or load carrying capability. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the bone-dry run performance of amorphous diamond-like carbon (ADLC) coated silicon carbide bearings both with and without Teflon lubricating strips. The test pump was a 1. 5 X 1 X 6 ANSI <b>magnetic</b> <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> fitted with a nonconductive containment shell and rated for 7. 5 hp at 3600 rpm. Ten bearing configurations were tested, including repeatability tests, cycle tests, and tests with covered suction and discharge flanges to eliminate the effect of air cooling. A baseline test was conducted for silicon carbide without the ADLC coating or Teflon strips in order to determine survivability under bone-dry run conditions. Not surprisingly, this configuration seized in under five sec operation and sustained the most massive damage of all configurations tested. Results showed that the configuration with ADLC SiC(P) bearings and Teflon lubricating strips was superior to all configurations tested. During this test, the maximum bearing temperature leveled off at 139 degrees F after five hours of bone-dry run operation. This configuration had the longest operating time, lowest temperature rise, and least wear of all configurations tested. An examination showed that the SiC bearings had virtually no damage and it was expected that this configuration could have continued to run bone-dry for many more hours. The bearing configuration with ADLC SiC(P) without Teflon strips also performed well and had an average bone-dry run time of 142 min prior to reaching the 300 degree F bearing temperature limit previously set for terminating the test. Post-test bearing condition for this configuration was good with only light to moderate scoring evident. It was found through repeatability testing that the dry run performance of the ADLC coating SiC(P) bearings was reasonably consistent. Prior experience with this coating indicated that it had significantly contributed to a 62 percent reduction in failure rate, during a frequency of repair audit at a large German chemical plant...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 93 Centrifugal pump design {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the safe operation of any refinery or chemical processing plant. In analyzing the performance of centrifugal pumps, pump operating time to failure is almost always limited to that of the shaft mechanical seal. Mechanical seals and their sophisticated supporting systems have become more complicated as the pumping industry perseveres in its efforts to produce satisfactorily seal life. Numerous research projects have proceeded, many papers demonstrating seal leakage have been presented, but the overall progress in extending seal life has not been to everyone?s satisfaction. A viable and important option, therefore, is a centrifugal pump that does not require mechanical seals. A magnetically <b>driven</b> sealless <b>pump</b> is such a machine. It conveys liquid safely with no dynamic seal between the motor shaft and the impeller(s). There is no potential leakage path, since prime mover energy is transmitted magnetically through the pressure casing wall. Magnet <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> are capable of producing flow rates to 5000 gpm and heads to 1000 ft. Temperatures ranging from - 100 ?F to + 850 ?F, and system pressure to 5000 psi can be accommodated without the need for any ancillary services or supporting systems. Likewise, the magnet <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> is excellent for high vacuum services where sealing mechanically may prove extremely difficult. Sealless pumps generally are thought to be intolerant of solids in pumpage. However, magnet <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> designs are now available with substantially improved performance in abrasive services.
