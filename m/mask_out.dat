He shows Christine a bust of herself, wearing a wedding dress and veil, causing her to faint, and the Phantom places her in a bed. The next morning she awakes to find the Phantom writing music. She {{approaches}} him and removes his <b>mask</b> <b>out</b> of curiosity. He bursts into a fit of rage, covering his face with his hand. He at first says she must stay forever because she saw his deformities, revealing that he [...] "dreams of beauty". Pitying him Christine hands him back his mask and the two have a moment of understanding. He then decides to return her to the opera house.|$|E
2500|$|The {{very first}} version of Eddie was a mask made by an art student who was friends with Dave [...] "Lights" [...] Beasley, then in charge of lighting, {{pyrotechnics}} and other effects for Iron Maiden's live show. According to Beasley, the original mask was a papier-mâché mould of his own face, which was then used in the band's backdrop, consisting of lights and the band's logo. At {{the end of their}} live set, during the [...] "Iron Maiden" [...] song, a fish tank pump was used to squirt fake blood out of the mask's mouth, which typically covered their then-drummer Doug Sampson. After this initial incarnation, Beasley constructed a larger <b>mask</b> <b>out</b> of fibreglass, equipped with flashing eyes and the ability to release red smoke from its mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{locomotive}} bore a name: {{for example}} D825 was Intrepid. All except D800 and D812 were named after Royal Navy vessels, thus the [...] "Warship diesel" [...] moniker {{used to refer}} to the class. D800 was named Sir Brian Robertson after the Chairman of the British Transport Commission at the time. D812 was planned to carry the name Despatch but was eventually named Royal Naval Reserve 1859–1959. All except these two bore a subtitle [...] "Warship Class" [...] in smaller letters underneath the main name. A nice touch was that throughout the production series examples (including the NBL-built D833–865) the names were allocated alphabetically. This caused some difficulty when Swindon was unexpectedly given an order for five more locomotives (which became D866–870); a shortage of Warship names beginning with Z required some names for the higher numbered NBL examples to be reallocated. The original livery for all D800s was BR green with a light grey waistband and red bufferbeams. In the mid-1960s the WR decided upon maroon as its new house colour for mainline diesel locomotives, this going very much against standard schemes imposed by BR's overall management. In November 1966 the first D800 (D864) appeared in the new BR blue scheme with D864 carrying an experimental 'Burnt Umber' paint scheme around the lower skirting (an attempt to <b>mask</b> <b>out</b> brake dust). Half yellow nose ends appeared from January 1962 and eventually two Green, several Maroon and all Blue-liveried locomotives received full yellow ends. Green livery was eradicated by 1970 when D810 was repainted, this being the last green member of the class in service, although D800 had still carried the green livery when withdrawn in 1968. A handful of Maroon examples, including D809, D815 & D817 remained in traffic until 5 October 1971, and were finally withdrawn in this colour scheme, although by now wearing full yellow ends. Three of the early withdrawals, D801, D840 and D848, met their end in maroon with small yellow panels. After withdrawal of steam in 1968, the [...] "D" [...] prefix was dropped from locomotive running numbers when repaints occurred – so for example, D832 became just 832 as there was now no chance of it conflicting with a steam locomotive number.|$|E

2500|$|The Matoran arrive back in Metru Nui for {{the first}} time in 1,000 years and begin to repair the damage caused by the prior Visorak invasion. Meanwhile, the Toa Nuva learn that Mata Nui is not only asleep, but dying. To save him, they're told to venture to the rocky island of Voya Nui and {{retrieve}} the Kanohi Ignika: the legendary Mask of Life. However, they are quickly overpowered and imprisoned by the Piraka: six former Dark Hunters of the Skakdi species, who after raiding Makuta's lair, had the idea of claiming the Ignika planted into their minds by the villain's surviving spirit, real name Teridax. Carrying Makuta's essence in the form of a substance called Antidermis, the Piraka travelled to Voya Uni and enslaved nearly all of the native Matoran with it while posing as Toa; forcing them to carry out tasks in relation to finding the Ignika. In Metru Nui, Jaller is curious of the Toa Nuva's whereabouts. Suspecting the Turaga of harboring more secrets, he gets the Matoran to hold a strike, but to no avail. In secret, Nokama discloses the Toa's mission to Jaller. Believing they need assistance, he gathers five of the bravest Matoran he knows - Hahli, Hewkii, Nuparu, Kongu and Matoro - and with Takanuva, they leave for Voya Nui. But after Takanuva is forced to turn back, the group arrive in the realm of Karzahni and are forced into the labor of rebuilding damaged Matoran. They eventually escape via Toa canisters heading to Voya Nui. Prior to arriving, bolts of lighting from the Red Star (a mysterious satellite which orbits their planet) transform them into the Toa Inika - Toa with intertwined lightning powers. With help from a small Matoran resistance force and the ancient guardian Axonn, the new Toa battle the many challenges set by the Ignika and chase the Piraka underground to its chamber. Finding the Skakdi already defeated by the mask's final guardian - Vezon, the insane seventh Piraka that the mask has fused itself to, as well as his Fenrakk Rahi steed - the Toa fight the pair until Jaller freezes them in a stasis field. But as Matoro retrieves the mask, Vezon unfreezes and the Fenrakk - now mutated into a Kardas Dragon - fires an energy blast that knocks the <b>mask</b> <b>out</b> of his hands and up out of the chamber, eventually plunging into the sea. The Toa Inika later receive a clue about a city beneath the ocean and are told by the recently-freed Toa Nuva to descend through the stone cord that keeps Voya Nui afloat to reclaim the Ignika, while the Toa Nuva themselves depart to begin their new mission of [...] "preparing" [...] the universe for Mata Nui's reawakening.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} self-taught object localization, a novel {{approach that}} leverages deep convolutional networks trained for whole-image recognition to localize objects in images without additional human supervision, i. e., without using any ground-truth bounding boxes for training. The key idea is to analyze {{the change in the}} recognition scores when artificially <b>masking</b> <b>out</b> different regions of the image. The <b>masking</b> <b>out</b> of a region that includes the object typically causes a significant drop in recognition score. This idea is embedded into an agglomerative clustering technique that generates self-taught localization hypotheses. Our object localization scheme outperforms existing proposal methods in both precision and recall for small number of subwindow proposals (e. g., on ILSVRC- 2012 it produces a relative gain of 23. 4 % over the state-of-the-art for top- 1 hypothesis). Furthermore, our experiments show that the annotations automatically-generated by our method can be used to train object detectors yielding recognition results remarkably close to those obtained by training on manually-annotated bounding boxes.

40|$|Short linear motifs (SLiMs) in {{proteins}} {{can act as}} {{targets for}} proteolytic cleavage, sites of post-translational modification, determinants of sub-cellular localization, and mediators of protein-protein interactions. Computational discovery of SLiMs involves assembling a group of proteins postulated to share a potential motif, <b>masking</b> <b>out</b> residues less likely to contain such a motif, down-weighting shared motifs arising through common evolutionary descent, and calculation of statistical probabilities allowing for the multiple testing of all possible motifs. Much of the challenge for motif discovery lies in the assembly and masking of datasets of proteins likely to share motifs, since the motifs are typically short (between 3 and 10 amino acids in length), so that potential signals can be easily swamped by the noise of stochastically recurring motifs. Focusing on disordered regions of proteins, where SLiMs are predominantly found, and <b>masking</b> <b>out</b> non-conserved residues can reduce the level of noise but more work is required {{to improve the quality}} of high-throughput experimental datasets (e. g. of physical protein interactions) as input for computational discovery...|$|R
