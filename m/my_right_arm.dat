500|$|The {{episode is}} part of the Treehouse of Horror series, which since the second season, has been a {{tradition}} for The Simpsons to air a new Halloween special each year. Treehouse of Horror episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, Twilight Zone episodes, or old issues of EC Comics. The episode featured guest appearances from Jackie Mason and Aron Ralston, who was the subject of the film 127 Hours. Mason has a recurring role on The Simpsons as Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, who is the father of Krusty the Clown. As it is tradition with most Treehouse of Horror episodes, this episode featured the use of [...] "scary" [...] names in the credits, which is to write alternate names for cast and crew in a [...] "scary" [...] fashion. Ralston came up with his own scary name for the credits, which was Aron [...] "I gave <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> to be on 'The Simpsons'" [...] Ralstump.|$|E
2500|$|From first grade, Bow {{preferred}} {{the company of}} boys, stating, [...] "I could lick any boy my size. <b>My</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> was quite famous. <b>My</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> was developed from pitching so much... Once I hopped a ride on behind a big fire engine. I {{got a lot of}} credit from the gang for that." [...] A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death in her presence after an accident. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. [...] "I wore sweaters and old skirts...didn't want to be treated like a girl...there was one boy who had always been my pal... he kissed me... I wasn't sore. I didn't get indignant. I was horrified and hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paige {{returned}} to his hotel room. He recalled that the next morning, [...] "My stomach got sick with the pain that shot up <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> Sweat popped out all over me. The pain wouldn't quit. I tried lifting my arm. I couldn't. I just sat there, sweating, hurting enough to want to cry, getting sicker in the stomach and getting scared—real scared. My arm. I couldn't lift it." [...] He was examined by physicians in Mexico and in the United States; one expert {{told him that he}} would never pitch again.|$|E

6000|$|The horse {{fell into}} a walk. [...] "Mrs. Brown, if this weren't a public road, I'd be tempted to put <b>my</b> strong <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> around you {{and give you a}} squeeze." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} faith in God {{all the days}} of my life. I believe He loves justice. I believe He is looking down upon us now, {{choosing}} between us. I believe He waits to work His will through <b>my</b> own <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> And such is my belief, that we will take equal chance and let Him speak His own judgment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. The ropes got {{twisted into}} a knot and <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> hurt so I could only use my left hand. Besides, I am {{not much of}} a sailor." ...|$|E
60|$|As he came I grasped {{his left}} wrist {{with my left}} hand, and, {{swinging}} <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> about his left shoulder, caught him beneath the chin with my elbow and bore him backward across my thigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{trouble you}} to hold it to my lips," [...] he said, [...] "for as you see <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> is useless, my {{collar-bone}} is broken, I believe, and my shoulder-blade smashed. However, it might be worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} coward," [...] {{said the}} big King. [...] "I have killed in battle scores of my enemies; by the might of my sword and <b>my</b> good <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> I have conquered many nations; all my life people have feared me. But no one would dare face the {{tremendous}} power of the Prince of Pingaree, boy though he is. It would not be courage, it would be folly, to attempt it." ...|$|R
60|$|Besides, what cared I now for {{the green}} groves and bright shore? Was not Yillah my shore and my grove? my meadow, my mead, my soft shady vine, and my arbor? Of all things {{desirable}} and delightful, the full- plumed sheaf, and <b>my</b> own <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> the band? Enough: no shore for me yet. One sweep of the helm, and our light prow headed round toward the vague land of song, sun, and vine: the fabled South.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] said Albert, {{after another}} short pause, [...] "I {{have got a}} hundred dollars and <b>my</b> axe,--and this <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> I am {{thinking}} of buying a lot of land, about a mile beyond Kater's corner. If I will do it, and build a small house of one room there, will you come and be my wife? It {{will have to be}} a log house at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Try, try!" [...] cried Nigel, eagerly {{extending}} his hand. [...] "Don't fear for my strength--I've {{got plenty of}} it, thank God! and see, I have <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> wedged into a crevice so firmly that nothing could haul it out." ...|$|E
60|$|We had now {{got into}} the month of March. My left arm, though it {{presented}} no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on. <b>My</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> was tolerably restored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.|$|E
60|$|As I {{approached}} her, I {{happened to}} be putting on my gloves. She stopped me; and, taking <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> lifted my hand toward her face. Was she going to kiss it? or to bite it? Neither. She smelt it like a dog--and dropped it again with a hoarse chuckling laugh.|$|E
5000|$|While {{her father}} was away on {{business}} in Cincinnati, the couple eloped and married on November 22, 1795 {{at the home of}} Dr. Stephen Wood, treasurer of the Northwest Territory, at North Bend. The couple honeymooned at Fort Washington, as Harrison was still on duty. Two weeks later, at a farewell dinner for General [...] "Mad" [...] Anthony Wayne, Symmes confronted his new son-in-law {{for the first time since}} their wedding. Addressing Harrison sternly, Symmes demanded to know how he intended to support a family with Anna. Harrison responded [...] "by my sword, and <b>my</b> own <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> sir." [...] Not until his son-in-law had achieved fame on the battlefield did Symmes come to accept him.|$|R
60|$|We clubbed our muskets {{and laid}} about us; even then, those two ladies--always behind me--were steady and ready with the arms. I {{had a lot}} of Maltese and Malays upon me, and, but for a broadsword that Miss Maryon's own hand put in mine, should have got my end from them. But, was that all? No. I saw a heap of banded dark hair and a white dress come thrice between me and them, under <b>my</b> own raised <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> which each time might have {{destroyed}} the wearer of the white dress; and each time one of the lot went down, struck dead.|$|R

He has been our primary liaison with the agencies of the Philippine Government, with accrediting agencies, and has {{played a significant role}} in our search for needed faculty. Dr. Cunningham takes on the tedious task of arranging class and teaching schedules so that the needs of students and of faculty are woven into a manageable whole. He is being relied on increasingly as a resource person by the General Church. He has been <b>my</b> strong <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> throughout <b>my</b> years here at APNTS. ... Dr. Cunningham has devoted his entire professional life to Asia-Pacific Nazarene Theological Seminary making invaluable contributions to the lives of generations of students and leaving an indelible mark upon the identity of the institution. His shadow is long. His service has been exemplary. His faithfulness has been enduring. His commitment has been firm." ...|$|R
6000|$|But it {{went for}} nothing. He put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of {{contempt}} and insult unmoved. He certainly was great in his way. Absently, I {{had taken off}} my white bandage and wound it about <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> When the crowd noticed this, they began upon me. They said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did so, {{and with}} her pallor and her wasted thin face she looked deathlike. At a turn of the path, where a great crag of purple {{porphyry}} closes {{the view of the}} lowlands, I saw her open her eyes. I rode just behind her holding the little girl with <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b> 'The child is all right,' I cried encouragingly.|$|E
6000|$|Calvin {{lifted one}} {{dripping}} hand. [...] "I reckon I'm punched a few. <b>My</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> feels numb, {{and the blood}} is fillin' my left boot. But I'm all here, sure thing." [...] But even as he spoke he reeled. Curtis caught him; he smiled apologetically: [...] "That left leg o' mine, sure feels like a hitchin'-post; reckon some one must o' clipped a nerve somewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1795, at age 22, Harrison met Anna Tuthill Symmes of North Bend, Ohio. She was a {{daughter}} of Anna Tuthill and Judge John Cleves Symmes, {{who served as a}} colonel in the American Revolutionary War, as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation, and became a prominent figure in Ohio. Harrison asked the judge for permission to marry Anna but was refused— the pair waited until Symmes left on business, eloped and were married on November 25, 1795, at the North Bend home of Doctor Stephen Wood, treasurer of the Northwest Territory. The couple honeymooned at Fort Washington since Harrison was still on military duty. Two weeks later, at a farewell dinner for General Wayne, Judge Symmes confronted his new son-in-law {{for the first time since}} the wedding, sternly demanding to know how Harrison intended to support a family. Harrison responded, [...] "by my sword, and <b>my</b> own <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> sir." [...] Afterward, still concerned about Harrison's ability to provide for Anna, Judge Symmes sold the young couple [...] of land in North Bend. Symmes did not come to accept Harrison until he had achieved fame on the battlefield.|$|R
5000|$|In October of {{the same}} year Nelson was {{invested}} as a Knight of the Bath, accompanied on the occasion by Berry. When the King remarked upon the loss of Nelson's <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> he wittily replied, indicating Berry, [...] "But not <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, your majesty". It was agreed between them that when Nelson next hoisted his flag, Berry would be his Flag Captain.|$|R

6000|$|... "You mustn't do that," [...] said I. [...] "I {{will put}} you on." [...] And holding her bicycle upright {{with my left}} hand, I put <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> around her and lifted her to the seat. She was such a childlike, {{sensible}} young person that I {{did not think it}} necessary to ask any permission for this action, nor even to allude to its necessity.|$|E
60|$|I don't want {{to erase}} any of them. <b>My</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> is nearly {{disabled}} by rheumatism, but I am bound {{to write this}} book (and sell 100,000 copies of it--no, I mean a million--next fall) I feel sure I can dictate the book into a phonograph if I don't have to yell. I write 2,000 words a day; I think I can dictate twice as many.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Didn't I? Why weren't you oftener with me? I'll {{tell you}} a funny thing, When I went a soldiering I used to pray--just {{standing}} up, you know--that I shouldn't lose <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> {{because it would be}} so awkward for casting.' He cogitates as he returns to the ingle-nook. 'Somehow I never thought I should be killed. Lots of fellows thought that about themselves, but I never did. It was quite a surprise to me.' ...|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>right</b> away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{open letter}} to the parents of victims who died in the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Wurzelbacher wrote of his right to [...] "protect my family"stating, [...] "As harsh as this sounds—your dead kids don't trump <b>my</b> Constitutional <b>rights</b> ...

6000|$|Wetherford spoke slowly: [...] "I hate {{to lose my}} girl, {{now that}} I've seen her, but I guess you're right; and Lize, poor old critter! It's hell's shame the way I've queered her life, and I'd give <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> to be where I was twelve years ago; but with a price on my head and old age comin' on, I don't see myself ever again getting up to par. It's a losing game for me now." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, Stanczak {{was interviewed}} by Brian Sherwin for Myartspace. During the interview, Stanczak {{recalled}} his experiences with war {{and the loss of}} his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> and how both influenced his art. Stanczak explained, [...] "The transition from using my left hand as <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> main hand, was very difficult. My youthful experiences with the atrocities of the Second World War are with me,- but I wanted to forget them and live a [...] "normal" [...] life and adapt into society more fully. In the search for Art, you have to separate what is emotional and what is logical. I {{did not want to be}} bombarded daily by the past,- I looked for anonymity of actions through non-referential, abstract art." ...|$|R
