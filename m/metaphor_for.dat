40|$|This {{position}} paper addresses the way knowledge is conceptualized in knowledge management literature and practice. Using {{the work of}} Lakoff and Johnson on metaphors it will show how people use metaphors to think and talk about knowledge. In KM literature at least 22 different <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> knowledge are used. Further research shows that these metaphors are primarily Western metaphors while in Eastern philosophy many other <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> knowledge are used. The choice of <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> knowledge has great influence {{about the way we}} think about knowledge management. They determine what we diagnose as KM problems in organizations and what we develop as KM solutions. To illustrate this, the paper presents the results of an exercise set up to determine the effect of metaphors on knowledge management approaches in which two challenging <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> knowledge were used: knowledge as water and knowledge as love...|$|R

5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death.|$|E

The “Big Five” personality factors of 20 patients after lung transplantation were examined with the NEO-FFI. Patients were questioned about their social network, and self- and body-image. The interviews were assessed with metaphor analysis. Significant positive correlations were found between “extraversion” and <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> acoustics, play/sport and economy, furthermore between “openness to experience” and <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> acoustics, container, battle, illness. A positive correlation was also found between “openness to experience” and metaphor frequency. Significant negative correlations were found between “conscientiousness” and <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> illness. The results indicate that personality factors may correspond with certain implicit metaphorical schemas...|$|R

5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|First {{published}} in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, {{the book is}} Morgan's third novel, the first two {{being part of the}} Takeshi Kovacs series. Market Forces satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and action sequences received praise.|$|E
5|$|Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American adult {{animated}} comedy-drama film {{written and}} directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> inner-city life. Heavy Traffic was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film Fritz the Cat. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, Heavy Traffic was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical success.|$|E

5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible.

5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> a magic key or a panacea in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or difficult one. Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross, {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{described}} as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, one of whose feet is thrust into the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, while a hand is placed against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir. The depiction has also been theorized as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> Jesus's defeat of Satan.|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{described}} as a poem of water and hope. It begins with images of the sea, water, and of Eliot's past; this water later becomes a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> life and how humans act. This transitions into an image of a ringing bell and a discussion on time and prayer. Images of men drowning dominate the section before leading into how science and ideas on evolution separate mankind from properly understanding the past. This ends with Krishna stating that the divine will, and not future benefits or rewards, matters. The fourth section is a prayer to the Virgin Mary for fishermen, sailors, and the drowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
