5|$|In March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee,</b> {{threatened}} another filibuster, {{this one}} opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures. The filibuster was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by cloture, in a 68–31 vote. Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election campaign. McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, {{as his own}} campaign manager. Paul's endorsement {{was seen as a}} major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.|$|E
5|$|Paul was {{assigned}} {{to be on the}} Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee</b> as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.|$|E

The Board also included representations from the three levels of Government with the specific authority to make commitments on behalf of their respective Governments. Technical aspects of the bid were supported by various Councils and Committees composed of a professionals staff, and supplemented by a team of domestic and international experts; which were coordinated by Carlos Roberto Osório, Secretary General of the bid committee. <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee,</b> former Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, was the lead advisor to the bid of Rio de Janeiro.

25|$|Earlier {{feasibility}} studies saw the possible terminus {{of a new}} Waitematā Harbour Crossing (possibly as a tunnel) at Wynyard Point. These have now been shelved by Transit New Zealand, with one remaining option being a longer tunnel to surface near Fanshawe Street or further south along Cook Street, possibly with an underground public transport station somewhere underneath the Tank Farm. A less likely option has also been proposed by <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee,</b> Auckland Regional Council chairman, who suggested a tunnel underneath the Auckland CBD to emerge east of the city centre at Stanley Street, thus avoiding the Central Motorway Junction and city centre traffic.|$|E
25|$|Both of Utah's U.S. Senators, Orrin Hatch and <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee,</b> are Republican.

25|$|In May 2012, House Republicans {{put forward}} five {{separate}} budget proposals {{for a vote}} in the Senate. The Republican proposals included the House-approved proposal by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and one that was very close in content to the budget proposal submitted earlier in 2012 by President Barack Obama. The other three proposals each called for greatly reduced government spending. The budget put forward by Senator <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee</b> would halve the government over the next 25 years. Senator Rand Paul's budget included proposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security benefits and the closure of four Cabinet departments. The budget plan from Senator Patrick Toomey aimed to balance the budget within eight years. All five of the proposed plans were rejected in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, {{the bridge}} option again {{surfaced}} in the public eye, {{with a group of}} backers again suggesting that a bridge would be a better option from an urban design, and even from a transport point of view. Critics noted that the proposal would delay other transport plans in the region due to the funding required for it, especially for a 2015 target. The then mayor of North Shore City, Andrew Williams, and the then Chairman of the Auckland Regional Council, <b>Mike</b> <b>Lee,</b> both opposed the reconsideration of existing decisions that had been in favour of a tunnel. The then mayor of Auckland City, John Banks, also favoured the tunnel option, though he did not outright oppose the bridge idea, while the then mayor of Manukau City, Len Brown, considered the bridge proposal worthy of consideration.|$|E
