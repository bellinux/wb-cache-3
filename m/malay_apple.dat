50|$|<b>Malay</b> <b>apple</b> is a {{strictly}} tropical tree {{and will be}} damaged by freezing temperatures. It thrives in humid climates with an annual rainfall of 152 cm or more. It can grow {{at a variety of}} altitudes, from sea level up to 2740 m. The tree can grow to 12 - 18 m in height. It flowers in early summer, bearing fruit three months afterward. In Costa Rica, it flowers earlier, with ripe fruit in April. Coffee growers use the species to divert birds.|$|E
5000|$|Syzygium malaccense has {{a number}} of English common names. It is known as a Malay rose apple, or simply <b>Malay</b> <b>apple,</b> {{mountain}} apple, rose apple, Otaheite apple, pink satin-ash and pommerac (derived from pomme Malac, meaning [...] "Malayan apple" [...] in French). Despite {{the fact that it is}} sometimes called the otaheite cashew, it is not related to cashew. While cashew nuts (but not cashew fruits) may trigger allergic reactions, rose apple fruit has not been observed to do so.|$|E
5000|$|In Costa Rica it's called Guaro de Contrabando, {{which means}} {{counterfeit}} liquor. Also known as chirrite, {{it can be}} made from any kind of fermented fruit from [...] "manzana de agua" [...] (<b>Malay</b> (rose) <b>apple)</b> to pineapple.|$|R
5000|$|In 1934-35 a {{significant}} advance {{was made with}} around 25 acres (10 hectares) of the reserve on the lower slopes of Mt Islay cleared of heavy undergrowth and planted with young trees. The mayor of Cairns advised that the reserve would be planted with [...] "permanent trees which are noteworthy for their ornamentation and their regularity of design, planted at pre-determined distances, {{so that they will}} provide permanent avenues of great beauty." [...] Trees and shrubs of a less [...] "permanent" [...] nature were to be removed and relocated {{to other parts of the}} reserve allowing for the development of avenues lined with pine, acacia, palms, Poinciana and others. This project continued until 1940 when part of the recreation reserve (suburban section 74, north of the council nursery) was converted to a Quarry Reserve for war purposes and part of the 1930s gardens work was destroyed by quarrying. It appears that oil palms, poincianas, hoop pines, two rubber trees, a Dillenia, a Schizolobium, an Indian mango, a Wongi plum, a Terminalia and a <b>Malay</b> <b>Apple</b> were planted during this period by Les Wright.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{characteristics}} of cuttings of five cultivars of local <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> (Syzygium malaccense L.) was studied in Ternate Island, Indonesia. Hardwood cuttings of <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> were planted in two combinations {{of media and}} hormone treatments. During 5 months experiment, can be found that hardwood cutting of <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> with top soil+ sand and NAA 1000 ppm had the best performance in producing shoots and roots for cuttings of <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> in a short period. Although, each of these cultivars has different performance to rooting and shooting, but its can be propagated by cuttings. Therefore, {{the result of this}} research is expected to contribute for conservation of <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> as a source of germplasm for further research and commercialization of <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> as new potential fruit in the international market demand...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the physico-chemical characteristics, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of <b>Malay</b> <b>apple</b> fruit (Syzygium malaccense) grown in Brazil with regard to the geographical origin and its peel fractions and edible portion analyzed independently. Fruit diameter, weight, yield, and centesimal composition, ascorbic acid, reductive sugars, total soluble solids, pH and fiber content were determined. Total phenolics (1293 mg gallic acid equivalent/ 100 g) and total anthocyanins (1045 mg/ 100 g) contents were higher in the peel, with the major anthocyanin identified using HPLC-DAD-MS/MS as cyanidin 3 -glucoside. Higher values for DPPH antiradical scavenging activity (47. 52 μMol trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity/g) and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP, 0. 19 mM ferreous sulfate/g) were also observed in the peel fraction. All extracts tested showed the ability to inhibit oxidation in the β-carotene/linoleic acid system. This study highlights the potential of <b>Malay</b> <b>apple</b> fruit as a good source of antioxidant compounds with potential benefits to human health...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{different}} tropical fruits on biological and behavioral {{aspects of the}} Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera, Tephritidae). Studies on Ceratitis capitata, a world fruit pest, can aid the implementation of control programs by determining the plants with higher vulnerability to attacks and plants able to sustain their population in areas of fly distribution. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of eight tropical fruits on the following biological and behavioral parameters of C. capitata: emergence percentage, life cycle duration, adult size, egg production, longevity, fecundity, egg viability, and oviposition acceptance. The fruits tested were: acerola (Malpighia glabra L.), cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.), star fruit (Averrhoa carambola L.), guava (Psidium guajava L.), soursop (Annona muricata L.), yellow mombin (Spondias mombin L.), <b>Malay</b> <b>apple</b> (Syzygium malaccense L.), and umbu (Spondias tuberosa L.). The biological parameters were obtained by rearing the recently hatched larvae on each of the fruit kinds. Acceptance of fruits for oviposition experiment was assessed using no-choice tests, as couples were exposed to two pieces of the same fruit. The best performances were obtained with guava, soursop, and star fruit. Larvae reared on cashew and acerola fruits had regular performances. No adults emerged from yellow mombin, <b>Malay</b> <b>apple,</b> or umbu. Fruit species did not affect adult longevity, female fecundity, or egg viability. Guava, soursop, and acerola were preferred for oviposition, followed by star fruit, <b>Malay</b> <b>apple,</b> cashew, and yellow mombin. Oviposition did not occur on umbu. In general, fruits with better larval development were also more accepted for oviposition...|$|E
40|$|Summary The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rheological behavior of <b>malay</b> <b>apple,</b> a traditional Amazonian fruit with high bioactive properties, at different temperatures and soluble solids concentrations. The experiments were carried out in a Brookfield R/S Plus rheometer with concentric cylinders geometry. Power Law, Herschel-Bulkley, Mizrahi-Berk, and Sisko rheological models were fitted to the experimental data. The <b>malay</b> <b>apple</b> juice (pulp and skin) showed a pseudoplastic behavior for all temperatures and concentrations with flow behavior indexes lower than 1. The temperature effect on the samples&# 8217; apparent viscosity was analyzed by the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy increased with a decrease in the soluble solids concentration, showing that the lower the concentration, the greater the temperature influence on the apparent viscosity. The soluble solids effect was described by the exponential equation. The exponential factor increased with the temperature increasing, showing that the higher the temperature, the greater the effect of the soluble solids concentration on samples&# 8217; apparent viscosity. Finally, a triparametric mathematical model combining temperature, concentration, and shear rate was proposed aiming to evaluate its effects on the samples&# 8217; apparent viscosity and has accurately adjusted to the data with high correlation index R 2...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Malay</b> <b>Apple</b> [Syzygium malaccense (L.) Merr. & L. M. Perry] is {{an option}} for the {{producer}} as its fruits are attractive and well accepted by the consumer. The difficulty of culture of this species is that the plant is very tall and has a long juvenile period when propagated by seed, making its vegetative propagation necessary to anticipate the productive period and decrease its size. The possibility of vegetative propagation of this species was studied by cutting, layering, and grafting. In the cutting experiment, three doses of indolbutyric acid (IBA) (0, 1, 000, 3, 000, and 5, 000 mg L(- 1)) were tested in two lengths of herbaceous cuttings (15 and 25 cm). In the layering experiment, two periods of layering (summer and autumn) and four doses of IBA (0, 1, 000, 4, 000, 7, 000, and 10, 000 mg kg(- 1)) were evaluated. For grafting, the compatibility between S. malaccense and S. jambos (L.) Alston as rootstock was studied with two diameters (0. 5 and 0. 8 cm) and in two periods (winter and summer), by method of full graft. For cuttings, the percentage of rooting was 20 %, independently of the IBA doses, except for 5, 000 mg L(- 1) that showed negative effect on 15 cm cuttings; layering and grafting were not successful in the studied conditions...|$|E
