This study elucidates the effects of sludge shearing during the thickening process on the microbial community structure {{and its effect on}} biogas production. <b>Medium</b> <b>shearing</b> resulted in approximately 15 % increase in biogas production. By contrast, excessive or high shearing led to a marked decrease in biogas production, possibly due to sludge disintegration and cell lysis. Microbial analysis using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that <b>medium</b> <b>shearing</b> increased the evenness and diversity of the microbial community in the anaerobic digester, which is consistent with the observed improved biogas production. By contrast, microbial diversity decreased under either excessive shearing or high shearing condition. In good agreement with the observed decrease in biogas production, the abundance of Bacteroidales and Syntrophobaterales (which are responsible for hydrolysis and acetogenesis) decreased due to high shearing during recuperative thickening...|$|R

50|$|Recently, {{many states}} {{decreased}} the VOC limit from 450 g/L to 350 g/L limit for the specialty primers, sealers and undercoats category. As state regulatory agencies continue to introduce stricter legislation concerning VOCs, this will pose an even tougher challenge to manufacturers of solvent-based stain-blocking primers. In order {{to decrease the}} VOC of a coating, {{it is necessary to}} remove solvent from the formulation. This has the effect of increasing relative solids content (both pigment + binder) in the formulation, which has a negative effect on viscosity. Increasing resin content primarily increases high-shear viscosity and that is important for sprayability. Increasing pigment content primarily affects low and <b>medium</b> <b>shear</b> viscosities, which are important for flow, leveling, and sag resistance. When formulating a low odor, low VOC primer, if the plan is to increase the binder, then resins with lower viscosity profiles and solubility in low-odor, isoparaffinic solvents are needed.|$|E

Like Cyclone Hondo before it, the storm intensified quickly into Moderate Tropical Storm Ivan, then reached severe status a few hours later. Severe status was held until February 11, when Ivan became a tropical cyclone for a short time. Ivan was moving quite slowly, and this, coupled with <b>medium</b> <b>shear,</b> weakened it to moderate tropical storm status by February 12. During this time, Ivan made two complete loops in the open sea. However, by February 14, it had sped up and entered a more favourable environment, becoming a severe tropical storm. On February 15, Ivan was reupgraded to a tropical cyclone as favourable conditions persisted. Ivan was further upgraded to an Intense Tropical Cyclone on February 16 as it moved closer to Madagascar. Ivan made landfall north of Fanoarivo, Madagascar on February 17. Once overland, rapid weakening occurred due to the rugged terrain of the island. Ivan was forecast to regenerate over the Mozambique Channel into a tropical depression once it left Madagascar.|$|E

50|$|When the red {{cells are}} at rest or at very small shear rates, {{they tend to}} {{aggregate}} and stack together in an energetically favorable manner. The attraction is attributed to charged groups {{on the surface of}} cells and to the presence of fibrinogen and globulins. This aggregated configuration is an arrangement of cells with the least amount of deformation. With very low shear rates, the viscoelastic property of blood is dominated by the aggregation and cell deformability is relatively insignificant. As the shear rate increases the size of the aggregates begins to decrease. With a further increase in shear rate, the cells will rearrange and orient to provide channels for the plasma to pass through and for the cells to slide. In this low to <b>medium</b> <b>shear</b> rate range, the cells wiggle with respect to the neighboring cells allowing flow. The influence of aggregation properties on the viscoelasticity diminish and the influence of red cell deformability begins to increase. As shear rates become large, red blood cells will stretch or deform and align with the flow. Cell layers are formed, separated by plasma, and flow is now attributed to layers of cells sliding on layers of plasma. The cell layer allows for easier flow of blood and as such there is a reduced viscosity and reduced elasticity. The viscoelasticity of the blood is dominated by the deformability of the red blood cells.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Discrepancies in {{the results}} from studies of early events in human {{trophoblast}} invasion of decidua have been acknowledged and are attributed largely to deficiencies in the accuracy of sampling of the decidual tissue used in the research. We describe a novel technique of biopsy of decidua parietalis and basalis that overcomes the issue of accuracy of site of the biopsy. METHODS & RESULTS: The technique is applicable to pregnancies undergoing first trimester surgical termination. Following cervical dilatation, a rigid hysteroscope is introduced into the cervical canal. The pressure of the saline distending <b>medium</b> <b>shears</b> the membranes of the gestation sac away from the decidua parietalis, leaving the pregnancy suspended {{at the site of}} the early placenta (the decidual basalis).

The nerve terminal membranes then reseal to form synaptosomes. The discontinuous Percoll gradient procedure described here is designed to isolate synaptosomes from brain homogenates in the minimum time to allow functional experiments to be performed. Synaptosomes are isolated using a medium-speed centrifuge, while maintaining isotonic conditions and minimizing mechanically damaging resuspension steps. This protocol has advantages over other procedures in terms of speed and by producing relatively homogeneous synaptosomes, minimizing the presence of synaptic and glial plasma membranes and extrasynaptosomal mitochondria. The purified synaptosomes are viable and take up and release neurotransmitters very efficiently. A typical yield of synaptosomes is between 2. 5 and 4 mg of synaptosomal protein per gram rat brain. The procedure takes ~ 1 h from homogenization of the brain until collection of the synaptosomal suspension from the Percoll gradient...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The microstructures {{and crystal}} fabrics {{associated}} {{with the development of}} an amphibolite facies quartzo-feldspathic mylonitic shear zone (Torridon, NW Scotland) have been investigated using SEM electron channelling. Our results illustrate a variety of microstructures and fabrics which attest to a complex shear zone deformation history. Microstructural variation is particularly pronounced at low shear strains: significant intragranular deformation occurs via a domino-faulting style process, whilst mechanical incompatibilities between individual grains result in characteristic grain boundary deformation accommodation microstructures. A sudden reduction in grain size defines the transition to <b>medium</b> <b>shear</b> strains, but many of the boundaries inherited from the original and low shear strain regions can still be recognized and define distinctive bands oriented at low angles to the shear zone margin. Grains within these bands have somewhat steeper preferred dimensional orientations. These domains persist into the high shear strain mylonitic region, where they are oriented subparallel to the shear zone margin and consist of sub- 20 /~m grains. The microstructures suggest that the principal deformation mechanism was intracrystalline plasticity (with contributions from grain size reduction via dynamic recrystallization, grain boundary migration and grain boundary sliding). Crystal fabrics measured from the shear zone vary with position depending on the shear strain involved, and are consistent with the operation of several crystal slip systems (e. g. prism, basal, rhomb and acute rhomb planes) in a consisten...|$|E

The` main factors in the C 2 CA process which influence the properties of Recycled Aggregates or Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) include the type of Parent Concrete (PC), the intensity of autogenous milling and ADR cut-size point. This study aims to investigate the influence of PC and intensity of the autogenous milling {{on the quality of the}} produced recycled aggregates. Three types of concrete which are frequently demanded in the Dutch market were cast as PC and their fresh and hardened properties were tested. After near one year curing of PC samples, they were recycled independently while the aforementioned recycling factors were varied. The effects of different recycling variables on the water absorption, density, crushing resistance and durability of produced recycled aggregates were investigated.
