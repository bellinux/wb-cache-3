40|$|Abstract Bar Chart, {{the other}} name of Gantt Chart, is {{one type of}} sheduling form that often used in {{construction}} project. The Bar Chart is usually completed with <b>S</b> <b>Curve,</b> that present the cumulative earned of work from time to time. The <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> {{can be used to}} controlled the progress of work in any time. The analysis of Earned Value Concept, that analyze cost and time consumed of work simultaneously, is based on <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> either. In many cases, the shape of <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> is formed unless reffered to certain rule, so that the shape of letter “S” some times too steep or too slope slightly. To improve the shape of <b>S</b> <b>Curve,</b> Miller introduced the concept of <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> that composed from three mathematic’s formulas. The three formulas that form three parts of the curve are y = 0, 0225 x 2, y = 1, 5 x – 25, and y = - 125 + 4, 5 x – 0, 0225 x 2 respectively. This curve is ideal, whereas the earned of the work in a certain unit time changes gradually, therefore meet the concept of resources levelling. Miller divided the duration of project excecution in three parts. Each part has a same length of periode. The study of different length of periode for three parts shows that <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> is not ideal, proved by the fluctuation of earned of work in significant value.

40|$|The <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> {{developed}} by the Earning Value has been widely employed for Project Performance Control. However, the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> evaluates project durations and costs deterministically, but takes no uncertainties into account. In order to control projects under uncertainties, the SS <b>curve</b> (Stochastic <b>S</b> <b>curve)</b> is developed. Compared to the <b>S</b> <b>curve,</b> the SS curve is more complete and systematic. Nevertheless, the SS curve does not deal with performance correlation comprehensively, because it ignores that performance deviation may be a normal consequence in the real world, and may lead to an arbitrary estimate of project performance. To deal with the above problems, this paper uses the factor statuses, factor period and unit price period to construct a new performance control mechanism, named as the Factor-Oriented Stochastic <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> (FOSS-Curve). The FOSS-Curve can properly handle performance correlation and enhance the SS curve to avoid over-adjusting when performance deviation occurs. Furthermore, this paper utilizes a scenario analysis to verify the FOSS-Curve and punctuate the overreaction which the SS curve may have.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a narrow focus on Moore 2 ̆ 7 s Irishness and Irish {{writings}} does not adequately represent his relevance and importance in nineteenth-century literature and culture. It {{draws attention to the}} early phase of <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> writing career (from 1800 - 06) in order to illustrate that this neglected period was formative in shaping his authorial persona, his literary reputation, and his approach to communicating meaning in his work. Because <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> developing views on these subjects are evident in the writings and events of his early career, the period is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of his mature work. However, the early writings have suffered from scholarly neglect partly because of the absence of Irish issues and perspectives that dominate later works such as the Irish Melodies and Captain Rock. In order to argue that greater attention be devoted to this period, this paper examines the heteroglossia and multiple personae in <b>Moore</b> <b>s</b> first three books, and the influence of critical responses to these writings on shaping the author s subsequent aesthetic strategies. Understanding these topics enables both a broader recognition of the importance of Moore to the literary world of the nineteenth century, and a more nuanced appreciation of his legacy to Irish literature and culture...|$|R

40|$|Innovativeness determines, {{to a large}} extent, {{the firm}} {{competition}} level. In order to properly manage technological processes, the company strategists need models {{for the analysis of}} the technological performance trend. In recent decades, the literature of technology management has proposed the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> models as useful tools for the analysis of the life cycle of technological innovations in order to plan the company strategies and policies. As for many other models developed in the field of management, the scarce attention devoted to the analytical foundations has reduced the theoretical consistency of the <b>S</b> <b>curves</b> to model the technological innovation process, making it difficult to use these models as real strategic tools. In this work a flexible <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> model is examined in order to highlight the model suitability to analyse the technological innovation process. Specifically, the linearity properties of the model have been studied and a suitable re-parameterization has been proposed. In order to enable the management to strategically use the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> model, approximate prediction intervals about the technological innovation level have been built to monitor the evolution of the performance of a given technology. The theoretical considerations are supported by the practical application of the proposed methodology to three data sets concerning three different technologies: piston aero-engines, jet-aero-engines and digital signal processors, respectively...|$|R
