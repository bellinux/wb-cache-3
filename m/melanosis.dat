2500|$|The first English {{language}} {{report of}} melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William Norris in 1820. [...] In his later work in 1857 he remarked {{that there is}} a familial predisposition for development of melanoma (Eight Cases of <b>Melanosis</b> with Pathological and Therapeutical Remarks on That Disease). Norris was also a pioneer in suggesting a link between nevi and melanoma and the possibility of a relationship between melanoma and environmental exposures, by observing that most of his patients had pale complexions. He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.|$|E
2500|$|Laennec's work put him {{in contact}} with the vanguard of the French medical establishment, {{including}} Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis. Louis would go on to use statistical methods to evaluate the different aspects of the disease's progression, the efficacy of various therapies and individuals' susceptibility, publishing an article in the Annales d'hygiène publique entitled [...] "Note on the Relative Frequency of Phthisis in the Two Sexes". Another good friend and co-worker of Laennec, Gaspard Laurent Bayle, published an article in 1810 entitled Recherches sur la Pthisie Pulmonaire, in which he divided pthisis into six types: tubercular phthisis, glandular phthisis, ulcerous phthisis, phthisis with <b>melanosis,</b> calculous phthisis, and cancerous phthisis. He based his findings on more than 900 autopsies.|$|E
6000|$|Even if {{no single}} fact {{had been known}} {{with respect to the}} {{inheritance}} of disease and malformations by man, the evidence would have been ample {{in the case of the}} horse. And this might have been expected, as horses breed much quicker than man, are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have consulted many works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of all nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is surprising. Authors who have had wide experience give in detail many singular cases, and assert that contracted feet, with the numerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin, founder and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick wind, <b>melanosis,</b> specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great French veterinary Huzard going so far as to say that a blind race could soon be formed), crib-biting, jibbing and ill-temper, are all plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying [...] "there is scarcely a malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;" [...] and M. Bernard adds that the doctrine [...] "that there is scarcely a disease which does not run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every day." [...] (12/21. These various statements are taken from the following works and papers:--Youatt on 'The Horse' pages 35, 220. Lawrence 'The Horse' page 30. Karkeek in an excellent paper in 'Gard. Chronicle' 1853 page 92. Mr. Burke in 'Journal of R. Agricul. Soc. of England' volume 5 page 511. 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page 279. Girou de Buzareingues 'Philosoph. Phys.' page 215. See following papers in 'The Veterinary;' Roberts in volume 2 page 144; M. Marrimpoey volume 2 page 387; Mr. Karkeek volume 4 page 5; Youatt on Goitre in 'Dogs' volume 5 page 483: Youatt in volume 6 pages 66, 348, 412; M. Bernard volume 11 page 539; Dr. Samesreuther on 'Cattle' in volume 12 page 181; Percivall in volume 13 page 47. With respect to blindness in horses see also a whole row of authorities in Dr. P. Lucas's great work, tome 1 page 399. Mr. Baker in 'The Veterinary' volume 13 page 721, gives a strong case of hereditary imperfect vision and of jibbing.) So it is in regard to cattle, with consumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin, etc. etc. But enough, and more than enough, has been said on disease. Andrew Knight, from his own experience, asserts that disease is hereditary with plants; and this assertion is endorsed by Lindley. (12/22. Knight on 'The Culture of the Apple and Pear' page 34. Lindley's 'Horticulture' page 180.) ...|$|E
50|$|The morbid {{deposition}} of black matter, often of a malignant character causing pigmented tumors, is called <b>melanosis.</b> For {{a description of}} melanin-related disorders, see melanin, <b>melanosis</b> coli and ocular <b>melanosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> is {{associated}} with the presence of either giant congenital melanocytic nevi or non-giant nevi of the skin. It is estimated that neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> is present in 2% to 45% of patients with giant congenital melanocytic nevi. Neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> is characterized by the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic tumors in the leptomeninges of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} Sweden showed that 21.5% of smokers and 3% of nonsmokers (genetic {{pigmentation}} or unknown cause) had lesions {{that could be}} classified as an oral melanin pigmentation. A gingival melanin index in 4 degrees was established. Already with a consumption of 1-3 cigarettes a day 9.3% of all 20.333 examined showed a smoker's <b>melanosis.</b> Pipe smokers had smoker's <b>melanosis</b> in 16.8%. One year after the start of cigarette smoking a clinically visible smoker's <b>melanosis</b> could be seen in 12.3% of women, and 17% among men.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 10% {{of patient}} with neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> also present the Dandy-Walker {{syndrome}} and associated Dandy-Walker malformation. This malformation involves an {{enlargement of the}} posterior fossae and fourth ventricle along with agenesis of the cerebellar vermis. The abnormalities of the leptomeninges during fetal development due to neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> may {{be the cause of}} this increased incidence of the Dandy-Walker malformation. The development of hydrocephalus is the most common symptom associated with a combination of neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> and a Dandy-Walker malformation, occurring in about 2 out of 3 patients.|$|E
50|$|Imaging {{has been}} shown to be the only {{reliable}} detection method for the presence of neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> that can be performed in living patients. Currently, the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> is Magnetic Resonance Imaging, although ultrasound is another viable option. The signal due melanin deposits in the leptomeninges typical of neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> can be easily detected in MRI scans of patients under 4 months old. In patients above this age, there is some suggestion that normal brain myelination may partially obscure these signals.|$|E
50|$|Riehl <b>melanosis</b> {{is a form}} {{of contact}} dermatitis, {{beginning}} with pruritus, erythema, and pigmentation that gradually spreads which, after reaching a certain extent, becomes stationary. The pathogenesis of Riehl <b>melanosis</b> is believed to be sun exposure following the use of some perfumes or creams (a photocontact dermatitis).|$|E
50|$|As most {{patients}} with neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> are asymptomatic, {{those who are}} diagnosed through MR imaging are not guarantied to develop symptoms. Those diagnosed who did not develop symptoms ranged from 10% to 68%. This wide range is most likely due to {{the large number of}} asymptomatic, undiagnosed patients with neurocutaneous <b>melanosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Melanosis</b> {{is a form}} of {{hyperpigmentation}} {{associated with}} increased melanin.|$|E
50|$|Neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> is a {{congenital}} disorder {{characterized by}} the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic tumors in the leptomeninges of the central nervous system. These lesions may occur in the amygdala, cerebellum, cerebrum, pons, and spinal cord of patients. Although typically asymptomatic, malignancy occurs in the form of leptomeningeal melanoma in over half of patients. Regardless of the presence of malignancy, patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> generally have a poor prognosis with few treatment options. The pathogenesis of neurocutaneous <b>melanosis</b> is believed {{to be related to the}} abnormal postzygotic development of melanoblasts and mutations of the NRAS gene.|$|E

5000|$|Lesions usually {{disappear}} between 3 {{months to}} 3 years {{for those who}} stop smoking. [...] Smoker's <b>melanosis</b> is a benign, normal physiological reaction, and does not develop into cancer. If it does not disappear, however, a biopsy can verify the diagnosis. If Smoker's <b>melanosis</b> is destroyed by excessive smoking, as in the hard palate of reverse smokers, who smoke with the glowing part of the cigarette inside the mouth for different reasons, a pale depigmented surface is first seen, indicating {{the loss of the}} protecting melanin. Then a red inflammation sometimes occurs and cancer development may follow. In reverse smokers it is important to inspect regularly the areas with smoker's <b>melanosis</b> to detect any melanin destruction, in order to stop smoking in time and thus prevent a cancer to develop.|$|E
