The lack of resolution, tight compaction, {{and the absence of}} function-specific chromatin labels have been the key technical obstacles.

It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.|$|E

Furthermore, in contrast to the random association of BPV 1 E 2 with <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> several of these proteins appear to bind to more specific regions of <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Using human papillomavirus (HPV) type 8 E 2, we show that this region is adjacent to centromeres/kinetochores. Therefore, E 2 proteins from both HPV and animal papillomavirus bind to <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and there are variations in the specificity of this binding. Only the α-papillomavirus E 2 proteins do not stably associate with mitotic chromatin throughout mitosis. These proteins closely associate with prophase chromosomes and bind to chromosomes in telophase but not in metaphase. However, extraction of mitotic cells before fixation results in α-E 2 proteins binding to the pericentromeric region of metaphase chromosomes, as observed for HPV 8 E 2. We postulate that this is the authentic target of these E 2 proteins but that additional factors or a specialized cellular environment is required to stabilize this association.

In our previous work, we hypothesized that the minor capsid protein L 2 of PVs tethers the incoming vDNA to <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to direct them into the nascent nuclei. To re-evaluate how dynamic L 2 recruitment to cellular chromosomes occurs specifically during prometaphase, we developed a quantitative, microscopy-based assay for measuring the degree of chromosome recruitment of L 2 -EGFP. Analyzing various HPV 16 L 2 truncation-mutants revealed a central chromosome-binding region (CBR) of 147 amino acids that confers binding to <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Specific mutations of conserved motifs (IVAL 286 AAAA, RR 302 / 5 AA, and RTR 313 EEE) within the CBR interfered with chromosomal binding. Moreover, assembly-competent HPV 16 containing the chromosome-binding deficient L 2 (RTR 313 EEE) or L 2 (IVAL 286 AAAA) were inhibited for infection despite their ability to be transported to intracellular compartments. Since vDNA and L 2 were not associated with <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> either, the infectivity was likely impaired by a defect in tethering of the vDNA to <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> However, L 2 mutations that abrogated chromatin association also compromised translocation of L 2 across membranes of intracellular organelles. Thus, chromatin recruitment of L 2 may in itself be a requirement for successful penetration of the limiting membrane thereby linking both processes mechanistically. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the association of L 2 with <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is conserved among the alpha, beta, gamma, and iota genera of Papillomaviridae. However, different binding patterns point to a certain variance amongst the different genera.

40|$|SummaryThe origin-recognition complex (ORC) has an {{essential}} role in defining DNA replication origins [1] and in chromosome segregation [2, 3]. Recent studies in Drosophila orc 2 mutants [4 – 6], and in human cells depleted of ORC 2 [3], have suggested that this factor is also implicated in <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> assembly. We asked whether ORC was required for M phase chromosome assembly independently of its function in DNA replication. We performed depletion assays and reconstitution experiments in Xenopus egg extracts, in conditions of M phase chromosome assembly coupled or uncoupled from DNA replication. We show that, although ORC is dispensable for <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> condensation, it is necessary at the interphase-mitosis transition for proper <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> assembly to occur in a reaction not strictly dependent on DNA replication. This function involves the recruitment to chromatin of cdc 2 kinase and the chromatin disassembly of interphasic replication protein A (RPA) foci [7, 8].

A structural model of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV 1) E 2 transactivation domain was generated based on its homology with the solved structure of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) domain.

40|$|Mentor: Duncan J ClarkeThe {{segregation}} of genetic material between newly formed daughter cells during cell division {{is a highly}} dynamic, intricately orchestrated cellular process. The sheer size of eukaryotic genomes poses a fundamental problem that must be overcome to ensure proper transmission of genetic material to daughter cells. After DNA replication, a typical human skin cell contains more than twelve feet of DNA, housed within a space measuring less than a millimeter across. Beyond simply containing this mass of DNA, cells must achieve a dramatic reorganization of their chromosomes during mitosis {{in order for them}} to be evenly divided between daughter cells. <b>Mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> condensation, the process by which chromosomes resolve into discrete bodies prior to nuclear division, must be faithfully carried out to ensure that each pair of sister-chromatids, the identical copies of each chromosome formed during DNA replication, disjoins during nuclear division. If chromosomes fail to condense during early mitosis, tangles between sister-chromatids can lead to breaks in the DNA or an outright failed {{segregation of}} sister-chromatids. Previous research has shown that topoisomerase II and the condensin complexes (condensin I and condensin II) are essential for <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> segregation.

Depletion of either CeCENP-A or CeCENP-C results in an identical “kinetochore null ” phenotype, characterized by complete failure of <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> segregation as well as failure to recruit other kinetochore components and to assemble a mechanically stable spindle. The similarity of their depletion phenotypes, combined with a requirement for CeCENP-A to localize CeCENP-C but not vice versa, suggest that a key step in kinetochore assembly is the recruitment of CENP-C by CENP-A–containing chromatin.

Consequently, a gene regulatory mechanism called dosage compensation equalizes X-linked gene expression between the sexes. Dosage compensation initiates as cells transition from pluripotency to differentiation. In C. elegans, dosage compensation is achieved by the dosage compensation complex (DCC) binding to both X chromosomes in hermaphrodites to downregulate gene expression by two fold. The DCC contains a subcomplex (condensin IDC) similar to the evolutionarily conserved condensin complexes which play {{a fundamental role in}} chromosome dynamics during mitosis.

The similarity of their depletion phenotypes, combined with a requirement for CeCENP-A to localize CeCENP-C but not vice versa, suggest that a key step in kinetochore assembly is the recruitment of CENP-C by CENP-A–containing chromatin. Parallel analysis of CeINCENP-depleted embryos revealed <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> segregation defects different from those observed {{in the absence of}} CeCENP-A/C. Defects are observed before and during anaphase, but the chromatin separates into two equivalently sized masses. Mechanically stable spindles assemble that show defects later in anaphase and telophase. Furthermore, kinetochore assembly and the recruitment of CeINCENP to chromosomes are independent. These results suggest distinct roles for the kinetochore and the chromosomal passengers in <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosome</b> segregation...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is a human}} {{herpesvirus}} {{that causes}} infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several types of cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. An EBV protein that plays an integral role during lytic replication is the immediate-early protein BZLF 1. Our laboratory has found that BZLF 1 (Z) localizes to host chromosomes during mitosis. Two Z-interacting proteins are also found localized to <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{in the presence of}} Z. The association between Z and <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> may lead to the sequestering of Z-interacting proteins within the cell and potentially cause an alteration of chromosome compaction or chromatin structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} of heterochromatin is generally {{accepted as a}} useful tool for the evaluation of the cell state including pathology; however, information on the heterochromatin DNA condensation state expressed by the image optical density in interphase nuclear regions and <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with silent genes is very limited. Since human proliferating myeloblasts are a very convenient model, they were studied in the bone marrow of leukemic patients and established cell cultures using computer assisted image densitometry at the single cell level after heterochromatin visualization by a simple but sensitive cytochemical procedure for demonstration of DNA. As was expected, a high DNA image optical density was noted in central heterochromatin regions in contrast to the nuclear periphery at the nuclear envelope. Similarly, a high nuclear DNA image optical density was also expressed in <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Thus the possibility exists that the large heterochromatin DNA condensation expressed by the large image optical density in central nuclear regions, as in <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> is related to silent gene locations. The similar width of <b>mitotic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and chromatin fibrils in the heterochromatin regions in the interphase nuclei supports that explanation. The chromatin DNA fibrils in the central heterochromatin nuclear regions of interphase cells might just represent masked silent chromosomal segments. Such a conclusion is in harmony with “classical” cytology {{in the first part of}} the last century, which suggests the chromosome continuity from the mitotic division to the interphase where each chromatin region (“Kernbezirk”) actually represents a chromosomal territory...|$|R
