5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a Mohs {{hardness}} of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E
5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually <b>mild</b> <b>steel.</b> Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|New {{methods of}} {{producing}} it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, {{new methods of}} producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce <b>mild</b> <b>steel.</b> This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E
40|$|The heat {{treatment}} and carburization has been acknowledged by some means {{of improving the}} various properties of metals and alloys. In the present investigation the mechanical and wear behaviours of <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> carburized at different temperature range of 850, 900 and 9500 C have been studied and {{it is found that}} the simple {{heat treatment}} greatly improves the hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance of the <b>mild</b> <b>steels.</b> The aim has been {{to examine the effects of}} these different carburization temperatures and conditions on the mechanical and wear properties of the carburized <b>mild</b> <b>steels.</b> For above purpose firstly the <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> are carburized under the different temperature range as stated above and then it is tempered at 2000 C for half an hour after this the carburized and tempered <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> are subjected for different kind of test such as abrasive wear test, hardness test, tensile test and the toughness test. The results of these experiment shows that the process of carburization greatly improves the mechanical and wear properties like hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance and these properties increases with increase in the carburization temperature but apart from this the toughness property decreases and it is further decreases with increase in carburization temperature. The experimental results also shows that the <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> carburized under different temperature range as stated above, with in which the <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> carburized at the temperature of 9500 C gives the best results for the different kinds of mechanical and wear properties because at this temperature it gives highest tensile strength, hardness and wear resistance, so it must be preferred for the required applications...|$|R

But, there were little basic studied on the {{solution heat treatment}} of <b>mild</b> <b>steels.</b> In this paper, the present investigators studied the effect or relationship of aging temperature and methods of solution treatment on {{the phenomena}} of quench-age-hardening of <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> with carbon 0. 07 % preceded by normalizing at 900 ℃ through means of hardness test. The results obtained may be summarised as follows : (1) In order to produce the maximum quench-age-hardening effects {{it is necessary to}} quench after holding 1 hour about 700 ℃. (2) Quench-age-hardening reaches about the same maximum for aging temperature up to about 10 ℃. (3) When aging temperature is 20 ℃, quench-age-hardening have reached the maximum for about 310 hours, and it is unconcerned in temperature of solution treatment being between A_ 1 arrest point and 680 ℃. (4) When aging temperature is lower and temperature of solution treatment is between A_ 1 arrest point and 680 ℃, two steps hardening are observed in the quench-age-hardening of <b>mild</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R
5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel. With {{the invention of the}} Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, a new era of mass-produced steel began. This was followed by the Siemens-Martin process and then the Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> replaced wrought iron.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} in {{steelmaking}} {{began with the}} introduction of Henry Bessemer's Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>steel</b> corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
25|$|Both {{carbon and}} alloy steels are {{suitable}} for case-hardening; typically <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> are used, with low carbon content, usually less than 0.3% (see plain-carbon steel for more information). These <b>mild</b> <b>steels</b> are not normally hardenable due to the low quantity of carbon, so {{the surface of the}} steel is chemically altered to increase the hardenability. Case-hardened steel is formed by diffusing carbon (carburization), nitrogen (nitriding) and/or boron (boriding) into the outer layer of the steel at high temperature, and then heat treating the surface layer to the desired hardness.|$|R

5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and <b>mild</b> <b>steel</b> rods.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from <b>mild</b> <b>steel,</b> but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E

50|$|Ducts {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{as if the}} duct plate and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For <b>mild</b> carbon <b>steels</b> (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300°F is 84% of room temperature stress.

Temperatures above 800°F may cause <b>mild</b> carbon <b>steel</b> to warp.

5|$|The series {{production}} of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be more}} suitable for mass production. The {{production of the}} T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from <b>mild</b> <b>steel.</b> Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. The business plan for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E
