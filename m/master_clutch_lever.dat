50|$|By {{comparison}} with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller 17 L fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> effort.|$|R
50|$|The Panda has a 'grip-locking' <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> and a {{carburettor}} set-up {{that provides}} a very reliable and steady tick-over. The rear brake comprises a back pedal Perry Coaster hub and a conventional bicycle-type hub brake, handlebar lever operated for the front brake.|$|R
5000|$|A rider may be {{assisted}} by {{no more than}} four mechanics while changing bikes during a pit stop, all of whom must wear approved helmets. A mechanic may hold in the bike's <b>clutch</b> <b>lever,</b> but only the rider can select a gear.|$|R
50|$|Traditional scooters (such as the Vespa) {{still have}} manual {{gear-changing}} by a twist {{grip on the}} left hand side of the handlebar, with a co-rotated <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> Modern scooters were often fitted with a throttle-controlled continuously variable transmission, thus earning the term twist-and-go.|$|R
5000|$|CT110s {{are well}} {{regarded}} for their extreme reliability, economy {{and ease of}} operation. The clutchless four speed transmission (centrifugal clutch) {{does not require a}} <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> In Australia and New Zealand the freeing of the left hand of the rider makes mail delivery easier for postal workers, or [...] "posties".|$|R
50|$|The RC8 R {{offers many}} chassis {{adjustments}} not found on other superbikes. In {{addition to the}} suspension, the rider can adjust many other parts on the bike including the front brake lever, the rear brake pedal, the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever,</b> the handlebars, the shifter, the footpegs, and the seat/subframe height. Essentially, the adjustable options allow the RC8 R to accommodate riders of various sizes.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Hondamatic system noted above, Yamaha Motor Company introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year FJR1300 sport-touring motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> would go on traditional motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Some 1950s-era James {{motorcycles}} {{were built}} using Villiers engines that utilized a preselector gearbox. Press the gear pedal down to select 1st gear, then pull in the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> {{and on its}} return the gear engaged and drove forward, press the gear pedal again to select 2nd gear and it will engage only after the lever has been pulled in again.|$|R
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|R
50|$|The layout {{consisted}} of a small, 18 ft lift hill, followed by a diving 180° turn and several small hills, ending with another 180° {{turn back to the}} station. High Speed Thrill Coaster lift was powered by a six-cylinder Ford engine. The operator could control the coaster's overall speed by adjusting the speed of the chain through a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> to engage and disengage the engine from the lift chain.|$|R
50|$|The Crosstourer is {{equipped}} with either a conventional six-speed sequential manual transmission as fitted to most motorcycles, or a dual clutch transmission (DCT), which allows the rider to change gears manually without a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever,</b> or {{leave it to the}} gearbox to select the appropriate gear as an automatic transmission would. The DCT system is also used on the VFR1200F, the first use of DCT on any motorcycle. Like the VFR1200F, the Crosstourer uses a shaft final drive.|$|R
50|$|Regular clutch hand Shifter - This {{is where}} the shifter is a regular knob either located on the tank, which {{operates}} through a linkage to the transmission (tank shifter) or on a lever bolted directly {{to the top of}} the transmission (jockey shifter or slap shifter depending on the transmission design) and involves the semi-complex task of foot clutch operation and hand shifting. The foot is used to operate the <b>clutch</b> pedal <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> and the second hand is used to shift gears.|$|R
5000|$|The GD250N is {{equipped}} with an engine kill switch on the right handlebar, a stand sensor in case the rider forgot to raise it which can cause accident after starting riding (due to carelessness), a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> that first must be gripped before tap on the [...] "START" [...] switch. The rider also must put the bike on [...] "NEUTRAL" [...] gear or the bike will not start if there is another gear (this feature is to prevent rider from carelessly starting the bike).|$|R

500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, {{without the}} need for a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|R

25|$|The Ninja 300 {{is based}} on the Ninja 250R, a {{lightweight}} and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades. Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R. The Ninja 300 also has a LED tail lamp, 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional ABS.By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> effort. Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable ergonomics (such as windscreen effectively protecting from wind blast) which promotes commuting.|$|R

5000|$|Many modern {{motorcycles}} {{feature a}} device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes {{pressure on the}} gear shift rod and quickshifter sends {{a signal to the}} ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially [...] "blips" [...] the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.|$|R

5000|$|The 620 has an APTC wet clutch. According to Ducati, the wet <b>clutch</b> reduces <b>lever</b> {{operating}} effort, ensuring gradual engagement, and {{incorporates a}} racing derived [...] "slipper" [...] device {{to reduce the}} tendency for the rear wheel to lock-up or chatter during aggressive downshifting.|$|R
50|$|The FJR1300AE/AS {{model has}} an {{electronic}} clutch, which Yamaha calls YCC-S. There is no <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> on this model. Instead, the YCC-S system allows the rider to shift using {{a set of}} manually operated push buttons on the left handlebar or via the standard gear shift <b>lever.</b> The electronic <b>clutch</b> is controlled by an internal computer, allowing gear shifts to complete in approximately 0.2 seconds. The gearbox pattern is also unconventional in that neutral {{is at the bottom}} end of the range, otherwise the gearbox is identical to the A model. The ECU automatically controls the electronic clutch and ignition timing to ensure smooth gear shifting and will actuate the clutch at standstill. Stalling the engine is not normally possible.|$|R
50|$|The third type {{developed}} {{most recently}} and fitted to 7000series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet <b>master</b> <b>clutch,</b> a six speed powershift section and a four speed range box. As reverse {{is at the}} front of the powershift section the reverse gears are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2x3x4) and 12 reverse gears (1x3x4). Note that the top three reverse gears are not available for use.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the {{transmission input shaft}} and clutch hub to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|EX250-H - This model came to Canada as the Ninja 250R between 2000 and 2002, {{after which}} it {{received}} a new name: ZZR-250, {{in line with}} the -H model's name elsewhere in the world, where it had existed since 1992. This motorcycle has parts in common with the -F model, though it shares the same engine, albeit with different casings. It sports a lateral aluminum frame, a different fairing (designed to make it look sportier), larger 17-inch wheels, an adjustable rear shock absorber, adjustable brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>levers,</b> a smaller drive sprocket, computer-controlled timing advance, and a revised electrical system. It also had a smaller carburetor, & slightly different compression ratio, both of which were designed for quicker revving and slightly higher top end power. However, these upgrades came at a 6 kg weight gain.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1990s, supermoto bikes, {{including}} the precursor motorcycles used in Superbikers, were converted open-class two-stroke motocross or enduro bikes desired for their light weight and jumping abilities. The motorcycles currently used for Supermoto racing are predominantly single-cylinder four-stroke powered dirtbikes with 17 in, sometimes with 16.5 in front wheels. The 17 in wheels allow {{the use of}} up to 7.0 in superbike road racing slick tires. These are often hand-grooved on the rear tire to facilitate slightly better acceleration on the dirt stretches of a supermoto course. Suspension is lowered and slightly stiffened in comparison with a stock dirt bike, and braking power is improved with oversize front brake rotors and calipers. Despite the lack of trees on supermoto courses, hand guards are frequently added to supermoto bikes due the extreme cornering angles achieved by riders. Hand guards also greatly improve survivability of the brake & <b>clutch</b> <b>levers</b> during a fall making supermoto bikes highly crash resistant and often able to quickly re-enter the fray during a race following a crash.|$|R
50|$|The first Tempo moped ever {{manufactured}} was the bicycle-like 1951 Tempo Handy. It {{looked like}} a bicycle, but where the pedals normally would be it carried a Sachs 49 cc, 1 hp engine with pedals and two gears, shifted with the left side twist grip. It had a three-litre gasoline tank and weighed around 28 kilograms. To start the moped, one put the engine in neutral (the start gear) and used the pedals as a kick starter. To pedal the bike, e.g. {{in the event of}} running out of petrol, the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> was kept depressed by means of a small locking device and the transmission put in first or second gear. The engine was stopped by pressing a small switch that grounded the magneto. This moped sold well and was very cheap, but eventually more luxuries were needed and from 1957 Tempo made the rear suspensioned Comfort and Swing (same construction, the latter utilizing a swingarm front fork hence the name.) mopeds using the same engine before introducing the Corvette in 1960. Upgraded versions of the Sachs hand-shifted pedal engine had 1,6 hp and 3 gears.|$|R
