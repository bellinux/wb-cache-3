40|$|Westinghouse Electric Corporation is {{developing}} both the Communications Ground Segment and the Series 1000 Mobile Phone for American Mobile Satellite Corporation's (AMSC's) Mobile Satellite (MSAT) system. The {{success of the}} voice services portion of this system depends, to some extent, upon the interoperability of the cellular network and the satellite communication circuit switched communication channels. This paper will describe the set of user-selectable cellular interoperable modes (cellular first/satellite second, etc.) provided by the Mobile Phone and described how they are implemented with the ground segment. Topics including roaming registration and cellular-to-satellite 'seamless' call handoff will be discussed, along with the relevant Interim Standard IS- 41 Revision B Cellular Radiotelecommunications Intersystem Operations and IOS- 553 <b>Mobile</b> <b>Station</b> - <b>Land</b> <b>Station</b> Compatibility Specification...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the bands listed above, paging may be authorized on any frequency in the <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> bands authorized under Part 90 of the FCC rules, including frequencies in the 72-76 MHz band {{as well as the}} usual 30.56-49.58 MHz, 150.775-162.000 MHz VHF bands and the 450-470 MHz band (plus 421-430 or 470-512 MHz in certain cities). In larger metropolitan areas with congested frequency spectrum, paging services will often share the same frequency as <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>stations,</b> or operate on an adjacent channel. For example, a department store may operate handheld walkie-talkies on 462.7625 MHz while there are high power pager transmitters on 462.7500 MHz and/or 462.7750 MHz in the same city. Or, a restaurant will use 467.7500 MHz to alert customers when their table is ready (using so-called [...] "coaster pagers") while a department store nearby uses 467.7500 MHz for their in-store communications. In both of these examples, the department store is forced to use a squelch system such as CTCSS or DCS.|$|R

50|$|Before {{satellite}} communication systems were widely available, {{the only way}} ships at sea had {{to communicate with the}} rest of the world was via radio connections to <b>land</b> <b>stations.</b> To talk to people who did not operate radio equipment, a vessel at sea would make contact with a <b>land</b> <b>station,</b> usually using high frequency AM or single-sideband (SSB) radio. The operator of the <b>land</b> <b>station</b> would patch the radio connection though to a telephone call made over the regular telephone system (referred to as a landline). The AT&T High Seas Service was a commercial radio-to-telephone connection system using the above <b>land</b> <b>stations.</b> The charges were typically settled by making the landline connection a collect call. Larger vessels maintained accounts with AT&T, but the service was available to any vessel with a marine HF radio. In the 1980s the radio link was priced at several dollars per minute plus the long distance landline charge from the High Seas station.|$|R
