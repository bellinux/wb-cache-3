Besides the mechanical behavior of the joints the influence on the dimensional accuracy is of particular interest as joining techniques like clinching or self-piercing riveting cause distortion comparable to spot welding. In recent years, a lot of simplified models using the finite element method (FEM) to predict the distortion of assemblies caused by welding (weld seams, spot welds) were presented and commercialized. In contrast to thermal joining technologies, there are no such simplified models with practical relevance existing in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technology sector. Simulating <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> techniques was basically feasible by models consisting of small volume elements and is more and more used to optimize process parameters. The use of volume elements implicates high calculation time and is not applicable to predict the distortion of large sheet metal assemblies. Along the process chain of car body assemblies quick as well as accurate FE-methods are required. This paper indicates that a transmission of calculation methods from thermal to <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technologies is not directly possible due to technological differences. Furthermore a new method to predict distortion caused by different <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technologies including effects from previous forming processes and clamping conditions is presented. The validation of the simplified model takes place due to an extensive design of experiments. In the course of experiments of the simplified model approach, it can be proved that the distortion of simple as well as of complex samples can be reliably predicted.

40|$|Abstract. The {{aspect of}} {{lightweight}} constructions {{becomes more and}} more important. This particularly applies to the automotive industry which wants to lower the fuel consumption by a smaller vehicle weight. Under this point of view in recent years steel has often been replaced by aluminum alloys. In comparison with this the application of lightweight magnesium alloys, whose specific density is appropriate within the range of plastics, opens further prospects for weight reduction. The pre-condition for this purpose is the supply of suitable joining processes for magnesium alloys, which are universally applicable and offer the maximum utilization of the materials of the joined parts under operating loads. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> techniques provide the opportunity of connecting magnesium components homogeneously as well as in material mix. However, the anisotropic deformation characteristics of the hexagonal crystal structure of magnesium at room temperature contain the application for <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> techniques. Only starting from temperatures of approx. 225 °C a sufficient plastic deformation and thus a crack-free shaping of the magnesium material is given. Therefore preheating of magnesium substrates leads to a broad extension of deformability and offers the chance to realize a high quality mechanical joint.

40|$|In {{the course}} of ongoing {{development}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technologies, different technologies were developed in the last years, where often the necessary die as contrary die was substituted by a flat anvil. Using the example of dieless clinching, the full potential of such process alternatives is visible. If the tools, as the punch or the blank-holder are modified and the necessary die is substituted by a flat anvil, then several advantages for the process alternative - the dieless clinching - emerges.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} as far as new constructions are concerned is the reduction of weight of car bodies, {{and as a result}} reduction of fuel consumption. That is why multi-material design is a central topic in the development of car bodies. To generate these hybrid structures <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technologies, as well as adhesive bondings with epoxy resin based adhesive, have been established. The combination of these two joining technologies, and their specific advantages, ensure quality and reliability of the joining in body construction. Optimal parameters for tools and methods of each technology cannot be simply transferred to hybrid joinings. Adhesive and <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technologies are a system with complex interactions. Focus of the present research is the hybrid joining of self-piercing riveting and clinching in combination with heat curing, structural adhesive and aluminum joining parts. During this process adhesive bags {{in the area of the}} joinings, as well as between two joining points, are prone to result. The experimental and numerical formation of adhesive bags in the joining area was topic of a former research [Neu 11]. The current report summarizes investigates the formation of adhesive bags between hybrid joints caused by the displacement of adhesive during the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> process and by the thermal curing process. For that purpose experimental and numerical methods were used. The experimental studies at the Fraunhofer IWU show the adhesive displacement and the deformation of the joining parts during the joining process, where two optical measuring methods are developed, qualified and successfully applied. The numerical studies of the Fraunhofer IFAM result in the development of a new simulation method to describe the formation of adhesive bags between hybrid jointing points. The described method is able to be used for components with relevance for the industry. Experiments and simulations are used to get a better understanding of the forming process of adhesive bags. The investigation lead to the following hypothesis: in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> process the fluid adhesive is pushed out of the joining point area. By the use of widely used adhesives with high viscosity, the fluid is not fully pushed to the edges of the joining parts; in fact it damps the closing of the adhesive gap between the metallic parts. The dynamic balance of forces between the changing adhesive bags due to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining,</b> and the reaction force of the adhesive, lead to an adhesive wave that spreads radially to the axis of joining point, which is ebbing away at a specific distance. The formation of adhesive bags between hybrid joining points results of an overlap of two approaching ebbing adhesive waves. The experimental and numerical investigation of the current research support the above-mentioned hypothesis of the formation of adhesive bags. Experiments and simulations were executed first with simple parts, subsequently on parts which are near to industrial demands. Finally, recommendations for optimization of the hybrid joining process are made...|$|R

40|$|In multi-material-design, e. g. in the {{automotive}} industry, <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> processes like self-pierce riveting are well established, {{because of their}} amount of advantages. However, adhesive bonding with one-component structural adhesives is increasingly being used. The combination of the specific advantages of both joining techniques {{in the form of}} hybrid joints leads to synergies of quality and reliability, such as high corrosion resistance and better damping properties. A critical issue is the generation of global deformations of the different parts of the mechanical joints. These global deformations of the sheet metal between two or more mechanical connectors (e. g. rivets) are caused by the formation of adhesive bags during the riveting process, before the adhesive curing takes place. This research focuses on the time-dependent formation process of these bags. The aim is to achieve a reduction of global deformations based on detailed knowledge of the adhesive flow during the manufacturing of the joint by means of experiments and simulations. For this purpose experimental techniques and measurement methods for deformations over time are presented for different setups of hybrid joint types of self-piercing rivets in combination with adhesive bonding. The challenge is to track rapid and small surface deformations very accurately in the ongoing <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> process. High-speed optical measurement technology like Point-Tracking and surface scanning are used to track the resulting deformations experimentally.

40|$|By {{combining}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> and {{adhesive bonding}} interactions exist between these elementary joining methods. Tooling and process parameters {{that have been}} determined as optimum, separately, can not {{be transferred to the}} hybrid technology, directly. Mutual interactions lead to the necessity of fitting the respective process parameters of both elementary joining methods in order to achieve best results in the combined joining process. Optimizing parameters for the overall system is required in every case. Therefore accurate statements concerning dependencies in terms of quality production are needed, such as clear guidelines for adhesive properties and adhesive processing or adjustment of process kinematics. Understanding of the process can be accomplished not only by experimental studies, so the numerical description of hybrid joining processes and the generation of additional knowledge from simulations has to be worked out. Subjects of investigation are the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> processes clinching and self-pierce-riveting in combination with adhesive bonding, below called clinch-bonding and riv-bonding. In extensive experimental studies the influence of various parameters on the clinch-bonding process are studied. These studies are focussed on the influence of adhesive viscosity and process kinematics on the joint quality for several joining applications with identical overall gauge. A key parameter of process kinematics is the relative axial positioning of punch and blank holder {{at the beginning of the}} joining process. Another parameter is a non-continuous joining process with a defined stopping time during the joining process. For the hybrid bonding and <b>mechanical</b> <b>joining</b> technologies clinch-bonding and riv-bonding FEA reference models are developed regarding elementary joining by forming processes. These reference models are expanded with the displacement of the liquid adhesive to describe the hybrid joining processes. The influence of the described parameters is investigated in a variety of simulations. Positioning the punch 0. 5 mm till 1. 0 mm in front of the blank holder leads to significant improvement of the joint quality for clinch-bonding processes by reducing the adhesive bags in the joint area. Thus a greater undercut can be realised. Stopping the joining process for about 1. 0 s can provide an increased undercut value in the same dimension. Based on the increased process knowledge based on simulations, options for process optimization are derived. The developed simulations go beyond the state of the art, how-ever, are associated with numerical instability and high computational times.
