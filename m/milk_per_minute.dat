40|$|Abstract – Segregation {{analyses}} with Gibbs sampling {{were applied}} to investigate the mode of inheritance and to estimate the genetic parameters of milk flow of Swiss dairy cattle. The data consisted of 20 4397, 655 989 and 40 242 lactation records of milk flow in Brown Swiss, Simmental and Holstein cattle, respectively (4 to 22 years). Separate genetic analyses of first and multiple lactations were carried out for each breed. The results show that genetic parameters especially polygenic variance and heritability of milk flow in the first lactation were very similar under both mixed inheritance (polygenes + major gene) and polygenic models. Segregation analyses yielded very low major gene variances which favour the polygenic determinism of milk flow. Heritabilities and repeatabilities of milk flow in both Brown Swiss and Simmental were high (0. 44 to 0. 48 and 0. 54 to 0. 59, respectively). The heritability of milk flow based on scores of milking ability in Holstein was intermediate (0. 25). Variance components and heritabilities in the first lactation were slightly larger than those estimates for multiple lactations. The results suggest that milk flow (the quantity of <b>milk</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> of milking) is a relevant measurement to characterise the cows milking ability {{which is a good}} candidate trait to be evaluated for a possible inclusion in the selection objectives in dairy cattle...|$|E
40|$|Os valores econÃmicos representam o lucro por unidade de melhoria nas caracterÃsticas e foram calculados com base em registros zootÃcnicos e contÃbeis de um sistema de produÃÃo de bovinos leiteiros mestiÃos HolandÃs x GuzerÃ de fazenda {{comercial}} situada no semi-Ãrido do SertÃo Central do Estado do CearÃ, Brasil. Para esses cÃlculos foram utilizados dois mÃtodos: 1) a partir da derivada parcial do lucro para cada caracterÃstica (RT - COT) e 2) pela derivada parcial da relaÃÃo RT/COT. Em ambos os mÃtodos os valores econÃmicos foram transformados em equivalente-leite. Para o primeiro mÃtodo, os valores econÃmicos obtidos foram: 0, 68 /kg para o leite, - 9, 14 /caso de mamite, 29, 28 por kg de leite/minuto para fluxo lÃcteo, - 41, 74 /serviÃos-concepÃÃo, 3, 67 /dia de vida Ãtil, - 0, 06 /dia para idade ao primeiro parto e - 9, 55 /kg de peso corporal. Os valores do segundo mÃtodo foram semelhantes aos do primeiro provavelmente devido a relaÃÃo RT/COT ter sido prÃxima de 1 (1, 06). As caracterÃsticas de nÃmero de serviÃo/concepÃÃo, mamite, peso corporal da vaca seca e idade ao primeiro parto apresentaram valores econÃmicos negativos, enquanto que o fluxo lÃcteo, a produÃÃo de leite e a vida Ãtil proporcionaram lucro genÃtico ao sistema. Portanto, todas estas caracterÃsticas devem ser incluÃdas no objetivo econÃmico de seleÃÃo de bovinos leiteiros em fazendas que apresentam manejo e condiÃÃes de criaÃÃo semelhante Ã avaliada neste estudo. The economic values {{represent the}} profit {{per unit of}} improvement in the characteristics were calculated based on husbandry and accountancy records of a production system of dairy cattle crossbred Holstein x commercial farm located in the semiarid of the State of CearÃ, Brazil. For these calculations we used two methods: 1) from the partial derivative of profit for each feature (RT - TOC) and 2) the partial derivative of the ratio RT / COT. In both methods the economic values were converted to equivalent-milk. For the first method, the economic values obtained were 0. 68 / kg for milk, - 9. 14 / case of mastitis, 29. 28 per kg of <b>milk</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> for milk flow, - 41. 74 / services-conception, 3. 67 / day of herdlife, - 0. 06 / day for age at first calving and - 9. 55 / kg body weight. The values of the second method were similar to the first probably because the ratio RT / COT have been close to 1 (1. 06). The characteristics {{of the number of}} service / conception, mastitis, body weight, dry cow weight and age at first calving had negative economic values, milk flow, milk yield and herdlife showed genetic profit in the system. Therefore, all these characteristics {{should be included in the}} economic objective of selection for dairy cattle on farms that have management and creating conditions similar to that evaluated in this stud...|$|E
40|$|Objective—This study {{compared}} the effectiveness, efficiency, comfort and convenience of newly designed breast pump suction patterns (BPSPs) that mimic sucking of the breastfeeding human infant during the initiation {{and maintenance of}} lactation. Methods— 105 mothers of premature infants ≤ 34 weeks of gestation {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 3 groups within 24 hours post-birth. Each group tested 2 BPSPs; an initiation BPSP was used until the onset of lactogenesis II (OOL-II) and a maintenance BPSP was used thereafter. Results—Mothers who used the experimental initiation and the standard 2. 0 maintenance BPSPs (EXP-STD group) demonstrated significantly greater daily and cumulative milk output, and greater <b>milk</b> output <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> spent pumping. Conclusions—BPSPs that mimic the unique sucking patterns used by healthy term breastfeeding infants during the initiation and maintenance of lactation are more effective, efficient, comfortable and convenient than other BPSPs...|$|R
40|$|In 100 bottle-fed preterm infants feeding {{efficiency}} was {{studied by}} quantifying {{the volume of}} <b>milk</b> intake <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> {{and the number of}} teat insertions per 10 ml of milk intake. These variables were related to gestational age and to number of weeks of feeding experience. Feeding efficiency was greater in infants above 34 weeks gestational age than in those below this age. There was a significant correlation between feeding efficiency and the duration of feeding experience at most gestational ages between 32 and 37 weeks. A characteristic adducted and flexed arm posture was observed during feeding: it changed along with feeding experience. A neonatal feeding score was devised that allowed the quantification of the early oral feeding behavior. The feeding score correlated well with some aspects of perinatal assessment, with some aspects of the neonatal neurological evaluation and with developmental assessment at 7 months of age. These findings are a stimulus to continue our study into the relationships between feeding behaviour and other aspects of early development, especially of neurological development. status: publishe...|$|R
