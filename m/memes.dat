5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because <b>memes</b> are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new <b>memes,</b> which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on <b>memes,</b> a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elegant method for visually representing {{the life and}} times of a <b>meme,</b> an element of cultural transmission. The elements of a <b>Meme</b> Map are described, and the steps for constructing a generic <b>Meme</b> Map are listed. A worked example of a <b>Meme</b> Map (using the "organic" <b>meme)</b> is provided. A <b>Meme</b> Map is a powerful and flexible tool for capturing, displaying and sharing memetic information - illustrating the time and space propinquity of <b>Meme</b> Events - yet it is easy to learn and simple to apply. <b>Meme</b> Maps can readily be drawn on “the back on an envelope”, or they can be professionally produced using any standard drawing package on a computer...|$|R
5000|$|One {{technique}} of <b>meme</b> mapping represents the evolution and transmission of a <b>meme</b> {{across time and}} space. Such a <b>meme</b> map uses a figure-8 diagram (an analemma) to map the gestation (in the lower loop), birth (at the choke point), and development (in the upper loop) of the selected <b>meme.</b> Such <b>meme</b> maps are nonscalar, with time mapped onto the y-axis and space onto the x-axis transect. One can read the temporal progression of the mapped <b>meme</b> from south to north on such a <b>meme</b> map. Paull has published a worked example using the [...] "organics meme" [...] (as in organic agriculture).|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>meme</b> {{propagation}} and {{the prediction of}} <b>meme</b> trajectory are emerging areas {{of interest in the}} field of complex networks research. In addition to the properties of the <b>meme</b> itself, the structural properties of the underlying network decides the speed and the trajectory of the propagating <b>meme.</b> In this paper, we provide an artificial framework for studying the <b>meme</b> propagation patterns. Firstly, the framework includes a synthetic network which simulates a real world network and acts as a testbed for <b>meme</b> simulation. Secondly, we propose a <b>meme</b> spreading model based on the diversity of edges in the network. Through the experiments conducted, we show that the generated synthetic network combined with the proposed spreading model is able to simulate a real world <b>meme</b> spread. Our proposed model is validated by the propagation of the Higgs boson <b>meme</b> on Twitter as well as many real world social networks...|$|R

5000|$|Dawkins {{initially}} defined <b>meme</b> as a noun that [...] "conveys {{the idea}} of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation". John S. Wilkins retained the notion of <b>meme</b> as a kernel of cultural imitation while emphasizing the <b>meme's</b> evolutionary aspect, defining the <b>meme</b> as [...] "the least unit of sociocultural information relative to a selection process that has favorable or unfavorable selection bias that exceeds its endogenous tendency to change". The <b>meme</b> as a unit provides a convenient means of discussing [...] "a piece of thought copied from person to person", regardless of whether that thought contains others inside it, or forms part of a larger <b>meme.</b> A <b>meme</b> could consist of a single word, or a <b>meme</b> could consist of the entire speech in which that word first occurred. This forms an analogy to {{the idea of}} a gene as a single unit of self-replicating information found on the self-replicating chromosome.|$|R

In February 2010, a photoshopped version of Pedobear appeared along with mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in an article on the games in Gazeta Olsztyńska, a Polish newspaper. This was done accidentally; due to the image being used from Google Images, the authors were unaware of the joke. Similarly, the Dutch television guide Avrobode used one of the images. It has been used as a symbol of pedophilia by Maltese graffiti vandals prior to a papal visit.|$|E

The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural <b>memes</b> and becoming part of India's daily vernacular.

5|$|Clouzot's health {{problems}} {{kept him from}} military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature Le Duel, {{as well as two}} plays for him: On prend les <b>mêmes,</b> which was performed in December 1940, and Comédie en trois actes, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, who declined to purchase them. After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940. Alfred Grevin, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin's offer. Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's mystery novel Six hommes mort (Six Dead Men). Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.|$|E

In early 2015, CMLL vacated the championship once more, this time because champion Diamante Azul had not appeared at CMLL shows for several months. Current champion Hechicero was the first champion to defend the championship at a non-CMLL event as he defeated Caifan on November 27, 2016 in the main event of Lucha <b>Memes</b> Chairo 6 in Naucalpan, State of Mexico. Of all the champions El Texano Jr. and Shocker are the only champions to never have a successful championship defense.
