Unnecessary marine biological growth or <b>marine</b> <b>pollutants</b> attached to the moving parts will affect the operation of the system by introducing imbalance. The imbalance, regarded as faults, would change the performance of turbine and lead to progressively increasing damages. In this paper, a marine current turbine prototype with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) has been studied. An innovative imbalance fault detection method is proposed for marine current turbines under the condition of wave and turbulence. In the proposed method, the average frequency of current is calculated through synchronous sampling. Meanwhile, current fluctuation influence is reduced during one revolution. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and spectrum analysis are used to achieve fault characteristics. Theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results under different conditions validate the proposed method. Moreover the proposed method could be used for long-term marine current turbine monitoring in respect to its simplicity and low time cost...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the effect of}} <b>marine</b> <b>pollutants</b> on <b>marine</b> mammals, whit special focus given Bergmans studies on the Baltic grey seal. Environmental pollutions have gained increasing attention the last few decades, and the alarming levels of certain pollutant compounds found in the biota caused by the worldwide spread of anthropogenic pollutants like PCBs and DDTs, has led to numerous studies on the subjects. Potential ways in which chemical compounds may manifest themselves include direct mortality, reproductive impairment, and increased susceptibility to disease. It is often assumed that sublethal toxic effects of persistent contaminants will ultimately alter population size. Unfortunately, field studies are hampered by many confounding variables, obscuring the nature of various associations and possible cause- end effect relationships. According to Tannabe (1988) the ocean serves as sink for most pollutants, and due to their lipophilic characteristics, the levels of several pollutants found has stagnated and exposure to these contaminants can be expected in the coming decades...|$|R

Next-generation sequencing of a normalized meta-transcriptomic library developed for the eukaryotic components of the A. formosa coral holobiont was leveraged to conduct microarray-based global transcript expression analysis of integrated coral/zooxanthellae responses to the RDX exposure. Total differentially expressed transcripts (DET) increased with increasing RDX exposure concentrations as did the proportion of zooxanthellae DET relative to the coral animal. Transcriptional responses in the coral demonstrated higher sensitivity to RDX compared to zooxanthellae where increased expression of gene transcripts coding xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms (i. e. cytochrome P 450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family) were initiated at the lowest exposure concentration.

In this work, we evaluated the influence of two antifouling biocides, tributyltin (TBT) and diuron, on the reproductive mechanisms of the marine invertebrate Ciona intestinalis.

Results show that sodium (Na+) currents were significantly reduced by either of the two biocides, whereas conductance was significantly increased. The fertilization current frequency and amplitude, fertilization rate and larval development were affected only by TBT. This study suggests that: (i) the two biocides affect either the electrical properties of the oocyte plasma membrane and the reproductive success representing a risk factor for the survival of the species exposed to environmental pollution; (ii) the ascidian Ciona intestinalis may represent a good model organism to test toxicity of <b>marine</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Possible mechanisms of action of the two biocides are discussed...|$|R

Due to their life history strategies, marine invertebrates are unable to avoid stress and must adapt to variable environments. We examined the genetic basis of pollution resistance across multiple environments using the marine invertebrate, Styela plicata. Gametes were crossed in a quantitative genetic breeding design to enable partitioning of additive genetic variance across a concentration gradient of a common <b>marine</b> <b>pollutant,</b> copper. Hatching success was scored {{as a measure of}} stress resistance in copper concentrations of 0, 75, 150, and 350 mu g/L. There was a significant genotype 3 environment interaction in hatching success across copper concentrations. Further analysis using factor analytic modeling confirmed a significant dimension of across-environment genetic variation where the genetic basis of resistance to stress in the first three environments differed from that in the environment of highest copper concentration. A second genetic dimension further differentiated between the genetic basis of resistance to low and high stress environments.

40|$|Bromobenzene (BrB), a hydrophobic, {{recalcitrant}} organic compound, {{is listed}} {{by the environmental}} protection agencies as an environmental and <b>marine</b> <b>pollutant</b> having hepatotoxic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects. The tropical marine yeast Yarrowia lipolytica 3589 was seen to grow aerobically on BrB and displayed a maximum growth rate (μmax) of 0. 04 h- 1. Furthermore, we also observed an increase in cell size and sedimentation velocity for the cells grown on BrB as compared to the glucose grown cells. The cells attached to the hydrophobic bromobenzene droplets through its hydrophobic and acid–base interactions. The BrB (0. 5 %, 47. 6 mM) was utilized by the cells with the release of a corresponding amount of bromide (12. 87 mM) and yielded a cell mass of 1. 86 g/L after showing 34 % degradation in 96 h. Maximum dehalogenase activity of 16. 16 U/mL was seen in the cell free supernatant after 24 h of growth. Identification of metabolites formed as a result of BrB degradation, namely, phenol, catechol, cis, cis muconic acid, and carbon dioxide were determined by LC–MS and GC–MS. The initial attack on bromobenzene by Y. lipolytica cells lead to the transient accumulation of phenol as an early intermediate which is being reported for the first time. Degradation of phenol led to catechol which was degraded by the ortho- cleavage pathway forming cis, cis muconic acid and then to Krebs cycle intermediates eventually leading to CO 2 production. The study shows that dehalogenation via an extracellular dehalogenase occurs prior to ring cleavage with phenol as the preliminary degradative compound being produced. The yeast was also able to grow on the degradative products, i. e., phenol and catechol, to varying degrees which would be of potential relevance in the degradation and remediation of xenobiotic environmental bromoaromatic pollutants such as bromobenzene...|$|E

The toxicity of metal contaminants in sediments to organisms {{is dependent on the}} bioavailability of the metals in both the water and sediment phases and the sensitivity of the organism to the metal exposure. This study investigated the effects of two metal contaminants of concern (CdCl 2 and CuCl 2) on a battery of marine bioassays employed for sediment assessment. Cadmium, a known carcinogen and widespread <b>marine</b> <b>pollutant,</b> was found to be the least toxic of the two assayed metals in all in vivo tests. However CdCl 2 was found to be more toxic to the fish cell lines PLHC- 1 and RTG- 2 than CuCl 2. Tisbe battagliai was the most sensitive species to both metals and the Microtox® and cell lines were the least sensitive (cadmium was found to be three orders of magnitude less toxic to Vibrio fischeri than to T. battagliai). The sensitivity of Tetraselmis suecica to the two metals varied greatly. Marine microalgae are among the organisms that can tolerate higher levels of cadmium. This hypothesis is demonstrated in this study where {{it was not possible to}} derive an EC 50 value for CdCl 2 and the marine prasinophyte, T. suecica. Conversely, CuCl 2 was observed to be highly toxic to the marine alga, EC 50 of 1. 19 mg l- 1. The genotoxic effect of Cu on the marine phytoplankton was evaluated using the Comet assay. Copper concentrations ranging from 0. 25 to 2. 50 mg l- 1 were used to evaluate the effects. DNA damage was measured as percent number of comets and normal cells.

Here nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based metabolomics, a system biology tool, {{was applied to the}} marine green mussel, Perna viridis, to investigate the toxicological effects of Cd in both digestive gland and adductor muscle tissues. After Cd exposure for either two or four weeks, there was no significant metabolic change in the mussels exposed to Cd at 2 μg/L. At 20 μg/L, there were major metabolite changes related to amino acids, osmolytes, and energy metabolites. Digestive gland tissue was more sensitive to Cd than adductor muscle tissue. The adductor muscle tissue showed elevated levels of glutamine, glutamate, and lactate, and reduced levels of branched chain amino acids, aspartate, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. Overall, four weeks of Cd exposure produced neurotoxicity and metabolic disturbances and disturbed osmoregulation. These results suggest that the adductor muscle tissue of mussels may be a suitable supplemental biomarker for exposure to toxicants. In addition, the results demonstrate that 1 H-NMR-based metabolomic analysis can provide a systematic view of the toxicological effects of metals on mussels, suggesting that it might be employed to investigate the toxicological effects of other <b>marine</b> <b>pollutants.</b> © 2010 SETAC © 2011 SETAC...|$|R
