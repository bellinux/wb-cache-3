40|$|In the thirty-years-long {{research}} of organizational culture, two mutually opposed <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> have emerged: objectivistic quantitative and subjectivistic-qualitative. These two approaches {{are based on}} opposite ontological and epistemological assumptions: they include different types of research, and use opposite, quantitative vs. qualitative, methods of research.

For this reason a hybrid approach emerges as a legitimate choice in organizational culture research methodology.

25|$|Linguistics is the {{scientific}} study of language. Chomskyan linguistics (an inclusive, though perhaps informal, label for the theories and methodologies of linguistic study spearheaded by Noam Chomsky, meant to encompass his extensive work and influence in the field) includes everything from Chomsky's earliest work in transformational grammar to more recent work in the Minimalist Program. More exactly, it is the study of the structure of language, or grammar. Chomskyan linguistics is defined by a particular theoretical foundation and <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> that sets it apart from other linguistic perspectives, such as those described by functional grammar or structuralism (per Leonard Bloomfield) for example. This particular approach to the study of language is also often referred to as Generative linguistics, which is attributed to Chomsky and his early generative grammar work.|$|E

She critiqued Justice Alito's <b>methodological</b> <b>approach,</b> arguing that [...] "he proper inquiry is not whether the trial court’s determination can be sustained, but whether it may have been different had counsel been present". Considering the evidence presented in this case, Justice Sotomayor concluded that there [...] "is neither a factual nor a legal basis for the Court’s confidence" [...] that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges was race neutral. She argued that in light of [...] "the strength of Ayala’s prima facie case", the Court should have upheld the Ninth Circuit's ruling.|$|E

Cooke recommended it for [...] "readers interested {{both in the}} moral and political standing of animals and in political theory in general", the latter group because the work's <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> allows it {{to serve as a}} good introduction to political theory generally. Seymour considered the book a [...] "refreshing and comprehensive overview of a highly interesting issue". Garner said that the work came [...] "highly recommended"; he considered it [...] "a very fine book", in which [...] "Cochrane expertly simplifies and synthesizes a huge and complex literature in the limited space available to him, while retaining high scholarly standards". Garner also praised the fact that the book remained interesting, unlike many textbooks.

40|$|Abstract Background Quality {{indicators}} (QIs) {{are used}} in many healthcare settings to measure, compare, and improve quality of care. For the efficient development of high-quality QIs, rigorous, approved, and evidence-based development methods are needed. Clinical practice guidelines are a suitable source to derive QIs from, but no gold standard for guideline-based QI development exists. This review aims to identify, describe, and compare <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> to guideline-based QI development. Methods We systematically searched medical literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and grey literature. Two researchers selected publications reporting <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> to guideline-based QI development. In order to describe and compare <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> used in these publications, we extracted detailed information on common steps of guideline-based QI development (topic selection, guideline selection, extraction of recommendations, QI selection, practice test, and implementation) to predesigned extraction tables. Results From 8, 697 hits in the database search and several grey literature documents, we selected 48 relevant references. The studies were of heterogeneous type and quality. We found no randomized controlled trial or other studies comparing the ability of different <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> to guideline-based development to generate high-quality QIs. The relevant publications featured {{a wide variety of}} <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> to guideline-based QI development, especially regarding guideline selection and extraction of recommendations. Only a few studies reported patient involvement. Conclusions Further {{research is needed to determine}} which elements of the <b>methodological</b> <b>approaches</b> identified, described, and compared in this review are best suited to constitute a gold standard for guideline-based QI development. For this research, we provide a comprehensive groundwork. </p...|$|R

500|$|The {{earliest}} international versions {{were what}} then-CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole called [...] "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed {{versions of the}} show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. They utilized a variant of a flexible model called the CTW model, developed by the producers and creators of the original show, to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries. The Workshop recognized that the production model developed in the US, which reflected its needs and culture at the time, served {{as a framework for}} other countries that wanted to repeat it. Its inherent flexibility was attractive to producers in other countries, who saw the model as [...] "a <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> that is neither doctrinaire nor culture-bound" [...] {{that could be used to}} achieve different results in different countries. According to the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the producers of the co-productions repeated the [...] "experiment" [...] undertaken by the original US show, but adapted it to each specific situation. In 1969, the producers of the original show depended upon government and foundation funding, but as Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell stated in 2009, the US funding model would not necessarily be effective in countries with different economic and political structures. All co-productions share elements with the American show, but because of their different needs, no two are exactly alike. According to Gettas, the producers of the programs would [...] "rely on variants of the CTW model to help them create programming that faithfully reflects the linguistic, cultural, social, or religious diversity of their native lands".|$|E
500|$|Having {{outlined}} his <b>methodological</b> <b>approach,</b> Cochrane goes on {{to apply}} his theory {{to a number of}} ways that animals are used by society. First, Cochrane considers animal experimentation, arguing that [...] "animal experiments that result in pain or death are morally illegitimate, while painless experiments in which the animal does not die are permissible, all else being equal." [...] Cochrane discusses how to judge the strength of an interest, and then considers the strength of animals' interests in not being subjected to painful experimentation. He considers three reasons the interest may not be sufficient to ground a right, and rejects them all; that the benefits of animal testing outweigh the suffering, that humans owe more to members of their own species than to members of others (see speciesism) and that human lives are objectively more valuable than the lives of other animals. Cochrane concludes that animals have a concrete right to not be subjected to painful experiments. He next considers animals' interests in not being killed, concluding that they [...] "have an interest in continued life so that they may have more pleasant experiences and greater overall well-being in their lives", but that this interest is weaker than the corresponding interest possessed by human persons. If deadly experimentation on nonhuman non-persons is permitted, then consistency demands that it also be permitted on human non-persons, such as babies or individuals with certain cognitive disabilities. Like most others, Cochrane is unwilling to allow this possibility, and so claims that animals have a right not to be used in deadly experiments. However, he argues that animals have neither an interest in negative or positive freedom, and, like animals, human non-persons also lack this interest; therefore, neither have a prima facie right not to be used, provided said use respects the rights they do possess.|$|E

2500|$|... 'Socio-legal studies' in the UK {{has grown}} mainly {{out of the}} {{interest}} of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law. Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a <b>methodological</b> <b>approach,</b> it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law. It should not, therefore, {{be confused with the}} legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical. Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services' and adds that it [...] "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".|$|E
2500|$|From the 1950s, Bowlby was {{in contact}} with leading European ethologists, namely Niko Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Robert Hinde. Bowlby was {{inspired}} by the study Lorenz conducted on goslings, showing that they imprint on the first animate object they see. Bowlby was encouraged by an evolutionary biologist, Julian Huxley, to look further into ethology to help further his research in psychoanalysis as he introduced Bowlby to the impactful work by Tinbergen on [...] "The Study of Instinct". Bowlby followed this guidance and became interested in ethology as he wanted to rewrite psychoanalysis in order to focus this research field around a concrete theory in which psychoanalysis was lacking. He admired the <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> to ethology that psychoanalysis was not familiar with (Van der Horst, 2011). From reading widely in ethology, Bowlby was able to learn that ethologists supported the theoretical ideas through concrete empirical data.|$|E
