40|$|The Bruntland Report has for {{the first}} time {{formulated}} the concept of "sustainable development", defining it as "development able to meet current needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs"; such definition has emphasised not only the need to limit natural resources consumption and pollution emissions, but has also introduced the concept of (ethical) "responsibility" of man's action, both towards the natural environment and towards the anthropized one. Applying the sustainability objectives to the building process (project, construction, maintenance, management, decommissioning) -with the intention of reducing raw materials demand and wastes-forces one to reflect even on the maintenance process role. Maintenance can indeed be intended as a tool to build up a co-evolution project between man and nature, to be achieved by considering and managing maintenance-oriented buildings. Carrying out the <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirement</b> during the project phase becomes crucial since it guarantees, during the managing phase, that the maintenance intervention is carried out without any unforeseen or unpredictable collateral events characterized by a waste of financial and environmental resources. A number of researches and experimentations have been developed at the Department of Technologies for Built Environment in order to encourage the carrying out of the <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirement</b> during the project phase...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{inconsistency}} and vagueness in the treatment of and terminology involved with software maintainability. This is exacerbated by the fact that there are a number of different dimensions of maintainability, each requiring specific treatment. The trends of increasing systems functionality and increasing systems complexity have given rise to new dimensions of maintainability since ISO/IEC defined maintainability as “the capability of the software to be modified ” in 1996. This paper introduces the framework of maintainability and the techniques that promote maintainability in three abstraction levels; system, architecture and component. In the system dimension, the <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirement</b> is considered from a business-related point of view. In architecture, maintainability means a set of quality attributes, e. g. extensibility and flexibility. At the component level, maintainability focuses on modifiability, integrability and testability. 1...|$|E

The prescribed time limit to complete maintenance work is metric to measure good degree of product’s maintainability, which influences {{the availability of the}} product directly and influences the combat readiness. For example, in military fields, good maintainability will reduce the downtime caused by maintenance, improve the executing ability of equipment to increase combat efficiency, and also in the field of manufacturing, downtime of product line caused by maintenance will cause great loss, but now there isn’t a useful method to measure the maintenance time in the design stage to verify if the maintenance time can meet <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirement,</b> while traditional way rely on statistic data in the physical prototypes in the later stage, which is lagged, and modifies the design is very difficult. To predict actual maintenance time in the design phase, this paper presents a method for measuring the actual maintenance time through virtual maintenance process simulation for complex product system. Considering unique features of the maintenance, this paper proposes a corrective MOD method to measure time, because VR still exist difference from the reality, it is difficult to simulate the adjustment process of the maintenance personnel, considering the some influence factors such as workspace, visibility and human posture that influence the maintenance operation, this paper modifies the initial maintenance time of each therbligs got from the virtual simulation.

40|$|This {{document}} is established to provide common general requirements for all NASA programs to: design maintainability into all systems where maintenance {{is a factor}} in system operation and mission success; and ensure that maintainability characteristics are developed through the systems engineering process. These requirements are not new. Design for ease of maintenance and minimization of repair time have always been fundamental requirements of the systems engineering process. However, new or reusable orbital manned and in-flight maintainable unmanned space systems demand special emphasis on maintainability, and this document has been prepared to meet that need. <b>Maintainability</b> <b>requirements</b> on many NASA programs differ in phasing and task emphasis from requirements promulgated by other Government agencies. This difference is due to the research and development nature of NASA programs where quantities produced are generally small; therefore, the depth of logistics support typical of many programs is generally not warranted. The cost of excessive maintenance is very high due to the logistics problems associated with the space environment. The ability to provide timely maintenance often involves safety considerations for manned space flight applications. This document represents a basic set of requirements that will achieve a design for maintenance. These requirements are directed primarily at manned and unmanned orbital space systems.

40|$|Abstract: Today, the {{architectures}} {{of software}} {{systems are not}} stable for their whole lifetime but often adapted driven by business needs. Preserving their quality charac-teristics beyond each of these changes requires deep knowledge of the requirements and the systems themselves. Proper documentation reduces the risk that knowledge is lost and hence is a base for the system’s maintenance in the long-run. However, the influence of architectural documentation on the maintainability of software systems is neglected in current quality assessment methods. They are limited to documentation for anticipated change scenarios and do not provide a general assessment approach. In this paper, we propose a maturity model for architecture documentation. It is shaped relative to growing quality preservation maturity and independent of specific tech-nologies or products. It supports the weighting of necessary effort against reducing long-term risks in the maintenance phase. This allows to take product <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirements</b> into account for selecting an appropriate documentation maturity level. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirements</b> {{address the}} costs of repairs as well as repair time. Testability (not to be {{confused}} with test requirements) requirements provide the link between reliability and maintainability and should address detectability of failure modes (on a particular system level), isolation levels, and the creation of diagnostics (procedures).As indicated above, reliability engineers should also address requirements for various reliability tasks and documentation during system development, testing, production, and operation. These requirements are generally specified in the contract statement of work and depend on how much leeway the customer wishes to provide to the contractor. Reliability tasks include various analyses, planning, and failure reporting. Task selection depends on the criticality of the system as well as cost. A safety-critical system may require a formal failure reporting and review process throughout development, whereas a non-critical system may rely on final test reports. The most common reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program standards, such as MIL-STD-785 and IEEE 1332. Failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems are a common approach for product/process reliability monitoring.|$|R

40|$|Most modern {{systems are}} {{equipped}} with very complex, expensive, and high technology components whose maintenance costs have become an increasingly {{large portion of the}} total operating cost of these systems. Thus, the efficacy of the maintenance policy for these and related systems has become a major concern to both manufacturing and design engineers. Different kinds of maintenance strategies have been proposed to solve the problem. While some of these have proven effective, there is yet no definitive approach that has been found that support the <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirements</b> of transient systems or systems that exhibit transient behavior. Transient behavior is the notion of non-steady state operation, which is the characteristic of system operation during its useful life. For designing convenience most of the maintenance strategies have assumed negligible maintenance or repair time which is not practical. In this research an opportunistic maintenance (OM) approach is implemented on a multi-unit system that exhibits transient behavior. Under OM policy, if a maintenance event has been scheduled for certain components and in the process of implementing the scheduled maintenance of these targeted components, the maintenance of other components whose maintenance times are in close proximity is also implemented at the same time. As a result, the time and cost of marshalling and staging maintenance resources are reduced.

The aim of this thesis is to identify {{an effective way to}} optimize composite wing structure, especially the stiffened skin panels for minimum weight subject to stiffness and strength constraints. Many design variables (geometrical dimensions, ply angle proportion and stacking sequence) are involved in the optimum design of a composite stiffened panel. Moreover, in order to meet practical design, manufacturability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirements</b> should be taken into account as well, which makes the optimum design problem more complicated. In this thesis, the research work consists of three steps: Firstly, attention is paid to metallic stiffened panels. Based on the study of Emero’s optimum design method and buckling analysis, a VB program IPO, which employs closed form equations to obtain buckling load, is developed to facilitate the optimization process. The IPO extends the application of Emero’s method to an optimum solution based on user defined panel dimensional range to satisfy practical design constraints. Secondly, the optimum design of a composite stiffened panel is studied. Based on the research of laminate layup effects on buckling load and case study of bucking analysis methods, a practical laminate database (PLDB) concept is presented, upon which the optimum design procedure is established. By employing the PLDB, laminate equivalent modulus and closed form equations, a VB program CPO is developed to achieve the optimum design of a composite stiffened panel. A multi-level and step-length-adjustable optimization strategy is applied in CPO, which makes the optimization process efficient and effective. Lastly, a composite outer wing box, which is related to the author’s GDP work, is optimized by CPO.

This article explores the evolution from the Shuttle Canadarm to the Space Station Canadarm 2 design, which incorporates a 7 degree of freedom design, larger joints, and changeable operating base. This article also addresses phased design, redundancy, life and <b>maintainability</b> <b>requirements.</b> The design of Canadarm 2 meets unique ISS requirements, including expanded handling capability and the ability to be maintained on orbit. The size of ISS necessitated a mobile manipulator, resulting in the unique capability of Canadarm 2 to relocate by performing a walk off to base points located along the Station, and interchanging the tip and base of the manipulator. This provides the manipulator with reach and access to {{a large part of the}} Station, enabling on-orbit assembly of the Station and providing support to Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). Canadarm 2 is evolving based on on-orbit operational experience and new functionality requirements. SSRMS functionality is being developed in phases to support evolving ISS assembly and operation as modules are added and the Station becomes more complex. Changes to sustaining software, hardware architecture, and operations have significantly enhanced SSRMS capability to support ISS mission requirements. As a result of operational experience, SSRMS changes have been implemented for Degraded Joint Operations, Force Moment Sensor Thermal Protection, Enabling Ground Controlled Operations, and Software Commutation. Planned Canadarm 2 design modifications include: Force Moment Accommodation, Smart Safing, Separate Safing, and Hot Backup. In summary, Canadarm 2 continues to evolve in support of new ISS requirements and improved operations. It is a tribute to the design that this evolution can be accomplished while conducting critical on-orbit operations with minimal hardware changes...|$|R
