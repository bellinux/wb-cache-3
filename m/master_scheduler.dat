50|$|While in {{traditional}} multi-user computer systems and early supercomputers, job scheduling {{was in effect}} a task scheduling problem for processing and peripheral resources, in a massively parallel system, the job management system needs to manage the allocation of both computational and communication resources. It is essential to tune task scheduling, and the operating system, in different configurations of a supercomputer. A typical parallel job scheduler has a <b>master</b> <b>scheduler</b> which instructs some number of slave schedulers to launch, monitor, and control parallel jobs, and periodically receives reports from them {{about the status of}} job progress.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Control {{oriented}} {{local area}} networks (COLANs) are being installed in factories at an increasing rate. Traditionally, process control has operated with a <b>master</b> <b>scheduler</b> (computer) monitoring {{a number of}} points in a control grid. As the complexity of today's process control needs grow, the need to process information locally increases. Microcontrollers, networked with a <b>master</b> <b>scheduler,</b> can collect data from a locus of points and make decisions {{as to whether the}} master needs to be notified or not. By processing data locally, memory and execution time are freed up for the <b>master</b> <b>scheduler.</b> Task implementation becomes modular in nature, resulting in process control software that is easier to write, and maintain. This structure is the basis for COLAN V, a low cost, real-time, distributed control network developed at Oregon State University. COLAN V was used as the foundation {{for the creation of a}} multi-media presentation system. Six microcontrollers were networked together to remotely control the operation of projectors, projector screens, and lighting. Based on the application the <b>master</b> <b>scheduler</b> was replaced by a tape player. This allowed the storage of the audio part of the presentation on one track of the tape and the storage of the synchronized control signals on the other track. This distributed control network supplied a low cost solution to a need that was not addressed by the commercial market at any price...|$|E

50|$|Some {{types of}} buses allow only one device (typically the CPU, or its proxy) to {{initiate}} transactions. Most modern bus architectures, such as PCI, allow multiple devices to bus master because it significantly improves performance for general-purpose operating systems. Some real-time operating systems prohibit peripherals from becoming bus <b>masters,</b> because the <b>scheduler</b> {{can no longer}} arbitrate for the bus and hence cannot provide deterministic latency.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 In recent years, the new {{integrated}} circuit technology has spawned {{the development of}} many low cost high performance microcontrollers. With the improvement in the processor speed, instruction sets, and memory capacities, these microcontrollers are ideal {{for the implementation of}} Control-Oriented Local Area Networks (COLAN) for real-time distributed control systems. The design of COLAN V has evolved from a series of predecessor networks developed at Oregon State University. COLAN V is a low cost, real-time, distributed local control network. The network provides complex control and monitoring of activities remotely from a centralized <b>master</b> <b>scheduler.</b> With a single <b>master</b> <b>scheduler,</b> bus contention and the need for complex protocols are eliminated. Since twisted-pair wire is used as the communication medium, cost is kept at a minimum. As a practical control application, a microcontroller-based local network task node for controlling slide projectors was implemented. The use of a task node to concurrently control several slide projectors enhances the overall effectiveness of a presentation without the high cost associated with the commercially available composer systems. In addition, COLAN V can control and monitor different presentations in different locations through the use of different task nodes from the centralized <b>master</b> <b>scheduler.</b> Since the commercially available composer systems are non-networkable, this is not possible. When monitoring is not required, COLAN V provides the capability of storing a presentation onto a tape along with the corresponding sound. This offers a convenient and economical method for storing an entire audio/visual presentation that can be played back at a later time...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{indexing}} and partitioning {{schemes for}} high dimensional scientific computational problems. Building on the foundation offered by Mathematics of Arrays (MoA) for tensor-based computation, the ultimate {{contribution of the}} thesis is a unified partitioning scheme that works invariant of the dataset dimension and shape. Consequently, portability is ensured between different high performance machines, cluster architectures, and potentially computational grids. The Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem in computational biology has an optimal dynamic programming based solution, but it becomes computationally infeasible as its dimensionality (the number of sequences) increases. Even sub-optimal approximations may be unmanageable for more than eight sequences. Furthermore, no existing MSA algorithms have been formulated in a manner invariant over the number of sequences. This thesis presents an optimal distributed MSA method based on MoA. The latter offers a set of constructs that help represent multidimensional arrays in memory in a linear, concise and efficient way. Using MoA allows the partitioning of the dynamic programming algorithm to be expressed independently of dimension. MSA is the highest dimensional scientific problem considered for MoA-based partitioning to date. Two partitioning schemes are presented: {{the first is a}} master/slave approach which is based on both master/slave scheduling and slave/slave coupling. The second approach is a peer-to-peer design, in which the scheduling and dependency communication are calculated independently by each process, with no need for a <b>master</b> <b>scheduler.</b> A search space reduction technique is introduced to cater for the exponential expansion as the problem dimensionality increases. This technique relies on defining a hyper-diagonal through the tensor space, and choosing a band of neighbouring partitions around the diagonal to score. In contrast, other sub-optimal methods in the literature only consider projections {{on the surface of the}} hyper-cube. The resulting massively parallel design produces a scalable solution that has been implemented on high performance machines and cluster architectures. Experimental results for these implementations are presented for both simulated and real datasets. Comparisons between the reduced search space technique of this thesis with other sub-optimal methods for the MSA problem are presented...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{systems are}} used nowadays, among other things, for the {{planning}} of manufacturing systems and industrial logistics. <b>Master</b> production <b>schedulers</b> are {{in the position to}} improve their understanding of complex systems by visual depiction of the processes and analysis of the simulation results. Capital expenditures are barely accomplished in large enterprises without a hedge by the use of a simulation experiment. But since the simulation models often have to be regenerated completely for every specific application, the benefit implies a considerable expenditure. This article describes a new electronic service, which enables a simple and permanent use of the simulation models via Internet, without any specific hardware or software. On the one hand the simulation improves the coordination of all the subjects involved in the planning process; on the other hand, the capital expenditure invested {{in the construction of the}} model provides a long term benefit...|$|R
40|$|In cloud {{computing}} systems, such as Hadoop, system performance {{is a significant}} target for improvement. In classic <b>master</b> node-central <b>schedulers,</b> decision {{is made in the}} heartbeat time scale, and idle slots during a heartbeat, remain idle until allocated a task by the master node. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduler named multiple queues scheduler (MQS) that improves the throughput of the system by increasing data locality rate of map tasks, reducing thereby the average completion time of jobs. To achieve this, we associate slave nodes with individual queues, and distribute the tasks of a job at arrival to those nodes that contain the associated input data, based on data locality. To reduce the load on overloaded slave nodes, task migration is performed asynchronously between nodes within a rack, without the intervention of the master node. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The benefits of MQS are three-fold: first, it decreases the probability of allocating map tasks to non data-local nodes; second, it decreases the time wasted between heartbeats; these two aspects immediately improve the system performance; and third, it mitigates the stress on the master node by assigning part of the scheduler's functions to slave nodes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for master {{production}} scheduling (MPS) is presented. The {{objective of this}} new method is to minimize schedule instability in the order driven company. In such companies the order arrival process is highly uncertain, {{and the production of}} an item is usually scheduled only after an order is received. Further, the customer usually demands a short delivery lead time. The new MPS method combines a rolling schedule approach with an overtime or subcontracting capability, and is labelled as MPS with incremental capacity allocation and a rolling horizon (MPS-IR). Two features distinguish this new approach. First, rather than allocating the entire production capacity of a future period at once, the MPS-IR does so in an incremental fashion over multiple periods. Second, rather than scheduling the entire demand for a future demand at once, the MPS-IR does so in an incremental fashion over multiple periods. In experimental tests the MPS-IR was found to outperform a Gantt chart based <b>scheduler.</b> <b>master</b> production scheduling hedging uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{new world}} {{economic}} conditions and increasing global competition {{have changed the}} way in which manufacturing companies view production/operations management and their role in achieving greater productivity, lower costs, operational efficiency and better customer service. Several manufacturing planning and control systems have been developed in order to enable manufacturers to meet these new challenges. Material Requirements Planning System-MRP I and its extension Manufacturing Resources Planning System-MRP II, the much proclaimed systems, have gained wide acceptance from both academics and practitioners. The research presented here concentrates on the key issues of MRP practices and the effectiveness of MRP systems. Evidence from the literature shows that over 60 percent of MRP I/MRP II users have failed to achieve the expected benefits. Also, {{a review of the literature}} reveals that very little work has been done to provide mathematical models to relate these benefits to their determinants. Furthermore, it reveals that much was written about MRP practices based on case studies, but very few studies survey-based have been conducted to investigate MRP implementation. None of these studies was conducted in less developed countries. The researcher has attempted to fill some of these gaps in this study by posing three key questions, namely: how have MRP systems been implemented in Egyptian manufacturing companies?, what are the benefits obtained from these which have been implemented?, and what are the explanatory variables of MRP systems effectiveness?. Accordingly, the objectives of the current study are threefold: " To investigate MRP practices in Egyptian manufacturing companies. " To assess the effectiveness of MRP practices measured by the benefits obtained from MRP implementation based on the expectations and perceptions of MRP users in Egyptian manufacturing companies. " To explorea nd examineth e explanatoryv ariableso f MRP systemse ffectiveness. This study has drawn on an extensive review of the literature and previous empirical studies in western industrialised countries and in newly industrialised countries. The strategy used to achieve the research objectives involved quantitative analysis of questionnaire data. Data for the study were collected by a postal questionnaire. One questionnaire was sent out to each company within the Egyptian industrial ex-public sector. Companies were asked if an MRP user in their organisations could respond (production manager or materials manager or inventory control manager or <b>master</b> <b>scheduler</b> or management information systems manager).

40|$|Manufacturing {{is playing}} a {{significant}} role in its re-shoring into America. Companies are grappling with ways to obtain that competitive advantage by distinguishing themselves through their intellectual capabilities, process improvements, technology, people, shop floor management and information flows. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the effort at Farmingdale State College to educate our students in understanding Production Management and Master Production Schedule (MPS). We are trying to prepare students for entry into the workforce. By using a Real world ERP tool in the classroom while complimenting this learning with touring local manufacturers who use this tool and having production control experts in our classrooms. [1] The opportunity presents itself for these students to visit real world manufacturers using the same tool these students use in the classroom, the Infor Visual ERP. Each semester students go to a local manufacturer to see how the product is made and the ERP system is used to make it. Each semester a subject matter expert, SME, in manufacturing comes into the class and talks about how they use their ERP to perform their functional responsibilities. Students go into these companies and sit down with these Production Manufacturing and IT SME's to see how they use the modules in their ERP system from estimating, Production Management, MPS to delivery and payment. From the manufacturing window to the Master Schedule Window students learn from these companies SME's just how they perform their functions, how they use this tool. Then that is replicated this in the classroom lab assignments for students to better understand Production Management, scheduling and work order integrity. They identify the desired schedule (forecast) and populate a Master Production Schedule. They create a BOM with work orders adding operations and material. The Production Management/Control is the function of directing or regulating the movement of goods through the entire manufacturing cycle from the requisitioning of raw material to the delivery of finished products. (APICS Dictionary 13 th Edition) The Master Production Schedule is often a major component of Sales and Operations Management. The purpose of the Master Schedule is to translate the Sales forecast into a Production Plan that must be executed by the organization. The Master Schedule is the demand side of the equation and must represent the customers' needs. In this way the <b>Master</b> <b>Scheduler</b> can give manufacturing its best chance for success. Master Production Schedule (MPS) : The MPS should be closely aligned with the Sales Forecast. Students enter a Sales Forecast into the system similar to what they have seen at the companies. Students see how it is the liaison between the Sales Forecast and a production work order. Its function is to translate the Sales Forecast into a viable production schedule that supports the customer requirements, while taking into account shop floor constraints. The MPS must support the Sales Forecast and customer demand. Students learn the importance of this in their lab assignments. They identify and enter shop floor resources. Students learn that companies should never chase supply they should chase demand and manage supply. Supply can mean, purchased parts, and externally produced parts, internally made items, internal machine or labor constraints. The student's comprehension of this topic, concept and knowledge is significantly enhanced due to the tours to local manufacturers and the individuals that come into the class to discuss these functional areas and the processes they perform in their organizations.

40|$|Parallel and {{distributed}} computing [multi-chip multiprocessor] environments are essential and utilized {{to meet the}} needs of a wide variety of high-throughput applications. Scheduling strategies are important in order to efficiently utilize the resources and to improve response times, throughput and utilization of computing platforms. In this paper, we present a two-level hierarchical method for scheduling of independent coarse-grained tasks in multi-chip multiprocessor environments. A set of jobs that is feasible on some uniform multiprocessor platform with cumulative computing capacity and in which the fastest processor has speed s < 1 is schedulable on an SMP composed by m processors with unit capacity assuming an arbitrary collection of jobs. A task system composed by periodic and sporadic tasks with constrained deadlines is feasible on a uniform multiprocessor platform that has S total and s max. With two-level architecture, the <b>scheduler</b> (<b>master</b> node of upper-level) proceeds with distribution of tasks to computing sites. While the Local Resource Manager (master node of lower level) assigns this task to an available computing node according to a given threshold. Comparing experimental results with those obtained from well known traditional scheduling algorithms, the effectiveness of the proposed method consistently shows a benefit from this approach...|$|R
