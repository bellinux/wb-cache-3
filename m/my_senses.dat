25|$|Six {{months after}} Hüsker Dü's breakup, Hart {{discovered}} that his diagnosis as being HIV-positive was incorrect. In 1988 he released the solo EP, 2541, on Hüsker Dü's former label SST. The title {{is taken from}} the address of his former band's office and rehearsal house, where the members had at one time lived. Marshall Crenshaw would later cover the title song, as would the Go-Betweens' Robert Forster. After {{the release of the}} EP, Hart went further into sobriety, recording and releasing the album Intolerance and the associated EP All of <b>My</b> <b>Senses</b> in 1989 and 1990, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Although Verlaine {{was against}} drug use after Television formed, {{he once had}} a {{short-lived}} phase using psychedelic drugs, to which he makes reference in similes on songs such as [...] "Venus". The vignette-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: [...] "You know it's all like some new kind of drug / <b>my</b> <b>senses</b> are sharp and my hands are like gloves / Broadway looks so medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages." [...] According to Waterman, although psychedelic trips informed the experiences of many artists in lower Manhattan at the time, [...] "Venus" [...] contributed to the impression of Marquee Moon as a transcendental work in the vein of 19th-century Romanticism: [...] "Verlaine is into perception, and sometimes the perception he represents is as intense as a mind-altering substance." [...] Christgau said the lyric about Broadway lent the album its association among critics to the East Village, as it [...] "situates this philosophical action in the downtown night".|$|E

2500|$|Although multi-faceted and complex, Casanova's personality, as he {{described}} it, was dominated by his sensual urges: [...] "Cultivating whatever gave pleasure to <b>my</b> <b>senses</b> was always the chief business of my life; I never found any occupation more important. Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to make myself loved by it." [...] He noted that he sometimes used [...] "assurance caps" [...] to prevent impregnating his mistresses.|$|E
60|$|The Word of {{the tiger}} is: <b>my</b> <b>senses</b> are supremely Me, and <b>my</b> <b>senses</b> are God in me. But Christ said: God {{is in the}} others, who are not-me. In all the {{multitude}} of the others is God, {{and this is the}} great God, greater than the God which is Me. God is that which is Not-Me.|$|E

6000|$|... "When I {{partially}} recovered <b>my</b> <b>senses</b> I {{was conscious}} of being under shelter somewhere, and of having a wine-glass containing some cordial drink held to my lips by a man.

6000|$|I {{can only}} account {{for it in}} one way. The {{restoration}} of my sight has made a new creature of me. I have gained a sense--I am no longer the same woman.

60|$|She {{lost all}} her lovely color, and sighed, and turned away. As she pulled down her veil, I saw the {{tears in her}} eyes.
