5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. Rubble or third-class <b>masonry</b> construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class <b>masonry</b> used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and ashlar or first-class <b>masonry</b> used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. Rubble <b>masonry</b> was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest tolerances. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using rubble <b>masonry</b> techniques.|$|E

40|$|Several {{historic}} <b>masonries</b> {{have experienced}} severe damage and collapse {{due to lack}} of proper design and maintenance. Understanding of their behavior is essential for their survival. Multi-leaf walls, a special case that is often encountered in historic <b>masonries,</b> need special attention due to the complex geometry and its weak inner leaf. The behavior of historic <b>masonries</b> when subjected to different static load is investigated. An isolated multi-leaf wall is modeled using the finite element method. Multiple cases, varying the properties of the materials of the multi-leaf wall and loading conditions, are analyzed considering linear elastic behavior of the materials. It is found that the properties of the multi-leaf walls and the loads applied affect considerably the response of the structure. </span...|$|R
40|$|Considering several real case studies, {{moisture}} distribution due to rising damp in Venetian brick <b>masonries</b> is discussed and empirical models are developed. Moisture content and soluble salt data of 25 historical buildings in Venice are analysed. Data are scrutinized using statistical methods, obtaining contour plots and estimating {{the validity of}} linear and non-linear models. The models confirm that <b>masonries</b> are usually soaked with water till 120 – 150  cm over sea level, while the evaporation zone ranges in height from 200  cm to 350  cm. In the perpendicular section, {{moisture distribution}} depends on several contingent factors such as, among them, the proximity and the exposition of the external façades to the water action...|$|R
5|$|The {{change in}} {{structural}} material from <b>masonry</b> to iron allowed Bartholdi {{to change his}} plans for the statue's assembly.

40|$|The Portuguese housing {{building}} {{industry has been}} mainly focused on the reinforced concrete and clay brick <b>masonries.</b> Recently, this industry also includes steel and timber structures. However, the hearth related building techniques still remains punctual in this field and only applied by specific contractors which have a particular interest on these ecological techniques. However, this sector has been having a gradual increasing interest {{on the environment and}} the sustainability issues. This is the context of the present research work in which a sustainable structure of a typical Portuguese house using natural materials is proposed and analyzed (adobe block <b>masonries</b> and timber floors). Meanwhile, this research work also includes a detailed discretion of the main aspects related to the design of the described sustainable solution and taking into account that this type of solution still remains uncommon in the Portuguese context...|$|R

50|$|Prior to Allinge and Sandvig {{becoming}} urban areas, {{people in}} the bronze age lived there and made rock carvings at Madsebakke. Not all carvings of ships, suns, and footprints have survived, however.

50|$|Characteristic for Mühlhausen's {{buildings}} is {{the predominant}} use {{of one kind}} of material - Travertine. It was found near the city in large quantities and is both light and solid, so that the Gothic churches with their filigree <b>masonries</b> and other important buildings could be built relatively cheaply. Nevertheless, many older citizens' houses were half-timbered constructions, with only the ground-floors made of stone.|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} metrological-chronological studies {{carried out in}} the last ten years on {{traditional}} building techniques used in Campania - concerning post-medieval walling of Neapolitan historical centre, those of d’Angiò and Aragon Age in Terra di Lavoro, and those of the late Middle Age in Amalfi Coast - this contribution aims to analyse the XVIth century Terra di Lavoro yellow tufa <b>masonries,</b> showing their structural aspects and the executive modalities for their setting up. Besides, one will illustrate the methodology used for their chronological definition - methodology borrowed from the archaeological field - based on the drawing up of specific inventories, with the support of the already achieved results. Indeed, in spite of the efforts made up to now, there is no systematic and scientifically based catalogue of the traditional solutions used by the Campania builders for the realization of walling, with great detriment for their conservation, especially with reference to the so called ‘minor building’, just for its non-identification. Particularly, the study, referring to the homogeneous constructive area of Terra di Lavoro, is based on the following phases: -examination of the printed sources concerning building materials (geo-morphological literature; local architectural practical treaties; contracts and price tariffs of military engineers corps, of civil engineer corps, of provincial and municipal administrations) and of archive sources (<b>masonries</b> masters guilds statutes; notarial acts for the construction of religious or noble buildings); realisation, through metric and photographic surveys, of drawings highlighting the constructive peculiarities of the <b>masonries</b> analysed; identification of the chrono-typological models identified; definition of chronological series of the structural solutions...|$|R
5|$|The McElmo Phase was {{a period}} in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, when major changes in {{ceramics}} and <b>masonry</b> techniques appeared in Chaco Canyon. Chacoans started using painted black-on-white pottery, and the <b>masonry</b> and layout of great houses built during the period, which was the last major construction era in the canyon, differs significantly from those built during the Bonito Phase (850 to 1140). Archeologists initially believed that the McElmo style was brought to Chaco Canyon by immigrants from Mesa Verde, but subsequent research suggests the developments were of local origin. McElmo black-on-white pottery was abundant in later contexts at Chetro Ketl, and the problematic McElmo style <b>masonry</b> was used in several later additions to the building, including very characteristic Chaco-style kivas.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of skyscrapers {{was made possible}} by technological improvements {{during the middle of the}} 19th century. One of these developments was the iron framed building. <b>Masonry</b> buildings supported their internal floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base. In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using built-up plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames. These frames were stronger than traditional <b>masonry</b> and permitted much thinner walls. The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses.|$|E
5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} to cool a large mass of <b>masonry</b> with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, {{the warmth of}} the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool <b>masonry.</b> None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{experimental results}} of a chemical–physical and mineralogical characterisation of some mortars, sampled by different <b>masonries</b> brought to light during excavations of the site of Monte Sannace. The {{aim of the research}} is to provide, through the characterisation of the mortar samples and the relative rawmaterials, useful information in order to define the stages of construction and theworkers’ technological knowledge during different historical periods. DTA/TG/DTG thermoanalytical investigations and X-ray diffractometry analyses can allow to define the nature of both the binder and aggregate materials. As regards a specific mortar with hydraulic behaviour such a study has allowed to recognise also the residual reactivity towards lime of the ‘pozzolanic’ sand, rich in volcanic ashes, used as aggregate in the original mortar. The thermoanalytical and X-ray diffractometric results together with the granulometric and chemical determinations allow to get information about the preparation techniques of binding materials of old <b>masonries.</b> © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{strengthening}} of <b>masonries</b> {{is a crucial}} step in building restoration works because of its relevance, mostly {{with regard to the}} improvement of building seismic behavior. Current building technologies are based on the use of steel nets which are incorporated into cement plasters. The use of steel has a number of contraindications that can be solved by using composite materials such as glass fiber nets, which have high mechanical characteristics and lightness, elasticity, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with lime plaster. Building interventions, that take into account the application of glass fiber nets, are very sustainable from several points of view, e. g., material production, in situ works, economic cost and durability. In Italy, several experiments have been carried out in situ with the aim of testing the mechanical characteristics of <b>masonries</b> which have been treated with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) nets. This paper deals with a series of in situ tests carried out during the restoration works of an important historical building located in Catania (Sicily, Italy). The results achieved are largely positive...|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} 46 meters in length, 27 meters in width and 20 meters in height (with {{dimensions}} {{comparable to the}} Armenian Apostolic churches of Dvin, Zvartnots and Talin). The outward appearance of the temple is made of strict shaped <b>masonries</b> and ornaments, a contrast to the well brightened interior. People of 19th century associated the monastery's appearance with the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (now Istanbul). The monastery had 5 doors and 51 windows.|$|R

5|$|Wood {{was used}} for beams, and for lintels, even in <b>masonry</b> structures. Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples {{continued}} to be built from wooden poles and thatch. Adobe was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of <b>masonry</b> structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} aimed to examine a number of important defence towers situated along the western Sardinian coast, Italy, built in 16 th- 17 th century. They have been studied through the analysis of <b>masonries</b> by an historical, architectural, technical and petrographical-chemical point of view, through a methodology based on a stratigraphical approach. The main aim is the understanding of the traditional building techniques used during the above mentioned centuries, for warranting proper restoration projects...|$|R

Some time later he went to a church-builder in the same place, and under the architect's direction became handy at restoring the dilapidated <b>masonries</b> of several village churches round about.|$|R
40|$|National audienceTo face coke {{and steel}} market requirement, the coking process {{has to be}} more flexible. But {{changing}} process parameters such as coking temperature and time, blend composition [...] . can have consequences of the coke oven battery lifetime and on its <b>masonries.</b> The main objective of this work is to determine the admissible stress for the coke oven heating walls in order to prevent cracks formation. Thus a numerical tool of the coke oven battery based on the Finite Element Method was developed. It is a two-step model using homogenization and submodelling techniques in order to decrease the computational cost. Coke oven <b>masonries</b> are large structures composed of thousands of bricks and mortar joints. In the model, bricks and mortar are replaced by a Homogeneous Equivalent Material (HEM) whose behaviour depends on the joints state. The HEM properties are determined thanks to brick-mortar interface behaviour, experimentally characterised at high temperature. In order to control joint opening, a criterion changing the HEM is used. The use of the HEM gives the global stresses instead of local stresses, that's why, a submodelling step has been developed to obtain local stresses used in the criterion and thus to have accurate information about joint opening...|$|R
