2500|$|Sheldon has {{sometimes}} appeared to show empathy, including lending money to Penny without expecting it back quickly (although that may just {{have been his}} logical Spock-like response to a problem to be solved; it was, after all, money he was not using and would not miss) and driving her to a hospital when her shoulder was dislocated. Sheldon admits he is overly fond of koalas <b>munching</b> <b>on</b> eucalyptus {{so much that he}} has a facial expression that he refers to as his koala face. He dislikes gifts, because the [...] "social contract" [...] in his view creates either a debt or burden on the receiver of the gift which will not stop until one of the two involved in the [...] "gift-relationship" [...] dies leaving the other either in debt or with an undue surplus. Sheldon does not take drugs, not even legal ones such as caffeine, due to a promise to his mother, and is hypersensitive when he accidentally consumes them. It has been shown, however, that alcohol often causes Sheldon to loosen up significantly, although it will also cloud his judgment – on occasion, after drinking alcoholic drinks (both deliberately and accidentally), he has done things that he would never do while sober, such as singing out loud, mooning an audience full of people, confronting Wil Wheaton and affectionately slapping Amy's rear.|$|E
