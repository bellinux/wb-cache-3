40|$|Several {{stainless}} steel based surfaces with different properties were evaluated {{according to their}} fouling behaviour for different dairy products under different conditions. Surface properties were obtained by the following modification techniques: SiF 3 +, MoS 22 + and TiC ion implantation; diamond-like carbon (DLC) sputtering; DLC, DLC-Si-O and SiOx, plasma enhanced chemical vapor Deposition (PECVD); autocatalytic Ni-P-PTFE and silica coating. Aqueous solutions that simulate milk (SMUF - simulated milk ultrafiltrate for the mineral components, beta-lactoglobulin for the protein components and FMF - fouling model fluid for complex milk systems) were used to study the fouling behaviour during pasteurisation. Bacteriological deposition studies were also performed with two heat resistant strains of Bacillus. The experiments were carried out at laboratory scale {{for the evaluation of}} calcium phosphate and protein deposition, and at pilot scale for adhesion of bacteria and deposits from complex milk systems. In all cases, the fouling behaviour was affected by the surface material, although in different ways for the deposition or the cleaning phases. For the non-microbiological deposits (calcium phosphate, whey protein and FMF <b>milk-based</b> <b>product),</b> the Ni-P-PTFE surface was the most promising one, since it generally promoted less deposit build up and, in all cases, was the easiest to clean. On the other hand, for bacterial adhesion, the most suitable surface was the ion implanted (TiC) surface, which also showed less spores after the cleaning process. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting from the diet observed for each adult in the 1999 French Enquete Individuelle et Nationale sur les Consommations Alimentaires survey (n= 1, 171), an isocaloric nutritionally adequate diet was modeled that simultaneously met {{a whole set of}} nutrient constraints (based on nutrient recommendations) while deviating the least from the observed diet, food content. Variations in weight, energy, and nutrients between observed and modeled diets were calculated for each food group (n= 7), with a focus on <b>milk-based</b> <b>products</b> (n= 4 categories). The diet optimization process increased the weights of three food groups: fruit and vegetables (+ 62 %), starchy foods (+ 37 %), and dairy products (+ 19 %).

40|$|Manipulation of the {{composition}} of milkfat {{has the potential to}} improve the nutritional properties and physical functionality of milkfat and its acceptability in the market. The modifications that have been targeted from a nutritional perspective have included: (a) reducing the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids; (b) increasing the level of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; and (c) increasing the content of conjugated linoleic acid. From a physical functionality viewpoint, the outcome targeted has been an improvement in the spreadability of butter by altering milkfat composition to reduce the hardness of milkfat. Both on-farm strategies and the application of appropriate post-farm processing technologies may be used to alter the milkfat composition to enhance its nutritional image and its physical functionality for a range of product applications. However, changes in milkfat composition that are desirable for a specific nutritional purpose or for one type of <b>milk-based</b> <b>product</b> may not meet all the desirable requirements of another milkfat or dairy product. Furthermore, modification of the milkfat composition can also have an influence on the processing characteristics of milk and the quality of finished dairy products. It is essential to substantiate the benefits of specific target nutritional or physical functionality outcomes before the introduction of breeding goals, altered milk production systems or post-farm processing operations to manipulate milkfat composition. This paper reviews the variation in milkfat characteristics and the strategies that have been used to modify milkfat composition to achieve milkfat with altered nutritional and physical functional properties. <br /...|$|R

We assessed the taste preferences about milk-based and fruit-juice typed supplements in malnourished in-patients. METHODS: One hundred and nine in-patients requiring oral nutritional support {{were assigned to}} consume four given supplements on four consecutive days, to answer a questionnaire based on a 10 -point visual analogue scale (VAS) on acceptance/tolerance, and to choose their preferred product for the fifth day. RESULTS: Overall pleasantness was significantly better for milk-based supplements than for sweet and salty fruit-juice typed products (on VAS: 6. 2 +/- 3. 1 versus 4. 4 +/- 3. 9, p< 0. 01 and 3. 5 +/- 3. 4, p< 0. 0001, respectively, when 1 meant "not at all" and 10 "very much"), whereas digestive tolerance was comparable.

This study surveyed ice cream products available in Italy for heavy metals (lead, cadmium, chromium, tin, and arsenic). The differences between artisanal and industrial ice cream were also investigated because of the importance in the Italian diet and the diffusion of this ready-to-eat food. Ice cream sampling was performed between October 2010 and February 2011 in the northeast of Italy. A total of 100 samples were randomly collected from different sources: 50 industrial samples produced by 19 different brands were collected in coffee bars and supermarkets; 50 artisanal ice cream samples were gathered at nine different artisanal ice cream shops. Ten wooden sticks of industrial ice cream were analyzed in parallel to the ice cream. All samples were negative for arsenic and mercury. None of the artisanal ice cream samples were positive for lead and tin; 18 % of the industrial ice cream samples were positive. All positive lead samples were higher than the legal limit stated for milk (0. 02 mg/kg). All industrial ice cream samples were negative for cadmium, but cadmium was present in 10 % of the artisanal ice cream samples. Chromium was found in 26 % of the artisanal and in 58 % of the industrial ice cream samples. The heavy metals found in the wooden sticks were different from the corresponding ice cream, pointing out the lack of cross-contamination between the products.

Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the heat resistance of spores isolated from dehydrated ingredients, intermediate and final products. Furthermore, the influence of the heating medium (milk or phosphate buffer) on the heat resistance was determined in order to assess which medium is best to use in the context of dairy processing. Sixteen spore-forming strains from seven different species (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus flexus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Bacillus smithii, Geobacillus pallidus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus) producing thermoresistant spores were selected after their isolation from diverse food products obtained from local dairies such as cocoa powder, milk powder, spices, and dessert products. Spores produced from the chosen strains were tested regarding their heat resistance at 110, 120, and 125  °C for 30  min. Highly thermoresistant spores surviving a heat treatment for 30  min at 125  °C in milk were produced by B. amyloliquefaciens and G. stearothermophilus. The inactivation of the spores was higher in milk than in phosphate buffer. This study highlights that not only raw milk but also dehydrated ingredients are important sources of thermoresistant spores in dairy processing. Since the inactivation of spores in milk and phosphate buffer turned out to be significantly different, milk rather than laboratory media or buffers should be employed as the model heating system when designing thermal processes for new <b>milk-based</b> <b>products...</b>|$|E

40|$|Although {{buffalo milk}} {{is the second}} most {{produced}} milk in the world, and of primary nutritional importance {{in various parts of the}} world, few studies have focused on the physicochemical properties of buffalo milk fat globules. This study is a comparative analysis of buffalo and cow milk fat globules. The larger size of buffalo fat globules, 5 vs. 3. 5 lm, was related to the higher amount of fat in the buffalo milks: 73. 4 ± 9. 9 vs. 41. 3 ± 3. 7 g/kg for cow milk. Buffalo milks contained significantly lower amount of polar lipids expressed per gram of lipids (0. 26 % vs. 0. 36 %), but significantly higher amount of polar lipids per litre of milk (+ 26 %). Buffalo and cow milk fat globule membranes contain the same classes of polar lipids; phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) being the main constituents. A significant higher percentage of PC and lower percentage of SM were found for buffalo milks. The fatty acid analysis revealed that saturated fatty acids, mainly palmitic acid, trans fatty acids, linolenic acid (x 3) and conjugated linolenic acid were higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk. Such results will contribute to the improvement of the quality of buffalo <b>milk-based</b> dairy <b>products...</b>|$|R
