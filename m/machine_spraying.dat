Caldwell also criticised Mannock for shooting two German airmen who had crash landed behind Allied lines. He wrote: [...] "The Hun crashed but not badly, and most people would have been content with this—but not Mick Mannock.

The two base coats of plaster are either hand-applied or <b>machine</b> <b>sprayed.</b> The finish coat can be troweled smooth, hand-textured, floated to a sand finish or sprayed. Originally the lath material was strips of wood installed horizontally on the wall, with spaces between, that {{would support the}} wet plaster until it cured.

40|$|To make paper, <b>machines</b> <b>spray</b> {{wet pulp}} on a moving screen and extract {{the water from}} it by {{squeezing}} it between rollers, before drying it using heat and rolling it on reels as finished product. The water extracted in the squeezing process is removed by a continuous roll of fabric called a felt. There are typically three felts on a paper machine. Felts wear out over time, and therefore must be replaced, either at a planned machine shutdown or at some other time when the machine fails randomly. All machine stoppages incur a downtime cost. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic programming model for determining a felt replacement policy that minimises the expected felt cost and cost of downtime. 1 Introduction This paper examines a problem that arises in running the paper machines at the Tasman pulp and paper mill in Kawerau, Bay of Plenty. The problem is that of scheduling the replacement of felts within the press section of the paper machine. This part of the machine is responsible [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere, we {{describe}} a nondestructive approach using terahertz wave to detect crack initiation in a film-coated {{layer on a}} drug tablet. During scale-up and scale-down of the film coating process, differences in film density and gaps between the film-coated layer and the uncoated tablet were generated {{due to differences in}} film coating process parameters, such as the tablet-filling rate in the coating <b>machine,</b> <b>spray</b> pressure, and gas–liquid ratio etc. Tablets using the PEO/PEG formulation were employed as uncoated tablets. We found that heat and humidity caused tablets to swell, thereby breaking the film-coated layer. Using our novel approach with terahertz wave nondestructively detect film surface density (FSD) and interface density differences (IDDs) between the film-coated layer and an uncoated tablet. We also found that a reduced FSD and IDD between the film-coated layer and uncoated tablet increased the risk of crack initiation in the film-coated layer, thereby enabling us to nondestructively predict initiation of cracks in the film-coated layer. Using this method, crack initiation can be nondestructively assessed in swelling tablets after the film coating process without conducting accelerated stability tests, and film coating process parameters during scale-up and scale-down studies can be appropriately established...|$|R

[...] A similar compound is used in various ways as a sprayed-on textural finishing for gypsum panel walls and ceilings that have been pre-sealed and coated with joint compound. The flexibility and plastic qualities of joint compound make it a very versatile material both as sealer or finishing coat for wall surfaces, and also in decorative applications that range from <b>machine</b> <b>sprayed</b> texturing to hand-trowelled or even hand-crafted and sculptural finishes.

40|$|Abstract-Although {{the number}} of {{operating}} longwalls in the United States (approximately 100) has remained relatively constant {{over the last five}} years, longwa/ 1 production levels have significantly increased and in some cases more than doubled. As a result of this production increase, control of respirable dust continues to be a problem. Therefore, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Pittsburgh Health Technology Center, Dust Division, initiated a study to investigate the availability and adequacy of technology for controlling dust on longwal / mining operations. The study involved 23 longwall mining operations in three dijferentCoalMineSafetyandHealthDistricts. Each operation was visited for a full shift. Respirable dust samples were collected on face personnel and atfu:ed locations along the face. Methods being used to control dust were noted, with special emphasis placed on obtaining quantitative data relative to ventilation, head gate dust controls, cutting drum <b>sprays,</b> external <b>machine</b> <b>sprays</b> and cutting sequence. Attempts were made to correlate dust control practices in place {{at the time of the}} visit to dust concentrations measured at the tail and on the tail shearer operator and to the average of all the dust concentration measurements from the occupations sampled. The methods used to control dust were also compared to the gamut of methods known to be available.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to introduce an integrated simulation AHP model for modeling, assessment and improvement of a machine mix problem with complex queue priorities and service times. Furthermore, there is no closed form expression for such situations, as previous studies show no mathematical models for machine mix with integrated service and queue priorities. The production lines of a powder coating manufacturing system with three parallel machines and queue and service time priorities was considered. The machines produce eight different spray coatings. Production operation starts as soon as an order is received. Spray coatings numbers 1 and 2 are handled by <b>machine</b> 1, <b>spray</b> coatings numbers 3 to 6 are handled by <b>machine</b> 2 and <b>spray</b> coatings numbers 7 and 8 are handled by machine 3. Priority is with the arriving entity (new order) which has identical number as the entity being serviced. Also, if the arriving entity has higher number than entity being serviced and there is no identical order as the entity being serviced in the queue, then the arriving entity occupies the first place in the queue. Service time priority means that a machine is only allowed to service identical products (spray coatings) up to a limited period that is defined as ta. For example, if machine 2 has been servicing product number 6 for the last two hours due to high demand, th...|$|R
