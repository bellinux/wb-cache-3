Depending {{on the field and}} temperature, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>template</b> guides superconductivity to nucleate in different areas: above the magnetic domain walls of the BaFe 12 O 19 forming the domain-wall superconductivity (DWS), above the reversed magnetic domains (RDS), and above the positive magnetic domains forming bulk superconductivity. The DWS, behaving as a superconducting wire network, survives in a broad field range. The RDS, existing in the form of isolated superconducting islands near the saturation field H-s of BaFe 12 O 19, can be described as a two-dimensional two-component random conductor mixture.

40|$|THESIS 9302 Magnetic fields {{imposed on}} {{electrochemical}} cells {{have been shown}} to have dramatic effects on electrodeposits ranging from surface morphology, crystal structure, deposition rate, alloy composition and magnetic properties. To further illuminate the effects of magnetic fields a number of electrochemical systems were studied ranging from metal deposition in uniform magnetic fields, organic liquid-liquid systems, and patterned metal deposits by permanent magnet arrays. Lorentz force induced magneto-convection was observed to dominate during metal electrodeposition and corrosion, enhancing the mass transport of ions by thinning the diffusion layer. Using AC impedance methods the double layer and charge transfer kinetics were probed in a model one electron transfer system. The imposition of a magnetic field was observed to alter the structure of the double layer and the measured apparent kinetics of the system. No true magnetic shift in kinetics was observed, rather all the effects are due to the change in free energy at the interface due to the magnetostatic energy, which is manifested as an induced Maxwell stress and thus the increased attraction of ions to the electrode surface. Patterned permanent magnet arrays were used to demonstrate <b>magnetic</b> <b>templating</b> using paramagnetic ions, inverse templating using rare-earth salts as contrast agents. The deposits were seen to follow the contours of |B|, which can be explained in terms of the magnetostatic interaction developed in the model system. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>templating</b> is a potentially fruitful development that may scale below the micron dimensions demonstrated here. In summary, all magnetic field effects in electrochemical systems can be described and understood through the determination of the energies involved. This avoids any erroneous derivation of forces from incorrect boundary condition assumptions, and can also take into account the magnetic stresses, or energies, which are ignored in a force model, where only net forces are considered...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} of magnetically controlled guided vortex motion in a hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet nanosystem consisting of an Al film {{on top of}} a square array of permalloy square rings.

The resulting <b>magnetic</b> <b>template</b> generates a strongly anisotropic pinning potential landscape for vortices in the superconducting layer. Transport measurements show that this anisotropy is able to confine the flux motion along the high symmetry axes of the square lattice of dipoles.

40|$|UV nanoimprint {{lithography}} (UV NIL) is attracting {{more and more}} interest, because of its potential to become a high-resolution, low-cost patterning technique. To establish UV NIL as a low-cost patterning technique, the costs of single templates, today obtained from 6025 quartz mask blanks, have to be reduced and the life-time of the antisticking layers has to be optimized. Within this work, a process flow was de-veloped to obtain 49 UV nanoimprint templates with a dimension of 12. 5 × 12. 5 mm² out of a fused silica substrate with a diameter of 150 mm. After sawing, etching, and cleaning, the template surfaces were covered with an antisticking layer. Next, the templates were glued onto a <b>template</b> <b>holder</b> to enable their handling with the nanoimprint tool NPS 300 from Süss MicroTec.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of the thickness D-f of the plain ferromagnetic (F) film on the electrical resistance of the flux-coupled hybrids, consisting of superconducting (S) Al film and multilayer [Co/Pt] F film with out-of-plain magnetization. The behavior of such hybrids at high and low temperatures is found to be different as follows: the nucleation of superconductivity at high temperatures is governed mainly by the typical lateral dimensions of the magnetic domains, while low-temperature properties are determined by topology of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>template.</b> We show that an increase in the D-f value leads to a broadening of the field-intervals and temperature intervals where nonmonotonous dependence of the superconducting critical temperature T-c on the applied magnetic field H is observed (for demagnetized F films). Further increase in the Df value results in a global suppression of superconductivity. Thus, we determined an optimal thickness, when the nonmonotonous dependence T-c(H) can be observed in rather broad T and H range, what can be interesting for further studies of the localized superconductivity in planar Al-based S/F hybrids and for development of the devices which can exploit the localized superconductivity.

Feature widths are determined from Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, while heights are obtained with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). For short assembly times, widths were ~ 150 nm, while heights were ~ 14 nm, a single nanoparticle on average with a 10 : 1 aspect ratio. For long assembly times, widths approach 550 nm, while the average height grows to 3 nanoparticles, ~ 35 nm; a 16 : 1 aspect ratio. We perform magnetometry on these self-assembled structures and observe the slope of the magnetic moment vs. field curve increases with time. This increase suggests magnetic nanoparticle interactions evolve from nanoparticle–nanoparticle interactions to cluster–cluster interactions as opposed to feature–feature interactions. We suggest the aspect ratio increase occurs because the magnetic field gradients are strongest near the transitions between recorded regions in perpendicular media. If these gradients can be optimized for assembly, strong potential exists for using perpendicular recording templates to assemble complex heterogeneous materials...|$|R

40|$|Hollow {{asymmetrical}} silica dumbbells {{containing a}} movable inner core were fabricated by a template-assisted method. Three different templates were employed for the fabrication of the hollow asymmetrical dumbbells. For {{the preparation of}} the first template, silica particles were uniformly covered with a cross-linked polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) shell and the polymerization of styrene was conducted to induce a protrusion of polystyrene (PSt) from the PMMA shell. Anisotropic colloids composed of silica, PMMA, and PSt were used as templates, coated with a silica shell, and held at 500 °C for 2 h to remove the polymer interior components of the template colloid.

In this work, a guided magnetic media growth is attempted by creating a pre-fabricated template with a specific material and morphology. The template is designed in such a way that, when magnetic media consisting of the magnetic alloy and segregant are sputtered, the sites on the template result in a controlled two-phase growth of <b>magnetic</b> media. The <b>template</b> is fabricated using self-assembling block copolymers, which can be used to fabricate nanostructures with a regular hexagonal lattice of spheres of one block in the other’s matrix.

In such an approach, the magnetic grain size is defined by the uniform pitch of the block copolymer pattern, resulting in a uniform microstructure with much better grain size distribution than can be obtained with conventional un-templated media growth.

40|$|A {{critical}} materials challenge {{over the}} next quarter century is the sustainable use {{and management of the}} world's natural resources, particularly the scarcest of them. Chemistry's ability to get more from less is epitomized by porous coordination polymers, also known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which use a minimum amount of material to build maximum surface areas with fine control over pore size. Their large specific surface area and tunable porosity make MOFs useful for applications including small-molecule sensing, separation, catalysis, and storage and release of molecules of interest. Proof-of-concept projects have demonstrated their potential for environmental applications such as carbon separation and capture, water purification, carcinogen sequestration, byproduct separation, and resource recovery.

Direct (bottom-up) and premix (top-down) membrane emulsification processes are discussed including operational, formulation and membrane factors that control the droplet size and droplet generation regimes. A special emphasis was put on different methods of controlled shear generation on membrane surface, such as cross flow on the membrane surface, swirl flow, forward and backward flow pulsations in the continuous phase and membrane oscillations and rotations. Droplets produced by membrane emulsification can be used for synthesis of particles with versatile morphology (solid and hollow, matrix and core/shell, spherical and non-spherical, porous and coherent, composite and homogeneous), which can be surface functionalised and coated or loaded with macromolecules, nanoparticles, quantum dots, drugs, phase change materials and high molecular weight gases to achieve controlled/targeted drug release and impart special optical, chemical, electrical, acoustic, thermal and <b>magnetic</b> properties.

S 1 be a projection map for the fibration. By integrating along the gradient of ss we obtain a flow. Any such flow induces a diffeomorphism on the fibers, which is called the monodromy of the flow. The monodromy of this flow was shown by Thurston [6] to be isotopic to the map A = &quot; 2 11 1 #; where we view the punched torus as the unit square in (R 2 Γ Z 2) =Z 2. This map is Anosov. By the work of Asimov and Franks [1] we know that any flow 1 with monodromy in the same isotopy class as an Anosov map, will have at least the knots given by the suspension of the Anosov map.

40|$|Manuscript {{submitted}} {{to reach the}} degree of Ph D in Physics, on 22 nd June 2012 The knowledge of magnetization reversal processes in nanoscale systems is relevant {{for the design of}} advanced technologies such as advanced magnetic recording media, spintronics and various sensing and reading devices. Magnetic nanowires can have important applications in advanced 3 D recording media, logic and MEMS devices (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems). Commonly, nanowires and their patterned arrays are prepared by different lithography techniques. However, the alternative electrochemical route profiting from self-assembled pores in anodic alumina templates has been proved to be very fruitful and a less-expensive reproducible method to prepare 3 D ordered arrays of magnetic nanowires with tunable <b>magnetic</b> characteristics. The <b>template</b> synthesis has recently been demonstrated to be an elegant chemical approach for the fabrication of nanoscale materials and an alternative to other sophisticated methods such as molecular beam epitaxy and microlithography. Self assembled ordered hexagonal nanoporous alumina templates (AAO) are chosen in this work for the fabrication of the nanowires, as an effective mean to create customized materials with designed physical properties. AAO templates are obtained by common electrochemical processes, with the aim to control their geometry (pore diameter, length and inter-pore distance). The latter is achieved by controlling the anodization parameters. The present work deals with the magnetic study of Co and Co-based nanowire arrays prepared by template-assisted electroplating growth. The role played by the crystalline structure in the magnetic properties of Co and Co-based nanowire arrays is emphasized, and it is shown that the crystalline structure depends on the particular deposition and geometrical parameters. Modifying the electrolytic bath acidity, the pH, in the electrodeposition of Co nanowires, it is possible to induce different hcp Co phase textures, resulting in different types of magnetic behavior. Additionally, an alternative way to tune the magnetic anisotropy without extreme changes in magnetic saturation moment is through the addition of other metallic elements, such as Ni and Pd. On the other hand, by modifying the dimensions (i. e. length and diameter) of Co nanowires their crystalline structure is also modified. Particularly, for reduced lengths of nanowires, fcc-crystal phase is dominant which together with the shape anisotropy usually results in longitudinal magnetization easy axis. For longer wires, hcp-crystal phase is formed, which determines the appearance of a magnetocrystalline anisotropy with nearly transverse orientation. In this latter case there is a competition between the shape and the crystalline anisotropies. For the case of Co nanopillars, it was found that for 35 nm of pore diameter the dominant crystal fase is the fcc one. Above this diameter the crystal structure is dominated by the hcp phase and a reorientation of the c axis is observed from out of plane to in plane for a pore diameter higher than 44 nm. The controlled preparation of ordered arrays of magnetic nanowires with welldefined magnetic anisotropy constitutes a route to control the magnetization reversal process. This is discussed on the basis of analytical models, where different reversal modes, particularly propagating transverse or vortex-like domain walls were considered as alternatives to homogeneous coherent magnetization rotational mode. The analytical models were specially developed for the comparison with the experimental angular dependence of coercivity of Co and Co-based nanowire arrays. Also the temperature dependence of magnetic properties of Co and Co-based nanowire arrays were addressed in this study, with the aim to reinforce the discussion of the interplay of the different magnetic anisotropies.
