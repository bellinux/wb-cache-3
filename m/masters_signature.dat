40|$|The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) added {{public key}} {{cryptography}} to the DNS, but problems remain in selecting signature lifetimes. A zone’s <b>master</b> server distributes <b>signatures</b> to secondary servers. The signatures lifetimes should be long so that a secondary server can still operate if the master fails. However, DNSSEC lacks revocation. Signed data can be replayed until the signature expires and thus zones should select a short signature lifetime. Operators must choose between reduced robustness or long replay vulnerability windows. This paper introduces a revised DNSSEC signature that allows secondary servers to operate even if the master has failed while simultaneously limiting replay windows to twice the TTL. Each secondary server constructs a hash chain and relays the hash chain anchor to the <b>master</b> server. The <b>signature</b> produced by the master server ensures {{the authenticity of the}} hash anchor and the DNS data. A secondary server includes both the signature and a hash chain value used by resolvers to limit signature replay.

40|$|Handwriting {{skills have}} a major impact in the {{self-esteem}} of young children. Furthermore, good handwriting skills is considered a fundamental step to future academic success [4, 18]. Children with writing disorders had propensity to inferior verbal IQ, weakened mathematics abilities and higher attention dif- ficulties [17]. Considering that writing disorders affect approximately 10 to 30 % [9] of children, it is easy to understand that efficient handwriting therapy is of paramount importance. ‘Conventional therapy’ consisting of many training sessions, and ‘Learning by Teaching’ in which the student teaches a colleague in training sessions, are two proposed successful therapy techniques [8, 16]. In this work we involve both techniques in the effort to create a software framework that will serve as foundation for a future humanoid learning/teaching partner. This partner aims at being an extra tool for the handwriting therapist, not a substitute. Using the framework {{it will be possible to}} operate any of the therapy paradigms. The implemented system uses a dataset [12] to produce a signature for each character writing variation. These <b>signatures,</b> called <b>master</b> <b>signatures,</b> are compared with the user input to classify it. Having the user input classified it is possible to morph it towards a more correct character (e. g. for conventional teaching) or to improve a less correct character (e. g. for learning by teaching). The performance of the proposed system was assessed and validated. It was possible to prove that shape information is fully preserved, and used in the classification, not only enabling to divide characters of different variations, but also allowing to divide characters of the same variation but with different drawing path. This capability allows the master characters to be displayed (not instantaneously but) as being written by a human intervener, enabling a very straightforward future integration with a humanoid robot. The results also proved the ability of the framework to receive a user input, interpret it and produce a didactic output in line with the therapy technique being used.

40|$|Conditions of Use" are {{standardised}} contracts {{which are}} utilised within several areas of shipping. This thesis analyses the conditions issued by gas terminals to shipowners, allocating risks arising during the vessel's port call. The {{purpose of the}} paper is to examine risk allocation and insurance coverage in relation to such contracts. The contracts are built on a principle of unilateral liability, where the liability provisions are characterised by unlimited and strict, or far-reaching, liability for the shipowner {{in the form of}} comprehensive indemnity and disclaimer clauses which together produce the effect that the shipowner becomes liable for all and any damage to its own and the terminal's interests as well as third party interests. The liability provisions depart from ordinary legal principles inter alia with respect to the unlimited and strict liability for the shipowner, the lack of requirement for causation and the terminal's disclaiming of all fault on the part of itself and its servants. In order to facilitate an examination of the contracts, they are first of all placed in a legal, practical, geographical and historical context. Afterwards, certain issues related to contract formation are discussed, more specifically the contracts' binding effect and application with and without the <b>master's</b> <b>signature.</b> The main section of the thesis contains a detailed discussion of the contractual liability provisions with a view to examining their legal consequences for the shipowner, and this is followed by a discussion of whether such terms may be set aside or adjusted under Norwegian law. Subsequently, insurance coverage and risk allocation between shipowner and charterer are considered. Problems in relation to insurance are examined separately, and the presentation also includes a suggested charter party provision drawn up by Nordisk Defence Club. The final section summarises the main points of the thesis with an emphasis on how the contracts may be adjusted to obtain insurance cover. As a starting point, P&I insurers do not cover liabilities in excess of what is imposed by ordinary background law. The cover under hull insurance is more uncertain, since the decisive point for this insurance is whether such terms may be considered customary in the trade. However, some Conditions of Use have obtained P&I approval after negotiations with the terminal. What distinguishes the approved contracts from the others is primarily the negligence-based liability {{on the part of the}} shipowner, the existence of causation and the limitation of liability. This proves that it is possible to negotiate balanced solutions. Moreover, separate P&I insurances with an additional premium and limited liability cover are now available in the market...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{advent of}} global gene {{expression}} profiling has generated unprecedented insight into our molecular understanding of cancer, including breast cancer. For example, human {{breast cancer patients}} display significant diversity {{in terms of their}} survival, recurrence, metastasis as well as response to treatment. These patient outcomes can be predicted by the transcriptional programs of their individual breast tumors. Predictive gene signatures allow us to correctly classify human breast tumors into various risk groups as well as to more accurately target therapy to ensure more durable cancer treatment. Results Here we present a novel algorithm to generate gene signatures with predictive potential. The method first classifies the expression intensity for each gene as determined by global gene expression profiling as low, average or high. The matrix containing the classified data for each gene is then used to score the expression of each gene based its individual ability to predict the patient characteristic of interest. Finally, all examined genes are ranked based on their predictive ability and the most highly ranked genes are included in the <b>master</b> gene <b>signature,</b> which is then ready for use as a predictor. This method was used to accurately predict the survival outcomes in a cohort of human breast cancer patients. Conclusions We confirmed the capacity of our algorithm to generate gene signatures with bona fide predictive ability. The simplicity of our algorithm will enable biological researchers to quickly generate valuable gene signatures without specialized software or extensive bioinformatics training. </p...|$|R

In the definitions above, each action {{name is a}} task. Thus, one of the tasks is {pay i(T),pay i(F) }. From the discussion about the correctness of Dining Cryptographers {{we ended up with}} the following informal formulation of correctness: for every scheduler σ and every observation o of player 0, µσ(M 1 ‖C 0 ‖C 1 ‖C 2) (o) = µσ(M 2 ‖C 0 ‖C 1 ‖C 2) (o), where with the notation µσ(M 1 ‖C 0 ‖C 1 ‖C 2) (o) we mean the probability of o in the probabilistic execution of M 1 ‖C 0 ‖C 1 ‖C 2 induced by σ. In other words, for every scheduler σ cryptographer 0 has no way to distinguish the situation in which cryptographer 1 is paying from the situation in which cryptographer 2 is paying. The scheduler has to be restricted in power, and we reached the conclusion that according to the definition given in the CONCUR paper of Chatzikokolakis and Palamidessi [3] using task schedulers should be ok. We take this definition for granted, given that we derived it from the CONCUR paper mentioned above. However, we will need to see whether there are alternative definitions (e. g., by exchanging quantifications) that are equivalent or more interesting. An observation of a cryptographer should be seen as the actual execution performed by the cryptographer.

60|$|It was in {{this place}} that I first saw my hostess. She had drawn one of the skins forward {{and sat in the}} sun, leaning against a pillar. It was her dress that struck me first of all, for it was rich and brightly coloured, and shone out in that dusty {{courtyard}} with something of the same relief as the flowers of the pomegranates. At a second look it was her beauty of person that took hold of me. As she sat back--watching me, I thought, though with invisible eyes--and wearing at the same time an expression of almost imbecile good-humour and contentment, she showed a perfectness of feature and a quiet nobility of attitude that were beyond a statue's. I took off my hat to her in passing, and her face puckered with suspicion as swiftly and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze; but she paid no heed to my courtesy. I went forth on my customary walk a trifle daunted, her idol-like impassivity haunting me; and when I returned, although she was still in much the same posture, I was half surprised to see that she had moved as far as the next pillar, following the sunshine. This time, however, she addressed me with some trivial salutation, civilly enough conceived, and uttered in the same deep-chested, and yet indistinct and lisping tones, that had already baffled the utmost niceness of my hearing from her son. I answered rather at a venture; for not only did I fail to take her meaning with precision, but the sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed me. They were unusually large, the iris golden like Felipe's, but the pupil at that moment so distended that they seemed almost black; and what affected me was not so much their size as (what was perhaps its consequence) the singular insignificance of their regard. A look more blankly stupid I have never met. My eyes dropped before it even as I spoke, and I went on my way upstairs to my own room, at once baffled and embarrassed. Yet when I came there and saw the face of the portrait, I was again reminded of the miracle of family descent. My hostess was, indeed, both older and fuller in person; her eyes were of a different colour; her face, besides, was not only free from the ill-significance that offended and attracted me in the painting; it was devoid of either good or bad--a moral blank expressing literally naught. And yet there was a likeness, not so much speaking as immanent, not so much in any particular feature as upon the whole.

40|$|The {{industry}} of shipping reaches {{far back in}} time but the traditional view with a shipowner offering his services is a mere memory. Developing from one actor offering all services more and more players have taken a role in shipping and the new industry {{that we have seen}} develop over the last 150 years consists of several parties carrying out different functions. Someone does of course own the ship but this is no longer equal to being the party carrying out the transport. More likely, the shipowner is only a name on a paper unaware of the actual shipping involvements on a specific level. Irrespective of which one of these two extremes we are faced with one thing is sure; the functions relevant for shipping today differ from the traditional arrangements. A changing industry requires new tools in order to function efficiently. This concerns everything from communication, financial setups to legal solutions that are in line with the structure we see today. In this thesis the focus is on how the legal solutions can help the market or the industry to work as efficiently as possible and in order to do so {{it is important that the}} content is desirable seen from a practical perspective. Furthermore it is important that the desirable position is unambiguously expressed. This will be the main focus in the following discussion. Concerning trade in bulk, chartering is the reality of today. A carrier enters into a chartering agreement with a charterer. This chartering agreement can be based on transport between destinations, on a specific time or on another basis the parties find appropriate to fulfil their requirements. The point being that there are many different ways to organize your trade today but common to all of them is that they will in almost every case start with a charter party. There are numerous interesting legal issues in regard of charter parties and in this thesis only one of them will be assessed. This is the question of liability. When we have a chain of charter party relationships governed by different terms and transport document between the charterer and a receiver in the end, it follows from the very nature of these contractual relationships that the issue of liability is central and complex. Who are the liable parties in this structure? The starting point for chartering is that this is an area of freedom of contract. The rational for this being that the parties involved are professionals with insight in the industry. With this said the position evaluated in this thesis is the legal position under the maritime code. Apart from the contracts this is the main legal source and it supplements all different contracts when they are silent or unclear. Furthermore it stipulates mandatory rules for some transport. The liability under the maritime code concerning charter parties is regulated in chapter 14. Either the liability derives from the charter party or from a tramp bill of lading. These are the two main documents governing this kind of transport. The carrier can be liable as contractual carrier or as performing carrier depending on whether or not the relationship to the contractual party is directly contractual or based on performance. When the document governing the transport of goods is a charter party the liability of the carrier concerning damaged or delayed goods is regulated in section 347 and section 383. The rules relating to charter parties are materially the same for both time- and voyage chartering in the code. In the first subparagraph the carrier s liability towards the charterer is regulated. The carrier is defined as the person who, through a contract, charters out a ship to another (the charterer). If the performing carrier is someone else than the carrier this party is caught by the reference to section 286 made in section 347 and 383 first subparagraph second sentence. The effect of the first section is in conclusion that the charterer has a claim for damaged or delayed cargo towards the carrier and the performing carrier, if this is not the same party. In the second subparagraph the carrier s and the performing carrier s liability towards a receiver who is not the charterer is regu-lated. When we have a bill of lading issued under a charter party, a tramp bill of lading, and this is endorsed to someone else than the charterer, this party s rights towards the issuer follow from the bill of lading. This is stipulated in section 325 in the maritime code. In order to establish the liability under a tramp bill of lading there are two main questions that has to be answered. First, when the carrier is bound by a tramp bill of lading. In this concern it is the distinction from liner trade that is important as the rules of presumption might result in different parties being bound by the <b>master</b> s <b>signature.</b> The evaluation depends on whether it is liner trade or chartering. Secondly, it is a question about the consequences when the carrier is bound. Or expressed in another way, the substance of the liability. In this thesis these rules will be evaluated from a practical basis according to the commercial patterns in the shipping industry.
