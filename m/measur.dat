40|$|Background: Acne vulgaris is {{the most}} common skin disease. Local and {{systemic}} antimicrobial drugs are used for its treatment. But increasing resistance of Propionibacterium acnes to antibiotics has been reported. Materials and Methods: In a double-blind clinical trial, 40 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were recruited. one side of the face was treated with Clindamycin Gel 1 % and the other side with Azithromycin Topical Gel 2 % BID for 8 weeks and then they were assessed. Results: Average age was 21. 8 ± 7 years. 82. 5 % of them were female. Average number of papules, pustules and comedones was similarly reduced in both groups and, no significant difference was observed between the two groups (P > 0. 05, repeated <b>measurs</b> ANOVA). The mean indexes of ASI and TLC also significantly decreased during treatment in both groups, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. (P > 0. 05, repeated <b>measurs</b> ANOVA). Also, impact of both drugs on papules and pustules was 2 - 3 times greater than the effect on comedones. Average satisfaction score was not significant between the two groups (P = 0. 6, repeated <b>measurs</b> ANOVA). finally, frequency distribution of complications was not significant between the two groups (P > 0. 05, Fisher Exact test). Conclusion: Azithromycin gel has medical impact at least similar to Clindamycin Gel in treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, and it may be consider as suitable drug for resistant acne to conventional topical therapy...|$|R

Con este objetivo, el autor propone tres índices para medir la fluidez de los sistemas de partidos: la natalidad partidista (Np), la mortalidad partidista (Mp) y la fluidez (fp) que el sistema de partidos causa en el ámbito parlamentario. En términos empíricos, esos tres índices son calculados para los casos centroamericanos entre los cuales se constata cómo es posible encontrarse con sistemas fluidos (a nivel de la «oferta») y con baja volatilidad (a nivel de «demanda»).

40|$|Microcurrent therapy (MCT) {{involves}} {{the application of}} sub-sensory electric current and can promote tissue repair, possibly by mimicking endogenous electrical cues for healing. It has been used successfully to treat recalcitrant bone fractures and skin ulcers, but its effects on other forms of tissue have received little attention. This study aimed to investigate the potential of MCT to promote healing and alleviate symptoms in a selected soft connective tissue disorder. A systematic review of human studies involving MCT for soft connective tissue damage was conducted. A survey of 93 musculoskeletal physiotherapists was used to help select a common, recalcitrant disorder to treat with microcurrent in a clinical trial. Novel sonographic scales to quantify tendon structural abnormality and tissue healing were developed, and their measurement properties evaluated along with several clinical and patient-rated outcome measures. Two preliminary clinical trials, involving 62 people with the selected disorder – chronic tennis elbow - were conducted, comparing four different types of microcurrent applied daily for 3 weeks. The review found fair quality evidence that certain forms of MCT can relieve symptoms, and low quality evidence that they can promote healing, in several soft connective tissue disorders, including those affecting tendons. Optimal treatment parameters are unknown. In the survey, clinicians identified frozen shoulder, plantar fasciitis and tennis elbow as particularly problematic, and tennis elbow was selected for treatment in the trials. The sonographic scales of hyperaemia had fair-to-good inter-rater and test-retest reliability. Minimum Detectable Change values are calculated for the sonographic scales and for pain-free grip strength measurements. The trials suggest that monophasic microcurrent of peak amplitude 50 µA applied for 35 hours was most effective in symptom alleviation, with a 93 % treatment success rate three months after treatment. By final assessment, pain-free grip strength increased by 31 % (95 %CI: 5, 57 %), pain measured on a multiple-item questionnaire reduced by 27 % (95 %CI: 16, 38 %) and patient-rated functional disability by 26 % (95 %CI: 14, 28 %). MCT with a current amplitude of 500 µA was significantly less effective, and varying the waveform appeared less important in determining outcomes. Differences between groups were non-significant on several <b>measurs,</b> {{though there was a}} risk of type II error in the tests used. No significant differences between any groups were seen in sonographic assessments, although consistent patterns in bloodflow chage suggested that MCT may modulate hyperaemia levels. Higher baseline hyperaemia was associated with sustained falls in hyperaemia levels after treatment, and with improved clinical outcome. MCT’s analgesic effect does not rely on sensory stimulation, and further investigation of its influence on tendinous blood flow and vascularity, or on the local biochemical milieu, may help elucidate its mechanism of action. On the basis of this investigation, a fully-powered controlled clinical trial is justified. A protocol, combining MCT with an exercise programme, is proposed.

40|$|Objectives It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that major depression {{is accompanied by}} alterations in cell-mediated and innate immunity. Moreover, major depression appears {{to be associated with}} increased plasma concentrations of positive ‘acute-phase’ proteins and increased production of cytokines. It has been suggested that an altered production of cytokines may underlie numerous recognized changes of immune or inflammatory markers. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) values in identifying a state of immune-inflammatory activation in patients with major depressive disorder. In particular, in order to assess the reliability of this inflammatory parameter in depression, we measured changes in hs-CRP values as well as its correlation with both the levels of some cytokines [interleukin 6 (IL- 6), soluble interleukin 6 receptor (sIL 6 R) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) ] and the clinical characteristics of the sample (severity of symptoms, specific psychopathological dimensions, etc.). Methods 24 outpatients (M/F = 8 / 16; mean age 46. 79 ± 12. 97) with a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) during a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and 20 healthy controls (M/F = 8 / 12, mean age = 40. 05 ± 11. 02) were recruited at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Catholic University in Rome. Depression severity was as- sessed with 21 -item HDRS, while anhedonia and psychomotor retardation were evaluated with Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and Depression Retardation Rating Scale (DRRS). Blood samples for the determination of hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL- 6 and sIL- 6 R were collected. Cytokines were measured using commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Levels of hs- CRP were measured using nephelometric assay. Results The patients included in the study mostly had moderate depressive symptoms at baseline (Table I). Plasma concentrations of IL- 6 (0. 59 ± 1. 14 vs. 0. 06 ± 0. 27 pg/ ml) and hs-CRP (3. 28 ± 3. 59 vs. 1. 33 ± 1. 48 mg/ml) were significantly higher in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. sIL- 6 R levels along with receptor-ligand binding activity (product IL- 6 × sIL 6 R) were higher in depressed patients compared to healthy controls, though not significantly. There were no differences in plasma concentrations of TNF-α between de- pressive patients and healthy controls (Table II). A significant positive correlation between hs-CRP and IL- 6 (r = 0. 25, p = 0. 047) was found. The analysis of a possible correlation between different inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, IL- 6, sIL- 6 R and TNF-α) and scores on psychometric scales (HDRS, BPRS, DRRS and SHAPS) showed no statistical significance. Immune system and acute phase response activation, therefore, shows no correlation with severity of depressive symptoms and psychopathological profile (anhedonia and psychomotor retardation). Conclusions Although plasma cytokine assays are highly specific and sensitive <b>measurs</b> in defining immune profile, they are quite expensive. The use of hs-CRP in our study has, on the contrary, proven to be sufficiently reliable and potentially applicable to routine clinical practice, so to identify those subjects with the highest levels of immune dysregulation. Further studies on larger samples, more adequately characterized with respect to clinical course and characteristics, are necessary to increase our understanding of the role played by immune activation in major depression...|$|R

The System makes use of a convergent-divergent shaped Laval nozzle, which results in cooling of the gas flow, do~, to 70 K. The experimental setup includes a, main chamber in which two pulsed solenoid valves deliver gas to a pre-expansion reservoir from where the gas flows through the Laval nozzle and out into the low pressure regime in the main chamber. For kinetic studies, a pulsed laser photolysis ~ laser induced fluorescence method was used to measure rate coefficients of reactions ofOH at 86 Ã‚Â± 7 K and 69 Ã‚Â± 6 K, with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) used as an OH precursor when required. The Laval nozzles were characterised using two methods; impact pressure measurements and rotational spectroscopy, the temperature measurements from both of which agreed within error. Measurements of rate coefficients for collisional quencQing ofNO (A 2 L+, v'= 0) by O 2 and NO and OH (A 2 L+, v' = 0) by O 2 and N 2, were found to agree well with predictions from previpus experimental data and a model containing contributions from the multipole attractive forces model and Harpoon mechanism. Measurements of rate coeffic~ents for reactions of OH with ethene (k 1), propyne (k 2), acetylene (k 3) and benzene (k 4) were also carried out. The rate coefficients for these reactions' were found to be k 1 = (2. 12 Ã‚Â± 0. 12) x 10 - 11 and (3. 22 Ã‚Â± 0. 46) x 10 - 11 cm 3 molecule- 1 set, at 86 K and 69 K, respectively, k 2 = (3. 11 Ã‚Â± 0. 09) x 10 - 12, (5. 02 Ã‚Â± 0. 11) x 10 - 12 and (5. 08 Ã‚Â± 0. 65) x 10 - 12 cm 3 molecule- 1 S-l, at 298 K, 86 K and 69 K, respectively, and the upper limit for k 3 was assigned to be < 2. 4 x 10 - 12 cm 3 molecule- 1 S-l at 69 K, 14 was unable to be measured due to interference from the benzene sensitized decomposition of the t-BuOOH OH precursor. Reactions of the acetyl radical with O 2 (ks) and OH with acetone (k<,) and methyl ethyl ketone, MEK (k 7), were also studied, with ks = (5. 87 Ã‚Â± 0. 39) x 10, 12 and (9. 21 Ã‚Â± 1. 24) x 10 - 12 cm 3 molecule- 1 S'l at 86 K and 69 K, respectively. Measurements of the rate coefficients of k<, and k 7 were carried out using two different OH sources; reaction of the acetyl radical with O 2 and photolysis of t-BuOOH. Curved bimolecular plots, observed mainly at 69 K, indicated formation of acetone and MEK dimers as well as clusters with t-BuOOH. Lower limits of rate coefficients, when acetyl + O 2 was used as the OH source, were measured as k<, = (5. 67.
