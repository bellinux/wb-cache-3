Much of their household subsistence {{and part of the}} income is generated from the sale of a variety of NTFP products. In the Highlands of Vietnam, NTFPs calendar is spread almost throughout the year that provides a sustained income for the ethnic minority people. From June to August is the wild berry called Uoi (Scaphium macropodium) collection that provides the bulk of household income. Every family sends several people into the forest on a regular basis during this period where they stay for 2-3 days during which 5-6 kg of berries is collected. A kilogram of dried berries (2-3 days of sun-dry) is sold for $1.50. The next comes bamboo shoots, mushrooms and vegetable collection that goes through to February. The minority people in Sa Pa area depends mainly on a variety of NTFPs for their livelihoods. Among the products collected are fruits, berries, leaves, mushrooms, fish, bees honey, bamboo shoots, wild orchids and the list goes on. The Friday <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of orchids and other wild plants put forward by these people for the tourists, both domestic and international, that flock there. Between 10-15% of the total household income is derived from the sale of NTFPs. The harvesting of leaves in the diet of family goes round the year where different species are readily available in specific months. Water from forest areas is yet another service that is useful in the livelihoods of these people. They have micro-hydro plants installed in streams that generate the much needed power for pounding (grain and seeds) and lighting too.|$|E

More than of a by-product one should speak of glycerol as a co-product, as {{its impact on}} the overall economy of the biodiesel production chain is pivotal. Glycerine (a concentrated aqueous solution of glycerol) is nowadays no longer an attractive product as its increased availability has caused a dramatic fall in its price. Thus to enhance market competitiveness of biodiesel there is need to find alternative uses for glycerine. Currently, glycerol is produce industrially from glycerides (via saponification and transesterification), propylene (through various synthetic pathways) and sugars (via hydrogenolysis and fermentation). Glycerol founds applications in more than 1500 uses, such as food industry, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, tobacco and paper industry just to name a few. However, for all these uses the <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>full.</b> In principle glycerol could be used directly as a fuel but {{there are a number of}} drawbacks.
