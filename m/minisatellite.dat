25|$|The Southern blot {{technique}} is laborious, and requires {{large amounts of}} undegraded sample DNA. Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many <b>minisatellite</b> loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but {{making it hard to}} discern individual alleles (and thereby precluding paternity testing). These early techniques have been supplanted by PCR-based assays.|$|E
40|$|<b>Minisatellites</b> are DNA tandem repeats {{that are}} found in all sequenced genomes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, they are {{frequently}} encountered in genes encoding cell wall proteins. <b>Minisatellites</b> present in the completely sequenced genome of the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata were similarly analyzed, and two new types of <b>minisatellites</b> were discovered: <b>minisatellites</b> that are composed of two different intermingled repeats (called compound <b>minisatellites),</b> and <b>minisatellites</b> containing unusually long repeated motifs (126 – 429 bp). These long repeat <b>minisatellites</b> may reach unusual length for such elements (up to 10 kb). Due to these peculiar properties, they have been named ‘megasatellites’. They are found essentially in genes involved in cell–cell adhesion, and could therefore {{be involved in the}} ability of this opportunistic pathogen to colonize the human host. In addition to megasatellites, found in large paralogous gene families, there are 93 <b>minisatellites</b> with simple shorter motifs, comparable to those found in S. cerevisiae. Most of the time, these <b>minisatellites</b> are not conserved between C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae, although their host genes are well conserved, raising the question of an active mechanism creating <b>minisatellites</b> de novo in hemiascomycetes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Minisatellites</b> {{and their}} shorter cousins, the microsatellites, {{together}} {{are classified as}} VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) DNA. Confusingly, <b>minisatellites</b> are {{often referred to as}} VNTRs, and microsatellites are often referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs).|$|R
25|$|DNA profiling, {{based on}} typing {{individual}} highly variable <b>minisatellites</b> {{in the human}} genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many <b>minisatellites</b> simultaneously. By focusing on {{just a few of}} these highly variable <b>minisatellites,</b> DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and paternity testing worldwide.|$|R

Launched on 26 May 1999 by Indian space agency ISRO, on orbit the satellite was renamed to Uribyol 3. Manufactured by KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC), Kitsat-3 was developed with experience from Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 (no heritage to the Kitsat-1 and Kitsat-2 bus) {{and was the}} first independently designed South Korean satellite.|$|E

2500|$|Relatively {{few studies}} have {{researched}} the effects of paternal radiation exposure on offspring. Following the Chernobyl disaster, it was assumed in the 1990s that the germ line of irradiated fathers suffered <b>minisatellite</b> mutations in the DNA, which was inherited by descendants. more recently however, the World Health Organization states, [...] "children conceived before or after their father's exposure showed {{no statistically significant differences}} in mutation frequencies". This statistically insignificant increase was also seen by independent researchers analyzing the children of the liquidators. Animal studies have shown that incomparably massive doses of X-ray irradiation of male mice resulted in birth defects of the offspring.|$|E
40|$|We present DNA {{sequences}} flanking cloned hypervariable human <b>minisatellites.</b> In {{addition to}} providing confirmatory evidence that <b>minisatellites</b> cluster with other tandem repeats, these flanking sequences contain a high frequency of interspersed repetitive elements. These elements include a retroviral LTR-like sequence, from {{which one of the}} <b>minisatellites</b> appears to have expanded, and a recently described short interspersed repeat. We present our own findings concerning this element, in particular that those examples studied do not show significant evolutionary conservation, despite suggestions that the element may have a cis-acting function. 9274...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{developed}} approaches for the cloning of <b>minisatellites</b> from total genomic libraries and applied these {{approaches to the}} human, rat, and pig genomes. The chromosomal distribution of <b>minisatellites</b> in the three genomes is strikingly different, with clustering at chromosome ends in human, a seemingly almost even distribution in rat, and an intermediate situation in pig. A closer analysis, however, reveals that interstitial sites in pig and rat often correspond to terminal cytogenetic bands in human. This observation suggests that <b>minisatellites</b> are created toward chromosome ends and their internalization represents secondary events resulting from rearrangements involving chromosome ends...|$|R
25|$|Tandem repeats of longer {{sequences}} (arrays {{of repeated}} sequences 10–60 nucleotides long) are termed <b>minisatellites.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that <b>minisatellite</b> sequences encourage chromosomes to swap DNA. In alternative models, it {{is the presence of}} neighbouring double-strand hotspots which is the primary cause of <b>minisatellite</b> repeat copy number variations. Somatic changes are suggested to result from replication difficulties (which might include replication slippage, among other phenomena).|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{evolutionary}} fate of minisatellites tends towards an equilibrium distribution in the size of alleles, until mutations in the flanking DNA affect the recombinational activity of a <b>minisatellite</b> by suppressing DNA instability. Such an event would ultimately lead to the extinction of a hypermutable <b>minisatellite</b> by meiotic drive.|$|E

40|$|Background. Mucins are {{the major}} {{components}} of mucus and their genes share a common, centrally-located region of sequence that encodes tandem repeats. Mucins are well known genes {{with respect to their}} specific expression levels; however, their genomic levels are unclear because of complex genomic properties. In this study, we identified eight novel <b>minisatellites</b> from the entire MUC 2 region and investigated how allelic variation in these <b>minisatellites</b> may affect susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancer. Methodology/Principle Findings. We analyzed genomic DNA from the blood of normal healthy individuals and multi-generational family groups. Six of the eight <b>minisatellites</b> exhibited polymorphism and were transmitted meiotically in seven families, following Mendelian inheritance. Furthermore, a case-control study was performed that compared genomic DNA from 457 cancer-free controls with DNA from individuals with gastric (455), colon (192) and rectal (271) cancers. A statistically significant association was identified between rare exonic MUC 2 -MS 6 alleles and the occurrence of gastric cancer: odds ratio (OR), 2. 56; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 31 – 5. 04; and p= 0. 0047. We focused on an association between rare alleles and gastric cancer. Rare alleles were divided into short (40, 43 and 44) and long (47, 50 and 54), according to their TR (tandem repeats) lengths. Interestingly, short rare alleles were associated with gastric cancer (OR = 5. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 93 – 16. 42; p= 0. 00036). Moreover, hypervariable MUC 2 <b>minisatellites</b> were analyzed in matched blood and cancer tissue from 28 patients with gastric cancer and in 4 cases of MUC 2 -MS 2, <b>minisatellites</b> were found to have undergone rearrangement...|$|R

40|$|The term "DNA fingerprint" {{has been}} used to {{describe}} the extensive restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with hypervariable <b>minisatellites</b> present in the human genome. Until now, it was necessary to hybridize Southern blots to specific probes cloned from human genomic DNA in order to obtain individual-specific restriction patterns. The present study describes the surprising finding that the insert-free, wild-type M 13 bacteriophage detects hypervariable <b>minisatellites</b> in human and in animal DNA, provided no competitor DNA is used during hybridization. The effective sequence in M 13 was traced to two clusters of 15 -base pair repeats within the protein III gene of the bacteriophage. This unexpected use of M 13 renders the DNA fingerprinting technology more readily available to molecular biology laboratories. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.
