25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of <b>my</b> <b>oldest</b> friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
2500|$|While Atwater later orchestrated the 1988 presidential {{election}} of President George H. W. Bush, and became Chairman of the Republican National Committee, {{he recognized the}} fact that the Atkinson party switch was one of his first coups as Reagan's White House political adviser and it was Austin who helped him succeed. They remained close friends right up to Atwater's death from a brain tumor on March 29, 1991. As RNC Chairman, Atwater called Austin [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>oldest</b> and dearest political pals." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 9, 1995, at 4:23am, {{eight days}} after his 53rd birthday, Garcia {{was found dead in}} his room at the {{rehabilitation}} clinic. The cause of death was a heart attack. Garcia had long struggled with drug addiction, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and diabetes—all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that upon hearing of Garcia's death, [...] "I was struck numb; I had lost <b>my</b> <b>oldest</b> surviving friend, my brother." [...] Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including former basketball player Bill Walton and musician Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred Garcia's former wives from the ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|I {{have been}} {{requested}} {{by one of}} <b>my</b> <b>oldest</b> and best friends in the Company's service to introduce to your [...] and kind offices [...] John Campbell of the Ship Scotia which vessel he has commanded since she was launched, but owing to change of owners and other [...] he is now out of employ with a numerous family and very slender means to provide for them. He is, however, an active, able, and trustworthy Commander, in good health, well-known to your friends in Bombay, to the Lyalls in Calcutta, and to our friends in China. Under these circumstances, destitute at home though willing to work, he intends embarking by the October mail for Bombay, and I beg most earnestly to bring him under your notice and bespeak for him as early employment as though you and other kind friends can possibly be procured.|$|E
