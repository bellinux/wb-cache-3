60|$|The hens had, however, a {{numerous}} foe, {{who were}} a great trouble to their young mistresses. These were the skunks, an animal of the weasel tribe, but much resembling squirrels in appearance, and possessing a most abominable smell; {{so much so that}} the dogs, who would attack almost anything, would run away from them. They were at first exceedingly common, and created terrible depredations among the hens. The girls were in despair, and called in their brothers to their assistance. The boys shot a good many, for the animals were very tame and fearless; but their number was so great that this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>destruction</b> was of slight avail. They then prepared traps of various kinds--some made by an elastic stick bent down, with a noose at the end, placed at a small entrance left purposely in the hen-house, so that, when the skunk was about to enter, he touched a spring, and the stick released, flew into the air carrying the animal with it with the noose round its neck; other traps let fall a heavy piece of wood, which crushed the invader; and in these ways the skunks were pretty well got rid of, the most unpleasant work being the removal of the body from the trap. This had to be effected by taking hold of it with two pieces of wood, for the odor was so powerful that if the body was touched the smell would remain on the hands for days.|$|E

40|$|The Hanford Site was {{the first}} Department of Energy (DOE) complex to recycle excess {{software}} rather than dispose {{of it in the}} landfill.

40|$|A {{revolution}} in cardiac care is developing that may save Medicare {{hundreds of billions}} of dollars. Recent advances in imaging technology and combination pharmacologic interventions are changing our concepts of cardiovascular disease and improving our therapies. These advances portend a significant improvement in quality of care and reduction of costs. Historically, the primary cardiovascular therapy has been surgical, based on the development of cardiac angiography and its images of discrete luminal incursions with limitations to blood flow. Focal discrete lesions can be bypassed or stented. Since Dr. DeBakey performed the first bypass in the 1960 s, about half a million coronary artery bypass grafts are now performed each year in the U. S. The idea of a progressive, relatively focal lesion impinging on the lumen seemed very amenable to anatomical correction. Over the last decade a different model of the disease has emerged. Arterial disease is now seen as a diffuse inflammatory process of the arterial wall that is mediated by T-cells and macrophages. Modern thought believes the process occurs throughout the arterial system, and that its pathology resembles that of rheumatoid arthritis in its <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>destruction</b> of the connective tissue in the endothelium.
