Information from the {{exposure meter}} is displayed using a dual <b>match</b> <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 exposure meter can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 exposure meter required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|E

40|$|The multi-needle electrospinning {{system is}} a {{convenient}} way to produce fibers with special structures such as core-shell morphologies at a high production rate. In this paper, a specially designed multi-needle electrospinning system is presented. The spinnerets were built-up with an equilateral hexagon array. Each set of 3 needles of the spinnerets were distributed as an equilateral triangle. A coaxial shield ring was used to create an approximate uniform electric field near {{the tips of the}} needles and to restrict the collection area. The simulation results also show that the outside needles can help to create a more uniform electric field near the inside tips of the needles and restrict the path of the inside jets, which works almost the same as the additional shield ring. Based on the simulation results, several multi-needle systems were tested. A 7 cm diameter shield ring was used in a 7 <b>needle</b> <b>system,</b> a 9 cm diameter shield ring was used in a 19 <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> and a 10. 5 cm diameter shield ring was used in a 37 <b>needle</b> <b>system.</b> Polyethylene Oxide (PEO) aqueous solution was used as the test solution in experiments. The electrospinning results demonstrated that the use of multi-needle spinnerets is robust and that uniform nanofibers can be produced. The more needles used, the smaller the mean fiber diameter for larger mean electric field strengths. These distributions of needles show the scale up possibility of special structure electrospun nanofiber manufacturing.

An active MR intravascular <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> was used for all transvascular punctures, and all procedures were performed with a 1. 5 -T MR unit. The needle was introduced via a 12 -F femoral vein sheath and advanced into the IVC by using a real-time gradient-recalled-echo sequence (3. 4 / 1. 2 [repetition time msec/echo time msec], 45 ° flip angle, and six to eight frames per second). Fast transverse spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (SPGR) (6. 0 / 1. 5, 60 ° flip angle, one frame per second) was performed to confirm needle trajectory. The <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> was advanced under real-time MR imaging to puncture the SMV. The location of the needle tip was confirmed with a fast spin-echo sequence (1904 / 4. 5, 36 -cm field of view). A direct MR portogram was obtained after the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine at a concentration of 25 % with fast SPGR (6 / 1. 3, 90 ° flip angle, no section selection, three frames per second). Success was defined as entry into the mesehteric venous system without traversal of any retroperitoneal organs or adjacent vasculature. Results: Successful MR imaging-guided IVC-SMV punctures were performed in all 10 procedures (100 %). The needle was fully visualized as it traversed the retroperitoneum and entered the SMV.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a surgical needle designed for bone biopsy, {{based on an}} ultrasonic-sonic drilling mechanism. Bone biopsy is an invasive diagnostic procedure where a bone sample is extracted for clinical analysis. For conventional bone biopsy methods, closed biopsy is normally adopted and uses a core needle. An intact and viable biopsy sample is required for clinical analysis. However, a particular limitation of closed biopsy is that the microarchitecture of the biopsy sample can be easily damaged due to the large force which is applied through the core needle to penetrate bone. In some cases, the bone biopsy samples are fractured or crushed during the biopsy process. Power ultrasonic surgical devices have improved many aspects of bone cutting procedures, such as lower cutting force, higher accuracy, and better preservation of the tissue around the cutting site. In this study, an ultrasonic-sonic <b>needle</b> (US <b>needle)</b> <b>system</b> is designed and used to extract an intact biopsy sample and the penetration performance is evaluated by the effective impulse delivered to the target. The ultrasonic-sonic drilling mechanism was originally invented for rock drilling in low environments. In the US <b>needle</b> <b>system,</b> a free mass oscillates between an ultrasonic transducer-horn and a surgical needle, converting the ultrasonic frequency vibration of the horn to sonic frequency vibration of the needle. Compared to other ultrasonic surgical devices that directly transfer the ultrasonic vibrations from the cutting tip to the tissue, the US needle allows sufficient time between impacts with the free mass for the tip vibration amplitude to be re-established in the horn. This can maintain penetration progress of the needle into bone, where the rate of progress {{has been shown to}} be proportional to the effective impulse delivered by the needle to the bone. To maximise the effective impulse, a numerical model is developed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> and optimise the US needle. To build the US <b>needle</b> <b>system,</b> the design and optimisation of the ultrasonic transducer-horn were investigated with the finite element method and experimental modal analysis, ensuring that the transducer-horn operates at the tuned frequency (50 kHz) with a pure longitudinal mode. The configuration of the ultrasonic horn determines the momentum transferred to the free mass and hence also affects the effective impulse delivered to the target. The shape and dimensions of the ultrasonic horn were determined through the finite element model of the ultrasonic horn impacting the free mass, which focused on maximising the post-collision velocity of the free-mass. The dynamic components of the US needle were also investigated. A numerical model representing the dynamic behaviour of the <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> was developed, allowing the optimisation of each dynamic component, maximising the effective impulse delivered to the target. Each dynamic component of the US needle was modelled as a mass-spring-damper (MSD) system, which constituted the whole system dynamic model. The numerical model was validated by experiments using a prototype needle. The free-mass velocity, needle velocity and impact force predicted by the numerical model were compared with the results measured from experiments using 3 D laser Doppler vibrometry, an ultra-high speed camera and a load cell, respectively. The numerical model results exhibit good agreement with the experimental results, indicating the numerical model can be used as a predictive tool to evaluate the performance of the US needle when different configurations are implemented. The configuration of the US needle is studied to maximise the effective impulse by the numerical model, through optimisation of the mass of the free mass, spring rate and spring pre-load. An optimised configuration of the US needle was determined by the numerical model and validated by experiments. The resulting prototype of the needle device was tested in ovine femur in vitro and was demonstrated to retrieve a cortical bone biopsy sample with a more cylindrical geometry, smoother surface and more intact sample than a cortical biopsy sample retrieved using a conventional trephine needle. Moreover, the penetration performance of the US needle was also compared with an ultrasonic resonant needle where the ultrasonic transducer and surgical needle resonate at the same frequency...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{most common}} laparoscopic {{complications}} {{are associated with}} trocar insertion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop an objective method of evaluating the safety profile of various access devices used in laparoscopic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: In 20 swine, 6 bladed and 2 needle access devices were evaluated. A force profile was determined by measuring the force required to drive the trocar or needle through the fascia and into the peritoneum, at 0 and 10 mmHg. The amount Of tissue deformation, the length of blade exposed, and the duration of exposure were measured using a high-speed digital imaging <b>system.</b> RESULTS: The <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> without the sheath required the least driving force and had the most favorable force profile. In contrast, the bladed, nonretractable trocar system required a higher driving force and a rapid loss of resistance. Insertion under a pneumoperitoneum did not significantly alter the force profile of the various access devices except for the amount of tissue deformation. With the bladed system, the blade itself was exposed for an average of 0. 5 to 1. 0 seconds for a distance of 4. 5 to 5. 0 cm. In comparison, the <b>needle</b> <b>system</b> was exposed for 0. 2 seconds for a distance of 1. 8 cm. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a reproducible method of measuring the forces required to place the access systems, their pattern of resistance loss, and the characteristics of the blade exposure.
