5|$|The {{mercury battery}} is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a primary cell, that was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E
25|$|This {{electrolysis}} {{is conducted}} {{in either a}} <b>mercury</b> <b>cell,</b> a diaphragm cell, or a membrane cell. Each of those use a different method to separate the chlorine from the sodium hydroxide. Other technologies are under development due to the high energy consumption of the electrolysis, whereby small improvements in the efficiency can have large economic paybacks. Some applications of chlorine include PVC, disinfectants, and solvents. Sodium hydroxide enables industries that produce paper, soap, and aluminium.|$|E

500|$|Mercury is used {{primarily}} for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, [...] {{while most of the}} other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations, and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy. Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. It is still used as an ingredient in dental amalgams. In the late 20th century the largest use of mercury was in the <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) in the production of chlorine and caustic soda.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first patent}} for electrolyzing brine was granted in England in 1851 to Charles Watt. His process {{was not an}} {{economically}} feasible method for producing sodium hydroxide though because it could not prevent the chlorine that formed in the brine solution from reacting with its other constituents. Hamilton Castner solved the mixing problem with {{the invention of the}} <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> and was granted a U.S. patent in 1892 (http://www.google.com/patents/US528322). Austrian chemist, Karl Kellner arrived at a similar solution at about the same time. In order to avoid a legal battle they became partners in 1895, founding the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company, which built plants employing the process throughout Europe. The <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> process continues in use to this day. Current-day <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> plant operations are criticized for environmental release of mercury [...] leading in some cases to severe mercury poisoning as occurred in Ontario Minamata disease. Due to these concerns, <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> plants are being phased out, and a sustained effort is being made to reduce mercury emissions from existing plants.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Dufault began {{researching the}} mercury cycle {{on behalf of}} the FDA, which involved, among other things, {{analyzing}} a number of food products listing HFCS as either the first or second ingredient on the label. An EPA colleague inspired Dufault to follow up on this science because the caustic soda (lye) produced by the <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> chlorine industry likely contained mercury as a residue. During the course of her investigation, she found out that the biggest user of <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> chlorine products was the corn refining industry. In a confidential interview with a corn refiner, Dufault learned <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> caustic soda was used primarily by the corn refiners in their manufacturing process to lengthen the shelf life of corn syrups. Dufault enlisted the help of several colleagues inside and outside government to test whether high fructose corn syrup or products containing high fructose corn syrup contained trace amounts of mercury.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium amalgam is a {{by-product}} of chlorine manufactured by <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> electrolysis. In this cell, brine (concentrated sodium chloride solution) is electrolysed between a liquid mercury cathode and a titanium or graphite anode. Chlorine is formed at the anode, while sodium formed at the cathode dissolves into the mercury, making sodium amalgam. Normally this sodium amalgam is drawn off and reacted with water in a [...] "decomposer cell" [...] to produce hydrogen gas, concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, and mercury to be recycled through the process. In principle, all the mercury should be completely recycled, but inevitably a small portion goes missing. Because of concerns about this mercury escaping into the environment, the <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> process is generally being replaced by plants which use a less toxic cathode.|$|E

During the war they also made picric acid, TNT and guncotton. Following the end of hostilities the company laid plans to develop a range of chlorinated organics and to this end purchased salt-bearing land near [...] Sandbach, Cheshire. The salt was produced by a new company formed specifically for the purpose and named the British Soda Company. The salt being needed to feed a new installation of <b>mercury</b> <b>cells</b> at the Staveley works. The first cells at Staveley came into operation in 1922 and in 1926 they went into partnership with the Krebs Company of Paris and Berlin to develop a new cell, which was based on lessons learned. This was marketed worldwide as the Krebs-Staveley cell. This installation lasted into the late 1950s when the cellroom at Staveley was replaced with German-made <b>mercury</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>cell</b> {{chlor-alkali}} {{production is}} a significant user of mercury {{and a source of}} mercury releases to the environment. The mercury used in this process acts as a catalyst in the chlorine production process. Best practices, such as proper waste management, can minimize the release of mercury. Mercury-free technologies are also available in chlor-alkali production.|$|E
50|$|The salt {{solution}} (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted.

50|$|A {{mercury battery}} (also called mercuric oxide battery, or <b>mercury</b> <b>cell)</b> is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a primary cell. Mercury batteries use a reaction between mercuric oxide and zinc electrodes in an alkaline electrolyte.

Mercury batteries were used in the shape of button cells for watches, hearing aids, cameras and calculators, and in larger forms for other applications.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Canadian and American governments closed the {{commercial}} fishery over concerns of bio-accumulation of mercury. The industry {{responsible for this}} contamination was the Dow Chemical Chlor-Alkali Plant in Sarnia, Ontario. Since 1949, Dow Chemical had been operating <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> plants {{for the production of}} chlorine and other chemicals. From their production process, mercury was being discharged into the river and contaminating the fishery. The fishery has since not been re-opened, although studies have now confirmed mercury levels are well within safe range.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there are still}} around 100 mercury-cell plants operating worldwide. In Japan, mercury-based chloralkali production was virtually phased out by 1987 (except for the last two potassium chloride units shut down in 2003). In the United States, there will be only five mercury plants remaining in operation by the end of 2008. In Europe, <b>mercury</b> <b>cells</b> accounted for 43% of capacity in 2006 and Western European producers have committed to closing or converting all remaining chloralkali mercury plants by 2020.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} or {{potassium hydroxide}} {{are used as}} an electrolyte. Sodium hydroxide cells have nearly constant voltage at low discharge currents, making them ideal for hearing aids, calculators, and electronic watches. Potassium hydroxide cells, in turn, provided constant voltage at higher currents, making them suitable for applications requiring current surges, e.g. photographic cameras with flash, and watches with a backlight. Potassium hydroxide cells also have better performance at lower temperatures. <b>Mercury</b> <b>cells</b> have very long shelf life, up to 10 years.|$|R
40|$|Abstract − The {{triple point}} of mercury {{is one of}} the {{defining}} fixed-points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90) [1]. Its value was assigned to be 231. 3456 K (- 38. 8344 °C) by ITS- 90 and has an unique importance since it is the only fixed-point suggested by ITS- 90 between 0. 01 °C and- 190 °C. Four <b>mercury</b> <b>cells</b> from borosilicate-glass were constructed at TUBITAK-UME Temperature laboratory. The details of construction phase then the measurement and comparison results with the reference UME cell will be given in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Three {{production}} {{methods are}} in use. While the <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> method produces chlorine-free sodium hydroxide, {{the use of}} several tonnes of mercury leads to serious environmental problems. In a normal production cycle a few hundred pounds of mercury per year are emitted, which accumulate in the environment. Additionally, the chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced via the mercury-cell chloralkali process are themselves contaminated with trace amounts of mercury. The membrane and diaphragm method use no mercury, but the sodium hydroxide contains chlorine, which must be removed.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the early}} 21st Century, some {{factories}} manufacturing HFCS {{had used a}} chlor-alkali corn processing method which, in cases of applying <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> technology for digesting corn raw material, left trace residues of mercury in some batches of HFCS. In a 2009 release, The Corn Refiners Association stated that all factories in the American industry for manufacturing HFCS had used mercury-free processing over several previous years, making the prior report outdated. As of 2017, the USDA, FDA and US Centers for Disease Control list HFCS as a safe food ingredient, and do not mention mercury as a safety concern in HFCS products.|$|E
50|$|In the mercury-cell process, {{also known}} as the Castner-Kellner process, a {{saturated}} brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a sodium-mercury amalgam with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and evaporates out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about mercury poisoning from <b>mercury</b> <b>cell</b> pollution such as occurred in Canada (see Ontario Minamata disease) and Japan (see Minamata disease).|$|E
