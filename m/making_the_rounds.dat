While Hansen had not spoken in public about his desires or pursuits for a specific team, the rumors were rampant enough that Think Big Sacramento, a community action group created by Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson to develop solutions for the Kings, composed an open letter to Hansen asking him not to pursue the city's team. Meanwhile, negotiations between McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen continued on development of a memorandum of understanding that would lay out the relationship for a public-private partnership on the new arena.|$|E
25|$|For a few months, {{following}} {{the release of}} Rocky IV, a joke was <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> in Hollywood. Since Rocky Balboa {{had run out of}} earthly opponents, he would have to fight an alien if a fifth installment of his boxing series were to be made. Screenwriters Jim and John Thomas took the inspiration from the joke and wrote a screenplay based on it. The Thomas script for Predator was originally titled Hunter. It was picked up by 20th Century Fox in 1985, and turned over to producer Joel Silver who, based on his experience with Commando, decided to turn the science fiction pulp storyline into a big-budget film. Silver enlisted his former boss Lawrence Gordon as co-producer and John McTiernan was hired as director for his first studio film. New Zealand director Geoff Murphy was also considered to direct.|$|E

Sherman was relieved of his command in disgrace, Ewing aided {{his younger sister}} Ellen Ewing Sherman in <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> of Washington D.C., denying sensationalist media claims that Sherman was insane, and personally lobbying the President for Sherman's reinstatement. Ewing and his sister argued that Sherman's requests for men and material in Kentucky had been denied in Washington, and that the charges of insanity {{had been part of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. Eventually the political influence of the Ewing family persevered, and with the assistance of Henry Halleck, Sherman was returned to command. President Abraham Lincoln praised Sherman's [...] "talent & conduct" [...] publicly to a large group of important officers, and later banished Thomas to a meaningless post on recruiting duty in the Trans-Mississippi Theater.|$|E
500|$|Until around 1990, the North Korean state {{required}} every able-bodied male to {{be employed}} by some state enterprise. However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed {{to stay at home}} as full-time housewives (less than some countries in the same region like South Korean \Japan and Taiwan, more than Soviet Union\Mainland China or Nordic countries like Sweden, about the same as Today's United States).) In the early 1990s, an estimated 600,000-900,000 people perished in the famine, which was largely a product of the North Korean government's unwillingness to reform the economy, and the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling household items they could do without or homemade food. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women.

500|$|Though Skelton {{had always}} done live engagements at Nevada hotels and {{appearances}} such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after {{he was no longer}} on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year. He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> of the local shopping malls. [...] Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites. [...] The venue's ushers would collect the ballots and tally the votes. [...] Skelton's performance on that given day was based on the skits his audience selected. After he learned that his performances were popular with the hearing-impaired because of his heavy use of pantomimes, Skelton hired a sign language interpreter to translate the non-pantomime portions of his act for all his shows. He continued performing live until 1993, when he celebrated his 80th birthday.|$|E

Hancock joined bassist Butch Warren and drummer Billy Higgins in the rhythm section, with Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and Dexter Gordon on tenor saxophone. Hancock's chordal work draws from the gospel tradition, while he builds his solo on repeated riffs and trilled figures.|$|E

About two years later, William sired a daughter, Beatrice [...] "Mama Lucy" [...] Armstrong, who was {{under the care of}} Mary Albert. Josephine, Louis' maternal grandmother, raised him until he was about five, after he returned to Mary Albert. He spent his youth in poverty, in a rough neighborhood known as the Battlefield.

Fisk was located in his neighborhood and enrolled African-American children. During his school years, he continued to bring in money delivering coal and other odd jobs working for the Karnoffskys, a family of Lituanian Jews. He sold coal for a nickel per bucket, in many cases, to the brothels in Storyville. He attended Fisk sporadically from six years of age, but quit during fifth grade, at age eleven. <b>Making</b> <b>the</b> <b>rounds</b> with the Karnoffsky family while delivering coal exposed Louis to music by spasm bands, and the house musicians playing at brothels and dance halls.
