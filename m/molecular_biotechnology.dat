The renovation provides wet and dry teaching labs, classrooms, a computer classroom, support spaces, conference rooms, meeting rooms, faculty offices, a kitchen, and clerical support spaces.|$|R
2500|$|In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the {{university}} offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, {{with an overall}} acceptance rate of 16.3%. Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, <b>molecular</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%, 3.8%, 7.6% and 9.1% respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.|$|E
