40|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} {{efficacy of}} <b>meobentine</b> sulfate, a bethanidine derivative lacking inhibitory effects on adrenergic neuronal function, was assessed in three canine models. Intranvenous <b>meobentine</b> sulfate, administered in dosages of 5. 0, 10, 0, and 20. 0 mg/kg, produced a dose-related {{increase in the}} ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) under nonischemic conditions (7. 6 +/- 1. 8 mA vs 37. 8 +/- 8. 6 mA) (20 mg/kg; p p p 0. 05). In the conscious dog, 4 days after an anterior myocardial infarction, programmed electrical stimulation (PES) produced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in five dogs. After <b>meobentine</b> sulfate administration, eight of nine animals had sustained VT and one animal developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). At a dose of 20 mg/kg, there was prolongation of the cycle length of the VT (169 +/- 11 msec to 237 +/- 20 msec), prolongation of the QRS duration (58 +/- 2. 6 msec to 71 +/- 3. 7 msec), and prolongation of the delay in epicardial activation. There was an enhanced potential after <b>meobentine</b> administration for programmed stimulation to produce ventricular arrhythmias {{with the introduction of}} fewer premature impulses. In the third canine model, conscious dogs with a previous anterior myocardial infarction developed VF in response to electrically induced left circumflex coronary artery injury. <b>Meobentine</b> (20 mg/kg) failed to prevent VF in eight of eight dogs. These results suggest that while <b>meobentine</b> sulfate significantly increases the electrical VFT, it does not protect the conscious canine from the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in response to PES, and it does not prevent VF in a conscious canine model of sudden coronary death. The data would suggest that <b>meobentine</b> will not be effective in preventing sudden death in patients with ischemic heart disease...|$|E
40|$|Glass microelectrodes {{were used}} to record transmembrane {{electrical}} activity from cells located just beneath the endocardial surface of segments of the right ventricular free wall of the rat heart during superfusion and electrical stimulation in vitro at 37 degrees C. The sulphates of bethanidine, <b>meobentine</b> or quinidine (4 to 20 microM) applied in vitro caused a prolongation of action potential duration and a delayed and slowed return of electrical excitability following an action potential. Intracardiac electrical stimulation of the urethane-anaesthetized rat heart in situ {{was used to measure}} ventricular refractory periods from the electrocardiogram. Intravenous administration of bethanidine, <b>meobentine</b> or quinidine (10 to 20 mg kg- 1) caused a prolongation of ventricular refractory periods. Quinidine had a briefer duration of action than either of the other two drugs tested. Urethane-anaesthetized open-chested rats which were subjected to left coronary artery occlusion displayed ventricular tachyarrhythmias in their electrocardiogram. These arrhythmias occurred during the period of occlusion and even more prominently after release of the occlusion. Intravenous administration of bethanidine, <b>meobentine</b> or quinidine (1 to 20 mg kg- 1) protected rats against these arrhythmias. The protective effect of quinidine was briefer than that of either of the other two drugs tested...|$|E
