(2010) used sheets fabricated from a single manufacturer (FRP system M) and (McGuirk and Breña 2012) used sheets from two different manufacturers (FRP systems F and S). Unidirectional carbon fiber sheets bonded formed by wet layup were used in all cases. The published tensile strength, rupture strain, and elastic modulus of a 1 -ply cured fiber-reinforced sheet from manufacturer M are 830  MPa, 1.67  %, and 49.3 GPa, respectively. Similarly the published tensile strength, rupture strain, and modulus of a 1 -ply cured sheet from <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> are 849  MPa, 70.5  GPa, and 1.12  %; and those for manufacturer F are 875  MPa, 72.4  GPa, and 1.2  %, respectively. These values are based on cured laminate thicknesses of 0.76  mm for manufacturer M, and 1  mm for <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> and F.|$|R

40|$|Schulz-Grobert {{argues that}} {{scholars}} 2 ̆ 7 {{pursuit of a}} phantom Low German original, and their 2 ̆ 2 fixation 2 ̆ 2 on Herman Bote as its author, have directed scholarly {{attention away from the}} role the editors in Strassburg played in its production. While TE scholarship to date is in agreement that a Strassburg editor had a hand in {{the final version of the}} book, Schulz-Grobert argues that the circle of humanists and literati associated with Grüninger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>press</b> in Strassburg were alone responsible for producing the book. There is no need to assume the existence of a Low German original, he states, nor does the 2 ̆ 2 ERMAN B 2 ̆ 2 acrostic, possibly a product of happenstance, necessarily point to Herman Bote 2 ̆ 7 s authorship. Schulz-Grobert prefers not to name a sole author of Till Eulenspiegel in Strassburg, but examines the circle of literati in Strassburg, including Geiler von Kaysersberg, Brant, Wimpheling, Bebel, Pauli, and Murner, and their ties to Grüninger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>press.</b> But he directs special attention to one of Grüninger 2 ̆ 7 s Korrektoren, Johannes Adelphus Muling. Well connected both to the Strassburg literati and to Gruninger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>press,</b> familiar as author and translator with the texts to which we find parallels in Till Eulenspiegel, Muling emerges in Schulz- Grobert 2 ̆ 7 s study as the key figure among the Strassburg 2 ̆ 2 fathers 2 ̆ 2 of Till Eulenspiegel. Possibly the most valuable part of this study is found in the lengthy appendix, where for each Historie the author has provided a catalogue of international literary parallels...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} at {{the workplace}} are often complicated and expensive. The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350. By taking the example of masonry and stone working machines, the empirically determined tool-related correction factor is checked and confirmed. Methods Vibration measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 5349 in practical application conditions on 10 selected typical eccentric and orbital sanders, concrete and disc grinders as well as on wall chasers and stone saws. Results The total vibration value obtained for the investigated tools rangedfrom ahv = 3. 6 m/s to ahv = 11. 6 m/s. When the values from the practical measurements are compared with the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> vibration values, the underestimation of the risk occurring in some cases can be largely compensated for by the tool-related factors conforming to CEN/TR 15350 (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

In particular, maximum wholesale margins, a restriction of pricing by the intermediary, and mandatory rebates, a restriction of the pricing by the manufacturer, are analyzed {{with respect to their}} effect on drug prices, quantities, and public pharmaceutical expenditure. Maximum wholesale margins enhance the <b>manufacturer</b> 4 <b>s</b> ability to reduce competition from parallel trade in the destination country by increasing wholesale prices. In a symmetric equilibrium, maximum wholesale margins of both countries partly offset each other. Mandatory rebates may be a policy alternative, as they exhibit a reinforcing effect with respect to drug prices...|$|R
