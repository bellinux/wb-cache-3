25|$|Infection. A <b>mycotic</b> {{aneurysm}} is an aneurysm {{that results}} from an infectious process that involves the arterial wall. A person with a <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm has a bacterial infection in the wall of an artery, resulting {{in the formation of}} an aneurysm. The most common locations include arteries in the abdomen, thigh, neck, and arm. A <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm can result in sepsis, or life-threatening bleeding if the aneurysm ruptures. Less than 3% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are <b>mycotic</b> aneurysms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{gingivitis}} is poor or ineffective oral hygiene, {{which leads to the}} accumulation of a <b>mycotic</b> [...] and bacterial matrix at the gum line, called dental plaque. Other contributors are poor nutrition and underlying medical issues such as diabetes. Diabetics must be meticulous with their homecare to control periodontal disease. [...] New finger prick tests have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and are being used in dental offices to identify and screen patients for possible contributory causes of gum disease, such as diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|Cats are {{reservoirs}} and {{are able}} to transmit <b>mycotic</b> infections. [...] Cats, especially kittens can pass on a Ringworm infection to people. Ringworm is a fungal disease and approximately 40 types of fungi can cause ringworm. They are typically of the Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton type. [...] It gets its name from the characteristic ring-like rash on the skin. The disease is spread by touching an infected cat. The rash may be scaly, reddened, and circular. Ringworm on the scalp usually makes a bald patch of scaly skin. Long-haired [...] cats do not always show signs of ringworm infection. Kittens with ringworm have patches that are hairless, circular, or irregularly shaped areas of scaling, crusting, and redness {{that may or may not}} be itchy. The area may not be completely hairless, and instead have brittle, broken hairs. If the claws are affected, they may have a whitish, opaque appearance with shredding of the claw's surface.|$|E

50|$|Hyalohyphomycosis is a {{group of}} {{opportunistic}} <b>mycotic</b> infections caused by nondematiaceous molds, and may be contrasted with phaeohyphomycosis.|$|E
50|$|Systemic <b>mycotic</b> (fungal) infections {{may also}} cause osteomyelitis. The two most common are Blastomyces dermatitidis and Coccidioides immitis.|$|E
50|$|An {{infectious}} intracranial aneurysm (IIA, {{also called}} <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm) is a cerebral aneurysm that {{is caused by}} infection of the cerebral arterial wall.|$|E
50|$|Intracranial <b>mycotic</b> aneurysms (ICMAs) complicate about 2% to 3% of infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) cases, although {{as many as}} 15% to 29% {{of patients}} with IE have neurologic symptoms.|$|E
50|$|An {{infected}} aneurysm (also {{known as}} <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm or microbial arteritis) is an aneurysm arising from bacterial {{infection of the}} arterial wall. It can be a common complication of the hematogenous spread of bacterial infection.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{mycosis fungoides}} has been {{divided into three}} stages: premycotic, <b>mycotic</b> and tumorous. The premycotic stage {{clinically}} presents as an erythematous (red), itchy, scaly lesion. Microscopic appearance is non-diagnostic and represented by chronic nonspecific dermatosis associated with psoriasiform changes in epidermis.|$|E
50|$|Phaeohyphomycosis is a {{heterogeneous}} group of <b>mycotic</b> infections caused by dematiaceous fungi whose morphologic characteristics in tissue include hyphae, yeast-like cells, {{or a combination}} of these. It can be associated an array of darkly-pigmented hyphomycetes including Alternaria species, Exophiala jeanselmei, and Rhinocladiella mackenziei.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "infected aneurysm," [...] {{proposed}} by Jarrett and associates is more appropriate, since few infections involve fungi. According to some authors, {{a more accurate}} term might have been endovascular infection or infective vasculitis, because <b>mycotic</b> aneurysms are not due to a fungal organism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mycotic</b> aneurysms {{account for}} 2.6% of aortic aneurysms. For the clinician, early {{diagnosis}} {{is the cornerstone}} of effective treatment. Without medical or surgical management, catastrophic hemorrhage or uncontrolled sepsis may occur. However, symptomatology is frequently nonspecific during the early stages, so a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Epizootic {{ulcerative}} syndrome (EUS), {{also known}} as <b>mycotic</b> granulomatosis (MG) or red spot disease (RSD), is a disease caused by the water mould Aphanomyces invadans. It infects many freshwater and brackish fish species in the Asia-Pacific region and Australia. The disease is most commonly seen when there are low temperature and heavy rainfall in tropical and sub-tropical waters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919 Castellani went to London as Consultant to the Ministry of Pensions. He became {{lecturer}} on mycology and <b>mycotic</b> diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, {{and established}} a consulting practice in Harley Street. He was knighted in 1928 as an Honorary [...] and in 1934 his daughter Jacqueline married Sir Miles Lampson.|$|E
5000|$|William Osler {{first used}} the term [...] "mycotic aneurysm" [...] in 1885 to {{describe}} a mushroom-shaped aneurysm in a patient with subacute bacterial endocarditis. This may create considerable confusion, since [...] "mycotic" [...] is typically used to define fungal infections. However, <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm is still used for all extracardiac or intracardiac aneurysms caused by infections, except for syphilitic aortitis.|$|E
50|$|Dermatophilus congolensis is a gram {{positive}} bacterium and is {{the cause}} of a disease called dermatophilosis (sometimes called mud fever) in animals and humans, a dermatologic condition that manifests itself with the formation of crusty scabs that contain the microorganism. Some people erroneously call it <b>mycotic</b> dermatitis. Rainscald is another condition often seen in animals, which is also caused by Dermatophilus congolensis bacteria.|$|E
50|$|In immunocompetent atopic individuals, 17% {{of those}} {{affected}} with allergic fungal sinusitis can develop orbital <b>mycotic</b> symptoms, where the fungus {{acts as an}} allergen causing allergic mucin. Pre-existing allergic fungal sinusitis, allergic conjunctivitis and use of soft contact lenses are risk factors for development of opthalomycosis. Typical therapy includes administration of natamycin and azoles such as intraconazol, fluconazol, posaconazole and voriconazole.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>mycotic</b> stage, infiltrative plaques {{appear and}} biopsy shows a polymorphous {{inflammatory}} infiltrate in the dermis that contains {{small numbers of}} frankly atypical lymphoid cells. These cells may line up individually along the epidermal basal layer. The latter finding if unaccompanied by spongiosis is highly suggestive of mycosis fungoides. In the tumorous stage a dense infiltrate of medium-sized lymphocytes with cerebroid nuclei expands the dermis.|$|E
50|$|Characteristic for {{idiopathic}} granulomatous mastitis are multinucleated giant {{cells and}} epithelioid histiocytes forming non-caseating granulomas around lobules. Often minor ductal and periductal inflammation is present. The lesion {{is in some}} cases very difficult to distinguish from breast cancer and other causes such as infections (tuberculosis, syphilis, corynebacterial infection, <b>mycotic</b> infection), autoimmune diseases (sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis), foreign body reaction and granulomatous reaction in a carcinoma must be excluded.|$|E
50|$|Otomycosis is a fungal ear infection, a {{superficial}} <b>mycotic</b> {{infection of the}} outer ear canal. It {{is more common in}} the tropical countries. The infection may be either subacute or acute and is characterized by malodorous discharge, inflammation, pruritus, scaling, and severe discomfort. Suppuration can occur due to superimposed bacterial infection commonly due to pseudomonas species and proteus species. The mycosis results in inflammation, superficial epithelial exfoliation, masses of debris containing hyphae, suppuration, and pain.|$|E
50|$|The program collaborates with {{partners}} at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Department of Agriculture-Food Safety Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration and related organizations. The program also {{works closely with}} CDCâ€™s Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and <b>Mycotic</b> Diseases to support state and local laboratories in Pulsenet, the national network of public health laboratories, food laboratories and regulatory agencies coordinated by the CDC that recognizes and identifies foodborne outbreaks as soon as possible.|$|E
50|$|Absidia is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Cunninghamellaceae. The best-known species is the {{pathogenic}} Absidia corymbifera, which causes zygomycosis, especially {{in the form of}} <b>mycotic</b> spontaneous abortion in cows. It can also cause mucormycosis in humans. It is an allergenic that could cause mucorosis in individuals with low immunity. It usually infects the lungs, nose, brain, eyesight and skin. Absidia spp. are ubiquitous in most environments. They are often associated with warm decaying plant matter, such as in compost heaps.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{described}} in Central Europe, the fungus {{has been found}} in the Middle East, Great Britain, North and South America, India, and Africa. It is usually found inhabiting soil or dead plant material , and in association with farm animals, such as cattle and horses, probably because it decomposes hay and grass. Infections in farm animals can cause death relatively quickly if not treated immediately. The fungus was described as a cause of <b>mycotic</b> abortion in cattle in Po Valley, Italy.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the appearance of spherical, brownish yellow cells with thick, darkly pigmented walls. The presence of the agent is associated with host cell proliferation and enlargement known as hyperplasia localized to the stratified squamous epithelium and the formation of <b>mycotic</b> granulomas. Sclerotic bodies are present both extracellularly and intracellularly throughout the affected tissue and are a defining feature of chromoblastomycosis. The melanin content of sclerotic bodies may be important in the establishment of host immune responses.|$|E
5000|$|Some sources equate it with [...] "Trichophyton mentagrophytes". As such, {{it is one}} {{of three}} common fungi which cause {{ringworm}} in companion animals. It is also the second-most commonly isolated fungus causing tinea infections in humans, and the most common or {{one of the most common}} fungi that cause zoonotic skin disease (i.e., transmission of <b>mycotic</b> skin disease from species to species). The fungus has a major natural reservoir in rodents, but can also infect pet rabbits, dogs, and horses.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{species may}} cause {{a range of}} {{opportunistic}} infections in humans. In humans with normal immune systems, fusarial infections may occur in the nails (onychomycosis) and in the cornea (keratomycosis or <b>mycotic</b> keratitis). [...] In humans whose immune systems are weakened in a particular way, (neutropenia, i.e., very low neutrophils count), aggressive fusarial infections penetrating the entire body and bloodstream (disseminated infections) {{may be caused by}} members of the Fusarium solani complex, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium proliferatum and, rarely, other fusarial species.|$|E
50|$|A. terreus {{can cause}} {{infection}} in animals, {{but it is}} contained to a few species such as dogs and cattle. Widely, A. terreus is found to cause <b>mycotic</b> abortion in cattle. In dogs, especially in the German Shepherd breed, this fungus is also responsible for sinusitis. It can further affect dogs through its dissemination. It can affect {{other parts of the}} body, including organs such as the spleen and kidneys. Also, the bone can be affected by A. terreus which could lead to spinal osteomyelitis.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to human nail dust {{is a serious}} occupational hazard that can be minimized by not producing such dust. Best practice is to avoid electrical debridement or burring of <b>mycotic</b> nails unless the treatment is necessary. [...] When the procedure is necessary, {{it is possible to}} reduce exposure by using nail dust extractors, local exhaust, good housekeeping techniques, personal protective equipment such as gloves, glasses or goggles, face shields, and an appropriately fitted disposable respirators to protect against the hazards of nail dust and flying debris.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{gingivitis}} is poor or ineffective oral hygiene, {{which leads to the}} accumulation of a <b>mycotic</b> [...] and bacterial matrix at the gum line, called dental plaque. Other contributors are poor nutrition and underlying medical issues such as diabetes. Diabetics must be meticulous with their homecare to control periodontal disease. [...] New finger prick tests have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, and are being used in dental offices to identify and screen patients for possible contributory causes of gum disease, such as diabetes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mycotic</b> {{keratitis}} and conjunctivitis {{are more}} commonly reported in tropical climates. Environmental {{factors such as}} wind, temperature, rainfall and humidity {{have been found to}} influence the ecology of filamentous fungi. In the Gulf of Mexico for example, increased numbers of airborne spores of C. lunatus during hot, humid months has been linked to increased clinical reports of keratitis. C. lunatus commonly infects the cornea, and orbit of the eye, and infection can result from trauma, surgery or dissemination from paranasal sinuses. Endophthalmitis can result from deep fungal keratitis caused by C. lunatus, where the Descemet's membrane is penetrated and compromised.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm, {{initially}} {{attributed to}} Osler {{and used to}} describe bacterial intracranial aneurysms, is a misnomer. Most investigators currently agree that its use should be strictly limited to descriptions of aneurysms of fungal origin. Yet efforts to establish an accurate nomenclature have been generally unsuccessful. Therefore, we are resigned {{to the fact that}} the term <b>mycotic</b> aneurysm will remain in general parlance. At the same time, we prefer the use of a more specific and accurate heading, namely, infected intracranial aneurysm, to include the categories of intracranial bacterial aneurysm, fungal aneurysm, spirochetal aneurysm, infested or amebic aneurysm, viral aneurysm and phytotic aneurysm, according to the specific infecting organism or agent. The terms infectious aneurysm and infective aneurysm are flawed because they imply that the aneurysm itself is the infecting agent rather than being the end point of an infecting process. Until such a pathogenesis has been detected, it is the intention of the authors to avoid catachresis and the application of archaic language(Marcus S, The George Delacorte Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Columbia University, New York, personal communicationa, l993: [...] " [...] The correct usage is 'infected'. The term 'infectious' died out as a usage in termed of infected in l726." [...] And Jost, DA, Former Senior Lexicographer of The American Heritage Dictionary, Boston, personal communication, l996:"Infectious aneurysm will be interpreted by most users of English as an aneurysm that can communicate infection").|$|E
