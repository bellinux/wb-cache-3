40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{simulation}} of a divided wall column (DWC) {{was carried out}} to study the product quality and energy efficiency {{as a function of}} reflux rate, liquid spilt and vapour split for the separation of C 4 -C 6 normal paraffin ternary mixture. Rigorous simulation of the DWC was carried out using <b>Multifrac</b> model of ASPEN Plus software. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used for the optimization of parameters and to evaluate the effects and interaction of the process parameters such as reflux rate (r), liquid split (l) and vapour split (v). It was found that the number of simulation runs reduced significantly for the optimization of DWC by BBD. Optimization by BBD under response surface methodology (RSM) vividly underscores interactions between variables and their effects. The predictions agree well with the results of the rigorous simulation...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been achieved {{in the description of}} natural variability, largely due to the widespread use of scale-invariant concepts such as fractals and multifractals. In particular, this last concept has been used to clarify the fuzzy notion of `inhomogeneity' by introducing and quantifying the effects of intermittency. In this paper, we present a more comprehensive approach to multifractal data analysis and simulation that includes and combines the currently popular singularity analysis techniques with the more traditional approach based on structure functions. Being related to the new idea of `multi-affinity,' these last statistics are regaining favor and constitute the proper framework {{to address the problem of}} quantifying and qualifying yet another out-standing fuzzy notion, that of `non-stationarity. ' This is an important step because non-stationary behavior is ubiquitous in Nature. Using turbulence as an example, we also show how a unified <b>multifrac</b> [...] ...|$|E
