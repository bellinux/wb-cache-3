5|$|American Express {{had been}} in discussions to {{potentially}} live stream Lady Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event.

5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement,</b> in which case some kind of random choice is often employed.

A distributed solution will allow for embedding based only on <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements.</b> Moreover, in a distributed market there will be no single-point-of-failure or no opportunity for a monopolistic authority (e.g., the broker).|$|R

5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England {{was a way}} of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage by <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest.

Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's kit {{has been}} {{manufactured}} by Nike since July 2017. Previously, the kit was manufactured by Adidas, which was originally contracted {{to supply the}} club's kit from 2006 to 2018.

5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because {{the law does not}} apply such wording.

5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement.</b> They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E

5|$|While the production's lawyers {{worked to}} clarify its legal {{standing}} in the Summer of 2005, it emerged that Humbert Balsan's deeply indebted production company Ognon Pictures had pledged all rights to the production to Coficiné in exchange for loans. With production in legal stasis and faced with a lengthy court battle to recover the rights, the producers agreed to a settlement with Ognon's bankruptcy officer. In the meantime, the French partners Mezzanine Film declared their uncomfortableness with {{the scale of the}} production, and after <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> with the producers, left the project on September 5, 2005. After meeting with the producers and their new French partner, Paul Saadoun of 13 Production, Coficiné consented to completing the film. On February 6, 2006, Tarr and producer Gábor Téni issued a press release which documented at length the developments with the troubled production to that date, and expressed their hope and intent to persevere in completing the film. Tarr duly restarted shooting in March 2006, after a year of inactivity. The filmmakers dedicated The Man from London to their late colleague Humbert Balsan.|$|E
5|$|Larwood {{continued}} to play for Nottinghamshire for several more seasons, with considerable success: 82 wickets at 17.25 in 1934, 102 at 22.70 in 1935 and in 1936, his benefit season, 119at 12.97. The 18-year-old future Test batsman Denis Compton, in his second county match for Middlesex, faced Larwood in June 1936; he later recorded that Larwood and Voce were the most accurate fast bowlers he ever faced, and that Larwood was the fastest. The benefit season yielded the then county record sum of £2,098. In the English winter of 1936–37, while an MCC team led by Allen toured Australia, Larwood took a coaching job in India. The climate and the food disagreed with him, and he returned home early. His bowling achievements in 1937 were modest: 70 wickets at 24.57. Larwood's relations with Nottinghamshire had steadily deteriorated since Carr's dismissal from the captaincy in 1934; his foot problem returned, and was aggravated by a cartilage injury to his left knee. In 1938, after a few matches, he left the county by <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> and retired from first-class cricket. In his first-class career he took 1,427 wickets at 17.51, and scored 7,290 runs at 19.91 including three centuries. In Tests he took 78 wickets at 28.35 and scored 485 runs at 19.40.|$|E
