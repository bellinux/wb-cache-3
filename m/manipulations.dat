40|$|A self report {{emotional}} <b>manipulation</b> {{scale was}} completed by 121 participants, who also completed a tactics of <b>manipulation</b> scale and a personality measure. A subset of the group (thirty three participants) also completed a re-test of the emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale. Factor analysis of the emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale suggested a one or three factor structure. Examination of the three factor structure showed that the original factor structure had not been replicated. Instead a one factor solution was decided upon; a general emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor. Factor analysis of the tactics of <b>manipulation</b> scale suggested {{that three of the}} six tactics of <b>manipulation</b> proposed by Buss, Gomes, Higgins & Lauterbach (1987) had been replicated. Correlations between the general emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor and the original six tactics of <b>manipulation</b> found significant correlations with all of the tactics of <b>manipulation</b> {{with the exception of the}} reason tactic. These results show the general emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor has adequate reliability. Correlations between the first testing of the emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale and the re-test were found to be significant, suggesting good reliability. It was found that both the emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale and the general emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor had strong correlations between the first testing and re-test; this suggests that the emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale and general emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor have strong reliability. Personality traits were found to correlate with both emotional <b>manipulation</b> and tactics of <b>manipulation.</b> Surprisingly, Neuroticism did not correlate with any of the <b>manipulation</b> scale, this goes against previous findings. The emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale was found to correlate positively with Conscientiousness and negatively with Openness. Agreeableness was the one personality trait that correlated significantly with the tactics of <b>manipulation</b> in the current study and with the findings in previous studies by Buss (1987, 1992). Agreeableness was found to correlate negatively with coercion and silent treatment and positively with reason. This was replicated in the current study. Additional testing found a number of significant gender differences in the use of emotional <b>manipulation,</b> tactics of <b>manipulation</b> and personality traits. Significant gender differences were found for tactics of <b>manipulation</b> and personality traits. Females scored significantly higher on the emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor and for three of the six tactics of <b>manipulation.</b> Males were found to score significantly higher on the coercion tactic alone. Males scored lower on Agreeableness, which correlates with Austin et al (2007) findings. However, they also scored lower on Neuroticism. Overall, the results indicated that the factor structure of the emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale is unclear and requires further research; however the validity and reliability of the general emotional <b>manipulation</b> factor and emotional <b>manipulation</b> scale seem more secure...|$|R

40|$|Graspless <b>manipulation</b> is to {{manipulate}} objects without grasping. That includes pushing, tumbling, pivoting, {{and so on}} (Fig. 1). Graspless <b>manipulation</b> enables robots {{to manipulate}} objects with smaller load and enhances their dexterity. However, we have difficulties in planning of robot motion for graspless <b>manipulation.</b> In planning of graspless <b>manipulation,</b> {{we have to consider}} mechanics in addition to geometry, because motion of the manipulated object depends on mechanical conditions such as friction. Moreover, a robot may be able to push an object but {{may not be able to}} pull it because of the unilateral nature of contact forces. The irreversibility of <b>manipulation</b> caused by mechanics makes planning more difficult. We have developed an algorithm to plan general graspless <b>manipulation</b> by robot fingers and a theory of mechanics required for the <b>manipulation</b> planning.

40|$|Results from {{a number}} of studies have shown an inverse {{relationship}} between stereotypic behavior and object <b>manipulation.</b> The purposes of this study were to determine whether techniques similar to those used previously (prompting and reinforcement) would be effective in increasing object <b>manipulation</b> under both prompted and unprompted conditions, and to ascertain whether increases in object <b>manipulation</b> would result in decreases in stereotypic self-injurious behavior (SIB). Two individuals with developmental disabilities who engaged in SIB maintained by automatic reinforcement participated. Results showed that object <b>manipulation</b> increased from baseline levels when experimenters prompted participants to manipulate leisure items, but that object <b>manipulation</b> was not maintained under unprompted conditions, and rates of SIB stayed within baseline levels. We then attempted to increase object <b>manipulation</b> further by (a) reinforcing object <b>manipulation,</b> (b) blocking SIB while reinforcing <b>manipulation,</b> and (c) preventing SIB by applying protective equipment while reinforcing object <b>manipulation.</b> Reinforcing object <b>manipulation</b> alone did not affect levels of object <b>manipulation.</b> Blocking effectively reduced attempts to engage in SIB for 1 participant but produced no increase in object <b>manipulation.</b> When the 2 nd participant was prevented from engaging in SIB through the use of protective equipment, rates of object <b>manipulation</b> increased dramatically but were not maintained when the equipment was removed. These results suggest that stimulation derived from object <b>manipulation,</b> even when supplemented with arbitrary reinforcement, may not compete with stimulation produced by stereotypic SIB; therefore, direct interventions to reduce SIB are required...|$|R
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical <b>manipulations</b> of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene {{silencing}} {{process that is}} controlled by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's cytoplasm, where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory <b>manipulations),</b> the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC.|$|E
