Presently, the high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> of the collider is beginning commissioning.

40|$|The main design {{features}} of the PEP-II asymmetric two-ring electron-positron B Factory collider, built at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, are described. This facility will complete construction in June 1998. The high <b>energy</b> <b>ring,</b> completed in May 1997, has had 3 months of commissioning and successfully stored 0. 75 A of electrons. The success of the high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> testing validates not only its ring components, but also the injection system, the RF system and the control system {{all of which are}} common to the two rings. ...|$|R
40|$|The linear optics of {{both the}} high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> (HER) and low <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> (LER) for SLAC’s PEP-II B-Factory were {{characterized}} with two algorithms: analysis of the mea-sured closed orbit response matrix and analysis of betatron phase advance measurements. The results of the two anal-yses were in good agreement. When the HER was first run in a low optics in autumn 1997, the measured functions showed more than a factor of two discrepancy from the de-sign. The source of the optics distortion was diagnosed and corrected using these methods. ...|$|R

40|$|We congratulate Kou, Zhou and Wong {{for making}} a {{fundamental}} contribution to MCMC. Our discussion consists of two parts. First, we ask several questions about the EE-sampler. Then we review a data-driven MCMC scheme for solving computer vision problems. 1. Questions. To simplify the language, we use π(x) to denote a distribution we want to sample from, and q(x) to denote a distribution at a higher temperature (with energy truncation). The distributions π(x) and q(x) {{can be understood as}} two consecutive levels in the EE-sampler. Suppose we have obtained a sample from q(x) by running a Markov chain (with a burn-in period), and let us call the sampled states q-states. Suppose we have also formed the <b>energy</b> <b>rings</b> by grouping these q-states. Now consider sampling from π(x) by the EE-sampler. 1. In the jump step, can we make the chain jump to a q-state outside the intended <b>energy</b> <b>ring?</b> For example, can we simply propose to jump to any random q-states, as if performing the Metropolized independent sampler [2] with q(x) as the proposal distribution? Without restricting the jump to the intended <b>energy</b> <b>ring,</b> {{it is possible that the}} chain jumps to a q-state of a higher energy level than the current state, but it is also possible that it lands on a lower-energy q-state. If the energy of the current state is very low, we may not have any q-states in the corresponding <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> to make the EE jump. But if we do not restrict the chain to the current <b>energy</b> <b>ring,</b> it may jump to a higher-energy q-state and escape the local mode. The reason we ask this question is that the power of the EE-sampler seems to come from its reuse of the q-states, or the long memory of the chain, instead of the EE feature. Received November 2005. This is an electronic reprint of the original article published by th...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the beam position monitor system built for PEP-II, the B-factory at SLAC. The system reports beam position for bunches of between 5 × 10 8 and 8 × 10 10 electron charges, either singly or as continuous streams of bunches every 4. 2 ns. Resolution at full charge {{is to be}} better than 10 microns in a single turn. Higher resolution is available via on-board multi-turn averaging. The position signal is processed in a 20 MHz bandwidth around 952 MHz. This bandwidth, rather broader than that typical of RF position monitors, allows good resolution for low charge single bunches. Additional novel features include stringent control of return losses in order to minimize cross-talk between nearby bunches which may contain very different charges. The digitizing electronics is multiplexed between the two PEP-II storage rings. Design, construction, and installation experience, as well as first results with beam are presented. 1 PEP-II The PEP-II B-Factory 1 is based on colliding e+ and e-beams stored in two rings operating at different energies. Currently the high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> is nearly complete; the low <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> will be installed later this year. Both rings will contain up to 1658 bunches of electrons or positrons. The high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> will store currents up to 1 Amp, while the low <b>energy</b> <b>ring,</b> to be installed later this year, will operate to 3 Amps. The machine is to operate as a factory, meaning that the machine is expected to be colliding efficiently a large fraction of the time; sufficient diagnostics must be available to keep it running optimally...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{luminosity}} of the Fermilab Tevatron protonantiproton collider {{in the post}} Main-Injector era, the most straightforward approach {{is to increase the}} intensity of the antiproton beam. A number of schemes based on fixed <b>energy</b> storage <b>rings</b> have been suggested to accomplish this goal. A fixed <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> can be used to accumulate freshly produced antiprotons and/or to recycle used antiprotons at the end a store. For reasons of cost and reliability, permanent magnets are strong contenders for the magnet assemblies, with ceramic ferrite the material of choice. Since ferrite magnetization has a relatively large temperature coefficient, temperature considerations are very important. In this paper, we investigate the expected temperature environment for a fixed <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> at Fermilab, the required temperature stability and possible methods of compensating temperature dependent effects.

40|$|A {{single-pass}} beam position monitor (SPBPM) {{was developed}} for measuring of the injection beam orbit of the KEK B-factory (KEKB), and 21 sets have already been installed. We adopted log-ratio processing using a logarithmic (log) amplifier for the SPBPM of KEKB. The measurement circuit consists of four log-amplifiers, four peak-hold circuits, four analog-digital converters (ADC), a memory circuit and a timing control circuit. Moreover, it coexists with the existing beam position monitor (BPM) system for a closed-orbit distortion (COD) measurement. In order to choose the BPM signal of the low <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> (LER) and the high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> (HER) of KEKB, an RF signal switch circuit was also manufactured.

40|$|A {{broadband}} coax-waveguide transition for {{the high}} power test of the PEP-II RF cavity HOM waveguides has been studied. The design requirements are {{that it must have}} a VSWR less than 2 over the frequency range 714 MHz to 2500 MHz and transmit 10 kW average power from a 250 mm * 25. 4 mm rectangular waveguide to a 50 Ohm coaxial line.

40|$|The PEP 2 (e+) (e-) storage rings contain many complex interrelated systems. When {{the beam}} aborts, {{examining}} {{a record of}} the orbit from the time just before the abort can help identify the root cause. At the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) a system has been developed to continuously record beam orbits from Beam Position Monitors (BPMS) into a circular buffer. When the beam is aborted the buffers are frozen and their contents are stored for later analysis. BPM orbits are saved on a turn by turn basis for 2800 turns in both the high <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> (HER) and the low <b>energy</b> <b>ring</b> (LER). Each BPM Processor (BPMP) can either monitor the HER or the LER, but not both as the readout of the two rings is multiplexed into a single readout channel. Tools exist as part of the SLAC Control Program (SCP) to collect, display, and save the data. A physicist or operator can choose a few BPMS in which to view all 2800 turns to identify the turn in which the beam went awry; then ask for that specific orbit from all of the BPMS in the storage ring to determine the root cause of the abort...|$|R
