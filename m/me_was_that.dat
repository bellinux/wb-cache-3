500|$|Despite {{his short}} career in politics, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr {{in the gay}} community. In 2002, Milk was called [...] "the most famous and most {{significantly}} open LGBT official ever elected in the United States". Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: [...] "What set Harvey apart from you or <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us." [...] Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Creation of a 3D effect {{required}} the design team {{to use an}} assortment of low-poly meshes, or 3D geometric models. Using a variety of animation and special effects techniques, these images were later superimposed [...] "with painstaking care" [...] to avoid a sterile, digitized look. Clair said, [...] "The most crucial thing to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this didn't feel digital, {{so we went to}} great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible." [...] For some stills, the design team created digital doubles to develop more texture. The sequence's final cut was polished using optical glitching and motion distortion techniques. The Sydney Morning Herald included the opening sequence in a list of ten of the best title sequences on television.|$|E
500|$|Hertzler {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he based his character on the role played by Morgan Freeman in the film The Shawshank Redemption (1994). He said that [...] "Freeman plays a lifer. A guy that's been a lifer in prison has a different attitude toward life and death." [...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating thing for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet. I didn't get any of that. I was in a skintight rubber suit. Had I been 23, I would have been much happier, but at 49?" ...|$|E

500|$|Cannon {{was awarded}} the Heisman Trophy as the nation's most {{outstanding}} player in 1959. He had 598 rushing yards, and although he scored only six touchdowns in total, his performance on Halloween night and his defensive play throughout the season was enough to convince voters. [...] "The thing that clinched the Heisman for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I made a play or two in a big game", he later explained. He received the award from Vice President Richard Nixon during a ceremony on December 9 at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. Cannon was the second player from the SEC to win the trophy, following Georgia's Frank Sinkwich in 1942. He received {{more than five times}} as many first-place votes as the runner-up. Cannon was also a repeat winner of nearly every award he won the previous season, including unanimous All-America recognition. Shortly after the 1959 season, the LSU football team retired Cannon's number 20 jersey. It was the only jersey retired by the team until Tommy Casanova's was also retired in 2009.|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing he said to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie {{in his head and}} really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Tomlinson {{signed a}} four-month {{contract}} with Burton Albion, having previously been on trial at Preston North End. He joined the [...] "Brewers" [...] after manager Gary Rowett was {{dissatisfied with the}} performances of Ross Atkins and Dean Lyness. After keeping a clean sheet on his debut, in a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Spotland on 8 September, assistant manager Kevin Summerfield said that [...] "the biggest difference for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we were playing the game in their half and they were defending corners because he [...] can kick the ball so far up the pitch". He was aiming for a longer stay at the Pirelli Stadium, but a knee injury sustained in a home draw with former club Port Vale left him sidelined {{for up to six}} months. He recovered to full fitness in half that time, and signed a new contract in February to extend his stay at Burton until summer 2014. Burton reached the play-offs {{at the end of the}} 2012–13 season, but were defeated 5–4 by Bradford City at the semi-final stage. Tomlinson retired in July 2013 after surgeons advised him that scar tissue damage and a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament meant that his left knee was in poor shape and was vulnerable to further damage.|$|E

500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E
2500|$|San Diego Republican mayor Jerry Sanders testified how he transitioned from {{believing that}} {{domestic}} partnership was an ideal compromise to believing that same-sex marriage was fundamental. [...] "What hit <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I had been prejudiced", he explained. During cross-examination, {{he agreed with}} the defendants that not all {{people who voted for}} Proposition 8 were [...] "bigots", but that he believed their vote was [...] "grounded in prejudice".|$|E
2500|$|In summer 1923, in Siberia Lunacharsky {{was still}} {{speaking}} of Mayakovsky's poem {{with the greatest}} enthusiasm, praising it as [...] "the huge phenomena." [...] "What struck <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Anatoly Vasilyevich quoted several fragments of it by heart, without having a written copy, having heard the poem just once… As the poem came out as a separate book, he recited it in full {{to a group of}} close friends. Yury Mikhaylovich Yuryev said he [...] "discovered" [...] for him Mayakovsky whom he's 'never understood before'," [...] Lunacharskaya-Rosenel remembered.|$|E

2500|$|James D. Watson {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a {{businessman}} descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of Irish parents from Tipperary. Raised Catholic, he later described himself as [...] "an escapee from the Catholic religion." [...] Watson said, [...] "The luckiest {{thing that ever happened}} to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my father didn't believe in God." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Rubin said, [...] "Ultimately {{it became}} this weird {{political}} issue {{because if you}} asked the studio, 'How long was the repetition?', they'd say, 'Two weeks'.

A hundred years. A lifetime." [...] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.|$|E
2500|$|... "Steve and Ronnie went to America to see Clive Davis of Arista Records. They played him the tape. Clive Davis was {{tapping his}} foot and tapping his very {{expensive}} pen on his very expensive desk. He said [...] "Yeah, that's great man". Steve said [...] "So you like the tape, Clive". Steve then stopped the tape, ejected it and said [...] "WELL YOU CAN'T FUCKING HAVE IT!" [...] The story that Steve told <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it would have meant touring and Ronnie just wasn't up to it. It would have meant pretty much carrying him everywhere, no tour, no album. That's why the Mijits never came out {{at that point in}} time. It's been gathering dust for ages" [...] – Jim Leverton.|$|E

2500|$|Sigsworth {{created a}} demo backing track that was [...] "{{finished}} enough to impress, {{but not so}} finished as to restrict Madonna's freedom to write {{over the top of}} it." [...] According to him, [...] "'What It Feels Like For a Girl' was done very quickly. 'I sent her a backing track, and she wrote a top line to it, we put it together and four days later we had a record. And what was kind of good for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we decided on day one that we liked all the noises I'd already used on the demo, and it was more a matter of repositioning them in the arrangement around M's top line. So the whole job, apart from recording the voice, was moving things around in Pro Tools", he claimed. He remarked that he sent her two sketches and that she chose the more unusual one. [...] "And at the start of it, I put this sample from a movie of the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. I just knew that M would fall in love with that, and she did", he declared.|$|E
2500|$|Seemingly finding {{parenting}} difficult, Henry Sr. mostly bonded {{with his}} son through their mutual fascination with history. After {{the death of his}} wife Anna from influenza, the gulf between father and son grew {{to the point where they}} rarely spoke. Henry claims that he taught his son [...] "self reliance" [...] this way, while Indiana felt that his father simply cared more about his intellectual pursuits than he did about his own son, saying [...] "What you taught <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I was less important to you than some people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country." [...] To Indiana's constant exasperation, Henry refers to his son only as [...] "Junior" [...] (ironically, Indiana does the same thing to his own son), until the end of The Last Crusade when he finally calls him [...] "Indiana". As he was not a hands-on father, Indiana resented his father's aloof, distant nature, which may have influenced his own inability to settle down and start a family for much of his life, and also resented his father's lifelong pursuit of the quest for the Holy Grail. When Henry explains that the search for the Grail is [...] "a race against evil", Indy lashes out at him: [...] "This is an obsession, Dad! I never understood it! Never!" [...] Because of aloofness as a father, Indy embraced his father's friend Marcus Brody as a father figure and role model. Another factor which deteriorated Indiana and Henry's relationship was Indiana going off to enlist in the Belgian Army for World War I in 1916 without his father's consent, and the two went three years without seeing each other.|$|E
