40|$|An {{electroplating}} fabrication {{method has}} been used since 1962 for S-band frequency electron accelerating structures in Japan. The electrical contact between disk and cylinder, and the vacuum integrity are maintained by an electroplated copper layer 5 mm thick, without any <b>metal</b> <b>brazing.</b> The typical integrated phase error after plating was kept below ± 2 ° without any frequency tuning. The mechanical straightness was within ± 100 µm over the 2 m length of the S-band accelerating structure. Since this method does not require any high-temperature processes, such as the <b>metal</b> <b>brazing</b> commonly used for accelerator fabrication, the copper material does not crystallize and maintains a higher tensile strength. That makes this method very attractive for fabrication of the high-performance structures which will be required in various future projects, and especially for e+e- linear colliders. ...|$|E

Practical {{applications}} of metal/ceramic joints {{can be found}} in the biomedical field regarding the encapsulation of implantable telemetric devices, the fabrication of crowns and bridges for dental restoration, or in the production of drug delivery systems, biomedical sensors and electrodes.

Results show that the corrosion behaviour, of the whole interface was strongly influenced by the chemical composition of its constitutive layers. Thus, layers containing high contents of both titanium and silver showed a polarisation resistance increase with the immersion time, as a result of the formation of a thermodynamically stable passive film. On the other hand, the copper rich layer, appears to be the main responsible for the interface degradation. In fact, for high immersion times, an instable passive film is formed and, as a consequence, large amounts of copper are released.
