40|$|In {{the real}} work the {{solution}} of a problem of determination of parameters of the radio impulse reflected from an ionosphere is considered. The noise component, and also the multibeam structure of a signal arising at formation two <b>magnetoionic</b> <b>component</b> is thus considered.

40|$|A new {{ionogram}} algorithm, {{which is}} highly successful in generating robust and sharp digital ionograms free of artefacts and processing noise, is presented. An {{important feature of}} the algorithm is the distortionless zooming capability, which allows the user to concentrate only on the desired <b>magnetoionic</b> <b>components</b> of the ionogram...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for a numerical inversion method to calculate electron density profiles from ionograms are discussed. A systematic investigation about {{the independence of}} the two <b>magnetoionic</b> <b>components</b> shows that {{the extent to which the}} range of ambiguity can be reduced depends mainly on the magnetic latitude. Error estimates and first-order corrections for less elaborate methods are included...|$|R
40|$|Standard digital ionograms {{that are}} {{generated}} by fast Fourier transform or autoregressive modeling suffer from high interference levels due to other {{users of the}} HF channel which produce artifacts and distortion, hence complicating automatic processing and information extraction. In this paper, a new method is proposed to obtain high-quality ionograms of the desired layer reflections and automatically extract important information such as critical frequencies. Following the standard procedures, two sets of periodograms are obtained by using rectangular and Blackman windows. These two periodograms are filtered and fused utilizing an automatic edge-detection-based time-frequency detector. The fused ionogram provides sharp description of the layer reflections with very low sidelobe structure (ringing). The performance of this new ionogram algorithm is tested using chirp sounder data collected from an oblique midlatitude path. It is observed that the presented algorithm is highly successful in obtaining robust and sharp ionograms free of artifacts. Furthermore, a new algorithm is proposed for automated computation of dispersion and critical frequencies of the <b>magnetoionic</b> <b>components</b> detected on the ionogram. Since efficient signal-processing algorithms are utilized, the proposed method can be implemented in real time...|$|R
