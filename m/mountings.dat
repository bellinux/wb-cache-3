5|$|Sydney was {{initially}} armed with thirty Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns: eighteen single <b>mountings</b> and six twin <b>mountings.</b> During her refit as a troop transport, the carrier's armament {{was reduced to}} four single Bofors.|$|E
5|$|During the 1967–1969 refit, {{thirteen}} Bofors were removed, leaving four twin {{and four}} single <b>mountings.</b> The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 landing aid radar. A TACAN aerial and electronic countermeasures pods were also installed during this refit. The four Bofors twin <b>mountings</b> were removed in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Storm 3 {{reconnaissance}} and patrol model {{allows for}} extra stowage of fuel, water and equipment. This version is especially suited to be fitted with various machine gun or special equipment <b>mountings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ships' 37mm 83-calibre {{guns were}} twin mounted {{and placed in}} the superstructure. The mounts were {{hand-operated}} and automatically stabilised for roll and pitch. These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000rounds of ammunition. Bismarck and Tirpitz were initially armed with twelve 20mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time. Bismarck received a pair of quadruple gun <b>mountings,</b> for a total of twenty 20mm guns. Over the course of her career, Tirpitzs 20mm battery was increased to 78 guns in single and quadruple <b>mountings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{table of}} sword <b>mountings</b> differentiates between Sword type and Mounting type; {{includes}} a {{column on the}} employed Design and material; and lists the Overall length as the mounting {{in addition to the}} sword's length.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes initial {{armament}} included 25 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns: six twin and thirteen single <b>mountings.</b> The radar suite {{consisted of}} three Type 277Q height-finding sets, a Type 293Q surface search set, and a Type 978 navigational set. Between entering service and 1959, four of the single Bofors were removed.|$|E
5|$|The turrets {{were placed}} on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, Caesar and Illustrious, had {{circular}} barbettes. The BII <b>mountings</b> {{in the first six}} ships allowed all-around loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from the magazines, as the ammunition hoists did not rotate with the turret. Caesar and Illustrious, with their circular barbettes, had BIII <b>mountings</b> with rotating hoists, and these allowed all-around loading from the magazines. Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from 5degrees to 13.5degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During World War I, four of the Majestics were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight s. A further two turrets from Illustrious were later emplaced as coastal guns on the Tyne.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine <b>mountings,</b> with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun <b>mountings</b> were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun <b>mountings</b> (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword <b>mountings</b> of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the {{tradition}} of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable <b>mountings</b> for tachi. Along the edge of both the {{scabbard}} and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension <b>mountings.</b> Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales was {{originally}} named King Edward VIII but upon the abdication of Edward VIII {{the ship was}} renamed even before she had been laid down. This occurred at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, {{although it was not}} until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun <b>mountings</b> caused delays in her outfitting.|$|E
5|$|Swords are {{included}} in the crafts category, and either the sword itself or a sword mounting is designated as a National Treasure. Currently 110 swords and 12 sword <b>mountings</b> are National Treasures. The oldest designated properties date to the seventh century (Asuka period). However, 86 of the items are from the Kamakura period, with the most recent object from the Muromachi period. The designated items are located in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, museums, and private collections.|$|E
5|$|The Bayern-class battleships {{were armed}} with a main battery of eight 38cm (15in) SK L/45 guns in four Drh LC/1913 twin gun turrets. These turrets could train 150degrees {{to either side of}} the centerline, and their guns could depress to −8degrees. As the Germans thought that {{conditions}} in the North Sea would dictate short-range actions, the guns initially could elevate only to 16degrees, which allowed a maximum range of 20,400m. The gun <b>mountings</b> were modified to allow elevation up to 20degrees, increasing the range to 23,200m.|$|E
5|$|The Norse-American medal {{is not a}} coin, and is {{not legal}} tender. Due to its {{similarity}} to a coin, {{and the fact that}} it was authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series. Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the silver-plated one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in <b>mountings</b> to the fair, and display damage or wear.|$|E
5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Bristol {{class was}} two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were {{mounted on the}} centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist <b>mountings.</b> All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} was again torpedoed in August 1942, her 1.1-inch gun mounts were {{replaced}} by {{an equal number of}} quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts while she was under repair at Pearl Harbor. Her light anti-aircraft armament was also increased to 52 Oerlikon guns at the same time. In January 1944 a number of her 20mm guns were replaced by more Bofors guns, many of which were in the positions formerly occupied by the ship's boats in the sides of the hull. Saratoga mounted 23 quadruple and two twin 40mm <b>mountings</b> as well as 16 Oerlikon guns when she completed her refit.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on <b>mountings</b> raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword <b>mountings</b> became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
5|$|Indianas keel {{was laid}} on 20 September 1939 at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia. She was {{launched}} on 21 November 1941; during the fitting out process, the former battleship , {{which had been}} rebuilt as a crane ship, lowered the 16-inch guns into their turret <b>mountings.</b> Indiana was commissioned into the fleet on 30 April 1942. After shakedown operations, she was sent directly to the Solomon Islands; Indiana arrived off Guadalcanal on 9 November 1942 and replaced her sister South Dakota, which {{was in need of}} repairs. Indianas operations off Guadalcanal consisted primarily of shore bombardment in support of the Marines fighting on the island.|$|E
5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM <b>mountings</b> and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about {{half the cost of}} a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as <b>mountings</b> for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 1944, Captain Parham {{handed over}} command of HMS Belfast to Captain R M Dick, and until April 1945 Belfast {{underwent}} a refit {{to prepare for}} service against Japan in the Far East which improved her accommodation for tropical conditions, and updated her anti-aircraft armament and fire control in order to counter expected kamikaze attacks by Japanese aircraft. By May 1945, Belfast mounted thirty-six 2-pounder guns in two eight-gun mounts, four quadruple mounts, and four single mounts. She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons. Her two aftmost 4-inch <b>mountings</b> were removed, and the remainder fitted with Remote Power Control. Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult was removed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{propulsion}} problems included excessive motor vibrations {{at certain}} speeds which damaged various components (which {{was attributed to}} the removal of a flywheel and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in Collins at high speed (found {{to be caused by}} manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The propulsion system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator <b>mountings,</b> and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these <b>mountings</b> {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Ansons of No. 16 Group's No. 500 Squadron {{was fitted}} out with extra armour plating and side <b>mountings</b> for {{defensive}} guns. A free mounted 20mm {{was installed in}} the lower fuselage to offer protection. Though no evidence exists to indicate it was a success, crews appreciated the extra security. The British Cannon Manufacturing Company, impressed with the innovation, built a specialised mount for it. They began operations along with Fairey Battles of No. 12 Squadron RAF and No. 142 Squadron RAF, Bomber Command, operating from Eastchurch. Some conversions were made; No. 217 switched to Beauforts in May 1940, but still operated some Anson aircraft, and No. 502 received the Whitley in October 1940, a bitter disappointment for its crews.|$|E
5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Bristol {{class was}} two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were {{mounted on the}} centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist <b>mountings.</b> All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size by the Royal Navy, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.|$|E
5|$|To assist its weapon {{systems in}} hitting their target, Furious was {{completed}} with one fire-control system for each side, with separate directors for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally {{controlled by a}} Dreyer Fire-Control Table on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors. The existing fire-control directors were removed when Furious received her new dual-purpose 4-inch <b>mountings</b> in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the pom-poms, were mounted {{on top of the}} new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over {{the course of the war}} Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a Type 290 air-search radar.|$|E
5|$|After Jutland, Deutschland and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned to picket duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, Deutschland had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft <b>mountings</b> were installed.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun <b>mountings</b> fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E
5|$|Authorized to be {{built by}} Ansaldo of Genoa, the new battleship's keel was laid down on 14 May 1938 and {{launched}} on 15 November 1939. At her launching, she was christened Impero, after Italy's empire in Africa. With Genoa being in bombing range of France, and war now a definite possibility, Impero was moved to Brindisi on 8 June 1940 due to fears of French attack. Trieste was considered a better location, but Roma was fitting out there and the shipyard could not handle two battleships at one time. While at Brindisi, some of her machinery was installed, along with parts of her smaller caliber weaponry. Despite the intent to move Impero to a safer location, Brindisi was still hit by Allied bombers, though Impero was not damaged. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to shift production priorities to desperately needed escorts for merchant convoys. As a result, construction of Impero was delayed to expedite those ships. The only work done was the fitting of the engines and some gun <b>mountings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Navarin, {{named after}} the Battle of Navarino, was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco-Russian Works and {{construction}} began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891. She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out, but did not enter service until June 1896 {{at a cost of}} over nine million rubles. Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of armor plates, the gun <b>mountings,</b> and other components, compounded by inefficiencies in building. One example of such was that the Russian armor plate company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness, but the builder somehow lost track of this fact and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was located}} on the Kinburn Spit, at the extreme western end of the Kinburn Peninsula, and consisted of three separate fortifications. The primary fort, built of stone, square, and equipped with bastions, held 50guns, {{some of which were}} mounted in protective casemates; the rest were in en barbette <b>mountings,</b> firing over the parapets. Two smaller fortresses were located further down the spit, mounting ten and eleven guns, respectively. The first was a small stone fort, while the second was a simple sand earthwork. The forts were armed only with medium and smaller caliber guns, the largest guns being 24-pounders. Major General Maxim Kokhanovitch commanded the garrison of 1,500men, most of whom were stationed in the main fort. Across the estuary was Fort Nikolaev in the town of Ochakov with fifteen more guns, but these were too far away {{to play a role in}} the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} armament of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A {{hit from}} a light gun {{could not be}} relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate <b>mountings</b> of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only sure way to protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack {{was to provide a}} destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I the secondary armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide field of fire and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, the secondary guns were seen as {{a major part of the}} anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, dual-purpose guns increasingly adopted.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{had only}} {{relatively}} thin crenelated walls, which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments. They {{were lined with}} many tall towers for archers, but {{could not be used}} to mount cannon. Don Luis Bravo de Acuña, the governor of Gibraltar, produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory's fortifications. A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall, each named after saints, and a New Mole (later renamed the South Mole) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour. On the north side of Gibraltar, the Muralla de San Bernando (now the Grand Battery) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions. The Old Mole, stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar, provided further <b>mountings</b> for cannon to sweep the isthmus. A series of defensive works constructed on a glacis above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire. A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Señora del Rosario ("Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary"), and now as the South Bastion, it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa, now the Southport Gates. However, the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide enough troops to man them.|$|E
