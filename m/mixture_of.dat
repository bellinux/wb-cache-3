5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a <b>mixture</b> <b>of,</b> those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal.

Most elements have a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that nest depredation by olfactory-searching mammals greatly influences the reproductive success of ground-nesting birds.

In this study we show experimentally that an olfactory-searching dog had greater difficulty detecting <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> the less volatile diesters than <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> monoesters.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new {{methodology}} for maximum likelihood estimation in <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> non linear mixed effects models (NLMEM). Such <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> models include <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> distributions, <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> structural models and <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> residual error models. Since the individual parameters inside the NLMEM are not observed, we propose {{to combine the}} EM algorithm usually used for mixtures models when the mixture structure concerns an observed variable, with the Stochastic Approximation EM (SAEM) algorithm, which {{is known to be}} suitable for maximum likelihood estimation in NLMEM and also has nice theoretical properties. The main advantage of this hybrid procedure is to avoid a simulation step of unknown group labels required by a â€ fullâ€ version of SAEM. The resulting MSAEM (Mixture SAEM) algorithm is now implemented in the Monolix software. Several criteria for classification of subjects and estimation of individual parameters are also proposed. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that MSAEM performs well in a general framework <b>of</b> <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> NLMEM. Indeed, MSAEM provides an estimator close to the maximum likelihood estimator in very few iterations and is robust with regard to initialization. An application to pharmacokinetic (PK) data demonstrates the potential of the method for practical applications...|$|R

Equimolar <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> egg lecithin and lysolecithin formed the more usual smectic, concentric lamellae (liposomes) and elongated rod-like micelles which might be bimolecular fragments of spherules.
