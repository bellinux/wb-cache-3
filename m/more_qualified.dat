5|$|Eccles is the ninth-most densely {{populated}} ward in Salford, {{and has the}} highest number and proportion of people aged 75and over of all wards in Salford. Levels of crime are below the average for the city. The adult population tends to be <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> than the city average, and primary and secondary education results are also slightly higher than average for Salford. Unemployment is below average, with people tending to work longer hours. More residents live in purpose-built and converted flats than do in {{the city as a}} whole, with a minority occupying detached houses or bungalows.

5|$|New York allows electoral fusion, {{which is}} an {{arrangement}} allowing two or <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> parties to list the same candidate on a ballot. The Conservative Party chose to cross-endorse Tedisco on February 9, while the Working Families Party gave its endorsement to Murphy on February 17. On March 1, the Independence Party, the largest third party in the 20th district, gave its endorsement to Murphy. This {{was the first time}} the Independence Party had endorsed a Democrat in the district.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of <b>more</b> <b>qualified,</b> skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a designer was given the role when <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> staff members were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
25|$|This {{story was}} proved {{at least partly}} correct, when it was {{announced}} by the BCB that Fountain had indeed, joined the coaching & support staff of the Bangladesh Team. Kleusener finally turned down the role of bowling coach, which was then awarded to the highly acclaimed, and significantly <b>more</b> <b>qualified,</b> Ian Pont.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} eight {{spots for}} the nationals were {{awarded to the}} top finishers in the regional qualifiers and challenge rounds. Five teams qualified from the qualifiers round, where each qualified site received one or <b>more</b> <b>qualifying</b> spots. The other three spots went to {{the winners of the}} challenge round.|$|R
25|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the divisional structure {{is that it}} can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may increase costs by requiring <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than organizational goals which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel.|$|E
25|$|The Dalai Lama, Kalu Rinpoche, {{and others}} have stated that the public {{exposition}} of this tantra is necessary in the current degenerate age.

25|$|All {{candidates}} for examination face {{a panel of}} examiners. A larger, <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> panel is usually assembled to assess the higher dan grades. Kendo examinations typically consist of jitsugi, {{a demonstration of the}} skill of the applicants, Nihon Kendo Kata and a written exam. The eighth-dan kendo exam is extremely difficult, with a reported pass rate of less than 1 percent.|$|E

50|$|The lower two tiers (Groups B and C) were formalized, {{so there}} would be no <b>more</b> <b>qualifying</b> tournaments with {{promotion}} and relegation taking places between these two tournaments as well. West Germany won all their games to return to the top level of competition while Great Britain went winless and was replaced by Group C winner Italy.|$|R
25|$|Both Modern Orthodoxy and , the {{movement}} directly descended from Hirsch's Frankfurt community, have combined Torah and secular knowledge with participation in contemporary western life, and thus some maintain {{that there is}} a degree of practical and philosophical overlap between the two. The movements are nevertheless distinct, and in general, Neo-Orthodoxy has taken a <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> approach than Modern orthodoxy, emphasizing that followers must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{successful}} applicants {{enter the}} Canadian Military College (CMC) System as an Officer Cadet, where they receive an education that balances academics, leadership, bilingualism and athletics. If there are <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> candidates than the CMC System can accommodate or {{the choice of}} programme is not offered, such as Nursing, Physiotherapy and Pharmacy, successful applicants would be eligible to apply to any Canadian university where books, laboratory fees, and student fees are covered, and students receive a monthly salary.|$|E
25|$|After Admiral Darlan's assassination, Giraud {{became his}} de facto {{successor}} in French Africa with Allied support. This occurred {{through a series}} of consultations between Giraud and de Gaulle. The latter wanted to pursue a political position in France and agreed to have Giraud as commander in chief, as the <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> military person of the two. It is questionable that he ordered that many French resistance leaders who had helped Eisenhower's troops be arrested, without any protest by Roosevelt's representative, Robert Murphy.|$|E

25|$|Furius Victorinus, {{one of the}} two praetorian prefects, {{was sent}} with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, Marcus Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and Marcus Iallius Bassus, and a {{detachment}} of the Praetorian Guard. Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs. Moreover, he was far <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> than his praetorian partner, Cornelius Repentinus, who was said to owe his office to the influence of Pius' mistress Galeria Lysistrate. Repentius had the rank of a senator, but no real access to senatorial circleshis was merely a decorative title. Since a prefect had to accompany the Guard, Victorinus was the clear choice.|$|E
25|$|After Admiral Darlan's assassination, Henri Giraud {{became his}} de facto {{successor}} in French Africa with Allied support. This occurred {{through a series}} of consultations between Giraud and de Gaulle. De Gaulle wanted to pursue a political position in France and agreed to have Giraud as commander-in-chief, as the <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> military person of the two. Later, the Americans sent Jean Monnet to counsel Giraud and to press him to repeal the Vichy laws. After difficult negotiations, Giraud agreed to suppress the racist laws, and to liberate Vichy prisoners from the South Algerian concentration camps. The Cremieux decree, which granted French citizenship to Jews in Algeria and which had been repealed by Vichy, was immediately restored by General de Gaulle.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin {{said in a}} 2006 {{interview}} with The New York Times {{that if he did}} become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for Governor of New York. When asked if he was qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> than California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In June 2011, The Daily reported that Baldwin was mulling over a 2013 run for Mayor of New York City {{in the wake of a}} potential early race shake-up after candidate Congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal. However, on December 21, 2011, Baldwin said he was abandoning plans to run for the office and would instead continue in his role on 30 Rock.|$|E

25|$|The Finns did not {{pay much}} {{attention}} to the living conditions of the Soviet POWs {{at the beginning of the}} war, as the war was expected to be of short duration. The quantity and quality of camp personnel was very low, as the <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> men were at the front. It was not until the middle of 1942 that the quantity and quality of camp personnel was improved. There was a shortage of labour in Finland and authorities assigned POWs to forest and agricultural work, as well as the construction of fortification lines. Some Soviet officers cooperated with the Finnish authorities and were released from prison by the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|The KKB then {{experienced}} a tremendous growth: {{as an independent}} organization, {{they were able to}} ask for financial support from a greater variety of institutions; furthermore, many members and patrons contributed to the improved financial situation, allowing them, for example, to hire <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers. Public relations were enormously strengthened and improved, and the choir got a logo by holding a public competition. In the summer of 1973, their first concert tour took place in the Bernese Oberland and their first record, a collection of choral and organ works by Felix Mendelssohn, was made. In 1974, a tour of the Netherlands followed {{with the help of the}} organist Hans Peter Aeschlimann, and the KKB became a supporting member of the Gesellschaft für das Gute und Gemeinnützige Basel ("Society for a Good and Charitable Basel"). Their first television appearances took place in 1975 and 1976 on Südwestrundfunk.|$|E
25|$|With the {{enactment}} of the 1991 Local Government Code, municipalities and cities have both become more empowered to deal with local issues. Regular municipalities now share many of the same powers and responsibilities as chartered cities, but its citizens and/or leaders may feel that it might be to their best interest to get a larger share of internal revenue allotment (IRA) and acquire additional powers by becoming a city, especially if the population has greatly increased and local economy has become more robust. On the other hand, due to the higher property taxes that would be imposed after cityhood, many citizens have become wary of their town's conversion into a city, even if the municipality had already achieved a high degree of urbanization and has an annual income that already exceeds that of many existing lower-income cities. This has been among the cases made against the cityhood bids of many high-income and populous municipalities surrounding Metro Manila, most notably Bacoor and Dasmariñas (which finally became cities in June 2012 and November 2009 respectively), which for many years have been <b>more</b> <b>qualified</b> to become cities than others.|$|E
