5|$|In the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers {{guarding}} {{their children}} from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work as slaves in the mine, never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the <b>mine,</b> <b>the</b> team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately crashing into the <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables.|$|E
5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt <b>Mine,</b> <b>the</b> last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a <b>mine,</b> <b>the</b> pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
25|$|During the lead-up to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Lehi <b>mined</b> <b>the</b> Cairo–Haifa train several times. On 29 February 1948, Lehi <b>mined</b> <b>the</b> train {{north of}} Rehovot, killing 28 British {{soldiers}} and wounding 35.

In addition, parts of the story take place by the ocean and in a fictitious mountain range.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} Waterfall Gully has been {{extensively}} logged, and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation {{of a variety of}} introduced species as crops, along with the development of local market gardens and nurseries. Attempts to <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> area were largely unsuccessful, but the region housed one of the state's earliest water-powered mills, and a weir erected in the early 1880s provided for part of the City of Burnside's water supply. Today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} of Mine All <b>Mine,</b> <b>the</b> BBC commissioned Davies to produce the revival of Doctor Who, which completed his decade-long quest to return the series to the airwaves. At the time, he was developing two scripts: the first, a cinematic adaptation of the Charles Ingram-Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? scandal, was cancelled after he accepted the Doctor Who job; and the second, a dramatisation {{of the life of}} the Venetian adventurer and lover Giacomo Casanova, was his next show with Red Productions.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Amelanchier alnifolia by <b>mining</b> <b>the</b> {{leaves of}} their host plant. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> has <b>the</b> {{form of a}} tentiform <b>mine</b> on <b>the</b> {{underside}} the leaf. The epidermis is loosened and much wrinkled, pale brownish and speckled.|$|R
50|$|After the fire, in 1985, <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> {{was divided}} into two {{separate}} <b>mines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> workings on <b>the</b> {{west side of the}} fire seals became <b>the</b> Cottonwood <b>Mine</b> (MSHA ID No. 42-01944).|$|R
50|$|Using {{the first}} cylinder, Newgass checked <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> and {{prepared}} {{his plan to}} defuse the device.

5|$|The Greystone {{campus is}} {{situated}} {{in and around the}} Greystone Cellars building, which William Bowers Bourn II conceived as a business concept. His father, William Bowers Bourn Sr., was wealthy from ownership of the gold <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> Empire Mine, as well as co-ownership of a shipping company. Bourn II was a businessman with business interests and residences around California, although he had spent his summers during his youth at White Sulphur Springs Resort in St. Helena, before his parents bought Madroño, an estate in the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{colliery}} {{became known}} as the Bradford Colliery Company, and by 1896 employed 404 underground and 125 surface workers producing house coal and coal for manufacturing from the Parker <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> high price of coal {{at the end of the}} 19th century persuaded the newly created Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association to mitigate the effects on its members by purchasing the colliery in 1900, thus ensuring a cheap supply of fuel for their steam-powered mills.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Osterath-Dortmund Süd railway of the Rhenish Railway Company, which connected {{to a number of}} coal <b>mines,</b> <b>the</b> Duisburg-Quakenbrück line had few connections to <b>mining</b> railways. <b>The</b> <b>mines</b> were <b>the</b> Jacobi and Franz Haniel pits in Oberhausen-Klosterhardt and the Osterfeld colliery.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is <b>the</b> deepest {{base metal}} <b>mine</b> in <b>the</b> world. The maximum depth of 10300 ft and its northerly {{latitude}} {{mean that the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is <b>the</b> closest accessible point to {{the centre of the}} Earth.|$|R
5|$|There {{was still}} enough mining {{to keep the}} railroads busy, but not for long. In 1897 the Midland went bankrupt. It {{continued}} operating, and a new company formed under the same name to take over. In 1919 Smuggler <b>Mine,</b> <b>the</b> city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. Its tracks and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{entered the}} harbor at Espirtu Santo's western entrance, leading the cargo ship SSNira Luckenbach, unaware they had entered a {{minefield}} laid earlier by US Navy minelayers. After striking {{at least one}} <b>mine,</b> <b>the</b> destroyer was almost torn in two at the No.1 stack, killing {{all three of the}} crew in the forward fireroom. The rest of the crew survived but Tucker did not. The destroyer slowly settled in the water and sank. An investigation revealed that Tucker had been given no information about the existence of the minefield.|$|E
5|$|Two Israeli sappers {{were sent}} to <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> area of the {{quarantine}} station, but {{did not know that}} it was already under Syrian control. Their vehicle was blown up, but they managed to escape alive. On the same day, the Syrian company that attacked the water station from Tel ad-Dweir proceeded towards Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. Its advance was halted by the village residents as well as a platoon of reinforcements armed with 20 mm cannons. The company retreated to its position and commenced artillery fire on the two kibbutzim.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{continued}} to operate until November 1984, supplying coal to the Toowoomba Hospital. When <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> structures were bought by Kath and John Greenhalgh, {{the owners of}} the farm on which <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> was located. <b>The</b> Greenhalghs kept <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> intact and opened it as a museum. In 2000, when the Greenhalghs decided to retire from the land, they sold <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to <b>the</b> Rosalie Shire Council. It ceased to operate as a museum from that time.|$|R
50|$|The MN-111 is a Polish air-dropped {{anti-tank}} landmine. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> {{is designed}} for use on soft ground. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is cylindrical with six spring-loaded fins attached to one end of <b>the</b> <b>mine,</b> with <b>the</b> cylinder drawn to a point {{at the opposite end}} which is topped with a small wind vane. <b>The</b> <b>mine</b> is stored with the fins wrapped round the outside of <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is dropped from the aircraft the fins spring outward, acting as a drag parachute, slowing the rate of descent to a peak speed of about 60 meters per second. As <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> drops <b>the</b> wind vane spins, generating the power used to arm <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012 Cape Lambert Resources {{decided to}} sell <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> In 2013 Cape Lambert {{requested}} a <b>mining</b> license for <b>the</b> <b>mine.</b> At <b>the</b> moment (August 2014) <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> is still available for sale.|$|R
5|$|A {{few large}} {{deposits}} produce or produced {{a significant amount}} of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare-earth element oxides, the largest known deposit. The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare-earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.|$|E
5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from serious poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb (in From Russia, with Love) the MI6 agent James Bond is sent by his superior, M, on an undemanding {{mission to the}} British colony of Jamaica. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in Kingston, and his secretary. Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a guano <b>mine.</b> <b>The</b> island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American National Audubon Society, two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.|$|E

5|$|After {{she entered}} service, Feth-i Bülendwas sent to Crete {{to assist in}} {{stabilizing}} the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869, but the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive during this period. Both ships saw extensive use during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they operated against Russian forces in the Black Sea. They were primarily occupied with bombarding Russian coastal positions in support of the Ottoman army in the Caucasus. They also supported an amphibious assault on the port of Sokhumi in May 1877. On 23 July, Feth-i Bülend engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action that left both vessels lightly damaged before Vesta escaped. By this time, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had been transferred to Sulina at the mouth of the Danube to assist in the defense of the port; in November, she and several other ironclads disrupted a Russian attempt to <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> outer harbor.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30, French forces reached al-'Azma's headquarters, {{unhindered}} by {{the mines}} laid en route by the Syrians. Little information {{is known about}} the battle from the Syrian side. According to one version, when French forces were about 100 meters in the distance, al-'Azma rushed to a Syrian artilleryman stationed near him and demanded him to open fire. However, before any shells could be fired, a French tank unit spotted al-'Azma and gunned him down by machine gun. In another account, al-'Azma had attempted to <b>mine</b> <b>the</b> trenches as the French forces approached his position, but was shot down by the French before he could set off the charges. Al-'Azma's death marked the end of the battle, although intermittent clashes continued until 13:30. Surviving Syrian fighters were bombed from the air and harried by the French as they retreated toward Damascus.|$|E
