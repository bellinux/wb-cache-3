A few of the stops are connected with railway stations, as the SKM tracks are paralleled by tracks used by long distance and regional trains. At these stations, high platforms have been built for SKM trains. Over 90% of stops are connected with other transport services (both buses and trams, or trolley buses in Gdynia). For major stops, the timetables of the two services are synchronized, especially for night connections. The company <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> effort to keep passengers well informed. Informational tables, lists of fares and timetables are changed {{as soon as the}} previous is out of date or destroyed (which unfortunately occurs quite often).|$|E
25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to {{be made aware of}} this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E

The Xbox version was also awarded the October [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award. Roper dismissed notions that the game was simply a Grand Theft Auto clone, arguing instead that it advanced the genre; [...] "much of Scarface is based on what we've seen in Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it's fairly obvious that Radical used said series as the blueprint {{and then went back}} and re-evaluated its shortcomings. The result {{is that we have a}} game that fixes many of GTAs problematic elements." [...] He praised the basic gameplay, the storyline, the balls meter, rage mode, and the aiming system. Although he was somewhat critical of the map, arguing too many areas in the game are accessible via only one road, he concluded [...] "there are a whole lot of little things about Scarface that make it fun, but it's the sum of its parts that make it the overall great game that it is. It does a whole lot to fix many of the problems with other games in the genre, and it does an absolutely fantastic job of bringing the world of Scarface to gamers." [...] Mark Bozon and Chris Roper scored the Wii version 8.5 out of 10, also giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award, and writing [...] "Scarface is a very impressive game, and while there isn't a ton of Wii-specific additions to the package, everything that was added <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> difference." [...] Praising the controls, they wrote [...] "it's amazingly easy to target enemies and blow off specific body parts in the process."
