40|$|Abstract—Priority {{is usually}} given to {{handover}} traffic in mobile communication {{but doing so}} has the tendency of increasing call blocking probability. It was said previously that non-prioritized call traffic channel assignment scheme reduces call blocking probability more than other basic channel assignment schemes at high handover traffic intensities. A comparison of channel assignment schemes by analysis and MATLAB simulation in this {{research has shown that}} dynamic guard channel assignment scheme based on channel utilization minimizes call blocking probability better than non-prioritized, prioritized guard channel and prioritized guard channel with queue/buffer. The wireless technology used was Mobile WiMAX with <b>mobile</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>handover</b> (MAHO) and the queueing policy employed was M/M/C/Q with FCFS service discipline...|$|E
40|$|In {{cellular}} communication, {{guard channel}} {{has been used}} to provide priority to ongoing call traffic crossing cell boundaries in handover process but the major concern is that most guard channel allocation scheme are fixed channels. System congestion problems arising from traffic pattern in the real world is another major concern relating to fixed allocation of guard channels let alone the huge traffic that will emanate from user mobility in the envisaged converged traffic of 4 G networks. Hence, dynamic guard channel (DGC) allocation based on traffic intensity or channel utilization of each traffic type was used in this research and it reduced the new call blocking probability better than the fixed prioritized guard channel (PGC) and non-prioritized channel allocation scheme. Its performance in terms of call dropping probability reduction is comparable with the PGC and slightly better off at poor signal condition. It was revealed that DGC averaged QoS better than the existing channel assignment schemes. An investigation into the RSS quality factor (QF) proposed also, showed that at high quality RSS the blocking and dropping probability of the traffic were reduced for the Mobile WiMAX wireless technology network with <b>mobile</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>handover...</b>|$|E

Information between vehicles and infrastructures can be exchanged either using ITS-G 5 or cellular communications.

A hardware-in-the-loop driving simulator has been utilized to test the transmission of vehicle data. Performance measurements of the {{communication between}} vehicles and infrastructure have been made for both ITS-G 5 and LTE.

Numerical results are provided to compare our proposed scheme with the current existing ones.
