5|$|Aggressive <b>mimicry</b> {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive <b>mimicry,</b> {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive <b>mimicry</b> includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian <b>mimicry</b> both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive <b>mimicry</b> is the lesser known Mertensian <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian <b>mimicry,</b> where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive <b>mimicry,</b> the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} <b>mimicry</b> is Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> discovered by and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian <b>mimicry</b> both model and mimic are aposematic, so <b>mimicry</b> may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a <b>mimicry</b> ring.|$|E
5|$|Batesian <b>mimicry</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of <b>mimicry</b> complexes, such that the word <b>mimicry</b> is often treated as synonymous with Batesian <b>mimicry.</b> There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of <b>mimicry.</b> Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive <b>mimicry,</b> where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E
5|$|Batesian <b>mimicry</b> {{need not}} involve visual <b>mimicry,</b> but can employ {{deception}} {{of any of}} the senses. While visual signals have attracted most study, some moths mimic the ultrasound warning signals sent by unpalatable moths to bat predators, constituting auditory Batesian <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Host-parasite <b>mimicry</b> is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with <b>mimicry</b> of the female sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite <b>mimicry</b> has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive <b>mimicry</b> Kirbyan <b>mimicry,</b> after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive <b>mimicry</b> {{occurs when}} {{the actions of the}} dupe {{directly}} aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward they seem to offer. Other forms of <b>mimicry</b> have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian <b>mimicry</b> involving seeds, and brood parasitism, which can also involve aggressive <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian <b>mimicry</b> {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian <b>mimicry,</b> the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian <b>mimicry</b> is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive <b>mimicry</b> {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of <b>mimicry,</b> the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite <b>mimicry</b> is treated here as a subclass of aggressive <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} <b>mimicry,</b> there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use <b>mimicry</b> to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most <b>mimicry</b> in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through <b>mimicry.</b> For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is <b>mimicry.</b> A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian <b>mimicry</b> complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a <b>mimicry</b> complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the <b>mimicry</b> by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian <b>mimicry.</b> In Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant <b>mimicry</b> (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian <b>mimicry,</b> a form of <b>mimicry</b> seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of <b>mimicry</b> complexes of Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Batesian <b>mimicry</b> {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian <b>mimicry</b> stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. <b>Mimicry</b> need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective <b>mimicry,</b> the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 12 Protective <b>Mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gilbertian <b>mimicry</b> {{involves}} {{only two}} species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by mimicking it, {{the reverse of}} host-parasite aggressive <b>mimicry.</b> It was coined by Pasteur as a phrase for such rare <b>mimicry</b> systems, and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mimicry</b> {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many harmless {{species such as}} hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian <b>mimicry</b> rings, all resembling each other. <b>Mimicry</b> between prey species and their predators often involves three or more species.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>mimicry</b> is imperfect. Natural {{selection}} drives <b>mimicry</b> only {{far enough}} to deceive predators. For example, when predators avoid a mimic that imperfectly resembles a coral snake, the mimic is sufficiently protected.|$|E
5|$|With their {{powerful}} stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are {{the models}} for {{many species of}} mimic. Two common cases are Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic is harmless and is essentially bluffing, and Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic is also distasteful, and the <b>mimicry</b> can be considered mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include many species of hoverfly and the wasp beetle. Many species of wasp are involved in Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> as are many species of bee.|$|E
5|$|A second form of <b>mimicry</b> {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of <b>mimicry</b> is known as Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> after Fritz Müller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. Müllerian <b>mimicry</b> is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive <b>mimicry</b> {{is a form}} of <b>mimicry</b> {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian <b>mimicry</b> (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular <b>mimicry,</b> which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive <b>mimicry</b> is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive <b>mimicry,</b> where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most <b>mimicry</b> complexes.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian <b>mimicry,</b> {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive <b>mimicry</b> may not be readily apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Batesian <b>mimicry</b> {{is a form}} of <b>mimicry</b> where a {{harmless}} species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> where a {{harmless}} mimic poses as harmful.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 13 Protective and Aggressive <b>Mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Host-{{parasite}} <b>mimicry</b> is a {{two species}} system where a parasite mimics its own host. Cuckoos are a canonical example of brood parasitism, {{a form of}} kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, cutting down the biological mother's parental investment in the process. The ability to lay eggs that mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation. The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so-called gentes (gens, singular). Cases of intraspecific brood parasitism, where a female lays in conspecific's nest, {{as illustrated by the}} goldeneye duck (Bucephala clangula), do not represent a case of <b>mimicry.</b> Another example is that of chemical <b>mimicry,</b> in which the parasitic butterfly Phengaris rebeli, which parasitizes the ant species Myrmica schencki by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae, and enable the P. rebeli larvae to be brought directly into the M. schencki nest. Parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees (formerly Psithyrus, now included in Bombus) resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common. However, this is explainable as Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> rather than requiring the parasite's coloration to deceive the host and thus constitute aggressive <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> a palatable, {{harmless}} prey species {{mimics the}} appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack. This form of <b>mimicry</b> is seen in many insects. The idea behind Batesian <b>mimicry</b> is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colors and markings, including Batesian mimics. Some species of octopus can mimic a selection of other animals by changing their skin color, skin pattern and body motion. When a damselfish attacks an octopus, the octopus mimics a banded sea-snake. The model chosen varies with the octopus's predator and habitat. Most of these octopuses use Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> selecting an organism repulsive to predators as a model.|$|E
5|$|In {{imperfect}} Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> the mimics do {{not exactly}} resemble their models. Many reasons {{have been suggested}} for this.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves <b>mimicry</b> of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal <b>mimicry</b> it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved <b>mimicry</b> as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E
5|$|Kin {{selection}} may enforce poor <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like Bakerian <b>mimicry,</b> Dodsonian <b>mimicry</b> {{is a form}} of {{reproductive}} floral <b>mimicry,</b> but the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though. For example, a lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.|$|E
5|$|Mertensian <b>mimicry,</b> where {{a deadly}} mimic resembles a less harmful but lesson-teaching model.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mimicry</b> systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} bipolar. Only one bipolar arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian <b>mimicry</b> after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the model is the prey species. In the second case, the model {{is the host of}} a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> {{where two}} or more harmful species {{mutually}} advertise themselves as harmful.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, <b>mimicry</b> and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian <b>mimicry,</b> wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian <b>mimicry,</b> inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E
5|$|Some {{carnivorous}} plants {{may also}} be able to increase their rate of capture through <b>mimicry.</b>|$|E
