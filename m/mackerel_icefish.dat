Data on the frequency and size structure of <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua from 1991 to 2002 were used to examine trophic interactions involving this species and to evaluate the potential impact of predators on its population. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> occurred in 10 to 20 % of scats from Antarctic fur seals and comprised 48 % of the diet by mass of gentoo penguins.

The length-frequency distributions of <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> indicated a dominant mode at 130 to 180 mm total length (the 1 + age class), with apparent strong cohorts entering the population in 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001.

40|$|Abstract. —Preservation of {{ecosystem}} structure is the guiding principle {{by which the}} Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) endeavors to manage the harvests of living resources of the Southern Ocean (with the notable exception of marine mammals). The experiences of CCAMLR {{with regard to fisheries}} on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> Champhsocephalus gunnari and Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides are reviewed. The unifying paradigm employed by CCAMLR is the application of a precautionary approach, which explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the analysis of risk of exceeding defined management criteria. Each fishery, however, presents a unique set of circumstances and unresolved concerns. While the current fishery for krill is small compared to the precautionary limit established by CCAMLR, fishing effort concentrated near colonies of land-breeding krill predators may pose a threat in addition to those posed by the broader-scale influence of climatic cycles and trends on krill production.

40|$|Target {{identification}} {{remains a}} challenge for acoustic surveys of marine fauna. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are typically identified {{through a combination of}} expert scrutiny of echograms and analysis of differences in mean volume backscattering strengths (SV; dB re 1 m− 1) measured at two or more echosounder frequencies. For commonly used frequencies, however, the differences for krill are similar to those for many co-occurring fish species that do not possess swimbladders. At South Georgia, South Atlantic, one species in particular, <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish,</b> Champsocephalus gunnari, forms pelagic aggregations, which can be difficult to distinguish acoustically from large krill layers. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> are currently surveyed using bottom-trawls, but the resultant estimates of abundance may be biased because of the species' semi-pelagic distribution. An acoustic estimate of the pelagic component of the population could indicate the magnitude of this bias, but first a reliable target identification method is required. To address this, random forests (RFs) were generated using acoustic and net sample data collected during surveys. The final RF classified as krill, icefish, and mixed aggregations of weak scattering fish species with an overall estimated accuracy of 95 %. Minimum SV, mean aggregation depth (m), mean distance from the seabed (m), and geographic positional data were most important to the accuracy of the RF. Time-of-day and the difference between SV at 120 kHz (SV 120) and that at 38 kHz (SV 38) were also important. The RF classification resulted in significantly higher estimates of backscatter apportioned to krill when compared with widely applied identification methods based on fixed and variable ranges of SV 120 –SV 38. These results suggest that krill density is underestimated when those SV-differencing methods are used for target identification. RFs are an objective means for target identification and could enhance the utility of incidentally collected acoustic data...|$|E
40|$|The <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari) is a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} coastal fish fauna of the Seasonal Pack-Ice Zone and the islands north of it. Separated {{into a number of}} stocks, its distribution ranges from the Scotia Arc region, namely South Georgia, in the Atlantic Ocean sector to the Kerguelen-Heard Plateau in the Indian Ocean sector. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> have been heavily exploited {{since the beginning of the}} 1970 s with reported annual catches exceeding 50 – 100, 000 tonnes in some years. C. gunnari has many characteristics typical of Antarctic fish species with respect to life history characteristics, such as egg size, fecundity and growth. These fall well within the range of other sympatric red-blooded notothenioids; eggs are large and yolky. Egg diameter, egg production per gram body weight and growth performance at South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands was comparable with similar-sized nototheniids and channichthyids. Stocks of C. gunnari have a number of biological characteristics in common, such as feeding mode and food, early life history and growth in the first years of life. However, stocks in sub-Antarctic waters differ in reproductive characteristics, such as length and age at first spawning, natural mortality and life expectancy from those on more southerly grounds. They may grow to more than 60 cm and may become 13 – 15 yrs old. However, in the vicinity of South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands, fish apparently do not exhaust this growth potential fully. Their ability to reproduce at an early age coupled with a comparatively high fecundity and growth performance may mean stocks of C. gunnari in sub-antarctic waters have far more resilience and a greater capacity to rebuild than species with the slower reproductive rates common in other notothenioids...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Cllanzpsocephal[gsz rnnnvi) are {{widespread}} on the South Georgia shelf, Antarctica, {{and have}} been fished commercially since the early 1970 s.

The index is likely to be little affected by the reproductive cycle unless there is high krill availability during the months around the spawning time, and even then the effect is much less than the highest observed values. The condition index responds rapidly to changes in krill density and therefore can provide indications of short-term variations in krill availability. Condition index provides a useful proxy for krill density and is likely to be of considerable value in interpreting the results from ecosystein assessments such as that in progress under the auspices of CCAMLR...|$|E

Some spawning almost certainly occurs over much of the island shelf, althougl th is appears to be at a very much lower intensity than inshore. There is some evidence of spawning at Shag Rocks. There are also indications of a possible second spawning season in January, although the evidence is weak. Concentrations of larval icefish within Cumberland Bay are an order of magnitude higher than in adjacent coastal waters and their density declines exponentially offshore. All this evidence indicates that the most important spawning locations are within the bays...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid {{analysis}} was used to study the trophic ecology of 10 demersal fish species in the South Georgia region. Principal component analysis grouped the species into three general clusters, revealing resource partitioning between species. Two groups were characterised by large proportions of either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, separating species according to their predominant feeding habitat. The third group showed fatty acid signatures overlapping with either or both of the previous two groups, suggesting a more opportunistic feeding behaviour for these species. Intraspecific comparisons furthermore revealed dietary variability with size, year and geographical location in several species. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari) in particular showed inter-annual differences in muscle lipid concentrations closely linked to prey availability with low lipid contents found in years of low krill (Euphausia superba) abundance.

40|$|Wide-ranging, surface-feeding pelagic seabirds are {{the most}} {{numerous}} functional group of birds in the Southern Ocean. The mesoscale habitat use of these birds is increasingly being quantified by relating their movements to remotely sensed, near surface properties of the ocean. However, prey availability at the sea surface may also be determined by habitat characteristics not measurable from space. For instance, benthic-pelagic coupling, which occurs when seabed processes affect productivity in the epipelagic zone, can link benthic habitat type to availability of surface prey. We combined acoustically derived maps of the substrate of the South Georgia shelf with GPS tracking to quantify the sub-mesoscale habitat use of breeding black-browed albatrosses. We show that albatrosses preferentially used waters overlaying glacial moraine banks near the shelf edge {{and that this was}} unrelated to the presence of trawlers targeting <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish,</b> which are also associated with these features. Stomach temperature profiles suggest that albatrosses primarily caught krill and fish over the banks. We hypothesize that black-browed albatrosses target waters overlaying moraine banks due to upward benthic-pelagic coupling, mediated by an increase in abundance of zooplankton such as Antarctic krill. Our findings suggest that the potential effects of such processes on pelagic seabird distribution warrant wider investigation...|$|E

The <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari Lönnberg 1905), which feeds mainly on krill, was the most important fish species in terms of absolute frequency (53 %), frequency of occurrence (69 %) and estimated biomass (47 %); fur seals may {{have a significant impact on}} local stocks of this species. Cephalopods and pelagic fish (myctophids) were of minor importance in the diet (< 2 %).

40|$|Ontogenetic, inter-annual and {{regional}} variations in diet were investigated for <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish,</b> Champsocephalus gunnari, in three successive summer seasons around South Georgia. Stomach contents from 2239 C. gunnari (130 - 560 mm total length) were examined. A bootstrapping technique {{was used to}} calculate confidence intervals for an index of relative importance of prey categories (% IRIDC). Diet varied significantly between years and age classes {{but there was little}} regional difference in diet. In general, diet was dominated by krill, Euphausia superba and by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Smaller (younger) fish tended to prey on a higher proportion of T. gaudichaudii and small euphausiids such as Thysanoessa sp. and took smaller quantities of E. superba. In a season of poor krill availability (summer of 2003 - 2004) the proportion of krill in the diet, stomach fullness and fish condition (indicated by length-weight relationships) were significantly lower than in the other summer seasons. A large reduction (> 80 %) in the estimated annual (2005) biomass of the C. gunnari stock directly followed the season of poor krill availability. This decline was largely because of mortality of 2 + and 3 + fish, which were more krill dependent than 1 + fish.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{allocate}} quotas for sustainable harvests, {{that account for}} climate warming, {{it is important to}} incorporate species vulnerabilities that will underlie likely changes in population dynamics. Hotspots, regions with rapidly changing climate, are important locations for rapid advances in mechanistic understanding of the factors driving these changes, particularly if they coincide with regions with a high incidence of range limits, such as the sub-Antarctic Island of South Georgia. This archipelago is at the Northern limit of the Southern Ocean and therefore the northern distribution limit for many Southern Ocean shallow water marine species, which are amongst the most sensitive fauna to increasing temperature. At range limits species may either be living close to their physiological limits, or they may have more resistant phenotypes. In case studies, the northern range limit population of the gastropod limpet, Nacella concinna, has greater physiological plasticity at South Georgia than those from further south, allowing them to cope better with the warmer and more variable seasonal temperatures. Bivalve species, however, alter their depth distributions at South Georgia, to avoid the warmer water masses, indicating that {{they may not be able}} to cope with the warmer temperatures. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>icefish,</b> Champsocephalus gunnari, has a unique Antarctic trait, the loss of haemoglobin. A combination of temperature driven change in food web structure, and this extreme physiological cold adaptation, may explain why rapid warming at its northern range limit of South Georgia, has prevented stocks fully recovering from over fishing in the 1980 s, despite highly conservative management strategies...|$|E
40|$|Waters around South Georgia are {{amongst the}} most {{productive}} in the Southern Ocean, and support internationally important fisheries. However, there is significant inter-annual variability in fish stocks, and some species have failed to recover from historical overfishing. Dispersal and retention of the planktonic eggs and larvae of marine fish can {{play a key role}} in the maintenance of adult stocks. We use a numerical modelling approach to examine the influence of oceanographic and life-history variability on the dispersal and retention of 2 Antarctic fishes: Champsocephalus gunnari (<b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish)</b> and Notothenia rossii (marbled rockcod). Mean retention of N. rossii larvae was predicted to be 5. 3 %, considerably lower than that of C. gunnari (31. 3 %), a difference related to the longer planktonic period of the former. Such apparent loss of larvae from local recruitment grounds may contribute to the failure of the N. rossii population to recover from its collapse in the 1970 s. However, retention of both species showed high inter-annual variability. Dispersal and retention of C. gunnari were strongly influenced by location of the spawning site, with the greatest contribution to overall retention from spawning sites on the southwest South Georgia shelf. In addition, a consistent feature in C. gunnari was a lack of larval exchange between the proximate South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves, regions separated by only 240 km. Our findings provide insights into the demographic dynamics and connectivity of C. gunnari and N. rossii populations at South Georgia in relation to prospects for recovery and ongoing responses to environmental variability and change in the region...|$|E
40|$|The diet {{composition}} and feeding intensity of <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> Champsocephalus gunnari around Shag Rocks and the mainland of South Georgia was analyzed from ca 8700 stomachs collected in January/February 1985, January/February 1991 and January 1992. Main prey items were krill Euphausia superba, the amphipod hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii, mysids (primarily Antarctomysis maxima), and in 1985 also Thysanoessa species. The proportion of krill and T gaudichaudii {{in the diet}} varied considerably among the 3 years, whereas the proportion of mysids in the diet remained fairly constant, Krill {{appears to be the}} preferred food. In years of krill shortage, such as in 1991, krill was replaced by T gaudichaudii. The occurrence of krill in the diet in 1991 was among the lowest within a 28 yr period of investigation. Variation in food composition among sampling sites was high. This high variation appears to be primarily associated with differences in prey availability, but much less with prey size selectivity. Feeding intensity varied considerably among seasons. It was highest in 1992. The proportion of empty stomachs was uncommonly high and stomach content weight was uncommonly low in January 1991, a period when energy-rich food was needed for the final maturation of gonads. At the same time, an unusually high proportion of sexually mature fish showed no signs of the gonad development necessary for spawning in that season. It was hypothesized that as in some other non-Antarctic fish species the shortage of suitable food may have forced the fish to sacrifice gonad maturation in order to maintain body size...|$|E
40|$|The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) {{is bound}} by its Article II, 3 to follow an {{ecosystem}} approach to management. This {{approach has been}} extended to {{the application of a}} precautionary approach in the late 1980 s. In our review, we deal primarily with the science-related aspects of CCAMLR and its development towards an ecosystem approach to the management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean. To assist the Commission in meeting its objectives, as set out in Article II, 3, the Scientific Committee established the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme to detect possible effects of krill fishing on the performance of top-level predators, such as albatrosses, penguins, petrels and fur seals. Fisheries in the Southern Ocean followed the fate of other fisheries worldwide in which target species were depleted to low level one after the other. Currently, two types of fisheries are open: the longline fisheries on Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the trawl fisheries on <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari). Both fisheries are managed in a single-species context, however, with conservation measures in place to protect by-catch species, such as rattails (Macrouridae) and skates and rays (Rajidae). Two major problems still exist in fisheries in the Southern Ocean: the by-catch of birds in longline fisheries primarily in the Indian Ocean and the high level of IUU fishing again in the Indian Ocean. Both, the by-catch of birds and high IUU catches undermine the credibility of CCAMLR to safeguard the marine living resources in the Southern Ocean...|$|E
40|$|International audience‘POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope species (<b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari) and marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii)) exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (Channichthys rhinoceratus) and grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons)) seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations. Distinct cohorts of some species (D. eleginoides and C. gunnari) were detected in some sectors. The survey has defined the distribution of species, commercial or not, that are important in the ecosystem and are of major interest for the management and conservation of fish populations in the are...|$|E
40|$|Management of the <b>mackerel</b> <b>icefish</b> (Champsocephalus gunnari) at South Georgia is {{complicated}} by the likelihood of substantial periodic variations in natural mortality rates. These may be associated with increased consumption of C. gunnari by Antarctic fur seals in years of poor krill availability. Thus natural ortality of C. gunnari may, in some years, increase by a large factor (assumed here to be 4), declining to normal levels again when krill return. This paper outlines a scheme which would use information from studies on krill and predators undertaken as part of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) to interpret or modify information from commercial fisheries and research surveys leading to estimates of stock biomass. An extension of this scheme would use predictions of coming periods of krill scarcity as early warnings of increased natural mortality of C. gunnari. Full implementation of such a scheme would require greater knowledge of quantitative aspects of food web dynamics within the South Georgia ecosystem than we possess at present. There is therefore a need for an interim approach to the setting of precautionary catch limits for this fishery. An approach based on the CCAMLR generalised yield model (GYM), with periodically varying natural mortality, provides a realistic description of perceived icefish dynamics. However, the model generates a significant probability that C. gunnari populations will be depleted {{even in the absence of}} fishing, which, given the existing CCAMLR decision rules, would preclude the fishery's ever opening. Several possible modifications to the decision rules are discussed. It is concluded that while the GYM can be used to estimate a temporary, conservative long-term yield, a new approach and set of decision rules will ultimately be required for C. gunnari...|$|E
