After the war he worked as Deputy Medical Superintendent at Graylingwell Hospital, a large {{psychiatric}} hospital in Chichester in Sussex. In the early 1950s an Australian colleague showed him an article by John Cade in The Medical Journal of Australia on the beneficial effects of lithium on patients with mania. He decided to try it on some of his more severely affected patients, and found it worked in many cases. He wrote up the results in a 1956 edition of the Journal of <b>Mental</b> <b>Science,</b> after which his work was followed up in Britain by his colleague Ronald Maggs and others.|$|E

25|$|Netherne Hospital, Coulsdon, Surrey: in 1942 Eric Cunningham Dax, medical {{superintendent}} of Netherne Hospital, called in surgeon Eric Radley Smith {{to operate on}} patients. Before the year was out, fifty patients had undergone surgery, and in April 1943 the results {{were published in the}} Journal of <b>Mental</b> <b>Science.</b> Cunningham Dax described how he selected patients:"The operation was carried out with the primary object of relieving the most disturbed patients in the hospital quite independently of their poor prognosis. They formed {{a large proportion of the}} most violent, hostile, noisy, excited, destructive or obscene cases in the hospital; the type who distress their relatives, upset the other patients and consume the time and energy which could be put to so much better purpose by the staff".Two died of cerebral haemorrhage, two were discharged (of whom one relapsed); of those remaining in hospital two-thirds had shown at least some improvement, needing less staff time and supervision.|$|E

2500|$|ECT {{arrived in}} the UK with Lothar Kalinowsky, one of Cerletti’s assistants, who {{was on his way}} to the USA. Kalinowsky {{demonstrated}} Cerletti’s technique at the Burden Neurological Institute (BNI) and wrote an article about ECT which appeared in the Lancet in December 1939. He said that electrically induced seizures were cheaper and easier to administer than cardiazol seizures. The first paper on ECT by British authors appeared three weeks later in the same journal. Gerald Fleming, the medical superintendent of Barnwood House Hospital in Gloucester and editor of the Journal of <b>Mental</b> <b>Science,</b> psychiatrist Frederic Golla and neurophysiologist William Grey Walter (both from the BNI) described how they had tested the new method of convulsion therapy on five chronic schizophrenic patients from Barnwood House. Electrical parameters, technique of administration, seizures and electroencephalograms, but not therapeutic results, were discussed. An accompanying editorial entitled [...] "More shocks" [...] said that ECT [...] "may well turn out to be a valuable step forward" [...] but criticised Fleming’s claim that the use of ECT required only minimal training, expertise and patient preparation. The editorial also queried Kalinowsky’s dismissal of concerns about brain damage. [...] "There is still a chance" [...] it said [...] "that the brain has nemo me impune lacessit for its motto." ...|$|E

40|$|Jaegwon Kim {{attempts}} {{to pose a}} dilemma for anyone who would deny mind/body reductionism, namely that one must either advocate the wholesale reduction of psychology to physical science or the sundering of psychology into distinct fields each {{one of which is}} reducible to physical science.

My aim is to show {{that this is not a}} genuine dilemma, and that antireductionism is an option, if one recognizes that natural-kind individuation is not wholly a matter of metaphysics but is, at least to some degree, a matter of convention as well.
