500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are you here? Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough for that {{to be the end of}} <b>my</b> <b>light</b> comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|Deprived of the suitors' patronage, Iro {{commits suicide}} after a doleful {{monologue}} ("O grief, O torment that saddens the soul!") Melanto, whose lover Eurimaco was killed with the suitors, tries to warn Penelope {{of the new}} danger represented by the unidentified slayer, but Penelope is unmoved and continues to mourn for Ulisse. Eumete and Telemaco now inform her that the beggar was Ulisse in disguise, but she refuses to believe them: [...] "Your news is persistent and your comfort hurtful." [...] The scene briefly transfers to the heavens, where Giunone, having been solicited by Minerva, persuades Giove and Nettune that Ulisse should be restored to his throne. Back in the palace the nurse Ericlea has discovered Ulisse's identity by recognising a scar on his back, but does not immediately reveal this information: [...] "Sometimes {{the best thing is}} a wise silence." [...] Penelope continues to disbelieve, even when Ulisse appears in his true form and when Ericlea reveals her knowledge of the scar. Finally, after Ulisse describes the pattern of Penelope's private bedlinen, knowledge that only he could possess, she is convinced. Reunited, the pair sing rapturously to celebrate their love: [...] "My sun, long sighed for! <b>My</b> <b>light,</b> renewed!" ...|$|E
500|$|Bowen has {{described}} Tippett as [...] "a composer of our time", one who [...] engaged with the social, {{political and cultural}} issues of his day. [...] Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of [...] "ultimately optimistic humanism". [...] Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works [...] to seek [...] "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, {{while at the same}} time never losing sight of the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: [...] "he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and <b>my</b> <b>light,</b> So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett... this [...] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the [...] task that he had set himself of [...] "transmut his personal and private agonies into... something universal and impersonal". Michael Kennedy has referred to Tippett's [...] "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and his willingness to adopt whatever means or [...] techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.|$|E

His {{analysis}} of the lyrics observed that [...] "The singer declares herself unbreakable after a breakup, evident in lines such as [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade/ 'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out/ Like I was poison in your mouth/ You took <b>my</b> <b>light,</b> you drained me down/ But that was then and this is now, now look at me." [...] Dinh pointed out similarities between [...] "Part of Me" [...] and Perry's previous single [...] "California Gurls", noting that [...] "the tune's steady beat amplifies" [...] as the chorus starts. Andrew Hampp of Billboard described the song as a [...] "dance-floor rave up", and compared the song's composition to Jessie J's [...] "Domino". Edna Gundersen from USA Today stated: [...] "Katy Perry could be addressing her ex or her detractors on this defiant slapdown, a gleaming [...] "Firework"-like pop torpedo propelled by slick beats and a brazen chorus." [...] Chris Ryan, also of MTV, inferred that the song was aimed at Perry's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy, while New York magazine journalist Amanda Dobbis described it as [...] "another break-up anthem". Fans and media noted differences in the lyrics between the demo and the single, and claimed that the changes redirected the song's subject from McCoy to Perry's ex-husband Russell Brand, from whom she had recently divorced. Perry declared it was not about Brand, stating: ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1654, Milton {{had become}} totally blind; {{the cause of}} his {{blindness}} is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely. His blindness forced him to dictate his verse and prose to amanuenses who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell. One of his best-known sonnets is presumed to date from this period, When I Consider How <b>My</b> <b>Light</b> is Spent, titled by a later editor [...] "On His Blindness".|$|E

I definitely believe in a yin and yang, good and evil. My religion is a patchwork of whatever is real to me. If I can draw the strength {{to get through the}} day from something, that's religion... I'm not trying to be preachy or tell people what to think." [...] Danzig has voiced his approval of certain aspects of Satanic ideologies, including the quest for knowledge and individual freedom. He has stated that religion does not play a role in how he perceives other bands and musicians.|$|E
2500|$|The Midrash {{taught that}} the {{six days of}} {{darkness}} occurred in Egypt, while the seventh day of darkness was a day of darkness of the sea, as [...] says: [...] "And there was the cloud and the darkness here, yet it gave light by night there." [...] So God sent clouds and darkness and covered the Egyptians with darkness, but gave light to the Israelites, as God had done for them in Egypt. Hence [...] says: [...] "The Lord is <b>my</b> <b>light</b> and my salvation." [...] And the Midrash taught that in the Messianic Age, as well, God will bring darkness to sinners, but light to Israel, as [...] says: [...] "For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but upon you the Lord will shine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mojo {{summed up}} {{the sound of the}} album as [...] "an {{energetic}} mix of pop, Northern soul and punkish attitude." [...] The band intended to create a brassy sound mixed with the aggression and intensity of punk rock. The music mainly consists of up-beat soul music ("Tell Me When <b>My</b> <b>Light</b> Turns Green", [...] "Geno", [...] "Seven Days Too Long") inspired by labels such as Motown and Stax, and downbeat blues-jazz tunes ("I'm Just Looking", [...] "I Couldn't Help It If I Tried", [...] "Keep It"). [...] "Seven Days Too Long" [...] is a cover of the [...] "Northern soul classic", originally recorded by Chuck Wood. Rowland's lyrics have been described as [...] "a mixture of punchy bravado, deep disgust and a rather heroic flaunting of his insecurities, sobbed rather than sung," [...] and concern subjects such as ignorance towards Irish people ("Burn It Down"), an open letter to the dishonest music scene ("There, There, My Dear") and a tribute to the soul singer Geno Washington ("Geno").|$|E

This kind of behaviour seems normal now after 3 years of studying in Leeds, but thinking back to the way of life in my town, which sits just south of London, it couldn’t be more different. Before I arrived at university I thought that anything above Watford was northern; Birmingham was WAY up north, and I had never crossed the border from London {{to the rest of the}} country above. I had always fancied the north for my university choice, as I thought the north brought a more ‘fun’ way of life...|$|R
