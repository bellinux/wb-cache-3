5|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox</b> was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox's</b> character, Lewis Rothschild, in {{the film}} The American President (1995), written by Aaron Sorkin was modeled after Stephanopoulos.

According to Stephanopoulos, his role in the Clinton administration was more like Bradley Whitford's character Josh Lyman than Seaborn or Rothschild.|$|R

5|$|In 2015, PD {{affected}} 6.2 {{million people}} and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people {{over the age of}} 60, of which about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than females. When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called young-onset PD. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years. The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson, who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, in 1817. Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson's Day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April) and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease. People with parkinsonism who have increased the public's awareness of the condition include actor <b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox,</b> Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney, and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali.|$|E
5|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox</b> as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
5|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{wrote the}} script after Gale mused upon {{whether he would}} have befriended his father if they had {{attended}} school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly was <b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox.</b> However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.|$|E
50|$|McCown {{debuted in}} the 1985 hit film Teen Wolf with an uncredited, small role {{as one of}} <b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox's</b> character's {{basketball}} teammates.

His last film role was in the 1992 comedy/horror film Auntie Lee's Meat Pies, with Pat Morita.|$|R
5000|$|Shooting a film {{set in the}} Old West was {{appealing}} to the stuntmen, who were all experienced horse riders. [...] "We had every great stuntman in Hollywood wanting to work on Part III," [...] recalled Gale in 2002. Thomas F. Wilson, who played Buford Tannen, chose to perform his own stunts and {{spent a great deal}} of time learning to ride a horse and throw his lariat. Filming was halted when <b>Michael</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Fox's</b> father died and when his son was born.|$|R
