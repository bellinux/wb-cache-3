5|$|Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> is the 1974 second studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. The group was {{dissatisfied}} with the recording of their 1973 self-titled debut album, leading the band's frontman David Johansen to enlist veteran producer Shadow Morton for Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon.</b> Morton had become disenchanted by the music industry, but felt motivated by the band's energy and agreed {{to work with them}} as a challenge. They recorded the album the following year at A Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> was {{released}} by Mercury Records on May 10, 1974, to poor sales and only charted at number 167 on the Billboard 200. After a problem-ridden national tour, the New York Dolls were dropped by Mercury and disbanded a few years later. The album received positive reviews from most critics, some of whom felt Morton's production highlighted the group's raw sound {{and made it a}} better record than their first. Like their debut album, Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> {{became one of the most}} popular cult records in rock music and has since been viewed by music journalists as a precursor to punk rock.|$|E
5|$|When Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> was {{released}} in Europe in July, the New York Dolls performed at the Buxton Festival in Derbyshire and the Rock Prom Festival at Olympia in London. They also embarked on their second tour of the United States, which lasted only a few months. It was marred by cancelled shows and conflicts between the band members stemming from their escalating addictions to alcohol and other drugs. Because of their alcoholism, they failed {{to set up a}} recording session for a scheduled third album after the tour had ended, and by 1975, they were dropped by Mercury before disbanding a few years later.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Baker {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate. At the end of the {{legislative}} session, the Capitol Press Corps recognized him as its Outstanding Freshman Senator. In 1974, Baker was the lone vote against a Senate resolution honoring Martin Luther King Jr., explaining that he thought the Civil Rights Movement had pushed for too <b>much</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The New York Dolls {{were signed}} to Mercury Records, {{with the help}} of A & R man Paul Nelson. Thunders {{recorded}} two albums with the band, New York Dolls and Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon.</b> They were managed by Marty Thau, and booked by Leber & Krebs. Subsequently they worked with Malcolm McLaren for several months, later becoming a prototype for the Sex Pistols.|$|E
25|$|Flynn's {{performance}} in the latter was well received {{and led to a}} series of roles where he played drunks. Warner Bros cast him as John Barrymore in Too <b>Much,</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> (1958), and Zanuck used him again in The Roots of Heaven which made $3.0 million (1958). He met with Stanley Kubrick to discuss a role in Lolita, but nothing came of it.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{did not get}} <b>much</b> notice, coming <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> {{after the}} war for people to want to explore the {{harshness}} of his portrayal and confrontation with hard questions. Okada's novel was rediscovered by some writers from Los Angeles in 1976, who tracked down his wife to meet her and see {{if she had any}} of his manuscripts. She had struggled after his death and, unable to find a publisher interested in his next manuscript and disappointed at the rejection of his papers by UCLA, she burned everything: novel, notes, letters, etc.|$|R
50|$|After {{his release}} by Hibs in May 2010, Benjelloun agreed a two-year {{contract}} with German second division club Greuther Fürth. He {{did not complete}} the move, however, with the club claiming that Benjelloun had demanded <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money. <b>Soon</b> afterwards, Benjelloun signed for Egyptian Premier League club Ismaily SC. He made only seven appearances before leaving the club in January 2011.|$|R
25|$|The {{second test}} of the series was played at Headingley. England omitted the {{struggling}} Paul Collingwood from the side, and replaced him with Andrew Flintoff, returning to play his first test since the final Ashes test at the SCG {{at the start of}} 2007. Ryan Sidebottom, suffering from injury, was replaced with debutant Darren Pattinson. This decision provoked considerable reaction as many felt there were other bowlers who were better placed to come into the side – Chris Tremlett, Matthew Hoggard and Stephen Harmison all sprung to mind. Pattinson, born in Grimsby and raised in Australia, had only bowled a handful of overs at first class level, and whilst he had shown promise, his elevation to the test arena was arguably too <b>much</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> for him. A year previously, he was playing grade cricket in Australia alongside his regular job as a roof tiler. He had even shown uncertainly when asked about how keen he was to actually play for England. The decision to field him during a critical Test match prompted a variety of reaction and viewpoints from commentators, players and press experts.|$|E

500|$|According to a {{reviewer}} in Choice, {{the poems}} in Oh Pray focus on themes of love, insight, and tension. [...] They also focus on [...] "the black condition celebrated triumphant over difficulties". [...] The reviewer finds some poems uneven, sometimes banal, also best if read aloud, and meant to [...] "be reread and laughed over and thought about". [...] Reviewer James Finn Cotter states that this volume suffers from [...] "the dangers of success" [...] that happen when poets gain <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fame <b>too</b> <b>soon.</b> [...] Gilbert blames Angelou's publishers for capitalizing on her success as an autobiographer, stating that Oh Pray [...] "...is such a painfully untalented collection of poems that I can't {{think of any}} reason other than the Maya myth {{for it to be}} in print". [...] Writer Lyman B. Hagen responds to Gilbert's criticism by stating that Angelou had been a poet long before she began writing prose and that Angelou's audience is comfortable with her sparse lines. [...] He insists that Angelou's critics have missed the power of her poems' message in her apparently simple lines. [...] Hagen calls Angelou's poetry light verse. [...] He states that she writes about ordinary objects and experiences, and with deep feelings, about a variety of racial themes and concerns.|$|R

50|$|Due to a {{steering}} problem, Vitaly Petrov retired his Caterham on the start/finish straight {{beside the}} pit wall. The {{position of the}} car was dangerous so the safety car was deployed on lap 37 to allow a truck to recover it. This led to a round of pit stops which, significantly, allowed Vettel to take second place from Hamilton. With the new rules allowing lapped cars to unlap themselves, Button now {{had to contend with}} Vettel, Hamilton, Webber and Alonso behind him. With the safety car returning to the pits after lap 41, Button opened up a three-second gap at the restart. Hamilton was unable to overtake Vettel for second place, and fell into the clutches of Webber in fourth. Pastor Maldonado harried Alonso for fifth, with a radio transmission from the Ferrari pit revealing that Alonso's tyres were quickly degrading. Maldonado was unable to find a way past Alonso, and ultimately crashed out on the final lap when he applied <b>too</b> <b>much</b> throttle <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> while still on the astroturf through the apex of turn 7. As a result of pushing hard in pursuit of Alonso and ten world championship points, his Williams was forced into a spin which he could not correct. He made heavy contact with the wall, but was not injured, and was ultimately classified thirteenth as he had completed 90% of the race distance.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> was remastered and reissued by Hip-O Select and Mercury, {{after which}} Christgau wrote in Blender that both it and New York Dolls make up [...] "a priceless proto-punk legacy". He wrote that {{although}} Johansen's best original songs {{are on the}} first record, Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> has consistent hooks, clever lyrics, and exceptional cover songs, including [...] "two R novelties whose theatrical potential was barely noticed until the Dolls penetrated their holy essence". That same year, rock journalist Toby Creswell named [...] "Babylon" [...] {{as one of the}} greatest songs of all time in his book 1001 Songs. In the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), Colin Larkin felt the band's issues with alcohol and other drugs affected their performance on the record, which he deemed [...] "a charismatic collection of punk/glam-rock anthems, typically delivered with 'wasted' cool".|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Baby Doll, Baker was {{subsequently}} offered parts in The Brothers Karamazov (1958), Too <b>Much,</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> (1958), and The Devil's Disciple (1959). She refused to make Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon,</b> so Warner Bros. put her on suspension, which prevented her from starring in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) at MGM. Baker was also chosen by MGM for the lead in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and by Twentieth Century Fox for The Three Faces of Eve (1957), but her contract with Warner Bros. again prevented her from accepting the roles. Tensions between Baker and the studio escalated further when she went against their wishes by appearing in Arms and the Man on stage. Baker commented {{on the effect of}} the system on her career, saying: [...] "I came in {{at the end of the}} big studio system. I still had a slave contract and they were willing to put you in almost anything they had." ...|$|E
500|$|Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{a review of}} the album for Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on [...] "Chatterbox", calling it [...] "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for Creem magazine, Christgau said the polished sound reproduction preserved the band's raw qualities, {{especially in the case of}} Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren [...] "should be ashamed—Shadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." [...] Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times felt Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> was a better-produced album that proved the band to be [...] "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive punk rock since Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In The New Yorker, Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> more than New York Dolls after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly [...] "Human Being" [...] and [...] "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from Phonograph Record magazine said the group's [...] "easy going ironic sensibility" [...] was expressed [...] "far more amusingly and accessibly" [...] here than on their debut album.|$|E
5000|$|As time passed, Skull and 8-Ball {{began to}} focus on their tag team career, leaving Chainz to compete as a singles wrestler. In 1998, Chainz left the WWF, and Skull and 8-Ball {{continued}} as a tag team using the DOA name. They entered a feud with The Legion of Doom, during the course of which the Legion's former manager Paul Ellering turned on his former charges and sided with DOA. [...] However, that angle soon died out and DOA entered a brief feud with Southern Justice. Soon after that, Ellering left the duo and they formed a short lived alliance with Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor known then as <b>Too</b> <b>Much.</b> <b>Soon</b> after that angle, DOA left the WWF. Then, both 8-Ball and Skull went to WCW.|$|R

2500|$|In 1989, and now {{managed by}} Jeffrey Abbotts, {{they were then}} signed as The Real People by CBS on the Columbia label, {{although}} CBS were subsequently bought out by Sony. During this time, under the management of Jeffrey Abbotts, they toured extensively, including a major tour of the USA, Japan, Europe, etc. etc. They released their self-titled debut album The Real People on 6 May 1991. All the songs were written by Chris and Tony Griffiths. This reached the number 59 in the UK Albums Chart. They recorded a second album, 'Marshmellow Lane', for CBS, but although [...] "Believer", the first single from the album, charted at No.38 and another single, [...] "Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> Young", appeared <b>soon</b> afterwards, the album was never actually released. Several tracks subsequently appeared on a two band compilation album called Liverpool– The Calm Before the Storm, released in 1996 on the Columbia label. Tony and Chris Griffiths went on to {{set up their own}} recording studio (Realistic Studios) in Birkenhead, Wirral, and started their own label Egg Records.|$|R
500|$|Along with New York Dolls, Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> {{became one}} of the most popular cult albums in rock music. According to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the group predated punk rock with their [...] "gleeful sleaziness and {{reckless}} sound" [...] on the record, which he said was embellished by Morton's production details and exemplified by [...] "musically visceral and dangerous" [...] songs such as [...] "Human Being". In 1986, Sounds magazine ranked it sixtieth on its list of the 100 best albums of all time. After it was reissued by Mercury in 1987, Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Morton's production highlighted the New York Dolls' sense of humor and was rendered vividly by the CD remaster. However, he felt Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> was marred by inconsistent material and rated it lower than their first record. In a review of the reissue, Don Waller of the Los Angeles Times said the album was underappreciated and as much an [...] "instant classic" [...] as New York Dolls.|$|E
500|$|Although the Dolls {{shared an}} {{affinity}} for Morton, they produced little original material with him. To complete Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon,</b> they covered older songs and re-recorded their past demos. Johansen impersonated different characters while singing some of the novelty covers, and Morton incorporated many studio sound effects and female backing vocals in his production. For the album, lead guitarist Johnny Thunders wrote and recorded [...] "Chatterbox", his first recorded performance singing lead.|$|E
500|$|According to {{journalist}} Tony Fletcher, Morton {{would have}} been more productive on Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> {{had it not been for}} his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members—bassist Arthur Kane was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan had heroin addictions. Robert Christgau believed the New York Dolls relied more on cover songs for the album because, [...] "like so many cocky songwriters, David Johansen overloaded his debut with originals and then found that record promotion wasn't a life activity that inspired new ones." [...] English writer Clinton Heylin said their inability to sell enough records before may have discouraged them from writing original songs.|$|E

500|$|Barrymore {{had been}} a friend and {{drinking}} companion of Fields. In the 1976 film W.C. Fields and Me, Barrymore was played by Jack Cassidy. Barrymore's friend, Errol Flynn, played him in a 1958 film Too <b>Much,</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon,</b> an adaptation of the autobiography of Diana Barrymore, with Dorothy Malone playing the female lead. Howard Thompson, the film critic of The New York Times, wrote that [...] "Flynn, as the late John Barrymore, a moody, wild-drinking ruin of a great actor, steals the picture, lock, stock and keg. It {{is only in the}} scenes of his savage disintegration, as the horrified girl hangs on, that the picture approaches real tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> {{was titled}} after the {{biography}} {{of the same name}} on actress Diana Barrymore. According to music journalist Jon Savage, the title was [...] "more than applicable to the Dolls themselves" [...] because of alcoholism and other issues among the band members, including Thunders's heroin use and Nolan's contraction of hepatitis. A dedication to Barrymore was printed in the album's gatefold LP. For its front cover, the group eschewed the drag image that their first album had presented and they had developed a reputation for in favor of a fake concert shot. During the shoot, Thunders held a doll in his arm as if to strike it against his guitar to add shock value.|$|E
500|$|In May 1974, Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn {{reviewed}} the second New York Dolls album, Too <b>Much</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Soon.</b> [...] "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," [...] he wrote, describing the album as [...] "perhaps {{the best example}} of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street." [...] Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston's Real Kids reports of a show that year, [...] "A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave us a great review, calling us a 'punk band.'... e all sort of {{looked at each other and}} said, 'What's punk?'" [...] In a 1974 interview for his fanzine Heavy Metal Digest Danny Sugerman told Iggy Pop [...] "You went on record as saying you never were a punk" [...] and Iggy replied [...] "...well I ain't.

60|$|Of the {{ultimate}} destiny of New York {{as one of}} the ruling commercial cities of the world, it is, I think, impossible to doubt. Whether or no it will ever equal London in population I will not pretend to say; even should it do so, should its numbers so increase as to enable it to say that it had done so, the question could not very well be settled. When it comes to pass that an assemblage of men in one so-called city have to be counted by millions, there arises the impossibility of defining the limits of that city, and of saying who belong to it and who do not. An arbitrary line may be drawn, but that arbitrary line, though perhaps false when drawn as including <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> <b>soon</b> becomes more false as including too little. Ealing, Acton, Fulham, Putney, Norwood, Sydenham, Blackheath, Woolwich, Greenwich, Stratford, Highgate, and Hampstead are, in truth, component parts of London, and very shortly Brighton will be as much so.|$|R
