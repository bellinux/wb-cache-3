Obama said, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end." [...] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011.

Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.

But I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people {{are sick and tired of}} hearing about your damn emails!" [...] Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a [...] "very serious issue", but Americans want a discussion on issues that are [...] "real" [...] to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform.|$|E

The average Hottentot, or the average Melanesian, is pretty close to being {{on a par with}} the average white man. The {{difference}} lies in that there are proportionately so many more Hottentots and negroes who are merely average, while there is such a heavy percentage of white men who are not average, who are above average. These are what I called the pace- makers that bring up the speed of their own race average-men. Note that they do not change the nature or develop the intelligence of the average-men. But they give them better equipment, better facilities, enable them to travel a faster collective pace.|$|E
