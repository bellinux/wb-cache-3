25|$|US {{regulations}} require large North American {{vehicles to}} {{be equipped with}} left and right amber side <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and reflectors mounted midway between {{the front and rear}} side markers.|$|E
25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, side <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and headrests.|$|E
25|$|In early 2015, the {{remaining}} 12 ex-Conrail SD80MACs owned by CSX, were purchased by Norfolk Southern, and renumbered 7217-7228. Most have been repainted, and currently {{all of them}} still have red <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> intact, but {{it is unclear whether}} or not they will be removed.|$|E

50|$|Suomen leijona (Finlands lejon), The Lion of Finland, is a <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> {{and radio}} beacon in the Northern Baltic Sea {{operated}} by the Finnish Maritime Administration, located approximately 46 km Southwest of the island of Utö, six kilometers outside the Finnish territorial waters but inside the country's exclusive economic zone.|$|R
25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|R
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and side <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|E
25|$|The main combat jumps were preceded at each {{drop zone}} by three teams of pathfinders that arrived thirty {{minutes before the}} main assault to set up {{navigation}} aids, including Eureka radar transponder beacons and <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> to aid the C-47s in locating the DZs in the dark.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 and 1961 {{batches of}} 180hp locomotives, totalling 20, were built for British Railways. These were very {{closely related to}} the {{standard}} small diesel-hydraulic locomotives but with a few modifications to suit their use on a main line railway (different arrangement of fuel tanks, vacuum train brake system and <b>marker</b> <b>lights).</b> These locomotives were later designated Class 02.|$|E
25|$|When a train {{stopped at}} a red stop signal, its {{presence}} on the track started a time delay relay. At {{the conclusion of the}} time delay, the red <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was extinguished and replaced by the miniature yellow (the upper red aspect remained lit). The train stop also lowered. The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to stop short of another train.|$|R
50|$|Built by General Motors Diesel Division {{at their}} Canadian plant in London, Ontario in 1990. The four Class 59/1 {{locomotives}} owned by Hanson (parent {{company of the}} former owners Amey Roadstone Construction) {{are similar to the}} Class 59/0 locomotives of Foster Yeoman, the main differences being a revised head <b>light</b> and <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> layout and the fitting of yaw dampers to permit the maximum speed to be increased to 75 mi/h km/h.|$|R
30|$|The {{histological}} {{differential diagnosis}} {{in our patient}} included leiomyosarcoma (desmin+), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (ALK+/−, IgG 4 −), desmoid fibromatosis (β-catenin nuclear+), liposarcoma (CDK 4 +, MDM 2 +), follicular dendritic tumor (CD 21 +, CD 35 +), and malignant lymphoma (T/B cell <b>marker,</b> <b>light</b> chain restriction). A definitive diagnosis of SM requires histological examination of biopsy or surgically excised tissue specimens, unless other organs are apparently affected by IgG 4 -RD or percutaneous needle biopsy can be easily performed.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, Cadillac had {{its best}} annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an {{increase}} of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. 1967 and 1968 saw {{the introduction of a}} host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and side <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|Route {{destinations}} {{and service}} patterns were indicated to riders {{by means of}} steel signs placed in holders {{along the side of}} the cars, near the doors. These signs could be physically removed and changed when a train was assigned to a different service pattern. <b>Marker</b> <b>lights</b> at the front and rear of each car also indicated the routes to crews en route, as well as astute riders who came to recognize their trains' marker light patterns over time.|$|E
25|$|The SD70ACe/LCi {{is a low}} clearance, export {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The LCi in the model {{designation}} stands for Low Clearance international as these locomotives are designed to negotiate the tight clearances under the mine equipment. External differences between the SD70ACe and SD70ACe/LCi models include the addition of <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> number boxes lower in the body rather than {{on top of the}} cab, windscreen protector panels (to deflect abrasive iron ore when in mid train position), fire suppression canisters, louvre style vents, different horn and subtle differences with handrails.|$|E
50|$|In early 1928, the TTC {{modified}} Peter Witt cars 2500-2522 for radial {{service on}} the Lake Simcoe line (former Metropolitan line of the Toronto and York Radial Railway). These cars were fitted with air whistles, large-flange wheels, and flag and <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> brackets. They were mainly used to handle heavy crowds from Glen Echo to Bond Lake. However, on one occasion some of these Peter Witt cars {{went all the way}} to Sutton to accommodate an Orangemen's picnic.|$|R
25|$|The {{first five}} units were fitted with carbody pressurisation, as fitted {{to many other}} Australian National {{locomotives}} for operation in the dusty outback areas they operated in. Differences in the subsequent units included the fitting of double blade windscreen wipers, lowering of the multiple-unit jumper receptacle, and {{the changing of the}} <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> orientation from vertical to horizontal. Recent years have seen many of the class fitted with on line refuelling, and working from Melbourne to Perth on the SCT Logistics service.|$|R
50|$|A {{middle marker}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as an outer marker. It is normally positioned 0.5 to 0.8 nmi km before the runway threshold. When the aircraft is above the middle marker, the receiver's amber middle <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I missed approach point (typically 200 ft above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the missed approach if one of several visual cues has not been spotted.|$|R
25|$|The Aura {{was a new}} styling {{direction}} for Saturn, with styling that resembled its cousin, the European Opel Vectra. All Aura models came standard with folding side mirrors and side <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> lending to its European stylings. The design of the Aura Special appearance pieces included an integrated radio antenna in the rear window, a chrome appearance package available on XR models, standard 17inch wheels with five-spoke wheel covers and P225/50R17 all-season tires on XE models, and standard 18inch machined aluminum 14-spoke wheels on the XR with high-performance Goodyear Eagle LS2 P225/50R18 T tires.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, cars must be {{equipped}} with side-mounted turn signal repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally (i.e. {{to the sides of}} the vehicle) rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle. These are permitted, but not required in the US. As an alternative in both the United States and Canada, the front amber side <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> may be wired to flash with the turn signals, but this also is not mandatory. In recent years, many automakers have been incorporating side turn signal devices into the side view mirror housings, rather than mounting them on the vehicle's fenders. Some evidence suggests these mirror-mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender-mounted items.|$|E
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side <b>marker</b> <b>lights)</b> to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Festiva {{continued to be}} sold in Australia until 2000 when it {{was replaced by the}} Ford Ka. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. side <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> cut-outs {{on each side of the}} vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side indicator repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.|$|R
5000|$|For {{personnel}} who are flying over large bodies of water, in additional to wearing a survival suit over cold water, a survival kit may have additional {{items such as}} flotation vests, sea anchor, fishing nets, fishing equipment, fluorescent sea marking dye, pyrotechnical signals, a survival radio and/or radio-beacon, formerly a distress <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> replaced by a flashing strobe, formerly a seawater still or chemical desalinator kit now replaced by a hand pumped reverse osmosis desalinator (MROD) for desalinating seawater, a raft repair kit, a paddle, a bailer and sponge, sunscreen, medical equipment, a whistle, a compass, and a sun shade hat.|$|R
40|$|Objective. Autophagy, an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{process for}} the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic compo-nents, serves as a cell survival mechanism. The {{purpose of this study}} was to elucidate the role of autophagy in human chondrocytes and pathophysiology of osteoar-thritis (OA). Methods. Autophagy in articular cartilage and primary chondrocytes was assessed using antibodies for the autophagy <b>markers</b> <b>light</b> chain 3 and beclin 1.

25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
500|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 6June, the 9th Parachute Battalion's advance party landed with the brigade's pathfinders, {{and reached the}} {{battalion}} assembly area without any problems. While some men remained to mark out the company positions, the battalion's second in command, Major George Smith, and a reconnaissance party left to scout the battery. At the same time, Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers started their bombing run, which completely missed the battery, their bombs landing further to the south. The pathfinders in the meantime were having problems. Those who {{had arrived at the}} correct drop zone found their Eureka beacons had been damaged when they landed, and in the smoke and debris left over from the bombing, their <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by the pilots of the transport aircraft. The main body of the 9th Parachute Battalion and their gliders were to land at drop zone 'V', located between the battery and Varaville from 01:00. However, the battalion was scattered, with a number of paratroopers landing a considerable distance from the designated drop zone. Lieutenant Colonel Otway landed {{with the rest of his}} [...] "stick" [...] away from the drop zone at a farmhouse being used as a command post by a German battalion; after a brief fire-fight, they helped other scattered paratroopers, and reached the drop zone at 01:30. By 02:50, only 150 men had arrived at the battalion's assembly point with 20 Bangalore torpedoes and a machine gun. The mortars, anti-tank gun, mine detectors, jeeps, sappers and field ambulance section were all missing.|$|E
500|$|It {{was decided}} that the brigade's paratroops would land on four {{separate}} drop zones and that the gliders would land at two landing zones. The paratroops of the 1st Parachute Battalion {{were divided into two}} groups, one of which would land at 'Drop zone One' {{to the north of the}} river, and the second at 'Drop zone Two' to the south of it. Once they had landed the two groups would head for their assembly points, before conducting an assault on the bridge from both sides simultaneously. The 2nd Parachute Battalion were to be landed south of the bridge on 'Drop zone Three', in the area between the Gornalunga Canal and the main highway. The 2nd Battalion then had to assault and occupy three small hills, which had been given the codenames 'JohnnyI', 'JohnnyII' and 'JohnnyIII'. The hills were believed to be occupied by an Italian force of around platoon strength. Once the battalion had secured the three hills, they were to dig in and prepare to defend the hills against an attack from the south. The 3rd Parachute Battalion would land at 'Drop zone Four', [...] north of the bridge. Their objective was to secure the ground in this area, defending against any counterattack from the direction of Catania. The brigade's glider force had two landing areas, 'Landing zone Seven' north of the river and 'Landing zone Eight' south of the river. Owing to the complexity of the landing plan and the short time between inception and execution, the pathfinders belonging to the 21stIndependent Parachute Company, Army Air Corps, would be deployed to mark the correct drop zones. This was the first occasion this had been done in British airborne operations. The pathfinder company had special <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and Rebecca and Eureka beacons that the transport aircraft and gliders would be able to identify and home in on.|$|E

50|$|In early 1928, the TTC {{modified}} 7 double-ended ex-TCR cars 2160-2166, 23 single-ended Peter Witt cars 2500-2522 and 4 six-motor trains 1244/1170-1250/1176 for radial service. (A six-motor {{train was}} a coupled pair of 2 ex-TRC cars, {{the first car}} having 4 motors and the second having 2.) These cars were fitted with air whistles, large-flange wheels, and flag and <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> brackets. They were mainly used to handle heavy crowds to Bond Lake. However, on one occasion, such cars (including Peter Witt cars) {{went all the way}} to Sutton to accommodate an Orangemen's picnic, where the single-ended cars were reversed on a wye at Jackson's Point.|$|R

2500|$|Conrail {{was divided}} between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation in 1999, with all {{remaining}} locomotives having been repainted, but ex-CR units can be spotted. CR units had similar {{features such as}} [...] "Bright Future" [...] blue paint, flashing ditch lights, and Leslie RS-3L horns. Another key spotting feature is ditchlights mounted under the locomotive's front deck. This is a preference different from Norfolk Southern, who orders their locomotives with the lights above the deck. <b>Marker</b> <b>lights,</b> or class lights, were also a preference of Conrail. Most Conrail engines still have <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> on CSX, while NS opted to remove them. All Conrail locomotives that went to CSX were re-painted into CSX colors. All of the Conrail units owned by NS have been either repainted or retired, as the last unit in 'Big Blue' being NS 8312, was retired. Conrail was the only railroad to receive EMD SD80MACs (the Chicago North & Western were originally supposed to receive SD80MACs with <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> but when that railroad merged with Union Pacific, the order was rescinded) and were separated evenly between CSX and NS. Conrail had a different scheme for these locomotives and also the SD70MAC, with a large white, cone shaped line on the front, bearing [...] "Conrail Quality". The SD70MACs weren't fitted with <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> {{as it would be}} useless when given to NS and CSX. This goes along with the standard-cab SD70, Conrail's final order of locomotives, as they were in Norfolk Southern's preferred numbering (the 2500 series).|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Suomen leijona (Finlands lejon), The Lion of Finland, was a caisson lighthouse; a {{steel tower}} {{resting on a}} concrete caisson, equipped with a helicopter platform and powered by a wind generator. The lighthouse had a futuristic design with a helipad {{on the top of}} a downward tapering tower, which made great demands on the foundation and the bottom of the tower. In 1992 it was discovered that the foundation had been under-mined and that the lighthouse was threatening to collapse. The problem was remedied by filling with rubble, but the problem recurred in 2004. Deemed too dangerous to repair the lighthouse, it was demolished in 2005 and replaced by the much smaller, <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> / radio beacon.|$|R
