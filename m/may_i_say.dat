500|$|The final {{trial was}} {{presided over by}} Mr Justice Wills. On 25 May 1895 Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years' hard labour. The judge {{described}} the sentence, the maximum allowed, as [...] "totally inadequate for a case such as this," [...] and that the case was [...] "the worst case I have ever tried". Wilde's response [...] "And I? <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> nothing, my Lord?" [...] was drowned out in cries of [...] "Shame" [...] in the courtroom.|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} {{an industry}} screening in April 2008 Michael Cieply from The New York Times {{stated that the}} film was [...] "...shaping up as one of 's best prospects for the summer." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a positive review, writing [...] "There are some wildly funny scenes, a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot, with humorous satire undercut by over-the-top grisliness. Still, when it's funny, it's really funny." [...] A review in Variety by Todd McCarthy was critical: [...] "Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film a negative review, calling it [...] "...an assault {{in the guise of}} a comedy—watching it is like getting mugged by a clown." [...] J.R. Jones of Chicago Reader stated [...] "The rest of the movie never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 3.5/4 and wrote, [...] "The movie is, <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> considerably better than Stiller’s previous film, Zoolander (2001). It’s the kind of summer comedy that rolls in, makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{seen the}} man. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> know him,--for I dined with him once in Manchester Square. Old Wharton himself must {{have asked him}} there." ...|$|R
60|$|SMITH. <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> a word? I {{have a great}} {{dislike of}} a quarrel, for a reason quite beyond my duty to my cloth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't ask me now," [...] Rebecca said. [...] "You shall {{know all}} soon. Indeed you shall. Dear kind Miss Crawley--dear friend, <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now, <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{what more}} I {{want to see}} in you? If you could acquire more resolution, more manliness--will you pardon my saying so?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Miss; I {{have been}} in love ever since I was ten years old; <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was born in love, and hope to die in love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} repeat that I mean nothing {{offensive}} to our dear Mary; for whom, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> have always shown almost a mother's care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} {{intimate}} with them. I {{had been at}} Eton and at Christ Church with Silverbridge, and {{we have always been}} much together." ...|$|R

6000|$|That {{it should}} be a delight to him, was the very essence of her heaven. [...] "Tell me what to say," [...] she answered. [...] "How <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> it best?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, Mrs. Orme? Is it {{anything}} about the property? I think you need hardly be afraid of me. <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> could bear anything of that kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{might ask}} for you, Loveday,' said the captain thoughtfully, 'and so get you there that way. In short, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{will ask for}} you. So {{consider}} it settled.' ...|$|R

60|$|AUGUSTUS. I {{should not}} dream of {{describing}} myself so, Madam; but no doubt I have impressed my countrymen--and [bowing gallantly] <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> my countrywomen--as having some exceptional claims to their consideration.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE (solemnly). She will recover. <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> ma'am, it {{surprises me}} {{that any one}} should see much {{resemblance}} {{between you and your}} Aunt Phoebe. Miss Phoebe is decidedly shorter and more thick-set.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} she has told Mr. Broughton? I am sure she has not. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> know she has not. Maria Clutterbuck is infatuated. There is no other excuse {{to be made for}} her." ...|$|R
60|$|Without boasting, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am {{not afraid}} to stand before a modern French duelist, {{but as long as}} I keep in my right mind I will never consent to stand behind one again.|$|R

6000|$|PRESS. [Seriously] <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{that you}} {{designed}} the dinner {{to soften the}} tension, at this crisis? You saw that case, I suppose, this morning, of the woman dying of starvation in Bethnal Green? ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was fully}} committed, and {{must go on}} with the fight. As I was looking listlessly over the papers at breakfast I came across this paragraph, and <b>I</b> <b>may</b> truly <b>say</b> <b>I</b> never was so confounded before.|$|R
6000|$|Unfortunately, my {{troubles}} {{are part}} of my story; and my early life mixes itself up with them. In consideration of what is to follow, <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> two words relating to the period before I was a governess? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{meant no}} harm to thee," [...] said Sir Richard, [...] "but a merry jest is a merry jest, and <b>I</b> <b>may</b> truly <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{would have laughed}} at it had it been against mine own self." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Never mind,' replied Sam. 'P'raps you may {{ask for it}} five minits arterwards; p'raps <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> von't pay, and cut up rough.
