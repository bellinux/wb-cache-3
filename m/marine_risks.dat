40|$|The Aegean Sea is {{characterized}} by an extremely high marine safety risk, mainly due to the significant increase of the traffic of tankers from and to the Black Sea that pass through narrow straits formed by the 1600 Greek islands. Reducing {{the risk of a}} ship accident is therefore vital to all socio-economic and environmental sectors. This paper presents an online long-term marine traffic monitoring work-flow that focuses on extracting aggregated vessel risks using spatiotemporal analysis of multilayer information: vessel trajectories, vessel data, meteorological data, bathymetric / hydrographic data as well as information regarding environmentally important areas (e. g. protected high-risk areas, etc.). A web interface that enables user-friendly spatiotemporal queries is implemented at the frontend, while a series of data mining functionalities extracts aggregated statistics regarding: (a) <b>marine</b> <b>risks</b> and accident probabilities for particular areas (b) trajectories clustering information (c) general marine statistics (cargo types, etc.) and (d) correlation between spatial environmental importance and marine traffic risk. Towards this end, a set of data clustering and probabilistic graphical modelling techniques has been adopted...|$|E

40|$|Causation is {{a crucial}} issue in ascertaining whether certain loss or damage is covered in an {{insurance}} policy. Although marine insurance is well-known for investigating the “proximate” cause of loss {{in order to determine}} the insurers’ liability, decisions by English courts are far from reconcilable. The problem has been suggested to be the inference of matters of fact, and consequently, causal connection is deemed as a complex and uncertain issue. In the light of incoherency and uncertainty of law in this respect, the value of this research lies in the effort to conceptualize and develop a set of consistent causation rules in the marine insurance context and to explore how perils themselves would affect the formation and application of causation rules. Essentially, the proximate cause in law should not remain as a mere open question of fact. In order to achieve the merits, this dissertation scrutinises the causation theory itself and also the correlations between the perils involved in the policy. Introduction presents the legal problem of causation in marine insurance law and stresses the importance of setting up coherent and certain rules. The research on the pure causation theory consists of two chapters: Chapter One regarding the test of causation, i. e. the doctrine of proximity; and Chapter Two on concurrent causes. The subsequent three chapters concentrate on identifying the cause of loss from the nature and concepts of different <b>marine</b> <b>risks.</b> Chapter Three introduces marine perils and examines how causation rules apply in the case of a few typical insured and uninsured perils; Chapter Four and Chapter Five are concerned with exclusive researches on inherent vice and seaworthiness respectively. Apart from the substantive analysis on causation, burden of proof is addressed in the last chapter. Finally, the Conclusion provides a summary of the issues and the set of causation rules...|$|E

Bibliographic search was made as exhaustive as possible to collect ecotoxicity data for each substance. Then, methodological appraisal was carried out to validate or invalidate ecotoxicity data. Valid data were finally used to derive PNECs, according to hazard assessment principles within risk assessment method described in the Technical Guidance Document (EC, 2003).

40|$|In ocean ecosystems, many of {{the changes}} in {{predation}} risk - both increases and decreases - are human-induced. These changes are occurring at scales ranging from global to local and across variable temporal scales. Indirect, risk-based effects of human activity are known to be important in structuring some terrestrial ecosystems, but these impacts have largely been neglected in oceans. Here, we synthesize existing literature and data to explore multiple lines of evidence that collectively suggest diverse human activities are changing marine ecosystems, including carbon storage capacity, in myriad ways by altering predation risk. We provide novel, compelling evidence that at least one key human activity, overfishing, can lead to distinct, cascading risk effects in natural ecosystems whose magnitude exceeds that of presumed lethal effects and may account for previously unexplained findings. We further discuss the conservation implications of human-caused indirect risk effects. Finally, we provide a predictive framework for when human alterations of risk in oceans should lead to cascading effects and outline a prospectus for future research. Given the speed and extent with which human activities are altering <b>marine</b> <b>risk</b> landscapes, it is crucial that conservation and management policy considers the indirect effects of these activities in order to increase the likelihood of success and avoid unfortunate surprises. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a regional ecological risk assessment for a near shore marine en-vironment in northwestern Washington State using the Relative Risk Model. The objectives {{of this study}} were threefold: (1) to analyze cumulative impacts from mul-tiple sources of chemical and non-chemical stressors in the near shore region and upland watersheds of Cherry Point (2) to determine the utility of Monte Carlo type uncertainty analysis in a rank-based regional risk assessment and (3) to investigate the effects of model habitat characterization on risk estimates. We used geographic information systems to compile and compare spatial data to determine ranks for sub-regions within the study area. By quantitatively combining ranks with exposure and effects filters, we estimated total relative risk between sub-regions and relative contributions of stressors. Finally, we used Monte Carlo analysis and an alternative ranking scheme to evaluate the effects of model and parameter uncertainty on risk predictions. The regional risk assessment results suggest the major contributors of risk are vessel traffic, upland urban and agricultural land use and shoreline recre-ational activities. This assessment demonstrated the applicability of regional <b>risk</b> assessment to <b>marine</b> near shore regions and the benefit of Monte Carlo analysis in describing uncertainty in a Relative Risk Model regional risk assessment.
