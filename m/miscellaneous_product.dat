40|$|In a {{wide range}} of indoor air pollutants, {{formaldehyde}} is one of the most-used and best-known substances. In order to protect human health, many countries have established threshold values for the release of formaldehyde from <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>products</b> and revise them constantly. Compliance with these regulations is usually assessed by emission test chamber measurements or derived methods. To control and improve the mechanisms of an emission test chamber, a reliable reference source with sample mimicking emission properties is required but not available so far. This study describes a permeation-controlled reference source based on the application of paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde releasing polymeric compound. Interactions between the formaldehyde release of the source and the governing chamber parameters temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were investigated in 1 m 3 emission chambers. Depending on the conditions, constant formaldehyde concentrations between approximately 10 ppb and 150 ppb can be adjusted for up to 600 h. A linear correlation between the logarithm of the chamber concentration and the reciprocal temperature was found. The results support the feasibility of the source for validation of emission test chamber performance...|$|R

" "Standby" and "sleep" are the most familiar lopomos, but some new products already have many modes. Lopomos are becoming common in household appliances, safety equipment, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>products.</b> Ross and Meier (2000) reports that several international studies have found standby power {{to be as much}} as 10 percent of residential energy consumption.

In this paper, we propose a research agenda for study of lopomo energy consumption. This agenda has been developed with input from over 200 interested parties. Overall, there is consensus that lopomo energy consumption is an important area for research. Many see this as a critical time for addressing lopomo issues.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} novel algorithm for mapping of electronic components onto 3 D objects. The algoritm, called Algorithm Specialised for Electronic Components, is {{compared with other}} algorithms suitable to per-form this task. Exhaustive experimental results are provided and discussed as well. Algorithm Specialised for Electro-nic Components is recognized as best suitable for 3 D-MID technology, {{but it is not}} limited to it. 1. Indroduction The task of mapping electronic components onto 3 D objects is solved successfully by using algorithms based on orthogonal projection and parametric equations of surfaces [8]. The following disadvantages of those algorithms are recognized after their implementation and testing: As more and more <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>products</b> contain integrated parts and mechanisms, knowledge from various fields is required in order to manufacture them. The arrangement of electronic components (in-terconnect and packaged components) within a me-chanical structure is an example of such integration. 1. Avoidance of overlap of electronic component is not guaranteed, Because the size requirements for many devices equipped with electronics are getting stricter – the electronic piece parts should be as small as possible. While placing electronic components within mecha-nical structures, unused space must be minimized. 2. Preservation of the original shapes of packaged components, the width of tracks is not guaranteed, 3. The orthogonal projection-based algorithm can cause big distortions. In various papers it is proved that considering many aspects (mechanical constraints applied to electronic circuitry, thermal, pressure analysis, etc.) in early design stages saves manufacturing time and money [2, 3, 15].

In contrast, higher technology effects to reduce the emissions are found in CX 04 (utilities), CX 08 (apparel and textile), CX 15 (rubber and <b>miscellaneous</b> plastic <b>products),</b> CX 18 (fabricated metal products) and CX 35 (real estate) even if their production effects increase.|$|R
