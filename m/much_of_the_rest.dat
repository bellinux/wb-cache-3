5|$|Ashland, {{originally}} called Ashland Mills, {{was named}} after Ashland County, Ohio, the original home of founder Abel Helman, and secondarily for Ashland, Kentucky, where other founders had family connections. Ashland has a mayor-council government assisted by citizen committees. Historically, its liberal politics have differed, often sharply, with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of southwest Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of French West Africa, {{authorities}} enforced explicit {{rules in}} an attempt to end slavery in the region. In 1903, the government instructed French administrators to not use slave as an administrative category anymore. This was followed in 1905 by a formal French decree that ended slavery throughout French West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of French West Africa, {{the colony}} {{had a number}} of {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities. The Arabic language and Islamic law were preferred in the colony by the French in the establishment of colonial government, largely because both were codified, and thus easy to standardize.|$|E

5|$|There is {{significant}} agricultural activity {{done in the}} lower reaches of the watershed of West Creek {{and there are also}} some residential areas. Additionally, there are some agricultural lands in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the watershed is forested land. Some of the most downstream parts of the watershed are urban.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May {{carried out}} {{a wide variety of}} public duties. On the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, George's father ascended the throne as King Edward VII. George {{inherited}} the title of Duke of Cornwall, and for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of that year, he was known as the Duke of Cornwall and York.|$|E
500|$|Whippets {{are quiet}} and not prone to barking, but require regular exercise. They are {{generally}} gentle dogs {{and may be}} content to spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day <b>resting.</b> <b>The</b> AKC describes them as [...] "quiet and dignified in their owner's living room" [...] and says they make [...] "excellent house dogs."

There are no set goals in the game; however, the game {{encourages}} and rewards the player when they explore new areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house and search for new messages. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interactivity <b>rests</b> upon looking at objects and notes within the house. In order to progress in the game, the player must find certain objects that unlock access to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
5|$|Braille {{read the}} Haüy books repeatedly, {{and he was}} equally {{attentive}} to the oral instruction offered by the school. He {{proved to be a}} highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher's aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.|$|E
5|$|Conte di Cavour was {{the name}} ship of the three s built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s. She served during both World War I and World War II, {{although}} she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the Corfu Incident in 1923 and spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the decade in reserve. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, while <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E

Because Kennedy had no funeral plan in place, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planning <b>rested</b> with <b>the</b> CG MDW. House Speaker John W.

50|$|Louise Reynolds was a 28-year-old {{single mother}} living in Kingston, Ontario, charged with second degree murder for having killed her seven-year-old {{daughter}} Sharon in 1997 by stabbing {{her more than}} 80 times with a pair <b>of</b> scissors. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case <b>rested</b> on Dr. Smith’s 10-page autopsy report. In January 2001 the Crown abruptly dropped the charges, after numerous experts, including Crown witnesses, disagreed with Smith and agreed that a powerful dog had mauled the girl (there was a pit-bull present in {{the house at the}} time). By then, Reynolds had spent 22 months in custody.|$|R

Aliso Creek forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's boundary with Laguna Niguel to the south, and Wood Canyon Creek forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's western boundary. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city <b>rests</b> on <b>the</b> east slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> San Joaquin Hills, which are a coastal mountain range extending for about 15 mi along the Pacific coast.|$|R
5|$|Winchester was {{the only}} {{defendant}} to face trial on the charges. Winchester's lawyer argued that Smith was guilty of verbal assault against the defendant, and Winchester was found not guilty. The verdict was reported in The Spectator on March 22, 1825. In 1828 Stephenson left Edwardsville, and moved to Galena in Jo Daviess County where he made his home for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life.|$|E
5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

[...] Buddhism was heavily sponsored and [...] promoted by the royal court. [...] <b>The</b> early century <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unified Silla [...] period {{is known as a}} golden age of Korean history where the kingdom [...] enjoyed the peace and stability to produce fabulous works <b>of</b> art.

60|$|History has {{no record}} since <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Attila of so frightful a massacre. Neither age nor sex was spared, and 30,000 men, women, and {{children}} were ruthlessly massacred. The result for a time justified <b>the</b> anticipations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferocious leader. The terrible deed sent a shudder of horror and terror through Protestant Germany. It seemed, too, as if the catastrophe might have been averted had the Swedes shown diligence and marched to <b>the</b> relief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city; for in such a time men were not inclined to discuss how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blame <b>rested</b> upon <b>the</b> shoulders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Brandenburg, who was, in fact, alone responsible for <b>the</b> delay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{programme}} was a spoof of boys' comics from <b>the</b> Empire days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, featuring [...] "Your old chum" [...] the Editor (McGowan) presenting regular features, adventure stories, practical advice, readers letters, etc., {{complete with}} advertisements. An enthusiastic young reader (Baynham) {{could be heard}} turning (and once accidentally tearing) the pages and occasionally commenting. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humour <b>rested</b> upon anachronistic, politically incorrect attitudes towards such topics as education, class, sex, race, war, and the avuncular, paternalistic style adopted by interwar boys' publications like the Boy's Own Paper in addressing their readers. The reference to whaling in the title was underscored by the illustrated front cover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magazine, i.e. the opening music/sound effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> programme.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the second}} son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where he spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life. He became heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones {{on the death of}} his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E
5|$|His {{life and}} with it his reign, which were longer than any other British monarch before him, were marked {{by a series of}} {{military}} conflicts involving his kingdoms, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.|$|E
5000|$|Harby {{was also}} known for his {{opposition}} to modern art, sculpture and music.

5|$|In ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, {{with the}} goddess Bastet often {{depicted}} in cat form, sometimes {{taking on the}} war-like aspect of a lioness. The Romans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe; in Roman Aquitaine, a first- or second-century engraving {{of a young girl}} holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat. However, cats possibly were already kept in Europe prior to the Roman Empire, as they may have been present in Britain in the late Iron Age. Domestic cats were spread throughout <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the world during the Age of Discovery, as ship's cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{decided to}} film The Frighteners entirely in New Zealand. Zemeckis and Universal {{agreed on the}} {{condition}} that Jackson made New Zealand look similar to the Midwestern United States. Principal photography began on May 14, 1995 and lasted until November 16, {{which is one of the}} longest shooting schedules ever approved by Universal Pictures. Six weeks into the shoot, cinematographer Alun Bollinger had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the shoot. Location shooting primarily included Wellington and three weeks spent in Lyttelton. Interior scenes were compiled at Camperdown Studios in Miramar.|$|E

The ship was removed from the naval register on 31 December, and sold to the Italian ship breaking company SA Cantiere Navale de Santa Maria. Minas Geraes was taken under tow on 1 March 1954 and arrived in Genoa on 22 April; the old dreadnought, which had been in service for more than forty years, was broken up for scrap later that year.|$|E
