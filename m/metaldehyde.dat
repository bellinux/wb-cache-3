5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide <b>metaldehyde,</b> dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
25|$|As control measures, baits are {{the norm}} in both {{agriculture}} and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic <b>metaldehyde,</b> especially because domestic or wild animals may {{be exposed to the}} bait.

Parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.|$|E

Prior to the work presented here, it was known that <b>metaldehyde</b> is degraded biotically in soil, but the nature and identity of organisms responsible was unknown. Two novel <b>metaldehyde</b> degrading bacterial strains were isolated from domestic soil that can utilise <b>metaldehyde</b> as a sole carbon and energy source; Acinetobacter calcoaceticus E 1 and Variovorax E 3. Evidence that acetaldehyde is the primary metabolite of <b>metaldehyde</b> is presented: the <b>metaldehyde</b> dependent expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase in A. calcoaceticus E 1 was found, and the maximum metabolic flux of acetaldehyde was found to be greater than that of <b>metaldehyde</b> in cells grown using <b>metaldehyde.</b> The genomes of the isolated organisms were acquired. Comparative genomics of the two isolates showed that their novel catalytic ability was not dependent on genes shared between them, despite being isolated from the same soil sample. Comparison of the A. calcoaceticus E 1 genome against other Acinetobacter that cannot utilise <b>metaldehyde</b> yielded a strong candidate for the primary <b>metaldehyde</b> degrading enzyme that has characteristics consistent with an enzyme that catalysed ether hydrolysis of isochorismate in its ancestral form and has evolved to hydrolyse ether bonds in <b>metaldehyde...</b>|$|E

Equilibrium experimental data were successfully described by Freundlich isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity of S 957 (7. 5 g metaldehyde/g S 957) exceeded those of MN 200 and GAC. Thermodynamic studies showed that sorption of <b>metaldehyde</b> onto all sorbents is endothermic and processes are controlled by entropic rather than enthalpic changes. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that experimental data for MN 200 and GAC obey pseudo-second order models with rates limited by particle diffusion. Comparatively, S 957 was shown to obey a pseudo-first order model with a rate-limiting step of <b>metaldehyde</b> diffusion through the solid/liquid interface. Results obtained suggest that <b>metaldehyde</b> adsorption onto MN 200 and GAC are driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, as leaching tendencies were high since no degradation of <b>metaldehyde</b> occurred. Conversely, adsorption of <b>metaldehyde</b> onto S 957 occurs via ion-exchange processes, where sulfonic and phosphonic functionalities degrade adsorbed <b>metaldehyde</b> molecules and failure to detect <b>metaldehyde</b> in leaching studies for S 957 supports this theory.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} is directed towards many chemicals and microbial constituents {{which have not}} been historically considered as contaminants. These “emerging contaminants” are commonly derived from municipal, agricultural and industrial wastewater sources and pathways. Among others, <b>metaldehyde,</b> a widely used molluscicide, has been detected in groundwater at levels exceeding the 0. 1 μg L- 1 [microgram per liter] limit required by the Water Framework Directive. This has raised concerns for drinking water treatment, as the compound cannot be removed with conventional granular activated carbon or ozonation treatment processes. Further to this, some recent case studies on groundwater quality reported <b>metaldehyde</b> concentrations > 0. 1 μg L- 1 [microgram per liter] {{in the vicinity of}} landfill sites. In all cases, there is no evidence or record of <b>metaldehyde</b> disposal. This growing evidence raises the question about the relationship between the characteristics of leachate generated from the landfill sites, the presence of <b>metaldehyde</b> and its impact on surrounding groundwater resources. In the present study, two landfill sites located in the UK are being investigated as potential sources of contamination to groundwater by <b>metaldehyde.</b> In both cases, <b>metaldehyde</b> concentrations exceeded the levels expected from a point- source contamination site. For this reason, landfill leachate chemistry was assessed to determine whether an in situ synthesis of <b>metaldehyde</b> can occur within landfill sites. A critical review found that potential reagents such as acetaldehyde, catalysts such as acetic acid and environmental conditions are present in groundwater aquifers. However, lab-based experiments have suggested that <b>metaldehyde</b> cannot be synthesised in the environment despite the presence {{of a wide range of}} pH values, cold temperatures, a high concentration of acetaldehyde, and the presence of a calcium bromide catalyst. This finding, combined with data collected from the two case study sites over a 7 month period suggest that a point source of the pollutant is the most likely explanation. The in situ testing also highlighted that the acetaldehyde reagent contained significant contamination by <b>metaldehyde,</b> of which the supplier was unaware. Two independent laboratories also confirmed the presence of <b>metaldehyde</b> in the reagent. Acetaldehyde of a purer grade from other manufacturers was also tested and found to contain significant levels of <b>metaldehyde.</b> These findings demonstrate another potential source of <b>metaldehyde</b> which is not agricultural. Finally, leachate from another UK landfill site was also analysed for <b>metaldehyde</b> to determine how prevalent <b>metaldehyde</b> contamination could be across landfill and was found to be present well above the limit for drinking water...|$|E

40|$|<b>Metaldehyde</b> is {{a widely}} used {{molluscicide}} in countries where damage to crops from slugs and snails {{is a major problem}} associated with warm and wet winters. In the UK it is estimated that over 8 % of the area covered by arable crops is treated with formulated granular bait pellets containing <b>metaldehyde</b> as the main active ingredient. <b>Metaldehyde</b> is hydrophilic (log Kow= 0. 12), water soluble (200 mg·L(- 1) at 17 °C) and has been detected in UK surface waters in the concentration range of typically 0. 2 - 0. 6 μg·L(- 1) (maximum 2. 7 μg·L(- 1)) during 2008 - 2011. In the absence of chronic data on potential hazards to non-target freshwater molluscs, a laboratory study was conducted to investigate the impact of <b>metaldehyde</b> on embryo development in the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis (RENILYS strain) and using zinc as a positive control. L. stagnalis embryos were exposed to <b>metaldehyde</b> under semi-static conditions at 20 ± 1 °C and hatching success and growth (measured as shell height and intraocular distance) examined after 21 d. Exposure concentrations were verified using HPLC and gave 21 d (hatching) NOEC and (hatching) LOEC mean measured values of 36 and 116 mg MET·L(- 1), respectively (equal to the 21 d (shell height) NOEC and (shell height) LOEC values). For basic research purposes, a second group of L. stagnalis embryos was co-exposed to <b>metaldehyde</b> and the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Co-exposure to the PBO (measured concentrations between 0. 47 - 0. 56 mg·L(- 1)) reduced hatching success from 100 % to 47 % and resulted in a 30 % reduction in embryo growth (shell height) in snail embryos co-exposed to <b>metaldehyde</b> at 34 - 36 mg·L(- 1) over 21 d. In conclusion, these data suggest mollusc embryos may have some metabolic detoxication capacity for <b>metaldehyde</b> and further work is warranted to explore this aspect in order to support the recent initiative to include molluscs in the OECD test guideline programme...|$|E
40|$|<b>Metaldehyde</b> is a {{selective}} pesticide applied to control {{snails and slugs}} and which, particularly when application rates are high and during periods of high rainfall, may {{find its way into}} water courses, some of which may be used as drinking water supplies.

40|$|Sulfonic acid {{functionalized}} mesoporous silicas {{with various}} loadings of acid functionality were synthesized, characterized and applied as heterogeneous catalysts for {{the degradation of}} <b>metaldehyde,</b> a persistent organic pollutant in water supplies. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that acetaldehyde was the only by-product of catalytic degradation, and a detailed mechanism is proposed. Kinetic studies revealed that catalyst performance {{is related to the}} accessibility of <b>metaldehyde</b> to active sites, such that high sulfonic acid content is undesirable since it reduces pore size, and decreases pore volume and surface area. Acetaldehyde produced via catalytic degradation, was successfully removed via chemisorption on a second mesoporous silica adsorbent modified with amine functionalities. However, limited by the surface condensation reaction mechanism, mesoporous adsorbents are less desirable than macroporous materials, with respect to acetaldehyde removal, hence, a macroporous ion-exchange resin was employed, which showed much superior performance than the amine modified silica, with a maximum capacity up to 441 mg/g. A dual-stage method is proposed to completely remove <b>metaldehyde</b> from drinking water by initial degradation of <b>metaldehyde,</b> using sulfonic acid functionalized mesoporous silica, into a single by-product, acetaldehyde, removed via chemisorption on amine bearing macroporous ion-exchange resin.

40|$|AbstractCurrent water {{treatment}} technologies are inefficient at treating water contaminated with <b>metaldehyde,</b> an 8 -member cyclic tetramer of acetaldehyde widely {{used as a}} molluscicide in large-scale agriculture and in gardens, and which has been frequently observed to breach European regulatory limits in the UK due to its high solubility and frequent use. Here, we examine the controls on <b>metaldehyde</b> adsorption onto activated phenolic carbon, namely the influence of activation degree, pore size distribution, particle size, point of zero charge and surface functionalisation, by synthesising “tailored” carbons from phenolic resin. <b>Metaldehyde</b> adsorption {{has been found to}} be independent of specific surface area (SBET), which is highly unusual for an adsorption process, and is favoured in carbons with (a) high microporosity with narrow pore size distribution, (b) presence of mesopores which allow efficient diffusive transport, and (c) an absence of negatively charged functional groups. The maximum adsorption capacity of the phenolic resin-derived carbons, tested at an elevated (i. e. exceeding environmental levels) water concentration of 64  mg metaldehyde/L, was 76  mg metaldehyde/g carbon compared with 13  mg metaldehyde/g carbon in industrial granular activated carbon (GAC). The phenolic resin-derived carbons and GAC showed similar adsorption kinetics with maximum <b>metaldehyde</b> uptake occurring within 30  min under batch adsorption conditions, although adsorption isotherms indicate much stronger adsorption of <b>metaldehyde</b> on the phenolic resin-derived carbons.

40|$|A {{dual-stage}} {{method was}} developed to first efficaciously degrade <b>metaldehyde</b> into acetaldehyde, before subsequent removal of acetaldehyde using an amine functionalized ion-exchange resin. A range of Macronets, with different surface areas, pore volumes, pore size distributions and extents of functionalisation were evaluated for the depolymerisation of <b>metaldehyde.</b> NMR spectroscopy was used to confirm the compete degradation of <b>metaldehyde</b> by the selected Macronets. Kinetic studies showed that the rates of catalytic degradation were primarily determined by the porous structure of the materials rather than the extent of surface functionalization, since high levels of acid surface groups were observed to decrease the porosity significantly. The rate constants obtained show excellent correlation with non-micro pore volumes, which are of import as the only pores that are accessible to hydrogen bonded <b>metaldehyde</b> molecules; Macronet MN 502 exhibits the largest non-micro pore volume and, hence, demonstrated the best kinetic performance. The effect of competing ions on catalytic performance was also studied and the results demonstrate that competing ions compromise {{the performance of the}} proposed system to some extent, however, it is notable that a good level of performance is maintained even for competing ion concentrations as high as 100 times that of <b>metaldehyde.</b> Isothermal studies of acetaldehyde onto ion-exchange resin A 830, including kinetic evaluation, showed that acetaldehyde could be chemically adsorbed by the resin. Consequently, a dual-column system was proposed, which was determined to effectively degrade <b>metaldehyde</b> (MN 502) and remove the resulting by-product, acetaldehyde, via a second fixed bed absorber (A 830); this method could easily be adapted to existing facilities in water treatment works, making it very cost-effective and of great practical interest...|$|E
40|$|Pollutants via run-off {{into the}} ocean {{represent}} a potential threat to marine organisms, especially bivalves such as oysters living in coastal environments. These organisms filter large volumes of seawater and may accumulate contaminants within their tissues.

Although <b>metaldehyde</b> has been detected in surface waters, its effects on marine bivalves including the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have never been studied. Given the mode of action of this molecule and its targets (molluscs), it could be potentially more toxic to oysters than other pesticides (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, etc.).
