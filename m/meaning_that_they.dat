40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that transborder mobility {{is crucial to}} the way individuals relate to space and the <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> construct about it. Based on ethnographic work carried out in the Tijuana/San Diego and Tecún Umán/Tapachula border regions, an analysis is conducted {{of the relationship between the}} border region and the spatial mobility of its inhabitants. We conclude that there are at least four possible ways of constructing mobility in border contexts...|$|R

5|$|The spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical, hyaline (translucent), smooth, and have dimensions of 9–12 by 7–8µm. They are non-amyloid, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The spore-producing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, measure 38–46 by 3–13µm, and have clamps at their bases.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E

5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{can be applied}} to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use them to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E

However, they could still draw Bayern Munich, Roma or Juventus. In the end, Barcelona were drawn into Group C against Sporting CP, Basel and Shakhtar Donetsk.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.|$|E
5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups {{and examples of}} other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{skeletal}} features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons {{have been attributed}} to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.|$|E
40|$|The central {{position}} currently {{occupied by}} remittances in the economic fi eld has largely restricted its scope on the monetary dimension of them, setting aside their hidden complexity and {{the variety of}} forms, uses and <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can take.  In fact, the social dimension {{of different types of}} remittances, as mainly own social remittances, should be considered more as one of the most signifi cant effects of migration in relation to human development.

50|$|Categories may be {{described}} and named {{with regard to}} the type of <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are used to express. For example, the category of tense is considered to serve to express time of occurrence (as in past, present or future). However, purely grammatical features do not always correspond simply or consistently to elements of meaning, and different authors may take significantly different approaches in their terminology and analysis. For example, the meanings associated with the categories of tense, aspect and mood are often bound in up verb conjugation patterns that do not have separate grammatical elements corresponding to each of the three categories; see Tense-aspect-mood.|$|R
40|$|Drawing on a {{range of}} {{theoretical}} concepts originating from outside the field of African studies, this book offers the first thorough history of firearms in Central Africa between the early nineteenth and the early twentieth century. The book approaches the trajectory of firearms in Central Africa from a culturally sensitive perspective that embraces both the practical applications of guns and the set of values and <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have been taken to encompass. Intended as an exploration of the intersections between technology, society, politics and culture, it adopts a comparative perspective to chart, and account for, different user and potential user reactions to the same externally-introduced technology...|$|R
5|$|Microbats possess magnetoreception, in {{that they}} have a high {{sensitivity}} to Earth's magnetic field, similar to birds. However, microbats use a polarity-based compass, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> differentiate north from south, as opposed to birds which use the strength of the magnetic field to differentiate latitudes, which may be used in long-distance travel. Since microbats generally have poor eyesight, it is thought they use a magnetite-based method for orientation.|$|E
5|$|Much of the system's core, {{including}} the LWKT subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem {{and the new}} kernel memory allocator, are lockless, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> work without using mutexes, with each process operating on a single CPU. Critical sections are used to protect against local interrupts, individually for each CPU, guaranteeing that a thread currently being executed will not be preempted.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have been sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, {{either directly or indirectly}} (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and pathogenesis. The two subtypes are genetically distinct.|$|E
40|$|Far {{from having}} one sole meaning, a text always authorizes a {{plurality}} of readings. And the meaning attributed to a text always depends, at least partly, on the context wherein it is read. On this basis, social discourses - among which, more specifically, legal texts - appear as discourses which make sense only “in situation” The <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are supposed to convey are constructed (and negotiated) through processes in which two apparently heterogeneous types of doings - practices of interaction and practices of interpretation - appear as inseparable. The reason {{is that in the}} universe of legal intercourse and, more generally, of social interaction, the very production of meaning is, in itself, a way of acting...|$|R
5000|$|Second-Order Indexicality is {{concerned}} with the connection between linguistic variables and the metapragmatic <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> encode. For example, a woman is walking down the street in Manhattan and she stops to ask somebody where a McDonald's is. He responds to her talking in a heavy [...] "Brooklyn" [...] accent. She notices this accent and considers a set of possible personal characteristics that might be indexed by it (such as the man's intelligence, economic situation, and other non-linguistic aspects of his life). The power of language to encode these preconceived [...] "stereotypes" [...] based solely on accent is an example of second-order indexicality (representative of a more complex and subtle system of indexical form than that of first-order indexicality).|$|R
