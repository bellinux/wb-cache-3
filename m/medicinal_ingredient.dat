25|$|Opium as a <b>medicinal</b> <b>ingredient</b> was {{documented}} in Chinese texts {{as early as}} the Tang dynasty, but the recreational usage of the narcotic was limited. The Ming Dynasty had banned tobacco in 1640, and opium was seen as a similarly minor issue. The first restrictions of the drug were passed by the Qing in 1729 when Madak (blended opium and tobacco) was banned, at which time pure opium could only be found in small amounts due to it being difficult to preserve. Consumption of Javanese opium rose in the 18th century, and after the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the British occupying Java, British merchants became the primary traders in opium. The British realized they could reduce their trade deficit by counter-trading in narcotic opium, and as such efforts were made to produce more opium in the Indian colonies. Limited British sales of opium began in 1781, with exports to China increasing as the East India Company solidified its control over India.|$|E

Gandoerma lucidum is {{equipped}} with several kinds of bioactivity, and is considered as a very important <b>medicinal</b> <b>ingredient</b> of regimen and health care for Chinese medicine. This study has employed supercritical fluid extraction and fractionation device to continuously prepare ganoderic acid and phenolic compounds of ganoderma lucidum, and experiment design is conducted in coping with diverse pressure, temperature, and flow rate as experiments variables to conduct experiment design. Thus supercritical extraction is being employed to collect and extract different materials from sections, so that optimized trend of terms and conditions {{can be used to}} predict the test. As shown from the results, if lower temperature as 40 ˚C and high pressure 30 MPa are chosen, working in conjunction with flow rate of low sample 3 ml/min, it can reach the optimized effect of purification with regarding to ganoderic acid and phenolic compounds. If the concentration of fractionation liquid stays at 1. 0 g/L, its power of scavenging will be F 1 (60 %) ＞F 2 (50 %) ＞F 3 (30 %) ＞R(28 %), whereas half of the inhibition concentration will respectively be R(2. 67 g/L) ＞F 3 (2. 29 g/L) ＞F 2 (0. 97 g/L) ＞ F 1 (0. 76 g/L), and the antioxidant capacity of F 1 fractionation liquid is considered the best...|$|E

Rhein has various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, antifibrosis, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective activities. Although more than 100 articles in PubMed {{are involved in the}} pharmacological mechanism of action of rhein, only a few focus on the relationship of crosstalk among multiple pharmacological mechanisms. The mechanism of rhein involves multiple pathways which contain close interactions. From the overall perspective, the pathways which are related to the targets of rhein, are initiated by the membrane receptor. Then, MAPK and PI 3 K-AKT parallel signaling pathways are activated, and several downstream pathways are affected, thereby eventually regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. The therapeutic effect of rhein, as a multitarget molecule, is the synergistic and comprehensive result of the involvement of multiple pathways rather than the blocking or activation of a single signaling pathway. We review the pharmacological mechanisms of action of rhein by consulting literature published in the last 100 years in PubMed. We then summarize these pharmacological mechanisms from a comprehensive, interactive, and crosstalk perspective. In general, the molecular mechanism of action of drug must be understood from a systematic and holistic perspective, which can provide a theoretical basis for precise treatment and rational drug use...|$|E
40|$|Rehmannia glutinosa, {{a famous}} Chinese {{medicinal}} plant, is {{not suitable for}} consecutive monoculture, because there are autotoxic metabolites excreted by its tuberous roots, which can greatly limit the plant growth and development. In this research, cultivar “Wen 85 - 5 ” R. glutinosa under three different cultivation modes, including the newly planted, the two-year and three-year consecutively monocultured, {{was used in the}} field test. The differential expression of leaf proteins, physiological changes and corresponding medicinal quality of tuberous roots at the early tuberous root enlargement stage were detected and compared in different years of consecutive monoculture. The results showed that consecutive monoculture resulted in decrement of chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity and root activity, but increases in free radicals and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the content of catalpol, the main <b>medicinal</b> <b>ingredient</b> in R. glutinosa tuberous roots was analyzed by FTIR and HPLC. The result showed that consecutive monoculture resulted in declined medicinal ingredients. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed 20 differentially expressed protein spots in response to increasing years of monoculture. Among them, ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) kinase, Rubisco, sedoheptulose- 1, 7 -bisphosphatase related to Calvin cycle, and other proteins, i. e. proteasome, malonyl CoA-ACP transferase, antioxidases, pathogenesis-related protein and mRNA-binding protein were down-regulated with increasing years of monoculture. While energy metabolism related proteins (ATP synthase subunit β, ATPase, ATP-binding protein) and stress response related proteins (heat shock proteins) were up-regulated. Therefore it was concluded that consecutive monoculture of R. glutinosa remarkably affected the physiological reactions and induced the changes in the expression of leaf proteins, this in turn had a negative impact on the biomass and its quality of the medicinal plants...|$|E
40|$|Artemisia annua ? a plant {{cure for}} malaria Cue: The {{development}} of pharmaceutical drugs {{from the plant}} Artemisia annua {{has been one of}} the most exciting recent developments in plant-based medicine. Originating from China, artemisia is now being grown in East Africa, often by farmers who have left behind other cash crops such as tobacco. Having a plant-based malaria cure is of course nothing new. Quinine drugs, still used in some areas, are derived from the bark of a tree, the cinchona, which is a native of South America. But there are hopes that widespread cultivation of artemisia, combined with simpler methods for producing medicines, could offer great benefits in the treatment of malaria in Africa, at substantially lower costs. In Tanzania, farmers are growing the plant on behalf of a private company, African Artemisia. The leaves are then taken to Nairobi, where the <b>medicinal</b> <b>ingredient,</b> called artemisinin, is extracted. This is then exported to Europe for manufacture into drugs. Lazarus Laiser spoke to Peter Masawe about how small-scale farmers in Tanzania are involved in artemisia production. IN:		?We are planting this crop ? OUT:		? And also it is a malaria cure. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Peter Masawe of African Artemisia. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Masawe	We are planting this crop for curing malaria, and in Tanzania we have many places where we are growing artemisia. Laiser	You said artemisia is used to cure malaria. Is it that a person just takes direct the leaves or how is it? Masawe	No, no. After cropping it we transport our leaves to our factory, and there we undergo the crystalisation. And then we export those crystals to Europe. After that, the medicine can come back to cure malaria. Laiser	How did these farmers get involved in it? Masawe	In some areas we have the contact farmers who are helping the farmers how to grow artemisia. And these contact farmers are under an agricultural advisor, and the agricultural advisors are under an area manager. And the area manager is under the country director. All these are the services of helping farmers how to grow artemisia. Laiser	Now let us think of the quality, and also safety in cultivation. How is this controlled? Masawe 	Artemisia, as we said, is curing malaria, so we do not allow anyone to apply any chemical on this plant. You are not allowed. Laiser		So what else can be used to protect the crop? Masawe 	Yes, actually with this crop we are getting a problem at the earliest stage of the crop. When we transplant it you can find the cut-worms, maybe for a short time, about one month. So what we tell the farmer to apply is pyrethrum powder, and this pyrethrum powder you can dry it, and then you grind it and then you use that powder just around the stem, just a little bit. And then you will finish the problem of cut-worms. And management of getting the good quality is starting from the point of harvesting. We have two ways of harvesting. First we have plucking, but now we are not encouraging the plucking because it gives us the lowest artemisinin content. Now we are going with chopping the crop completely from the field, and then the crop will become dry. We start sieving it after hitting the leaves, and then we remove the stalks, and then the farmer is supposed to put the artemisia in the bags from ?African Artemisia?. Because maybe the bags which they can use have been contaminated with other things. So we provide the bags to the farmer. Mind you, before we were just harvesting this crop after 10 months. But now we are telling the farmer that we have to harvest this crop after 5 to 6 months and not more. Because from 8, 9 to 10 months this crop tends to lose artemisinin content, and this makes even the farmer not to get the profit which he is supposed to get. So this is what we are doing now. Laiser	How about the rain? How much rain is needed? Masawe	Artemisia needs enough water during the transplanting, about 2 - 3 months mainly, and then after that there is no problem. But other farmers also who are having irrigation can grow this crop for 2 seasons per year, so you see the benefit the farmer is getting. Planting this crop in the area where the altitude is low, this plant will pre-flower earlier, so high altitude is better for this crop. Laiser	Which other parts of the region, for example in Africa, are growing artemisia? Masawe	I know China are dealing with this crop, and it is the place where it started. But here, I know Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. Laiser	What else can you say about artemisia generally, to the listeners who are listening to us now? Masawe	I can say, let us mobilize farmers to get into artemisia growing in those areas which are conducive of growing artemisia, by looking at the altitude, even the soil type. This will make people to get enough money, it is a cash crop. And also it is a malaria cure. End of track. Advice and support on cultivation, harvesting and post-harvest handling for farmers who are growing Artemisia annua...|$|E
