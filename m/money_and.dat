40|$|For Fiji, {{which has}} been {{suffering}} persistent deficits since independence, determining the relationships between inflation, budget deficits, <b>money</b> supply, output, <b>and</b> import prices is essential. We find that inflation, deficits <b>and</b> <b>money</b> supply are cointegrated when inflation is the endogenous variable, and the long-run elasticities confirm that <b>money</b> supply <b>and</b> deficits induce inflation. While there is a short-run, unidirectional causality running from money supply to inflation and a bi-directional causality between <b>money</b> supply <b>and</b> budget deficits, {{in the long run}} both <b>money</b> supply <b>and</b> deficits &# 039;Granger-cause&# 039; inflation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{account for the}} U. S. Fed's {{response}} to money demand shocks by allowing for less-than-complete accommodation in the estimation of its money supply policy rule. We estimate a significantly lower degree of money accommodation in the 1979 - 1982 period than before and after. We identify the path of <b>money</b> demand <b>and</b> <b>money</b> supply shocks <b>and</b> show their effects on the <b>money</b> market, output <b>and</b> inflation. Both <b>money</b> demand <b>and</b> <b>money</b> supply shocks have been considerably less destabilizing since 1984. We also find that monetary policy was significantly pro-cyclical in the 70 s. Additionally, the price puzzle disappears {{for two of the}} three subperiods considered in the study...|$|R

Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the <b>money</b> <b>and</b> Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test the {{existence}} of long-term relationship between <b>money</b> supply <b>and</b> inflation, <b>money</b> supply <b>and</b> GDP <b>and</b> <b>money</b> supply <b>and</b> unemployment. Three independent panel cointegration regressions are evaluated where money supply is the explanatory variable, while inflation, GDP and unemployment rates occur as dependent variables. The sample consists of 17 countries (Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States). The data are annual and refer to the period from 1990 to 2013. The results of the empirical analysis in this paper {{show that there is}} no significant long-term relationship between inflation <b>and</b> <b>money</b> supply, while there is statistically significant long-term relationship between GDP <b>and</b> <b>money</b> supply, as well as between unemployment rates <b>and</b> the <b>money</b> supply...|$|R
