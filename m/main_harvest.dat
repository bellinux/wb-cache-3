At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking {{cherries}} by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|R

Ample food and freedom from the necessity to work in the fields are two central features of harvest festivals: eating, merriment, contests, music and romance are common features of harvest festivals around the world.|$|E
50|$|Cambodia has two rice crops each year, a monsoon-season crop (long-cycle) and a dry-season crop. The major monsoon crop is {{planted in}} late May through July, {{when the first}} rains of the monsoon season begin to inundate and soften the land. Rice shoots are transplanted from late June through September. The <b>main</b> <b>harvest</b> is usually {{gathered}} six months later, in December. The dry-season crop is smaller, and it takes less time to grow (three months from planting to harvest). It is planted in November in areas that have trapped or retained part of the monsoon rains, and it is harvested in January or February. The dry-season crop seldom exceeds 15 {{percent of the total}} annual production.|$|E

5000|$|Millet {{extended}} the idea from landscape to figures [...] - [...] peasant figures, scenes of peasant life, {{and work in}} the fields. In The Gleaners (1857), for example, Millet portrays three peasant women working at the harvest. Gleaners are poor people who are permitted to gather the remains after the owners of the field complete the <b>main</b> <b>harvest.</b> The owners (portrayed as wealthy) and their laborers are seen {{in the back of the}} painting. Millet shifted the focus and the subject matter from the rich and prominent to those at the bottom of the social ladders. To emphasize their anonymity and marginalized position, he hid their faces. The women's bowed bodies represent their everyday hard work.|$|E
5000|$|Potatoes {{are planted}} in Prince Edward Island {{starting}} in early May each year. [...] "New potatoes" [...] are harvested starting in June {{and continue to}} be harvested during the growing season, primarily for local production. The <b>main</b> <b>harvest</b> begins in late September and usually continues until early November. Fresh market potatoes are usually harvested first, with Russet varieties normally harvested later in the season. Among the most popular varieties grown in Prince Edward Island are Russet Burbank, Goldrush, Superior, Yukon Gold, Red Norland, and a number of proprietary varieties. Over 100 varieties of potatoes are grown in Prince Edward Island. Potatoes generally marketed as Russet, Round White, Yellow Fleshed, Red, or Specialty varieties.|$|E
50|$|Jimbu is an herb {{belonging}} to the onion family, used extensively in some regions of Nepal and in some central Himalayan districts of India, like Kumaun, where it is called Jamboo. It is composed of two species of Allium, A. hypsistum and A. przewalskianum. The herb, which has a taste in between onion and chives, is most commonly used dried. In the Mustang district of Nepal, {{it is used to}} flavor vegetables, pickles, meat. In the rest of Nepal it is most commonly used to flavor urad dal or lentils. The dried leaves are fried in ghee to develop their flavor. After harvest, people store Jimbu dried for later use since it is a seasonal herb (<b>main</b> <b>harvest</b> between June and September).|$|E

50|$|Crop {{rotation}} in the soudanian zone traditionally {{begins with}} sorghum or millet {{in the first}} year. Mixed crops of sorghum and-or millet, with peanuts, legumes, or tubers, are then cultivated for approximately three years. Farmers then return the land to fallow for periods up to fifteen years, turning to different fields for the next cycle. Preparation of a field begins with cutting heavy bush and unwanted low trees or branches that are then laid on the ground. Collectively owned lands are parceled out during the dry season, and the fields are burned just {{before the onset of}} the first rains, usually around March. Farmers work most intensively during the rains between May and October, planting, weeding and protecting the crops from birds and animals. Harvesting begins in September and October with the early varieties of sorghum. The <b>main</b> <b>harvest</b> occurs in November and December. Farmers harvest crops of rice and berebere, the hardiest of Chad's varieties of millet, grown along receding water courses, as late as February.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{origin of}} festivals is {{religion}}. Every religion has its rituals, celebrations and traditions maintained during time. The most important religious festivals such as Christmas, Hanukkah, Diwali serve {{to mark out}} the year. Among many religion a feast or festival {{is a set of}} celebration in honour of God or gods and they recur annually.Other festivals have an agricultural origin: a harvest festival is an annual celebration and occurs {{around the time of the}} <b>main</b> <b>harvest</b> of a given region, celebrating seasonal changes. An example is Thanksgiving Day, a national holiday celebrated in Canada and the United States. Festivals are celebrated since ancient time: people met each other and shared the same motivations, in particular they shared the same spiritual significance of festivals. People gave a great importance to this kind of celebration, especially to religious ones. Many festivals have a very ancient history: for example festival in India is an essential topic because it leaves a special significance about culture and true Indian faith. The celebrations are also now a moment of remembrance, marking the rites of birth, death and renewal.|$|E
50|$|There were 378 ethanol plants {{operating}} in Brazil by July 2008, 126 dedicated to ethanol production and 252 producing both sugar and ethanol. There are 15 additional plants dedicated exclusively to sugar production. These plants have an installed capacity of crushing 538 {{million metric tons}} of sugarcane per year, and there are 25 plants under construction expected to be on line by 2009 that will add an additional capacity of crushing 50 million tons of sugarcane per year. The typical plant costs approximately US$150 million and requires a nearby sugarcane plantation of 30,000 hectares.Ethanol production is concentrated in the Central and Southeast regions of the country, led by São Paulo state, with around 60% of the country's total ethanol production, followed by Paraná (8%), Minas Gerais (8%) and Goiás (5%). These two regions {{have been responsible for}} 90% of Brazil's ethanol production since 2005 and the harvest season goes from April to November. The Northeast Region is responsible for the remaining 10% of ethanol production, led by Alagoas with 2% of total production. The harvest season in the North-Northeast region goes from September to March, and the average productivity in this region is lower than the South-Central region. Due to the difference in the two <b>main</b> <b>harvest</b> seasons, Brazilian statistics for sugar and ethanol production are commonly reported on a harvest two-year basis rather than on a calendar year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{autonomous}} end-to-end 2. 4 GHz RF energy harvesting and storage system. The {{system is designed}} to collect ultra-low power RF input energy and automatically store it into a battery. Previous {{work in this area}} required a pushbutton switch for full functionality [...] RF energy is first stored in a capacitor and manually transferred into a battery. In this work, in addition to the main harvester, an auxiliary control system is developed to replace the pushbutton and achieve fully autonomous energy harvesting and storage. Two design approaches are proposed for the control system. The tradeoffs of each technique will be discussed. The designed control systems were integrated into the <b>main</b> <b>harvesting</b> structure. Experimental results indicate that the system autonomously stores 241 µJ into a NiMH battery after 30 minutes with an incident power (at the feedpoint of the antenna) of- 21 dBm...|$|R
