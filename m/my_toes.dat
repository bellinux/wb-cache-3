[...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he {{introduced}} himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch <b>my</b> <b>toes.</b> [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E
500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. [...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on <b>my</b> <b>toes</b> and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E

Angelina {{is getting}} into a bit of shenanigans and trouble along the way, {{just to make sure}} people are on their toes." [...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on <b>my</b> <b>toes.</b> I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reluctant {{to discuss}} the extreme poverty of his youth, Abraham quoted Gray's Elegy in 1860, saying his life [...] could be summed up as [...] "The short and simple annals of the poor." [...] Without the food and {{clothing}} that they needed, they were considered among the [...] "very poorest people" [...] while in Kentucky. Abraham recounted years later, in a discussion with homeless boys in New York, {{that he had been}} poor and could remember [...] "when <b>my</b> <b>toes</b> stuck out through my broken shoes in the winter; when my arms were out at the elbows; when I shivered with the cold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Police held Verburgh for 48hours of questionings and beatings that {{severely}} injured him, including a separated shoulder. Throughout, Verburgh denied {{involvement in the}} murder. Verburgh's Janitor Union lawyer got Verburgh released on a writ of habeas corpus. Verburgh said of the experience:Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms, they are sore. They had handcuffs on me for hours and hours. They threw me in the cell and blindfolded me. They handcuffed my hands behind my back and pulled me up on bars until <b>my</b> <b>toes</b> touched the floor. I no eat, I go to the hospital. Oh, I am so sick. Any more and I would have confessed to anything.|$|E
2500|$|Nadeau {{was born}} on September 9, 1970, {{and grew up in}} Danbury, Connecticut. His parents were Gerald Joseph, a roofer, and veteran in the United States Army (1944–2007) and Pauline Cyr Nadeau. Nadeau's {{ancestors}} originate from St. John's Valley, Maine. He has one sister, Debbie. Nadeau was educated at Henry Abbott Technical High School and studied automotive technology. His family had connections to auto racing; Gerald raced modifieds at the Danbury Race Arena. Nadeau was given a go-kart by his father when he was four and one-half years old. He also worked with his father in the construction industry to support his career. Speaking about his father's role in his career, Nadeau said, [...] "I learned a lot from my dad, Gerry, while I was growing up. He wasn't afraid to yell and get on <b>my</b> <b>toes</b> to do my job because he hated to lose and I hated to lose. He made me the hungriest guy on the race track." ...|$|E

That year he also publicly reflected on {{his career in}} law enforcement writing two articles for the Saturday Evening Post - a two part series Crime was my business. In it of his twenty five years in police work he said [...] "It's {{a long time to}} last without becoming a cynic" [...] and:During some of those years I was ridden by fear of being double-crossed out of my job by politicians. Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. And after I got to be chief, there was never a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on <b>my</b> <b>toes</b> to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.|$|E

40|$|Our {{preoccupation with}} pain can seem an {{eccentricity}} of philosophers. But {{just a little}} reflection leads one into the thickets. When I see a pencil on my desk, I’m aware of a physical thing and its objective properties; but what am I aware of when I feel a pain in <b>my</b> <b>toe?</b> A pain, perhaps? Or <b>my</b> <b>toe’s</b> hurting? But {{what is the nature}} of such things? Are they physical? Are they objective? To avoid unexperienced pains, we might say they are subjective, or are themselves experiences. But do those with hurting toes therefore have experiences in their feet? The issues rapidly proliferate. Many of them are addressed in this interesting collection of original essays by philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists, edited by Murat Aydede...|$|R

2500|$|Pittsburgh got {{the ball}} back on their own 22-yard line with 2:37 {{left in the game}} and two timeouts remaining. On their first play, a holding penalty pushed them back 10 yards. Roethlisberger then {{completed}} a pass to Holmes for 14 yards. After an incompletion, Roethlisberger threw it to Holmes again for a first down. An 11-yard reception by Nate Washington followed, and a 4-yard run by Roethlisberger forced the Steelers to burn their first timeout. On the very next play, he completed a pass to Holmes, who took it 40 yards to the Cardinals' 6-yard line after safety Aaron Francisco fell down. Two plays later, Roethlisberger found Mewelde Moore covered in the flat, then Ward covered. He looked and then threw to Holmes, who ran a flag route in the right corner. Holmes caught the pass in the back corner of the end zone for a touchdown, managing to land with his toes inbounds before falling out of bounds. [...] "My feet never left the ground," [...] said Holmes. [...] "All I did was extend my arms and use <b>my</b> <b>toes</b> as an extension to catch up to the ball." [...] After a booth review, the touchdown pass stood. Reed's ensuing extra point put the Steelers in front 27–23 with 35 seconds remaining. Following the ensuing kickoff, Warner completed a 20-yard pass to Fitzgerald and a 13-yarder to J. J. Arrington, moving the ball to the Steelers 44. With 15 seconds left, Warner prepared to attempt a Hail Mary pass, but linebacker LaMarr Woodley forced a fumble while sacking Warner. Defensive end Brett Keisel recovered the fumble, giving the ball back to Pittsburgh with five seconds left. [...] Many viewers assumed that the play had not been reviewed for a possible incomplete pass, but NFL Head of Officiating Mike Pereira later explained that it actually was reviewed, unnoticed by the public: [...] "We confirmed it was a fumble. The replay assistant in the replay booth saw it was clearly a fumble. The ball got knocked loose and was rolling in his hand before it started forward. He has to have total control." [...] It was the first and only Super Bowl in which Warner was involved not to be decided on the final play of the game. Roethlisberger took a knee, securing the Steelers' sixth Super Bowl victory and surpassing the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers to set a new NFL record for most Super Bowl wins by a team.|$|E
