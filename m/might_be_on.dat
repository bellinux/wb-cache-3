5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that the symphony <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{could only}} be valid if intelligence assessments were correct. To German intelligence, {{it seemed as if}} the RAF <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of collapse. The attacks on London, thus far, seemed to confirm the assumption. None of the Luftwaffe bomber formations had encountered the well organised, effective and ferocious defence that had characterised the battles in August 1940. If the German intelligence was correct, then by striking against vital choke points in London that the RAF would be forced to defend, the Luftwaffe had the opportunity to destroy the remaining RAF fighter forces. Not only would the attacks allow for the attainment of air superiority, they would eliminate a vital rail network, destroy shipping and supplies brought in from North America, and affect civilian morale by demonstrating London’s vulnerability to air power.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E

25|$|One {{drawback}} to any DF system using loop antennae {{is that the}} antenna is equally sensitive on both the front and the back, so {{there is always a}} 180 degree ambiguity in the measurements - the transmitter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> either side of the antenna. To address this, many DF systems added an additional antenna, the sense antenna (unrelated to the sense coil).|$|E

However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44-38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly {{there is}} no {{inclusion}} of imaging parameters such as slice thickness or interslice distance and lesion size is also {{not part of the}} assessment. This does in the authors’ opinion introduce an element of chance into the assessment. A single lesion of the same size <b>might</b> <b>be</b> visualised <b>on</b> one or two slices depending on its position relative to the centre of the slice, i.e. if it <b>is</b> central it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>on</b> one slice only, if it falls onto the border of two slices it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>on</b> two slices and therefore fulfil the diagnostic criteria for sacroiliitis. Or putting it another way, the thinner the slices the higher the chance of diagnosing sacroiliitis.|$|R

25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children do. This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of self or self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} tool {{in this effort}} was HUD's first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter {{at least once in}} a three-month period. Through the data collection for the report, and the subsequent analysis of that data, HUD learned {{a great deal about the}} demographics of homelessness. Prior to the report,according to Jackson, HUD had a hard time figuring out if national or local programs were working and a tough time just trying to figure out where the homeless <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a given night.|$|E
25|$|The 15ampere (A) sockets were {{generally}} given a dedicated 15A circuit. Multiple 5A sockets <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a 15A circuit, or each {{on a dedicated}} 5A circuit. Lighting circuits fused at 5A {{were generally}} used to feed the 2A sockets. Adaptors were available from 15A down to 5A and from 5A down to 2A so in practice {{it was possible for}} an appliance with the smallest size of flex to be protected only by a 15A fuse. This is a similar level of protection to that seen for portable appliances in other countries, but less than the protection offered by the BS1363 fused plug.|$|E

25|$|Massachusetts {{psychologist}} Robert Mendoza {{was hired}} by Rader's court-appointed public defenders to conduct a psychological evaluation for Rader, and determine if an insanity-based defense might be viable. He conducted an interview after Rader pleaded guilty on June 27. NBC claimed Rader knew the interview <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> TV, but this was false according to the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Department. Rader mentioned the interview during his sentencing statement. On October 25, 2005, the Kansas attorney general filed a petition to sue Mendoza and Tali Waters, co-owners of Cambridge Forensic Consultants, LLC, for breach of contract, claiming that they intended to benefit financially {{from the use of}} information obtained through involvement in Rader's defense. On May 10, 2007, Mendoza settled the case for US$30,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through {{the glare of the}} stage lights, was worried that the crowd <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E
25|$|International {{experts have}} also {{weighed in on}} the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazil’s nuclear program. Hans Rühle, a former official from the German defense ministry who also worked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the path toward getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, {{and the fact that}} Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While Rühle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazil’s relations with Iran and defense of the Iranian nuclear program should be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants to tread. Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{a stroke}} {{affecting}} the right parietal lobe {{of the brain}} can lead to neglect for {{the left side of}} the visual field, causing a patient with neglect to behave as if the left side of sensory space is nonexistent (although they can still turn left). In an extreme case, a patient with neglect might fail to eat the food on the left half of their plate, even though they complain of being hungry. If someone with neglect is asked to draw a clock, their drawing might show only the numbers 12 to 6, or all 12 numbers <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> one half of the clock face with the other half distorted or blank. Neglect patients may also ignore the contralesional side of their body; for instance, they might only shave, or apply make-up to, the non-neglected side. These patients may frequently collide with objects or structures such as door frames on the side being neglected.|$|E

Daniel becomes jealous when she starts dating Caspar Smythe (Barton Welch) and his feelings for her clear. Imogen and Daniel begin a relationship and he supports her {{when her parents}} separate. Daniel moves in with the Brennan brothers at Number 24. He runs a suspended coffee scheme at Off Air, which leads to him being attacked by a homeless man who misinterprets Daniel's attempt to wake him. Daniel refuses to report the man, but he is clearly affected by the incident and displays unusual behaviour. He later takes his anger out on Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson). Off Air is closed when Daniel struggles {{to keep up with}} the payments, and Paul refuses to give him a loan. Daniel finds Aaron and Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) searching through Paul's personal computer files, and they find Paul's plans for a housing estate surrounding Erinsborough High.

500|$|Like {{previous}} performers, Madonna was {{not paid}} for the show. According to Zack O'Malley Greenburg of Forbes, [...] "Typically, the entertainers for the Super Bowl do not get a cash payment ... This {{is the kind of}} exposure that entertainers would give their right arm for; they could do 20 Leno and Letterman appearances and still not reach that [...] audience". Greenburg wrote that with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a total value of $84 million for Madonna's enterprises and the singer did not have to pay for accommodations, travel, backup dancers, stage setup, advertising and publicity: [...] "Given all these benefits, playing the Super Bowl halftime show for free is more than worth the trouble. In fact, it's incredibly lucrative– and such a good deal for artists that some suspect a major change <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the horizon".|$|E
