Impacts produce particulate matter originating from either the projectile, the target, or both. Particles heated from the force of impact can burn {{in the presence of}} air (oxidizer).

The vaporific effect is particularly pronounced when these enclosures are constructed of pyrophoric metals (metals that react upon contact with air, such as aluminium, magnesium, or their alloys).
