25|$|Coming {{out of the}} 90s, ecofeminism <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{criticism}} from anti-essentialist feminism, which heavily critiqued what they viewed as essentialism.

Feminist thoughts surrounding ecofeminism grew in some areas as it was criticized; vegetarian ecofeminism contributed intersectional analysis; and ecofeminisms that analyzed animal rights, labor rights and activisms as they could draw lines among oppressed groups. To some, the inclusion of non-human animals also became {{to be viewed as}} essentialist. According to ecofeminist and author Charlene Spretnak, modern ecofeminism is concerned about a variety of issues, including reproductive technology, equal pay and equal rights, toxic poisoning, Third World development, and more.|$|E

5000|$|Stallone {{later said}} [...] "the director's cut was <b>met</b> with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> disapproval at the {{screening}} and received some alarmingly low scores.

By the way, the 2nd unit crew that filmed the majority of the action was extraordinary." ...|$|R
