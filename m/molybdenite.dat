5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural <b>molybdenite</b> and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by seaborgium) for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his <b>molybdenite</b> samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium. His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMolybdenum (Mo) {{isotopes}} {{are frequently}} used to investigate ocean and lake (paleo-) redox conditions. In {{the frame of}} mineral ressources, only {{few studies have been}} performed regarding Mo-Re-Os isotopes. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the source, processes and mobility of metals concentrations using Mo isotopes on <b>molybdenites</b> in different ore deposits. The present study focuses on the Azegour skarn (Morocco). Located in the High-Atlas, the Azegour site is one of the rare Mo-W-Cu exploited skarns (three historic mines). It is formed by a granitic intrusion (271 ± 3 Ma) in cambrian volcano-sedimentary serie composed by schists, volcanic complex (andesites, pyroclastites) and carbonate formations (calcareous and dolomites). The skarn takes place in the carbonate formations where pyroxenites and grenatites occured. The grenatites being the Mo-bearing minerals in the form of <b>molybdenites.</b> <b>Molybdenites</b> sampling has been performed in the main mine (Azegour) and in the Tizgui mine (1 km north of the Azegour mine). The Mo isotopic composition has been determined on <b>molybdenites</b> using a MC-ICP-MS Neptune after aquaregia dissolution and adjustment to [Mo] = 1 µg. g- 1. The δ 97 / 95 Mo ratios have been normalized to NBS 3134 and a reproducibility of 0. 07 ‰ (2 σ) is reached. Presently, we have analysed 12 <b>molybdenites</b> from Azegour and 2 from Tizgui and 14 others are in progress. Regarding the first 14 samples, the δ 97 / 95 MoNBS ratios vary between - 0. 40 and 0. 32 ‰ for Azegour and between 0. 08 and 0. 30 ‰ for Tizgui. It is worth noting that variations can occur either at the whole site (difference of about 0. 72 ‰) but also at the cm scale in the same sample (here the largest observed difference is up to 0. 40 ‰). Regarding the Azegour skarn, there is no direct relationship for explaining the Mo fractionation in molydbenites between the facies or the two sites of sampling. Different processes will be discussed to explain the observed variability (redox conditions prevaling during the molydbenites deposits, late metamophism phase [...] .). Further investigations using Pb and S isotopic compositions will help deciphering the oxidation state and the origin of <b>molybdenites</b> regarding the possible different fluids...|$|R

5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of <b>molybdenite</b> and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in <b>molybdenite</b> along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as <b>molybdenite</b> and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is the 54th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust and the 25th {{most abundant}} element in its oceans, {{with an average of}} 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is <b>molybdenite</b> (MoS2).

40|$|Mafic microgranular {{enclaves}} (MME) {{were formed}} in felsic ore-bearing porphyries from the Zhireken por-phyry Mo-Cu deposit, eastern Transbaikalia, Russia. Porphyry rocks were emplaced during the Upper Jurassic. Most of the enclaves are globular, oval-shaped and intermediate in composition (54 % SiO 2).

Higher contents of Pd (684 ppb) and Pt (299 ppb) in <b>molybdenites</b> of the Zhireken deposit, as well as high temperatures (1020 - 910 °C) of formation of porphyry rock melt inclusions, indirectly suggest a contribution from mafic melt derived from the mantle...|$|R
40|$|R]-IEI~IUM is an {{extremely}} rare element and a magnitude of c. 5 X 10 - 4 ppm for its abundance in igneous rocks has been assessed recently (Morris aud Short, 1965).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{high temperature}} Mo isotope fractionation in a hydrous supra-subduction volcano-plutonic system (Kos, Aegean Arc, Greece) {{in order to}} address the debate on the δ 98 / 95 Mo variability of the continental crust. In this igneous system, where differentiation is interpreted to be dominated by fractional crystallization, bulk rock data from olivine basalt to dacite show δ 98 / 95 Mo ratios increasing from + 0. 3 to + 0. 6 ‰ along with Mo concentrations increasing from 0. 8 to 4. 1 μg g− 1. Data for hornblende and biotite mineral separates reveal the extraction of light Mo into crystallizing silicates, with minimum partition coefficients between hornblende- silicate melt and biotite-silicate melt of 0. 6 and 0. 4 δ 98 / 95 Mo, respectively. Our data document significant Mo isotope fractionation at magmatic temperatures, hence, the igneous contribution to continental runoff is variable, besides probable source-related variability. Based on these results and published data an average continental δ 98 / 95 Mo of + 0. 3 to + 0. 4 ‰ can be derived. This signature corresponds more closely to the average of published data of dissolved Mo loads of large rivers than previous estimates and is consistent with an upper limit of δ 98 / 95 Mo = 0. 4 ‰ of the Earth's upper crust as derived from the analysis of <b>molybdenites...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{observations}} of natural mass-dependent fractionation of the isotopic composition of molybdenum (Mo), using multi-collector {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry. Variations in the isotopic composition of Mo are reported as δ 97 / 95 Mo analytical precision of δ 97 / 95 Mo is 1 ‰ between sediments deposited under anoxic conditions (δ 97 / 95 Mo = + 1. 02 to + 1. 52 ‰ 0 relative to our in-house standard) and ferromanganese nodules (δ 97 / 95 Mo = - 0. 63 to - 0. 42 ‰). δ 97 / 95 Mo of Pacific Ocean seawater (δ 97 / 95 Mo = + 1. 48 ‰) lies {{within the range of}} values for anoxic sediments, closest to modern Black Sea anoxic sediments. <b>Molybdenites</b> from continental ore deposits have intermediate δ 97 / 95 Mo ranging from - 0. 26 to + 0. 09 ‰. Variations in the abundances of 92 Mo, 95 Mo, 96 Mo, 97 Mo and 98 Mo are consistent with mass-dependent fractionation. A sporadic unidentified interference occurs at mass 94 and 100 Mo is not measured. We hypothesize that the δ 97 / 95 Mo offset between anoxic sediments and ferromanganese nodules results from Mo isotope fractionation during inefficient scavenging of Mo from seawater by Mn oxides under oxic conditions. The similarity in δ 97 / 95 Mo of anoxic sediments and seawater is consistent with the very efficient removal of Mo from seawater under anoxic conditions in the presence of H 2 S. The data can be interpreted in terms of a steady-state mass balance between the Mo flux into the oceans from the continents and the Mo flux out of the oceans into oxic and anoxic sediments. Such an interpretation is quantitatively consistent with existing estimates of the removal fluxes of Mo to anoxic and oxic sediments. These findings suggest that δ 97 / 95 Mo in seawater may co-vary with changes in the relative proportions of anoxic and oxic sedimentation in the oceans, and that this variation may be recorded in δ 97 / 95 Mo of anoxic sediments. Hence, the Mo isotope system may be useful in paleoredox investigations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|The sulfide {{minerals}} are {{chemical compounds}} {{of one or}} more metals or semimetals with a sulfur; tellurium, arsenic, or selenium can substitute for the sulfur. Sulfides tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity. Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits. Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1. Many sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores; examples include sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, galena (PbS), an ore of lead, cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, and <b>molybdenite</b> (MoS2, an ore of molybdenum. Pyrite (FeS2), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid. Related to the sulfides are the rare sulfosalts, in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as antimony, arsenic, or bismuth. Like the sulfides, sulfosalts are typically soft, heavy, and brittle minerals.|$|E
