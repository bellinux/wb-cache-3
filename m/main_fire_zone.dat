40|$|The most cost {{effective}} method of reducing {{nitrogen oxide emissions}} when burning fossil fuels, such as coal, is through in-furnace NOx reduction processes. ABB Combustion Engineering, Inc. (ABB CE), through its ABB Power Plant Laboratories {{has been involved in}} the development of such low NOx pulverized coal firing systems for many years. This development effort is most recently demonstrated through ABB CE`s involvement with the U. S. Department of Energy`s (DOE) {open_quotes}Engineering Development of Advanced Coal Fired Low-Emission Boiler Systems{close_quotes} (LEBS) project. The goal of the DOE LEBS project is to use {open_quotes}near term{close_quotes} technologies to produce a commercially viable, low emissions boiler. This paper addresses one of the key technologies within this project, the NOx control subsystem. The foundation for the work undertaken at ABB CE is the TFS 2000 {trademark} firing system, which is currently offered on a commercial basis. This system encompasses sub-stoichiometric combustion in the <b>main</b> <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> for reduced NOx formation. Potential enhancements to this firing system focus on optimizing the introduction of the air and fuel within the primary windbox to provide additional horizontal and vertical staging. As is the case with all in-furnace NOx control processes, it is necessary to operate the system in a manner which does not decrease NOx at the expense of reduced combustion efficiency...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} improve the flexural strength and fracture toughness of ceramics, two methods {{can be used}} to control the growth rate of grain during sintering of ceramic materials by adding a certain amount of (W,Ti)C material. Therefore, on the one hand, the paper simulates the composite ceramic materials based on cellular automata (CA) to optimize the ratio of two formulations. On the other hand, in order to optimize sintering process, CA modeling is also carried out for the sintering process of composite ceramics. Finally, in order to detect the temperature of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln by using the characteristics of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone,</b> the K-means clustering method is used for the color segmentation of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln. The experimental results show that the size of the grains is in accordance with the actual situation of the simulation and the microstructure evolution of the composites can be simulated well by using the CA theory to simulate the composites; with the increase of simulation time, the grain size distribution is basically unchanged, which accords with the normal distribution, and the simulation process of grain growth is very stable. Based on the K-mean clustering segmentation method, the segmentation of the flame image of ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> is realized. This method also provides a good technical means for feature extraction of flame image in ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

40|$|Coal fire burning {{around the}} world is an {{environmental}} catastrophe characterized by the emission of noxious gases, particulate matter, and condensation by-products. In this study, coal fire temperature is retrieved based on Landsat 5 TM images and Generalized Single-Channel Algorithm (GSCA), in Wuda coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China. Then coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> are extracted by Jenks' natural breaks and threshold methods based on temperature images. Changes of coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> are analyzed from 1989 to 2008. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The coal fire temperature retrieval method based on Landsat 5 TM and the GSCA model is effective and feasible, because the temperature error is relatively small (from - 2. 9 A degrees C to + 2. 6 A degrees C) between the measured temperature and the retrieved temperature. 2) The accuracy is relatively high to extract coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> through the Jenks' natural breaks and threshold methods, because 83. 56 % of surveyed area is located in the coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> extracted in 2005. 3) The coal fire area increased 9. 81 x 10 (5) m(2) from 1989 to 2005, and the annual growth is about 6. 1 x 10 (4) m(2), with an annual increasing rate of 2. 48 %.
