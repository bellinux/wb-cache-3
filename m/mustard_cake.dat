40|$|Considerando a importância de Meloidogyne spp. na formação de mudas e o potencial do óleo e da torta de mostarda no controle desses nematóides, objetivou-se desenvolver uma tecnologia de aplicação desses produtos para o tratamento de substrato para a formação de mudas de cafeeiro, bem como determinar a vida de prateleira da torta. Para tal, estudaram-se formas de aplicação do óleo e da torta da mostarda, alcance dos gases, eficiência da formulação em óleo, tempo de biofumigação e armazenamento da torta em diferentes condições. Os gases tiveram alcance na {{horizontal}} e vertical ascendente até 30 cm de distância, onde proporcionaram 100 % de mortalidade dos nematóides. Na vertical descendente, o óleo foi eficiente até 20 cm, mas com a torta não se obteve controle satisfatório. As formas de aplicação do óleo resultaram em 100 % de controle de M. exigua, mas com a torta apenas com a aplicação em sulcos transversal e longitudinal chegouse ao mesmo resultado. Aumentar o tempo de fumigação para 10 dias ao invés de 5 permitiu reduzir a dose do óleo para 60 mL/m 3, com 100 % controle do nematóide. A influência do tipo de recipiente e condições de armazenamento na conservação da torta foi avaliada até os 14 meses. A conservação em embalagem impermeável (vidro) manteve-se constante tanto na concentração do ITCA quanto na mortalidade do J 2 por até 14 meses, independente da temperatura e luz. Em embalagem permeável (saco de papel), em temperatura ambiente, a conservação da mesma foi mantida por até 5 meses, mas quando armazenada em geladeira, a conservação foi mantida até os 14 meses. Conclui-se que a melhor forma de aplicação da torta é no formato de cruz, interceptada a cada 40 cm. O bastão de papel impregnado com óleo revelou-se um possível substituto para o brometo de metila no tratamento de substrato para produção de mudas de cafeeiro. É possível armazenar a torta de mostarda de um ano para outro desde que se utilize um recipiente hermeticamente fechado, ou, se mantenha em saco de papel fechado, na geladeira. Considering {{the importance}} of Meloidogyne spp. on the seedlings formation and {{the potential of the}} <b>mustard</b> <b>cake</b> and essential oil in the control of this nematode, it was proposed to develop an application technology of these products for the substrates treatment in order to get health coffee seedlings, as well as to determinate the shelf life of the <b>mustard</b> <b>cake.</b> Previously, it was evaluated the gas reaching on the substrate and then, different ways of applying oil and <b>mustard</b> <b>cake.</b> The gas reached 30 cm of distance horizontally and vertically down, that resulted in 100 % of nematode mortality. In case of essential oil, the gas movement upright was efficient until 20 cm, but no satisfactory control was observed with the cake. The oil application, independently of the distribution way, resulted in 100 % of M. exigua mortality, but the same result only was obtained by the cake application on transversal and longitudinal furrows. Also, the efficiency of the essential oil formulation, biofumigation time and the cake storage in different conditions were evaluated. Increasing the fumigation time to 10 instead of 5 days, allowed to reduce the oil doses to 60 mL/m 3, with 100 % of nematode control. The influence of the storage recipient type and cake storage conditions on the ITCA concentration was evaluated until 14 months. The preservation of the cake in impermeable packaging (bottle) guaranteed the ITCA concentration and J 2 mortality percentage until 14 months, independently the temperature and light. In permeable packaging (paper bag), at environment temperature, the conservation was maintained until 5 months, but when maintained on the fridge the conservation lasted 14 months. In conclusion, the best way of cake application is in the cross format, spaced every 40 cm. The impregnated paper stick with essential oil is a possible substitute to the methyl bromide in the infested substrate treatment on coffee nurseries. It is possible to store the <b>mustard</b> <b>cake</b> from one to another year if using a recipient hermetically closed, or by using paper bag on the fridge...|$|E

Sub plots (ASD, MC, ASD+MC, untreated control (UTC), and fumigant (Pic-Clor 60. Conv only)) were applied prior to strawberry in October 2011. Cover crop and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were grown after strawberries at Org only. Marketable fruit yield, weed density, and disease level were monitored during the strawberry season and soil inorganic N dynamics for the entire period. ASD+MC and ASD produced similar fruit yields as fumigant at the Conv site. ASD+MC produced greater fruit yield than UTC and MC at both sites and ASD at the Org site. ASD and ASD+MC produced high inorganic N in the soil 2 to 3 months after application at both sites. This caused salt damage on strawberry during early growth especially at Conv which may have reduced fruit yields in both treatments. Verticillium dahliae population in soil at strawberry transplanting was less than 1 microsclerotia/g soil at both sites.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the laboratory condition {{to determine the effect}} of organic (poultry drop, cow dung and <b>mustard</b> oil <b>cake)</b> and inorganic fertilizer (urea) on production, reproduction rate and maturation time of Moina species. Production rate was also determined in both aerated and non-aerated system in plastic containers with carrying capacity of 2. 5 -liter each. Total production was significantly higher in both aerated (2475 individuals/ 2. 5 l water) and non-aerated (3253 individuals/ 2. 5 l water) containers using poultry manure compared to other fertilizers. Moreover, the reproduction rate and maturation time in poultry drops showed distinct efficacy in Moina species. Reproduction rate of 11 individuals was the maximal while lowest maturation time was found 78 hours. Reproduction and maturation were induced surprisingly in test tube where the aeration system was absent...|$|R

40|$|Effect of Azolla (Azolla pinnata) in {{combination}} with <b>mustard</b> oil <b>cake</b> (MOC) was studied on the galling in roots and growth of eggplants (Solanum melongena) inoculated with Meloidogyne javanica. Fresh weight and length of both shoot and root were vigorous when dry Azolla (5 g) or fresh Azolla extract (10 ml) in mixing with the half standard dose (1. 25 g) of MOC was applied. Similarly, the galling incidence was lower in the same treatment that was identified for the vigorous growth of the plant. A. pinnata was found as a very effective agent for the normal growth of root and shoot with half-standard dose of MOC. Both of these agents in together created resistance to the plants and its toxic materials might suppress the nematode activity, which ultimately confirm the lower presence of galling by M. javanica...|$|R

Groups II and III received, respectively, sodium thiosulfate 20 and 40 g to each animal for 30 days as a pilot study, whereas group I served as untreated control. Arsenic content of milk, feces, hair, and urine was estimated before and after administration of sodium thiosulfate orally at two dose level once daily for 1 month.

NR 4617, was newly {{isolated from}} decayed soil sample obtained in Thailand and {{was subjected to}} single exposure to two chemical mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Its myrosinase production was selected on low cost medium prepared from <b>mustard</b> seed <b>cake</b> (Brassica juncea). Studies of production and stability of the enzyme showed that EMS mutagenesis increased myrosinase activity. Aspergillus sp. NR 4617 E 1 produced myrosinase 1. 90 U ml- 1 at 36 hrs of the cultivation equivalent to 171 % of the enzyme production in wild-type. The stability studies revealed that myrosinase from the mutant strains retained activity similar to wild-type at 30 ºC. Aspergillus sp. NR 4617 E 1 degraded 10 mM of glucosinolate completely in 36 hrs. Enhanced myrosinase production and high yields of products (allylisothiocyanate) demonstrated that this mutant could be a new found candidate for feed detoxification and industrial allylisothiocyanate production...|$|R
