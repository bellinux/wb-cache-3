50|$|The <b>meander</b> <b>ratio</b> or {{sinuosity}} {{index is}} a means of quantifying how much a river or stream meanders (how much its course deviates from the shortest possible path). It is calculated as the length of the stream divided by the length of the valley. A perfectly straight river would have a <b>meander</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 (it would be the same length as its valley), while the higher this ratio is above 1, the more the river meanders.|$|E

40|$|Purpose/Objective: Tracking of {{immune cells}} {{is key to}} {{understanding}} their behaviour during inflammation. Current software available for tracking of immune cells is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a MatLab package of segmentation and tracking algorithms to apply in the tracking of neutrophils, fluorescently labelled in our zebrafish model [1]. The development of algorithms in MatLab allows us to explore parameters not available in other software packages such as directionality of neutrophil movement and neutrophil behaviour in- side and outside of a wound region. Materials and methods: Tail fin transection was performed on Tg(mpx:GFP) zebrafish (3 dpf) which were imaged on a spinning disk confocal from 1 h post injury (hpi) to 7 hpi. Images were exported from VolocityTM and analysed using MatLab m-files written for the tracking of immune cells. This is a fully automated analysis, after the user defines the initial thresholds based on fluorescent intensity of the images. Results: Neutrophils from injured embryos had a lower <b>meandering</b> <b>ratio</b> and a greater speed than neutrophils tracked in uninjured embryos (<b>meandering</b> <b>ratio</b> 0. 24 ± 0. 03 versus 0. 42 ± 0. 05, P = 0. 003; speed 4. 03 ± 0. 32 versus 1. 31 ± 0. 21 pixels/frame, P 0. 05). In injured embryos with a defined wound region, the oriented velocity towards the wound was 0. 31 ± 0. 24 pixels/frame. Once within the wound region, the oriented velocity of neutrophil tracks was - 0. 39 ± 0. 32 pixels/frame; indicating that while the neutrophils travel at a similar speed, they are now travelling away from the wound. The ‘in wound ratio’ was 0. 91 ± 0. 04, indicating that once neutrophils enter the wound region they tend to stay, in the timeframe studied. The ‘leave wound ratio’ was 0. 37 ± 0. 03, a measure of the rate at which neutrophils move away from the site of injury once they have entered the wound region. Conclusions: Using these algorithms, we can analyse the behaviour of immune cells in a more detailed way. In addition to previously available parameters such as <b>meandering</b> <b>ratio</b> and speed, more complex parameters such as velocity towards or away from a wound region and a measurement of how neutrophils behave while in a wound region are available. Combining this novel tracking technology with established assays in our laboratory will enable the further dissection of neutrophil fate following an inflammatory stimulus...|$|R
50|$|The {{sinuosity}} index {{plays a part}} in mathematical {{descriptions of}} streams. The index may require elaboration, because the valley may meander as well—i.e., the downvalley length is not identical to the reach. In that case the valley index is the <b>meander</b> <b>ratio</b> of the valley while the channel index is the <b>meander</b> <b>ratio</b> of the channel. The channel sinuosity index is the channel length divided by the valley length and the standard sinuosity index is the channel index divided by the valley index.

At the town of Srbobran, the Krivaja turns east, carving a shallow, 15 km long valley, in which it meanders for 33 km before it empties into the Great Bačka Canal, part of the Canal Danube-Tisa-Danube. Total <b>meandering</b> <b>ratio</b> of the whole river is 65:109 (in the valley 15:33), thus the name (Krivaja; Serbian for winding river).

40|$|A {{river or}} stream is dynamic through time. The most {{significant}} morphological property {{of a river}} is the meandering process, which is dominated and governed by hydraulic, hydrologic and topographic characteristics {{of the river and}} its drainage area [1]. In a meandering river, the length of the river keeps on increasing by eroding the outer bank of a bend [2]. The present study has been conducted to investigate the meandering parameters of Manu River using Remote sensing technology and Geographic information system. The name Manu River used here to represent the river reach from Tripura border to the confluence with Kushiyara River in Manumukh, Sherpur. Ten critical bend have been chosen in Manu River which are changing over time. The minimum width as found was 52. 6 m at near Brahman-bazar (chainage 22. 58 km) in 1997; the maximum width was 80. 6 m near Rajnagar (chainage 34 km) in 2006. <b>Meandering</b> <b>ratio</b> varies from 0. 32 to 1. 67 and wavelength 558. 31 m to 1803. 54 m.

40|$|ABSTRACT: As a {{first step}} toward {{designing}} a comprehensive model for validating land surface hydrology and river flow in Earth system models, a global river channel network has been prepared at 1 ° latitude × 1 ° longitude resolution. The end product is the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) network. The aim of TRIP is to provide information of lateral water movement over land following the paths of river channels. Flow directions were determined from vector data of river channels and river pathways available in two recent atlases; however, an automatic procedure using a digital elevation map of the corresponding horizontal resolution was used as a first guess. In this way, a template to convert the river discharge data into mean runoff per unit area of the basin has been obtained. One hundred eighty major rivers are identified and adequately resolved; they cover 63 % of land, excluding Antarctica and Greenland. Most of the river basin sizes are well within a 20 % difference of published values, with a root-mean-square error of approximately 10 %. Furthermore, drainage areas for more than 400 gauging stations were delineated. Obviously, the stream lengths in TRIP are shorter than the natural lengths published as data. This is caused by the meandering of rivers in the real world. <b>Meandering</b> <b>ratio</b> (rM), the ratio of actual (published) river length to the idealized river length, has been calculated. Averaged globally for all available data, rM is 1. 4, although it is 1. 3 for rivers with areas larger than 500, 000 km 2. The rM data will be useful {{in the design of the}} Scheme for Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (STRIP). In the current form, TRIP can be used as a template for producing a time series of river flow using a simple version of 1 STRIP...|$|R

40|$|Full {{preservation}} of ancient meandering channels is uncommon: most preserved architectural elements are fragmented due to later erosion and cutting of channels and bars. This makes it challenging to relate preserved architectural elements {{to the original}} dimensions {{at the time of}} sedimentation. Quantitative information on the three-dimensional geometry and composition of these basic building blocks of reservoirs and aquifers formed by meandering systems is essential for exploration and production purposes and potentially an invaluable source of information about ancient climate. In this thesis the relation between the morphodynamics of meandering rivers and the resulting stratigraphic architecture is explored and quantified in three dimensions. This led to a scale-independent inverse relation that uses stratigraphy to predict the original meandering river dimensions that is of considerable use in interpreting fluvial successions and in reservoir engineering studies. Channel dimensions need to be scaled correctly to produce meaningful experimental stratigraphy. In particular, any vertical distortion of the channels modifies the resultant stratigraphical and sedimentological architecture, as exemplified by the dependence of the transverse bed and stratigraphical architecture predictors on channel depth. The transverse bed slope of the experimental lateral accretion surfaces has similar values as the targeted natural prototype rivers and agrees well with theory. Also, the formation of experimental stratigraphy for meandering rivers depends on the deepest channel cuts and the order of occurrence of these channel cuts, which is consistent with the prediction from theory. Three key archimetric (i. e. quantitative, non-dimensional, architectural dimensions) parameters are identified to enhance the three-dimensional characterization of the external geometry and internal stratigraphy of meander belts. First, <b>meander</b> belt width-to-thickness <b>ratios</b> are generally between 100 and 200, which is consistent with reported values of natural meander belts. Second, the internal stratigraphical architecture of meander belts largely consists of fragmented deposits: 95 % of the stratigraphic sets are thinner than the mean channel. Third, prediction of the slope of lateral accretion deposits is possible based on the mean channel depth, a typical grain size and channel curvature. This indicates that a few fairly basic morphological (i. e. channel) and sedimentary parameters provide insightful quantitative predictors for the three-dimensional sedimentary architecture of meander belts, which is complementary to well and seismic observations. Most fluvial systems are subject to changes in forcing. For example, aggradation rates and discharge are extremely variable. This thesis demonstrates that moderate floods (≈ 50 years recurrence time) and aggradation rates...|$|R
