25|$|Cadbury were {{reliant on}} the canals for <b>milk</b> <b>delivery,</b> {{and on the}} {{railways}} for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton. They therefore needed a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail.

25|$|The Russian Revolution of 1917 was {{a source}} of great {{inspiration}} to the entire Childs family, and news of its dramatic events were breathlessly followed over the next several years. Towards {{the end of the decade}} Childs joined a trade union in order to get a job driving a <b>milk</b> <b>delivery</b> wagon, where he first made the acquaintance of members of the then-underground American Communist movement. The combination of his family's radical heritage, the exciting news from Russia, and the enthusiasm of his radical peers caused Morris Childs to become politically engaged, and he took the step of joining the United Communist Party of America in 1921.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, The Teamsters {{strongly}} {{endorsed the}} American labor movement's no-strike pledge. The Teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike {{for the duration}} of the national emergency. President Tobin even ordered Teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions. Nevertheless, the national leadership sanctioned strikes by Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and <b>milk</b> <b>delivery</b> drivers in January 1945. The Teamsters did not, however, participate in the great post-war wave of labor strikes. In the two years following the cessation of hostilities, the Teamsters struck only three times: 10,000 truckers in New Jersey struck for two weeks; workers at UPS struck nationwide for three weeks; and workers at Railway Express Agency struck for almost a month.|$|E
25|$|Carmino Ravosa {{was born}} on January 29, 1930 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the oldest of three children, {{and the son of}} Anello and Elmira Ravosa. His father was an Italian {{immigrant}} who owned and operated a <b>milk</b> <b>delivery</b> business and had a strong love of jazz and big band music of the 1930s and 1940s, and was the greatest influence on Carmino's music career. Ravosa and his brother Anthony worked in their father's business for several years. Anthony later {{went on to become a}} lawyer and businessman in Springfield. After serving in the United States Army as a corporal in the U.S. Army Band, Ravosa attended The Hartt School of Music and graduated in 1957. He then earned a master's degree in Music Education from The Hartt School in 1965. At the school, he met his wife Claire Colby, who was a voice major there. The two were married for almost 60 years. Ravosa later earned a master's degree and an advanced degree from Columbia University.|$|E
500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror {{praised the}} film for its well-execution, but it didn't miss {{a chance to}} balance it by criticizing the actor who played the milkman, [...] "The Laura Jean Libbey style of romance is here {{presented}} with {{more than the usual}} success. ... The purchase of the <b>milk</b> <b>delivery</b> job was not convincing and the milkman talked too much at the camera; otherwise the picture is not seriously defective in detail."

2500|$|The city, {{especially}} the historic center, has maintained its Spanish colonial layout, with narrow cobblestone streets, roofs covered in red clay tile and wrought iron balconies with flowers. The facades {{of the buildings}} vary from Baroque to Neoclassical and Moorish, painted in various colors. <b>Milk</b> <b>delivery</b> from local dairy farms still use canisters on donkeys, and farmers typically still use horses and donkeys for hauling wood and farmed goods within their own properties [...] The city subdivides into three sections {{but the majority of}} the population lives in the central section near the city center.

2500|$|During World War II, Tobin {{strongly}} supported the labor movement's no-strike pledge. [...] In early 1942, President Roosevelt asked the AFL and CIO to appoint members to a [...] "Labor War Board" [...] (also {{known as the}} [...] "Labor Victory Board") to advise him on how labor could contribute to the war effort. Tobin and the other labor leaders agreed to cease raiding {{one another and to}} not strike {{for the duration of the}} national emergency. Nevertheless, Tobin sanctioned strikes involving Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and <b>milk</b> <b>delivery</b> drivers in January 1945. But he also demanded that other unions punish wildcat strikers, asked the public to punish those unions which went on strike, and ordered his own members to cross picket lines unless specifically told not to by the international union.|$|E
2500|$|Konstantin met his [...] "golden day in life" [...] ("это был золотой день в моей жизни") {{through a}} <b>milk</b> <b>delivery</b> woman, who {{happened}} to serve the family of Vladimir Chaplin, a wealthy engineer. She recommended Konstantin's drawings to Chaplin, who was so impressed that he hired the teenager to his firm and paid for his art studies. Chaplin overestimated Melnikov's basic education, and Konstantin failed his grammar test at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1904. One year later, he passed the admissions that selected a class of 11 out of 270 applicants. Melnikov studied at the School for 12 years, first completing General Education (1910), then graduating in Arts (1914) and Architecture (1917). Despite Chaplin's calls to concentrate on architecture, Melnikov leaned to painting; {{by the time he}} joined the Architecture classes, he already was a well-recognized portrait painter. Later, he recalled Konstantin Korovin, Sergey Malyutin and Abram Arkhipov as his mentors in art; as for architecture, he gave his regards only to Ivan Zholtovsky, his professor in 1917-1918.|$|E
