5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton. About {{two thirds of the}} town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed. A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a <b>maltster.</b> He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E
25|$|The Tetley family's {{links with}} the beer {{industry}} {{go back to the}} 1740s when William Tetley was described as a <b>maltster</b> in Armley, near Leeds. His son William expanded the business, which in turn was passed to his son Joshua. In 1822, Joshua leased a brewery in Salem Place, Hunslet for £409.|$|E
25|$|By 1858 Eddington and Underdown were {{separate}} {{districts of}} Herne parish. In Eddington, Edward Collard was a farmer, William Evans was the surgeon in Herne Street, Eddington, William Johncock was the blacksmith, and Thomas Taylor {{was running the}} Blacksmiths' Arms Inn. By 1891, Eddington was still a hamlet in the parish of Herne. It had a post office, a blacksmith, a builder and a <b>maltster.</b> Residences included Prospect House, The Priory and Eddington House.|$|E

[...] His grandfather, William Tetley had formed a {{successful}} <b>maltster's</b> business in Armley, (a village close to Leeds). The business became a success and William, became wine and beer merchants in Leeds city centre. Joshua Tetley was the third of four brothers, Isaac, William and James.

500|$|After Adams {{had lost}} his money, his father made him {{a partner in the}} family's malthouse, which was next to the family home on Purchase Street. Several generations of Adamses were maltsters, who {{produced}} the malt necessary for brewing beer. Years later, a poet poked fun at Adams by calling him [...] "Sam the maltster". Adams has often been described as a brewer, but the extant evidence suggests that he worked as a <b>maltster</b> and not a brewer.|$|E
500|$|Locally farmed wheat was milled at Aldermaston Mill {{until the}} 1920s. In {{existence}} {{at the time}} of the Domesday survey, the mill was previously called the [...] "Kingsmill", and at one time supplied flour to Huntley & Palmers in Reading. Now known as The Old Mill, it was owned by Wasing's Mount family throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. William Mount let the mill to Francis Webb (1797–1811), Mr Sherwood (1811–1820), Mr King (1820–1824), Mr Waldren (1824–1828), Mr Mathews (1828–1848), and William Gilchrist (1848–1856). Gilchrist (Mathews' business partner) bought the mill from Mount in 1856 using money inherited from his brother's death the previous year. Owning it outright for approximately a year, he drowned in the River Kennet in 1857 after visiting the Angel public house in Woolhampton. Joseph Crockett purchased the mill in an auction the same year, before it was acquired by a Richard Sisling of Godalming in 1858. In approximately 1860, the mill was purchased by the Kersley family. Between then and 1885, it was operated by Anthony Kersley, a miller and <b>maltster</b> who employed [...] "six men and a boy, a carter, several domestic servants and a governess". Kersley's son, also named Anthony, ran the mill until 1895. That year, Walter Parson bought the mill and operated it until approximately 1897. Charles Keyser subsequently oversaw restoration on the mill building which [...] "had been untenanted for upwards of three years". He let the mill out to a Mr Iremonger from 1901. Iremonger used the mill until the late 1920s, shortly before Keyser's death. After Keyser had died and the Aldermaston estate had been divided and sold, his widow, Mary, approached Evelyn Arlott to run the mill as a tea room and guesthouse. The Arlott family purchased the mill in approximately 1939, after the death of Mary Keyser.|$|E

25|$|In general, none {{of these}} early malts would have been well {{shielded}} from the smoke involved in the kilning process, and consequently, early beers {{would have had a}} smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that <b>maltsters</b> and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer.|$|R

In 1710, Robert married, for a second time, Elizabeth Cumming, and there was born to them, in 1720, another Robert, certainly a <b>maltster</b> in Glasgow.
