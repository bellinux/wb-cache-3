25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of <b>malic</b> <b>acidity,</b> but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E

Chemically deacidified wines contained similar total acidity but higher pH values than malolactically fermented wines. Compared to control wines, the tartaric acid concentration decrease of 2. 13 g/L and the pH value increase of 0. 5 units were determined. The sensory quality of Moslavac wines of high acidity was improved by the applification of deacidification methods.

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out on a {{thousand}} wines from organic viticulture from different European countries. Analytical data were collected about the most used quality control parameters (e. g. alcoholic strength, reducing sugars, total acidity and pH, volatile <b>acidity,</b> <b>malic</b> and lactic acid, free and total sulfur dioxide), as well as regarding some compounds harmful for human health, such as ochratoxin A and biogenic amines. The results collected on quality control parameters were generally {{in agreement with the}} values normally detectable for conventional wines. Total sulfur dioxide was lower than 110 - 120 mg/L in the most of the samples and no significant correlation was found between sulfite levels and other parameters. Ochratoxin A (OTA) seemed not a generalized problem for organic wine productions: its concentration was below the European legal limit, in the 95 % of the samples analyzed; nevertheless, the risk of OTA pollution seemed higher in certain southern European regions. On the other hand, biogenic amines (BA) appeared a serious problem for organic winemaking and high concentrations were found in many of the analyzed wines. They seemed connected with a bad management of malolactic fermentation, being generally associated with high pHs and volatile acidities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Trabajo presentado en el XIII Congresso Luso-Espanhol de Fisiologia Vegetal, celebrado en Lisboa del 24 al 28 de julio de 2013. Experiments were {{conducted}} in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo) fruit-bearing cuttings, using temperature gradient greenhouses (TGG), to investigate the possible effects of future climate scenarios: elevated CO 2 (700 ppm) vs. ambient (ca. 375 ppm), elevated temperature (+ 4 ºC) vs. ambient and partia l vs. full irrigation, on C balance, partitioning and grape quality. Carbon balance was followed monitoring net photosynthesis (AN, C gain), respiration (RD) and photorespiration (RL) (C losses). For C partitioning characterization, 13 C isotopic composition (δ 13 C) was modified (- 24. 93 ‰) in the elevated CO 2 TGGs, with respect {{to that of the}} ambient TGGs (- 10. 30 ‰). Elevated CO 2 increased transiently (after 10 days of treatment) AN irrespective of water availability and temperature, but effects disappeared 10 days later. In most cases, no differences in RL were found. When grown under ambient temperature (regardless of water status), leaves respired more under elevated than under current CO 2 concentrations at both sampling dates, whereas all leaves respired similarly to controls when grown under elevated temperature. Carbon and N isotopic composition (δ 13 C and δ 15 N respectively) was characterized in roots, cuttings, shoots, petioles, leaves, rachides and berries. Data revealed a low C-sink strength of cuttings and rachides, whereas leaf N decreased as a response to elevated CO 2. Plants exposed to elevated CO 2 did acclimate. Such acclimation was reflected in lower AN rates measured at elevated CO 2 and a higher C/N ratio in plants grown at elevated CO 2. After 20 days of treatment, no oxidative damage to chlorophylls or carotenoids was observed, suggesting a protective role of CO 2 either at current or elevated temperatures against the adverse effect of water stress. Treatments simulating climate change influenced g rapevine maturation. Climate change (elevated CO 2 in interaction with water deficit, but irrespective of temperature) shortened maturation time. pH and extractable anthocyanins were not affected, whereas <b>acidity,</b> <b>malic</b> acid, total and potential anthocyanins, phenolic richness, colour intensity and tonality index were only slightly altered under some particular circumstances.

Por outro lado, estas regiões possuem potencial para a elaboração de espumantes, uma vez que, para a elaboração desta bebida, a uva é colhida antes de completar o amadurecimento. No Estado de Minas Gerais, as condições de verão chuvoso estão presentes em todas as regiões de potencial vitícola, e a variação de {{altitude}} entre elas pode exercer influência na composição das uvas. Desta forma, este estudo buscou avaliar o potencial de maturação de uvas 'Chardonnay' e 'Pinot Noir' destinadas à elaboração de espumantes em dois locais de Minas Gerais: Cordislândia (873 m) e Caldas (1. 150 m). As plantas foram enxertadas sobre 1. 103 Paulsen e conduzidas em espaldeira. Foram avaliados os teores de sólidos solúveis totais, acidez total, ácidos málico e tartárico, e pH do mosto, tamanho e massa das bagas, compostos fenólicos nas cascas e sementes, antocianinas na casca e açúcares solúveis nas bagas, em duas safras consecutivas. As bagas apresentaram maior tamanho e massa quando cultivadas em Caldas. As uvas colhidas em Cordislândia apresentaram maior grau de maturação, sendo observados maior pH, maiores teores de glicose e frutose, e quantidade inferior de acidez e fenólicos totais nas sementes. Os maiores teores de ácido málico presentes nas uvas provenientes de Caldas sugerem que esta região pode ser mais indicada à produção de uvas para elaboração de vinhos espumantes.

In the state of Minas Gerais, the conditions of rainy summer season are present in all regions of grape production potential, and the altitude variation between them influence on the grapes composition. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate the potential for maturing of the grapes 'Chardonnay' and 'Pinot Noir' which are designated for the preparation of sparklings in two locations of Minas Gerais: Cordislândia (873 m) and Caldas (1150 m). The plants were grafted on 1103 Paulsen and conducted in trellis.

The berries had higher size and mass when grown in Caldas. The grapes harvested in Cordislândia presented a higher maturity degree, and it was observed a higher pH, higher levels of glucose and fructose, and a lower amount of acidity and total phenolic content in the seeds. The highest levels of malic acid present in the grapes of Caldas suggest that this region may be more appropriate for the production of grapes which are used for making sparklings...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} {{of a conventional}} farm to the methods of the organic farming is a very critical stage of technical and economical investment. From an agronomical point of view, usually the conversion needs a very different length of time with respect to that set by the regulation, because the organic farming {{is based on the}} soil fertility and, in general, on the preservation at the equilibrium of the farm’s ecosystem. These elements affect time and method of the conversions that, although based on clear principles, can require different interventions and solutions and give different results in different times depending on the starting conditions of fertility, farm organization, operating possibilities and knowledge. A research project has been funded by the Lazio Region (central Italy) into the Interregional Programme Agriculture Quality with the general objective to monitor the soil characteristics and biodiversity, the quality of the products as well as to study the economical aspects in a farm sited in Lazio Region (Central Italy) during a 3 years conversion period from conventional to organic. Generally, in the geographical area interested by this study the organic farms have not a livestock. For this reason the conversion plan was focused on the rotation and the use of green manure. This work concerns the results of {{the first year of the}} conversion (certification body: Suolo e Salute srl). In particular, the results of the determination of the yield and some quality characteristics of processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, cv. CXD 271 bio) are presented. Moreover, the results were compared to those from a neighboring farm managed with the conventional method, having the same characteristics of the soil. The tomato samples from two field replicates of both the farms were analysed for the following parameters: moisture and soluble solids content, titratable acidity, colour, texture, composition in organic acids, carotenoids and antioxidant capacity with FRAP and TEAC methods. Data were analysed by Anova and multiple comparison test (Duncan at P 0. 05). Although it is clear that it will be possible to draw meaningful conclusions only at the end of the project, the results of the first year of the study indicate that the yield of the farm in conversion was higher than that of the conventional one (20, 575 kg/ha, 1. 235 kg/plant VS. 17, 202 kg/ha 17. 202, 1. 032 kg/plant). A significant effect of the field replicates on all the quality parameters was observed. The samples of tomato from the farm in conversion showed higher values of the colour parameters, size, moisture content, while lower levels were found for the soluble solids content, titratable <b>acidity,</b> <b>malic</b> acid and antioxidant capacity determined by TEAC method.

40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The rapid {{expansion}} of the world wine industry has increased the pressure on wine producers to produce high quality, distinguishable wines. The use of sensory evaluation alone {{as a tool to}} distinguish between wines is limited by its subjective nature. Chemical characterisation using analytical methods and data analysis techniques are increasingly being used in conjunction with sensory analysis for comprehensive profiling of wine. Analytical chemistry and chemometric techniques are important and inextricable parts of the chemical characterisation of wine. Through this process insight into the inherent composition of wines, be it in a general sense or related to a particular wine category is gained. Data generated during chemical characterisation are typically compiled into electronic databases. The application of such information towards wine quality control includes the establishment of industry benchmarks and authentication. The current project is part of The South African Young Wine Aroma Project, a long term research initiative funded by the South African Wine Industry with the ultimate aim to establish a comprehensive, up-to-date, database of the volatile composition of young wines. The data generated during this thesis represent the first contribution towards realising this ambition. Three clearly defined aims were set for this project, the first of which is the chemical characterisation of South African young wines in terms of selected volatile and non-volatile compounds and Fourier transform infrared spectra, with particular focus on the volatile composition. FTMIR spectra are information rich and non-specific instrumental signals that could provide invaluable information of the inherent composition of the wines. The second aim is the evaluation of the analytical methods used to generate the data and in the last instance, the optimisation of FTMIR spectroscopy for rapid quantification of major wine parameters and volatile compounds. The concentrations of 27 volatile compounds in South African young wines were determined by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) using liquid-liquid extraction of the analytes. Wine samples of the 2005 and 2006 vintages produced from six of the most important cultivars in the South African wine industry, namely Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinotage, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Shiraz were used. The producing cellars were from four major South African wine producing regions, namely Stellenbosch, Paarl, Robertson and Worcester. The data captured made a significant contribution to the establishment of the Aroma Project Database. Univariate statistics showed wide variations in the chemical composition of the wines. Red wines were generally characterised by high levels of higher alcohols and white wines by high levels of esters. Most of the differences between vintages were cultivar dependent and phenological differences between cultivars were suggested as a possible cause. Fusel alcohols, iso-acids and esters of fusel alcohols were particularly responsible for differences between red wines. A combination of fatty acids and higher alcohols were responsible for differences between production regions. However, using univariate statistics alone was limited in identifying characteristic features of the chemical composition of the wines. In order to explore the correlations between the volatile components, FTMIR spectra and nonvolatile components the data were further investigated with multivariate data analysis. Principal component analysis was successfully employed to distinguish between wines of different vintages and cultivars. The role of the volatile composition was more influential in the separation of vintage and red wine cultivar groupings than the non-volatile components or the FTMIR spectra. Almost all the individual volatile components contributed to the separation between the vintages and cultivars, thereby highlighting the multivariate nature required to establish the distinguishing features pertaining to each of these categories. The FTMIR spectra and the non-volatile components were more important than the volatile components to characterise the differences between the white cultivars. It was not surprising that both the volatile components and the FTMIR spectra were needed to distinguish between both red and white cultivars simultaneously. It was of interest the full spectrum, including all wavenumbers were required for a powerful classification model. This finding supports the initial expectation that the non-selective but information rich signal captured in the FTMIR spectra is indispensable. No distinction could be made between the production regions, which was not surprising since the wines used in this study was not of guaranteed origin. Furthermore, no clear correlation could be established between the chemical composition or the FTMIR spectra and the quality ratings of the wines. Limitations in the dataset were pointed out that {{must be taken into account}} during further investigations in the future. The liquid-liquid extraction method used during the analysis of the volatile components was evaluated for precision, accuracy and robustness. Generally good precision and accuracy were observed. There were slight indications of inconsistencies in the recoveries of analytes between the red and white wine matrices. Certain parameters of the protocol, namely sample volume, solvent volume, sonication temperature and sonication time, were identified as factors that had a major influence on quantification. The results obtained in this study made a major contribution towards establishing this technique for routine GC-FID analysis in our environment. Due to the high sample throughput in wine laboratories, the use of rapid quantitative analytical methods such as FTMIR spectroscopy is becoming increasingly important. Enzymatic-linked spectrophotometric assays and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were evaluated for their suitability to serve as reference methods for optimising and establishing FTMIR calibrations for glucose, fructose, malic acid, lactic acid and glycerol. Pigmented and phenolic compounds were identified as sources of interference in the determination of organic acids in red wines with both enzymatic assays and HPLC. The use of fining treatments for the decolourisation of red wine samples was investigated. Activated charcoal was more efficient in terms of colour removal than polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP), but neither were compatible with the specific enzymatic method used in this study. Solid phase extraction (SPE), a method commonly used during sample clean-up prior to HPLC analysis of organic acids in wine, and PVPP fining were evaluated as sample preparation methods for HPLC analysis to optimise the quantification of organic acids in red wine. Four different types of SPE cartridges were evaluated and the SPE method was optimised in order to recover the maximum amount of organic acids. However, low recoveries, in some instance less than 50 %, for the organic acids in wine were reported for the optimised SPE method. In this respect one was the worst. On average, excellent recoveries were observed for the organic acids using the PVPP method that were in excess of 90 %. This method therefore provides a very valuable and simple alternative to SPE for sample-cleanup prior to HPLC analysis. One aspect that still needs to be investigated is the reproducibility of the method that should still be optimised. In general, enzymatic analysis was more suitable for the determination of glucose and fructose, while HPLC analysis were more suitable for the quantification of organic acids. Efficient glycerol quantification was observed with both enzymatic and HPLC analysis, although a lower measurement error was observed during the HPLC analysis. Apart from reliable reference methods, successful FTMIR calibrations also rely on the variability present in the reference sample set. The reference sample set used to establish FTMIR calibrations must ideally be representative of the samples that will be analysed in the future. Commercial, or so-called global, FTMIR calibrations for the determination of important wine parameters were evaluated for their compatibility to a South African young wine matrix. The prediction pH, titratable <b>acidity,</b> <b>malic</b> acid, glucose, fructose, ethanol and glycerol could be improved by establishing a brand new FTMIR calibration, thereby clearly indicating that the South African young wine matrices were significantly different from the samples of European origin that were used to establish the commercial calibrations. New preliminary calibration models were established for a young wine sample matrix and were validated using independent test sets. On average the prediction errors were considered sufficient for at least screening purposes. The effect of wavenumber selection was evaluated. Relatively successful models could be established for all the compounds except glucose. Wavenumber selection had an influence on the efficiency of the calibration models. Some models were more effective using a small amount of highly correlated wavenumbers, while others were more effective using larger wavenumber regions. Preliminary FTMIR calibration models for the screening of volatile compound groups in young wines were evaluated. Compound groups were compiled based on chemical similarity and flavour similarity. Good linearity were observed for the “total alcohol”, “total fatty acids”, “esters” models while an interesting polynomial trend was observed for the “total esters” model. Relatively high prediction errors indicated the possibility of spectral interferences, but the models were nevertheless considered suitable for screening purposes. These findings are a valuable contribution to our environment where fermentation flavour profiles must often be examined. The important role sound and validated analytical methods to generate high quality analytical data, and the subsequent application of chemometric techniques to model the data for the purpose of wine characterisation has been thoroughly explored in this study. After a critical evaluation of the analytical methods used in this study, various statistical methods were used to uncover the chemical composition of South African young wines. The use of multivariate data analysis has revealed some limitations in the dataset and therefore it must be said that wine characterisation is not just reliant on sophisticated analytical chemistry and advanced data analytical techniques, but also on high quality sample sets...|$|R
