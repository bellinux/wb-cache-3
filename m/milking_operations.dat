6000|$|But when I {{found that}} Biddy could never succeed in getting near {{her in the}} pasture, and that any kind of success in the <b>milking</b> <b>operations</b> {{required}} my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening, the matter wore a more serious aspect, and I began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive. It is very well {{to talk of the}} pleasures of the milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn; but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a drizzly, rainy morning, and equipping himself for a scamper through a wet pasture lot, rope in hand, at the heels of such a termagant as mine! In fact, madam established a regular series of exercises, which had all to be gone through before she would suffer herself to be captured; as, first, she would station herself plump {{in the middle of a}} marsh, which lay at the lower part of the lot, and look very innocent and absent-minded, as if reflecting on some sentimental subject. [...] "Suke! Suke! Suke!" [...] I ejaculate, cautiously tottering along the edge of the marsh, and holding out an ear of corn. The lady looks gracious, and comes forward, almost within reach of my hand. I make a plunge to throw the rope over her horns, and away she goes, kicking up mud and water into my face in her flight, while I, losing my balance, tumble forward into the marsh. I pick myself up, and, full of wrath, behold her placidly chewing her cud on the other side, with the meekest air imaginable, as who should say, [...] "I hope you are not hurt, sir." [...] I dash through swamp and bog furiously, resolving to carry all by a coup de main. Then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging, scampering, and bopeeping, among the trees of the grove, interspersed with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid. I always wondered how I caught her every day; and when I had tied her head to one post and her heels to another, I wiped the sweat from my brow, and thought I was paying dear for the eccentricities of genius. A genius she certainly was, for besides her surprising agility, she had other talents equally extraordinary. There was no fence that she could not take down; nowhere that she could not go. She took the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure, using her horns as handily as I could use a claw hammer. Whatever she had a mind to, whether it were a bite in the cabbage garden, or a run in the corn patch, or a foraging expedition into the flower borders, she made herself equally welcome and at home. Such a scampering and driving, such cries of [...] "Suke here" [...] and [...] "Suke there," [...] as constantly greeted our ears, kept our little establishment in a constant commotion. At last, when she one morning made a plunge at the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat, and carried off one flap on her horns, my patience gave out, and I determined to sell her.|$|E

40|$|Mechanized milking {{has become}} widely used for buffalos in Italy in recent years, thus {{improving}} {{the management and}} the productivity of farms. The apparent similarities between buffalo and cattle have often resulted in applying the same milking systems and techniques currently used for dairy cows. Considering the effect of mechanical milking on animal health, productivity, and welfare in intensive livestock farming, this study compares the effects of milking at low vacuum (36 kPa) and medium vacuum (42 kPa) on milk emission characteristics and milking system performance.

Operator, cow, and parlor classes were the basic {{units of the}} model. Each object in the model is a self-contained unit that represents its real world counterpart. The model operation and events were scheduled by sending messages among the objects.

40|$|Innovation and new {{technology}} adoption represent two central elements {{for the business}} and industry development process in agriculture. One of the most relevant innovations in dairy farms is the robotisation of the milking process through the adoption of Automatic Milking Systems (AMS). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the impact of selected Common Agricultural Policy measures on the adoption of AMS in dairy farms. The model developed is a dynamic farm-household model that is able to simulate the adoption of AMS taking into account the allocation of productive factors between on-farm and off-farm activities. The model simulates the decision to replace a traditional milking system with AMS using a Real Options approach that allows farmers to choose the optimal timing of investments. Results show that the adoption of AMS, and the timing of such a decision, is strongly affected by policy uncertainty and market conditions. The effect of this uncertainty is to postpone the decision to adopt the {{new technology}} until farmers have gathered enough information to reduce the negative effects of the technological lock-in. AMS adoption results in an increase in farm size and herd size due to the reduction in the labour required for <b>milking</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dairy farm <b>milking</b> <b>operations</b> produce {{considerable}} {{amounts of}} carbon- and nutrient-rich effluent {{that can be}} a vital source of nutrients for pasture and crops. The study aim was to characterise dairy shed effluent from a commercial farm and examine the changes produced by treatment, storage and recycling of the effluent through a two-stage stabilisation pond system. The data and insights from the study are broadly applicable to passive pond systems servicing intensive dairy and other livestock operations. Raw effluent contained mostly poorly biodegradable particulate organic material and organically bound nutrients, as well as a large fraction of fixed solids due to effluent recycling. The anaerobic pond provided effective sedimentation and biological treatment, but hydrolysis of organic material occurred predominantly in the sludge and continually added to effluent soluble COD, nutrients and cations. Sludge digestion also suppressed pH in the pond and increased salt levels through formation of alkalinity. High sludge levels significantly impaired pond treatment performance. In the facultative pond, BOD 5 concentrations were halved; however smaller reductions in COD showed the refractory nature of incoming organic material. Reductions in soluble N and P were proportional to reductions in respective particulate forms, suggesting that respective removal mechanisms were not independent. Conditions in the ponds were unlikely to support biological nutrient removal. Recycling caused conservative inert constituents to accumulate within the pond system. Material leaving the system was mostly soluble (86 % TS) and inert (65 % TS), but salt concentrations remained below thresholds for safe land application...|$|E
40|$|Major {{expansion}} of the dairy industry {{has occurred in the}} last 12 years in North Central Texas, especially in Erath County. For several decades, this area has been the location of small dairy farms with sufficient land to maintain low animal densities on pastures except during <b>milking</b> <b>operations.</b> Today, however, new dairy operations are typically much larger (500 - 1, 000 or more head) and maintain milking and dry cattle in open lots or corrals on small areas relative to the number of cows, {{in a manner that is}} similar to practices in the desert Southwest. Typical animal spacings in open lots are 56 m 2 (600 square feet) pa cow. Large amounts of water are used for manure removal and milk sanitation, resulting in significant volumes of process-generated wastewater. Concern has increased regarding the potential for ground and surface water quality degradation due to the increasing number and size of open lot dairies, particularly in the Upper North Bosque River watershed (Erath and Hamilton Counties, Texas). The outcropping of the Paluxy Formation within the watershed, which acts as a recharge zone for the Trinity Aquifer group, has led to concern about the quality of ground water in the watershed. The Upper North Bosque River (stream segment 1226) flows through the center of Erath County and eventually enters a municipal water supply reservoir before entering the Brazos River at Waco. This stream segment has been characterized as the state's major "known problem" for agricultural nonpoint source water quality pursuant to 1988 and 1990 assessments under Section 319 of the Federal Clean Water Act (TWC, 1988). Animal confinement operations, specifically dairy operations, were identified as primary contributors to the problem. A number of interagency research and demonstration projects have been initiated since 1988 in response to the concerns about water quality degradation due to open lot dairies. A common goal of these projects is to obtain and disseminate data and information related to the design and evaluation of dairy waste management practices. The results of these studies will aid producers, engineers, planners, and regulatory officials in the refinement and adoption of appropriate practices for water quality protection...|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why pig milk is not {{considered}} suitable for human consumption or commercial production. Pigs are considered difficult to milk. The sow herself is reluctant to be milked, may be uncooperative or become spooked by human presence, and lactating pigs may be quite aggressive. There are 8 to 16 small nipples, each giving little milk for a short duration. A cow's milking time can be around ten minutes compared to fifteen seconds for a pig. A sow may produce only 13 pounds of milk per day compared to a cow's production of 65 pounds. (Production has been estimated using a system of weighing piglets prior to and after suckling.) In addition, there is currently no existing milking machine designed to attach to around a dozen teats and extract milk for fifteen seconds. Finally, pigs, unlike cows, cannot become pregnant while lactating, which makes a pig <b>milk</b> <b>operation</b> even less viable.|$|R

40|$|Grain feeding is an {{important}} part of a dairy feeding program. Grain supplies energy in a concentrated form and when fed as a supplement to forage permits cows to maintain high levels of production. Also, if the forage is of low quality, additional protein and other nutrients can be supplied with the grain in a concentrate mix. By feeding a balanced concentrate mix, according to individual production, each cow receives the necessary nutrients for production. Dairy cows are usually fed grain individually. During recent years dairy herds have increased in size and milking parlors have been developed in which to milk cows more efficiently. In milking parlors cows are generally fed grain individually. However, the cows are milked so rapidly that there is insufficient time for them to consume more than a few pounds of grain. Cows not consuming all of their grain, while being milked, are left in the stall until the remaining grain is eaten, thus delaying the <b>milking</b> <b>operation</b> or turned out without consuming the allotted amount of grain...|$|R

25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking.

As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off.

Milks were grouped into 7 types according to r + k 20 sum and different curd firmness. Milks with short time (type 1) of coagulation (60 mm (type 3), with slightly longer time of coagulation (12 - 20 min.) and a 30 60 mm (type 5), with longer time of coagulation (> 20 min.) and a 30 45 mm (type 7), correspond to 15 %, 32 %, 33 % and 20 % of clotted milks respectively.
