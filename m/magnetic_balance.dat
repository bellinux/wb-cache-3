Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly 253Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978.

40|$|OAK-B 135 The authors {{report on}} a recent {{experiment}} examining how changes in the divertor <b>magnetic</b> <b>balance</b> affect the rate that particles can be pumped at the divertor targets. They find that both the edge density of the core plasma and divertor recycling play important roles in properly interpreting this pumping result. Previous studies on DIII-D have identified several important differences between double-null (DN) and single-null (SN) divertor operation. Small variations in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>balance</b> near-DN have large effects on both the power- and particle loadings at the divertor targets. These most likely result from an interplay between the plasma geometry and ion particle drifts, e. g., ''B x {del}B'' and ''E x B'' drifts.

Both {{the pedestal}} density n{sub e,PED} and plasma stored energy W{sub T} were sensitive {{to changes in}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>balance</b> near the double-null (DN) configuration, e. g., both decreased 20 %- 30 % when the DN shifted to a slightly unbalanced DN, where the B x {del}B drift direction pointed away from the main X-point.

The poloidal distribution of the recycling in DN is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of UEDGE modeling with particle drifts included.
