40|$|Power-on failure {{has been}} the {{prevalent}} failure mechanism for solid tantalum capacitors in decoupling applications. A surge step stress test (SSST) has been previously applied to identify the critical stress level of a capacitor batch to give some predictability to the power-on failure mechanism [1]. But SSST can also {{be viewed as an}} electrically destructive test under a time-varying stress (voltage). It consists of rapidly charging the capacitor with incremental voltage increases, through a low resistance in series, until the capacitor under test is electrically shorted. When the reliability of capacitors is evaluated, a highly accelerated life test (HALT) is usually adopted since it is a time-efficient method of determining the failure mechanism; however, a destructive test under a time-varying stress such as SSST is even more time efficient. It usually takes days or weeks to complete a HALT test, but it only takes minutes for a time-varying stress test to produce failures. The advantage of incorporating a specific time-varying stress profile into a statistical model is significant in providing an alternative life test method for quickly revealing the failure mechanism in capacitors. In this paper, a time-varying stress that mimics a typical SSST has been incorporated into the Weibull model to characterize the failure mechanism in different types of capacitors. The SSST circuit and transient conditions for correctly surge testing capacitors are discussed. Finally, the SSST was applied for testing Ta capacitors, polymer aluminum capacitors (PA capacitors), and multi-layer ceramic (<b>MLC)</b> <b>capacitors</b> with both precious metal electrodes (PME) and base metal electrodes (BME). The test results are found to be directly associated with the dielectric layer breakdown in Ta and PA capacitors and are independent of the capacitor values, the way the capacitors were built, and the capacitors manufacturers. The test results also show that <b>MLC</b> <b>capacitors</b> exhibit surge breakdown voltages much higher than the rated voltage and that the breakdown field is inversely proportional to the dielectric layer thickness. The SSST data {{can also be used to}} comparatively evaluate the voltage robustness of capacitors for decoupling applications...|$|R
40|$|The primary fault {{created in}} surface-mount <b>MLC</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is related to}} flex cracking. This fault is created by a shear force applied to the ceramic element {{suspended}} between the terminations faces {{in contact with the}} PCB.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION Summary Multilayer ceramic capacitors prepared from various mid-K and high-K {{barium titanate}}-based laboratory compositions were studied to understand the conduction and failure mechanisms. For these laboratory ceramics, two types of failure modes, called avalanche breakdown or ABD and thermal runaway or TRA, were found. The ABD type failures were caused by extrinsic flaws such as delaminations, cracks and thin spots, and TRA type failures were attributed to intrinsic type imperfections such as electronic disorders, grain boundaries {{and the presence of}} a second phase. The voltage acceleration studies yielded voltage exponent values in the range of 2 to 4, and the temperature acceleration was best described by a pseudo activation energy for the process. Current-voltage plots were evaluated to study the endurance of the various ceramics under stress. These observations were employed to develop test conditions to screen parts with one to two orders of magnitude lower failure rates. Employing the understanding obtained from the above studies, the control of production processes and ceramics allowed further improvement of mean time to failure by another order of magnitude.

40|$|International audienceMultilayer <b>capacitors</b> (<b>MLCs)</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} 11 studied electrocaloric (EC) systems because they are {{regarded}} as the 12 most promising configuration for developing electrocaloric prototype 13 devices. Indeed, (1) they combine thin films prone to exhibit the so- 14 called giant EC effect; (2) they are made of several hundred active 15 layers; and (3) their internal interdigitated structure alternating highly 16 thermally conductive electrodes with EC layers should dramatically 17 increase their propensity to extract heat. Although the latter has been 18 foreseen by modeling, it has never been observed experimentally. Here 19 we use an infrared camera to observe for the first time the heat flux 20 crossing standard EC MLCs during operation. Interestingly, we 21 observed that heat flux perpendicular to the terminal−terminal 22 direction accounts for only 20 % of the total heat flux. This observation 23 strongly suggests that all future electrocaloric cooling devices should rely on a design favoring heat exchange through the 24 MLC terminals. 25 T he electrocaloric effect (ECE) is defined as the 26 adiabatic temperature change, ΔT, or isothermal 27 entropy change, ΔS, of a material upon application 28 or withdrawal of an external electric field, ΔE. 1, 2 Electrocaloric 29 refrigeration based on ECE is regarded as a solid-state 30 alternative to conventional vapor-compression cooling technol- 31 ogy. 3 − 7 Interestingly, electrocaloric refrigerator prototypes 32 based on multilayer <b>capacitors</b> (<b>MLCs)</b> (see the typical f 1 33 structure as shown in Figure 1 a) were recently designed 34 attesting to the potential of MLCs for cooling applications. 8 − 11 35 The promise of using MLCs is that heat flow can be conducted 36 by the inner interdigitated electrodes. 12, 13 Previous works 37 assumed a homogeneous distribution of temperature change in 38 the electrocaloric active ceramic regions, and the behavior of 39 electrocaloric heat flux between the center of ceramic regions 40 and the metallic terminals was only foreseen by modeling. 12, 14 41 Direct experiments are still lacking; however, understanding the 42 heat flow behavior in specific caloric prototype devices is crucial 43 to optimize refrigeration efficiency. 6 For instance, in active 44 magnetic regeneration, the control of heat flux direction has 45 been shown to be very useful to enhance the operating 46 frequency and thus the power density of the device. 15 47 Interestingly, infrared (IR) imaging can now enable a direct 48 determination of caloric effects both temporally and 49 spatially. 16 − 24 For instance, previous studies have demonstrated 50 the ability of this tool to measure real-time caloric responses 51 with good precision, which was confirmed by simultaneously 52 monitoring using a thermocouple 17, 19, 21 or by comparison with 53 differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 20 The noncontact IR 54 camera is compact and fast compared to other techniques, i. e., 55 DSC, and its use is rather simple. More importantly, the IR 56 camera can directly image spatial caloric response, which is the 57 main advantage over other techniques such as DSC, 58 thermocouple, and other specifically designed calorimeters. As 59 a result, spatially resolved measurements have been conducted 60 to study the local inhomogeneity of elastocaloric and 61 magnetocaloric responses relevant to the microstructure 62 nucleation dynamics of phase transition 17, 23 and correlated to 63 local magnetic field strength. 16 However, spatial imaging of the 64 ECE is rarely reported.

40|$|The {{perovskite}} family {{includes many}} titanates used in various electroceramic applications,for Example,electronic, electro-optical, and electromechanical applications of ceramics.

Because of people’s demands, dielectric (essentially nonconducting) characteristics of ceramic materials are increasing rapidly. At the same time, people are attempting {{to reduce the size of}} all communication devices as small and as light as possible. Due to this trend, high dielectric constant materials such as barium titanate have nowadays become more and more important in ceramic materials. This thesis describes perovskite structure based on barium titanate composition. Oxide perovskites (ABO 3) are important electroceramics having a large area of functionalities by virtue of their unique magnetic, dielectric, semiconducting or superconducting properties. These properties are related to the crystal structure, microstructure, and nature and distribution of point defects prevailing in the ceramics, which, in turn, depend on synthesis routes and processing parameters adopted. Extensive studies are reported in literature on these aspects of ceramics. The properties are also sensitive to such factors as atomic composition (non-stoichiometry), interfacial characteristics and chemical states as well as distribution, spatial and depth-wise, of the constituents of the material. Non-stoichiometry, oxygen non-stoichiometry in particular, is prevalent in perovskites. Oxygen vacancies, apart from bringing about structural modifications, act as donors and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of ceramics. The atomic composition in interfacial regions of polycrystalline materials is often different from the nominal or bulk composition. Therefore, a detailed study on these aspects of materials is desirable for a comprehensive assessment of their properties. This thesis presents investigations on the atomic composition and microstructural features of barium titanate and other electronic ceramics, namely, barium calcium titanates, barium praseodymium titanates and barium dysprosium titanates, by surface analytical techniques.

Research into this electrocaloric (EC) effect has focussed on increasing {{the size of the}} EC effects, with the long-term aim of building a cooler with an EC material at its heart. Materials and experimental methods are briefly reviewed. A ‘resetting’ indirect route to isothermal entropy change ∆S for hysteretic first-order transitions is described. An indirect route to adiabatic temperature change ∆T, without the need for field-resolved heat capacity data, is also described. Three temperature controllers were built: a cryogenic probe for 77 - 420 K with ∼ 5 mK resolution, a high-temperature stage with vacuum enclosure for 295 - 700 K with ∼ 15 mK resolution, and a low-temperature stage for 120 - 400 K with electrical access via micropositioners. Automation enables dense datasets to be compiled. Single crystals of inorganic salts (NH 4) 2 SO 4, KNO 3 and NaNO 2 were obtained. Applying 380 kV cm− 1 across (NH 4) 2 SO 4, it was found that |∆S| ∼ 20 J K− 1 kg− 1 and |∆T | ∼ 4 K, using the indirect method near the Curie temperature TC = 223 K. Without the ‘resetting’ indirect method, |∆S| ∼ 45 J K− 1 kg− 1 would have been spuriously found. Preliminary indirect measurements on KNO 3 and NaNO 2 give |∆S| ∼ 75 J K− 1 kg− 1 for ∆E ∼ 31 kV cm− 1 near TC = 400 K and |∆S| ∼ 14 J K− 1 kg− 1 for ∆E ∼ 15 kV cm− 1 near TC = 435 K, respectively. A cation-ordered PbSc 0. 5 Ta 0. 5 O 3 ceramic showing a nominally first-order transition at 295 K was obtained. The Clausius-Clapeyron phase diagram is revealed via indirect measurements where |∆S| ∼ 3. 25 J K− 1 kg− 1 and |∆T | ∼ 2 K, and direct measurements where |∆T | ∼ 2 K. Clamped samples show broadening of the field-induced transition. Epitaxial, ∼ 64 nm-thick SrTiO 3 films were grown by pulsed laser deposition on NdGaO 3 (001) substrates with a La 0. 67 Sr 0. 33 MnO 3 bottom electrode.
