5|$|Licensed and {{unlicensed}} {{variants of}} Sega consoles {{have been produced}} by third-party companies. In Brazil, Tectoy created and released the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> 3 Compact, which may function wirelessly with an RF transmitter. An SKU of this console targeted at female gamers, the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> Girl, was molded in bright pink plastic. A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil as the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. Another <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> variant, built as a handheld game console, was released by Coleco in North America in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sega {{redesigned}} the Mark III {{for release}} in North America as the Sega <b>Master</b> <b>System.</b> This {{was followed by}} a European release the next year. Although the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> was a success in Europe, and later in Brazil, it failed to ignite significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets, which, by the mid-to-late 1980s, were both dominated by Nintendo. With Sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market, Sega's console R team, led by Masami Ishikawa and supervised by Hideki Sato, began work on a successor to the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> almost immediately after that console launched.|$|E
5|$|Sales of the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> {{have been}} {{estimated}} at 13 million units, not including recent Brazil sales, {{in contrast to}} the 62 million units sold by its chief competitor, the Famicom. Sega would close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis, which sold 30.75 million consoles compared with the 49 million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles sold by Nintendo. The <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America. In 1989, the Sega <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> was listed in the top 20 products of NPD Group's Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service. However, the Electronic Gaming Monthly 1992 Buyer's Guide indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality titles for the <b>Master</b> <b>System.</b> In 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases. According to Bill Pearse of Playthings, the NES gained an advantage over the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> through the use of better software and stronger character identification.|$|E
40|$|Generalizing a {{construction}} of P. Vanhaecke, we introduce a large class of degenerate (i. e., associated to a degenerate Poisson bracket) completely integrable systems on (a dense subset of) the space ^ 2 d+n+ 1, called the generalized <b>master</b> <b>systems.</b> It {{turns out that}} certain generalized <b>master</b> <b>systems</b> (with different Poisson brackets and different Hamiltonians) determine the same Hamiltonian vector fields (and are therefore different descriptions of the same Hamiltonian system), and that the Poisson brackets of these systems are compatible. Consequently, our class of generalized <b>master</b> <b>systems</b> actually consists of a (smaller) class of completely integrable systems, and our construction yields a multi-Hamiltonian structure for these systems. As an application, we construct a multi-Hamiltonian structure for the so-called <b>master</b> <b>systems</b> introduced by D. Mumford. Comment: 25 pages, plain TeX, necessary macros include...|$|R

5|$|Succeeding the SG-1000, the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> was {{released}} {{as a direct}} competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the third generation of video game consoles. The NES used virtually the same hardware as the 1983 Famicom while the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> was constructed with more up-to-date hardware. Despite improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil. Compared with its competition from Nintendo, the Master System's game library lacked a number of well-received titles, due to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity to the NES.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land amassed {{moderate}} sales, and the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> version received overall positive reviews {{in all aspects}} and has been highly {{regarded as one of}} the better titles in the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> library. Reviews praised the game for its colorful graphics, smooth controls, gameplay, and replay value. Other ports received mixed reception: criticisms included very slow multi-load times on the home computer versions, sub-quality sound, and smaller play areas. The arcade version would later be re-released in emulated form as a digital download for Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} the game for the Sega <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> and Game Gear was {{developed}} by Aspect. Though based on the original game of the same name, it is a distinct game, with different level designs and a different plot, and this version, unlike the 16-bit release, {{does not have the}} spin dash, which led it to being thought to be made before the Sega Genesis version.|$|E

5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> and platforming fans alike.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{was one of}} {{the primary}} {{competitors}} to Nintendo in the video game console industry. A few of Sega's early consoles outsold their competitors in specific markets, such as the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> in Europe. Several of the company's later consoles were commercial failures, however, and the financial losses incurred from the Dreamcast console caused the company to restructure itself in 2001. As a result, Sega ceased to manufacture consoles and became a third-party video game developer. The only console that Sega has produced since is the educational toy console Advanced Pico Beena in 2005. Third-party variants of Sega consoles have been produced by licensed manufacturers, even after production of the original consoles had ended. Many of these variants have been produced in Brazil, where versions of the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> and Genesis are still sold and games for them are still developed.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis was {{the first}} Sega console to receive {{third-party}} versions. Its first variants were released before any <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> variants, even though the Genesis was released {{three years after the}} <b>Master</b> <b>System.</b> Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega, a Mega Drive and Mega CD combination with high quality audio, in Japan on April 1, 1992. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. A Pioneer LaserActive add-on pack, developed by Sega, allows the system to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox. Several companies added the Genesis to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990 distributed in Kuwait and Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC distributed in Europe and Australia. After the Genesis was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 in North America as a budget version of the console in 1998. Majesco also released a budget version of the Sega Pico in North America in August 1999.|$|E

50|$|So {{that users}} of the 3M Digital <b>Mastering</b> <b>System</b> could take {{advantage}} of Soundstream's editing system, the company developed the M Adapter. The adapter was a bidirectional eight-channel format converter. Data from the 3M Digital <b>Mastering</b> <b>System</b> were converted to the format used by the Soundstream DTR so that the data appearing at the input to the Digital Audio Interface looked to the DAI as if it had come from a DTR. Similarly, finished (edited) data in Soundstream format were restored to the 3M format by the adapter.|$|R
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is {{a falling}} block puzzle video game {{developed}} by Compile {{and published by}} Sega. It was released for the Genesis/Mega Drive in North America and Europe in November 1993, and was ported to the Game Gear and <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> in December 1993 and June 1994, respectively. The plot revolves around Sonic the Hedgehog series antagonist Doctor Robotnik kidnapping residents from Beanville and turning them into robots, {{with the purpose of}} removing all joy from the planet Mobius.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000, {{also known}} as the Sega Computer Videogame SG-1000, is a cartridge-based home video game console {{manufactured}} by Sega and released in Japan, Australia, and other countries. It was Sega's first entry into the home video game hardware business, and provided the basis for the more successful <b>Master</b> <b>System.</b> Introduced in 1983, the SG-1000 was released {{on the same day that}} Nintendo released the Family Computer (Famicom for short) in Japan. The SG-1000 was released in several forms, including the SC-3000 computer and the redesigned SG-1000 II, {{also known as}} the Mark II, released in 1984.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} also been ported to various consoles. It was ported by Mindscape to the Amiga home {{computers}} in 1992, by Arc System Works to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear both on 13 July 1993, and by Mindscape to the Amiga CD32 in 1994. Ports for PC DOS and the Atari ST were planned by Mindscape but never released. European CEO of Virgin Interactive, Tim Chaney, purchased the rights for Battletoads from Tradewest after the game found popularity in the United States, and planned a <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> release in 1993; however, it never materialised.|$|E
5|$|The main {{microprocessor}} is a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7.6 MHz. The console uses a Zilog Z80 sub-processor, mainly used {{to control}} the sound hardware and provide backward compatibility with the <b>Master</b> <b>System.</b> The system has 72 kB of RAM, 64 kB of video RAM, and can display up to 61 colors at once from a palette of 512. The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the game on the Amiga led to its rapid porting to many other platforms, and it is {{regarded as one of}} the most widely ported video games. Within a year of its release, the game had been ported to Atari ST, Sinclair Spectrum, PC and SNES. David Jones stated that after porting the game to 20 systems, he stopped keeping count of additional ports. Other commercial ports of the original game include 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Apple II, Apple Macintosh, CDTV, Commodore 64, NES, Sega <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> and Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, Philips CD-i and Sharp X68000.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, cloud {{computing}} has gained prominence and most companies are applying {{some kind of}} {{cloud computing}} technology in their company or part of it. Growing number of clients {{who are willing to}} use cloud services has made load balancing an eminent challenge in this field. A general approach to load balancing is the application of Divisible Load Theory (DLT). In DLT, the workload is divided among <b>master</b> <b>systems.</b> For their turn, <b>master</b> <b>systems</b> divide the load among their slave systems. This article presents an enhanced technique for load balancing based on DLT. Simulated results indicate that the expanded DLT reduces measurement/report time and shows an improved performance at a lower failure rate...|$|R

50|$|The Vectrex was {{the first}} and only home-based system to ever use a vector-based screen. It was also the first home system to offer a 3D {{peripheral}} (the Vectrex 3D Imager), in 1984, predating the Sega <b>Master</b> <b>System's</b> SegaScope 3D by several years.|$|R
5|$|Also {{developed}} by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Game Gear and <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> ports {{are similar to}} the Game Boy port, but in color instead of in monochrome. Both of them are almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with the addition of Kintaro. The arena where players fight Jade and Smoke is exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, but was drastically reduced in quantity when compared to other ports. Because of the systems' limited graphical resources, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent's body, leaving generic gibs of bones and limbs, while others were also simplified to use common animations.|$|E
5|$|Dynamite Headdy was {{originally}} released in Japan on 5 August 1994 for the Sega Genesis, with North American and European releases following in September and October respectively. A port was released for the Game Gear, and a <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> port {{based on the}} Game Gear version was released exclusively in Brazil. The game was included along with Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier in Sega Ages 2500: Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, a compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan. The compilation includes all versions of Dynamite Headdy released on all three Sega platforms across all regions. The game saw a digital re-release on the Wii via the Virtual Console in July 2007. It was also included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and most recently was released on Steam on 2 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Nomad {{does not}} have its own game library, but instead plays Genesis games. At {{the time of its}} launch, the Nomad had over 500 games {{available}} for play. However, no pack-in title was included. The Nomad can boot unlicensed, homebrew, and bootleg games made for the Genesis. Some earlier third-party titles have compatibility issues when played on the Nomad, but can be successfully played {{through the use of a}} Game Genie. Likewise, due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis' add-ons, it is unable to play any games for the Sega <b>Master</b> <b>System,</b> Sega CD, or Sega 32X.
