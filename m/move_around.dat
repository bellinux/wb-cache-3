5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to <b>move</b> <b>around,</b> or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} <b>move</b> <b>around</b> each other in stable orbits. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can {{have a significant impact on}} their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae <b>move</b> <b>around</b> inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E

50|$|Between 1941 and 1944, the {{regiment}} <b>moved</b> <b>around</b> the country, from Otley, to Eastbourne, South Lancing, Charing, and eventually Aldershot. Along with this, {{the regiment}}'s tanks and their crews often <b>moved</b> <b>around</b> {{the country to}} various gunnery ranges, such as at Bovington Camp in Dorset and Castlemartin in Wales.|$|R

5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to <b>move</b> <b>around</b> more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{occupation}} of South Kasai, the South Kasaian state was not dismantled and co-existed {{with the rest of}} the Congo. Congolese delegates, as well as ANC and UN troops were generally able to <b>move</b> <b>around</b> the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian authorities while their sporadic campaign against Katangese forces continued. Nevertheless, throughout much of the period, the South Kasaian gendarmerie fought with Kanyok and Lulua militias across the region while local ethnic violence persisted.|$|E
5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people <b>move</b> <b>around</b> and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E

In most implementations of inductive charging, the mobile device must be left on a pad to charge, and thus can't be <b>moved</b> <b>around</b> or easily operated while charging.|$|R
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species <b>move</b> <b>around</b> quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species <b>move</b> <b>around</b> on land by {{resting on the}} breast and pushing themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must <b>move</b> <b>around</b> the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then {{one of them will}} win.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors <b>move</b> <b>around</b> invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can <b>move</b> <b>around</b> the USS Voyager and interact with other members of its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{shareholders}} {{decided to}} open the property year-round; it had only previously opened for the summer season.

5|$|This was Bowie's {{first tour}} where {{wireless}} microphone technology was available, allowing Bowie considerable freedom to <b>move</b> <b>around</b> the stage during a concert. This {{allowed him to}} interact with the dancers and musicians much more freely, and as such the set included 3-story high mobile scaffolding, onto which Bowie and his dancers would occasionally climb during the show.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and <b>move</b> <b>around</b> on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|As they <b>move</b> <b>around</b> {{the city}} in the van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E

5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to <b>move</b> <b>around</b> was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's province while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to <b>move</b> <b>around</b> the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they <b>move</b> <b>around.</b> They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
