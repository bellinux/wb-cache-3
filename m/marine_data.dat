40|$|Even {{though the}} encoded multi-source {{approach}} dramatically reduces the computational cost of waveform inversion, {{it is generally}} not applicable to <b>marine</b> streamer <b>data.</b> This is because the simultaneous-sources modeled data cannot be muted {{to comply with the}} configuration of the <b>marine</b> streamer <b>data,</b> which causes differences in the number of stacked-traces, or energy levels, between the modeled and observed data. Since the conventional L 2 norm does not account for the difference in energy levels, multi-source inversion based on the conventional L 2 norm does not work for <b>marine</b> streamer <b>data.</b> In this study, we propose the L 2, approximated L 2, and L 1 norm using the normalized wavefields for the multi-source waveform inversion of <b>marine</b> streamer <b>data.</b> Since the normalized wavefields mitigate the different energy levels between the observed and modeled wavefields, the multi-source waveform inversion using the normalized wavefields can be applied to <b>marine</b> streamer <b>data.</b> We obtain the gradient of the objective functions using the back-propagation algorithm. To conclude, the gradient of the L 2 norm using the normalized wavefields is exactly {{the same as that of}} the global correlation norm.
