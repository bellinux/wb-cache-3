40|$|Inversive <b>meadows</b> are {{commutative}} rings with a multiplicative {{identity element}} {{and a total}} multiplicative inverse operation satisfying 0 − 1 = 0. Divisive <b>meadows</b> are inversive <b>meadows</b> with the multiplicative inverse operation replaced by a division operation. We give finite equational specifications {{of the class of}} all inversive <b>meadows</b> and the class of all divisive <b>meadows.</b> It depends on the angle from which they are viewed whether inversive <b>meadows</b> or divisive <b>meadows</b> must be considered more basic. We show that inversive and divisive <b>meadows</b> of rational numbers can be obtained as initial algebras of finite equational specifications. In the spirit of Peacockʼs arithmetical algebra, we study variants of inversive and divisive <b>meadows</b> without an additive identity element and/or an additive inverse operation. We propose simple constructions of variants of inversive and divisive <b>meadows</b> with a partial multiplicative inverse or division operation from inversive and divisive <b>meadows.</b> Divisive <b>meadows</b> are more basic if these variants are considered as well. We give a simple account of how mathematicians deal with 1 / 0, in which <b>meadows</b> and a customary convention among mathematicians play prominent parts, and we make plausible that a convincing account, starting from the popular computer science viewpoint that 1 / 0 is undefined, by means of some logic of partial functions is not attainable...|$|R

5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between <b>meadow</b> and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon <b>meadow</b> habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
