5|$|After Caesar's assassination, Mark Antony, who {{had been}} Caesar's <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse, formed an {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution, and as such, the senate and assemblies remained powerless. The conspirators were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Lepidus became powerless, and Antony went to Egypt to seek glory in the east, while Octavian remained in Rome. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and committed suicide in 30 BC. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome, as the unchallenged <b>master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. In 27 BC, Octavian offered to give up the Dictatorial powers which he had held since 42 BC, but the senate refused, and thus ratified his status as <b>master</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. He became the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the transition from Roman Republic to Roman Empire was complete.|$|E
