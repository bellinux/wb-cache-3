40|$|Abstract. The European Council has {{recently}} endorsed to achieve unilaterally {{at least a}} 20 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 level. Using a multi-sector, multi-region CGE model framework and implementing selected competitiveness indicators, we investigate implications of alternative emission reduction targets and tax differentiation regimes on leakage rates, economy-wide and sectoral competitiveness, and efficiency. For a given emission reduction target, tax differentiation towards energy-intensive industries is a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> for improving EU-wide international competitiveness (terms of trade) or efficiency. Our results indicate also that competitiveness effects at the sectoral level are highly sensitive to the particular indicator chosen and strongly responding {{to the level of}} tax differentiation. In contrast, leakage rates are much more robust with respect to alternative tax differentiation regimes...|$|R
2500|$|When attacking Luftwaffe bombers, it was {{discovered}} that the Hurricane's fuel tanks were vulnerable to defensive machine gun fire. The greatest hazard was with the unprotected gravity-feed fuel tank in front of the cockpit which could rupture when hit, allowing a jet of flame to penetrate the cockpit through the instrument panel, causing serious burn injuries to the pilot. The wooden and fabric rear fuselage was also far more likely to catch fire than the metal fuselages of its contemporaries. This issue was of such concern to Air Vice Marshal Hugh Dowding that he had Hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of Hurricanes with a fire-resistant material called [...] "Linatex" [...] as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority.</b> The wing tanks had already been fitted with a covering of this sealant, but the fuselage tank was considered to be too small a target. Hurricanes were soon being modified at the rate of 75 per month. In one month of combat, 10 July 1940 to 11 August, defensive fire from bombers hit 25 Hurricanes and 25 Spitfires; as a result 11 Hurricanes were shot down compared with two Spitfires.|$|E

40|$|In a {{world with}} {{regionally}} diverging commitments to climate pol-icy across nations, unilateral carbon abatement induces two problems: It tends to have a detrimental effect on domestic competitiveness, and it fosters increasing carbon emissions abroad (leakage). This paper analyses two policies that have been proposed to mitigate these prob-lems: Border tax adjustments (BTA) and integrated emission trading (IET). The former levies a quantity-based, the latter an emission based duty on imports from non-abating countries. In a stylized two-country model we demonstrate that both policies achieve their double goal. However, BTA is more effective in protecting domestic competitive-ness, IET reduces foreign emissions to a larger extent. These results are confirmed by a a computable general equilibrium analysis, where we adopt a unilateral abatement policy that reduces emissions by 20 % in the European Union. We conclude that the choice between BTA and IET regimes for the European Union is a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> for international competitiveness or global environmental effectiveness...|$|R
