40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{engineering}} designer defines the structural and the geometrical {{aspects of the}} product based on the functional requirements. In the detailed design step, the material corresponding to the product requirements is chosen. In this step, several loops are done in order to adapt the topology and the geometry according to new <b>material</b> <b>specifications.</b> In order to minimize these loops and using the integrated design paradigm, this research proposes a new approach. In this approach, the product geometry and structure are driven by the <b>material</b> <b>specifications</b> {{with the help of}} new CAD tools. The combination of insights from functional and material domains builds the theoretical background for this new proposed approach, called Design for Materials. The concept of CAD multi-views skeleton, customized according to the <b>material</b> <b>specifications,</b> is proposed as input of the detailed design. An implementation of this new approach in a CAD system is presented...|$|R
5000|$|ASTM A992 is {{currently}} the most available steel type for structural wide-flange beams. The industry's technical institute describes the standard thus: [...] "ASTM A992 (Fy = 50 ksi, Fu = 65 ksi) is the preferred <b>material</b> <b>specification</b> for wide-flange shapes, having replaced ASTM A36 and A572 grade 50. There {{are a couple of}} noteworthy enhancements with ASTM A992. Material ductility is well defined since a maximum yield-to-tensile strength ratio of 0.85 is specified. Additionally, weldability is improved since a maximum carbon equivalent value of 0.45 (0.47 for Group 4 and 5 shapes) is required. ASTM A992 is written to cover all hot-rolled shapes." ...|$|E
50|$|The unified {{numbering}} system (UNS) is an alloy designation system widely accepted in North America. It {{consists of a}} prefix letter and five digits designating a material composition. For example, a prefix of S indicates stainless steel alloys, C indicates copper, brass, or bronze alloys, T indicates tool steels, and so on. The first 3 digits often match older 3-digit {{numbering system}}s, while the last 2 digits indicate more modern variations. For example, Copper Alloy No. 377 (forging brass) in the original 3-digit system became C37700 in the UNS System. The UNS is managed jointly by the ASTM International and SAE International. A UNS number alone does not constitute a full <b>material</b> <b>specification</b> because it establishes no requirements for material properties, heat treatment, form, or quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of photographic lenses have the lens elements made from glass although {{the use of}} high-quality plastics is becoming more common in high-quality lenses and has been common in inexpensive cameras for some time. The design of photographic lenses is very demanding as designers push the limits of existing materials to make more versatile, better-quality, and lighter lenses. As a consequence many exotic glasses {{have been used in}} modern lens manufacturing. Caesium and lanthanum glass lenses are now in use because of their high refractive index and very low dispersion properties. It is also likely that a number of other transition element glasses are in use but manufacturers often prefer to keep their <b>material</b> <b>specification</b> secret to retain a commercial or performance edge over their rivals.|$|E

5000|$|... where E is {{the rate}} of etching (usually {{abbreviated}} to etch rate), s is {{the depth of the}} cut required, and t is the total immersion time. [...] Etch rate varies based on a number of factors, including the concentration and composition of the etchant, the material to be etched, and temperature conditions. Due to its inconstant nature, etch rate is often determined experimentally immediately prior to the etching process. A small sample of the material to be cut, of the same <b>material</b> <b>specification,</b> heat-treatment condition, and approximately the same thickness is etched for a certain time; after this time, the depth of the etch is measured and used with the time to calculate the etch rate. Aluminium is commonly etched at rates around 0.178 cm/h, and magnesium about 0.46 cm/h.|$|E
50|$|Inspection {{activities}} play a {{vital role}} in the production of high-quality soil nail walls because conformance to project plans and specifications should result in a soil nail wall that will perform its intended duty for its designed duration. Inspections usually involve evaluation of the following: conformance of system components to <b>material</b> <b>specification,</b> conformance of construction methods to execution specifications, conformance to short-term performance specifications, and long-term monitoring. Short-term performance specifications are checked with loads tests, which utilize hydraulic jacks and pumps to perform several load applications. Three common load tests for short-term performance are verification or ultimate load tests, proof tests and creep tests. Verification or ultimate load tests are conducted to verify the compliance of the soil nails with pullout capacity and strengths resulting from the contractor's installation method. Proof tests are intended to verify that the contractor's construction procedure has been consistent and that the nails have not been drilled and grouted in a soil zone not tested in the verification stage. Creep tests are performed to ensure that the nail design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure's service life.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{years of}} {{airworthiness}} regulations research, {{combined with the}} experience of airworthiness certification of civil aviation products, the airworthiness requirement to materials for civil aviation products was analyzed. The key airworthiness requirement for materials is that materials should conform to some <b>material</b> <b>specification</b> to ensure their having the strength and other properties adopted in the design data. The shortcomings of domestic airworthiness management methods for civil aviation materials was discussed and three recommendations for improvement were proposed:(1) conduct individual airworthiness management for civil aviation materials according to CCAR 21. 351 through 371 and CCAR 37; (2) develop and promote statistical-based <b>material</b> <b>specification</b> developing methods, to establish material specifications which could ensure material having the strength and other properties adopted in the design data; (3) establish a cooperation mechanism for developing material design value data base for civil aviation materials to reduce the cost of airworthiness certification activities.
