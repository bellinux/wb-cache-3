40|$|Eight fermentative mycoplasmas differing in genome size, {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) base composition, or sterol {{dependence}} were examined for lactic dehydrogenase composition by spectrophotometric assay and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three completely different patterns of lactic dehydrogenase composition were found.

Electrophoresis of cell-free extracts {{of each of these}} mycoplasmas produced, with the exception of M. mycoides var. mycoides and UM 30847, single, different enzyme bands. M. mycoides var. mycoides and UM 30847 were similar and formed multiple bands of enzyme activity. We were unable to establish whether these multiple bands were due to lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes or artifacts. (ii) An NAD-dependent d(−) -lactic dehydrogenase which could not be reversed to oxidize lactate was found in M. fermentans. (iii) A. laidlawii A possessed an NAD-independent d(−) -lactic dehydrogenase capable of reducing dichlorophenol-indophenol, and an NAD-dependent l(+) -lactic dehydrogenase which is specifically activated by fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate.

50|$|May 20, 2010- Researchers at the JCVI have {{successfully}} created a synthetic bacterial cell that {{is capable of}} replicating itself.

The original proteins and biological materials of the converted cell use the new artificially DNA to generate daughter cells. These daughter cells are of synthetic origin and capable of further replication. This proves that genomes can be designed on computers. The steps they applied to build this was first they simulated a model of this genome computationally, they identified DNA via watermarks; next, they chemically produced this genome in the laboratory and finally, transplanted this genome into a recipient cell to produce a synthetic cell solely controlled by this synthetic genome.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, D.G. Edward and E.A. Freundt made a first {{proposal}} for classifying and naming PPLOs. They left undecided, however, whether {{they belong to}} the bacteria (prokaryotes, in 1956 called [...] "Schizomycetes") or to the eukaryotes. As type species (name-giving species) of the PPLOs/mycoplasmas, Edward and Freundt proposed <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides,</b> being the causative organism of bovine pleuropneumonia and referring to the pleuropneumonia-like organisms. Until then, <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> was known as Asterococcus mycoides, but later that name was not recognized as valid. In their publication of 1956, they described 15 species of Mycoplasma. In 1967 the class Mollicutes, containing the order Mycoplasmatales, was proposed by the Subcommittee on Taxonomy of the Mycoplasmata. Now, the name Mycoplasma should exclusively be used {{for members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, rather than the use as a trivial name for any mollicute. As the trivial name has been used in literature for a long time, this is yet not always the case.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{using the}} methods {{described}} above, Venter and colleagues created {{a strain of}} <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> called JCVI-syn1.0 with a synthetic genome. Initially the synthetic construct did not work, so to pin point the error—which caused a delay of 3 months in the whole project—a series of semi-synthetic constructs were created.

50|$|The {{construction}} of a cell with a synthetic genome was done to test the methodology—allowing more modified genomes to be created in the future. To minimize sources of failure, the genome was created using a natural genome as a template. Due to the large size of a genome, apart from the elements required for propagation in yeast and residues from restriction sites, several differences are present in <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> JCVI-syn1.0 notably an E.coli transposon IS1 (an infection from the 10kb stage) and an 85bp duplication.|$|E

The outbreak was so severe that it resulted in a trade embargo by the British government, blocking U.S. cattle exports to Britain and Canada. This prompted the United States to establish the Bureau of Animal Industry, set up in 1884 to eradicate the disease, which it succeeded in doing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classification}} of the Mollicutes {{has always been}} difficult. The individuals are tiny, and being parasites, {{they have to be}} cultivated on special media. Until now, many species could not be isolated at all. In the beginning, whether they were fungi, viruses, or bacteria was not clear. Also, the resemblance to L-forms was confusing. At first, all members of the class Mollicutes were generally named [...] "mycoplasma" [...] or pleuropneumonia-like organism (PPLO).

50|$|The goal of Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR) {{technology}} in synthetic genomics is to combine DNA contigs {{by means of}} homologous recombination performed by the Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC). Of importance is the CEN element within the YAC vector, which corresponds to the yeast centromere. This sequence gives the vector the ability to behave in a chromosomal manner, thereby allowing it to perform homologous recombination.First, Gap Repair Cloning is performed to generate regions of homology flanking the DNA contigs. Gap Repair Cloning is a particular form of the Polymerase Chain Reaction in which specialized primers with extensions beyond the sequence of the DNA target are utilized. Then, the DNA cassettes {{are exposed to the}} YAC vector, which drives the process of homologous recombination, thereby connecting the DNA cassettes. Polymerase Cycling Assembly and TAR technology were used together to construct the 600 kb Mycoplasma genitalium genome in 2008, the first synthetic organism ever created. Similar steps were taken in synthesizing the larger <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> genome a few years later.|$|E

A microarray containing genetic sequences of 55 different bacterial species from Acholeplasma, Mycoplasma, Spiroplasma and Ureaplasma genera was constructed. Sequences to genes of interest were collected in FASTA format from NCBI. The collected sequences were processed with OligoPicker software. Oligonucleotides were then checked for their selectivity with BLAST searches in GenBank. The microarray was tested with ATCC/NCTC strains of Mycoplasma spp. of veterinary importance in ruminants including Mycoplasma belonging to the mycoides cluster as well as <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides and <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. capri field strains. The results showed that but one ATCC/NCTC reference strains hybridized with their species-specific sequences showed a profile/signature different and distinct from each other. The heat-map of the hybridization results for the nine genes interrogated for <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides demonstrated that the reference strain <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp mycoides PG 1 was positive for all of the gene sequences spotted on the microarray. CBPP field, vaccine and reference strains were all typed to be M. mycoides subsp. mycoides, and seven of the nine strains gave positive hybridization results for all of the nine genes. Two Italian strains were negative for some of the genes. Comparison with non-Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides reference strains showed some positive signals or considerable homology to <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides genes. As expected, some correlations were observed between the strictly genetically and antigenically correlated <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides and <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. capri strains. Specifically, we observed that some Italian <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides strains were positive for two out of the three <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. capri genes, differently from what has been observed for other European or African <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides strains. This study highlighted the use of microarray technology as a simple and effective method for a single-step identification and differentiation of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides from other mycoplasmas that may be pathogenic to ruminants, including those of the <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> cluster, genetically and antigenically strictly correlated with <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides. The opportunity to discriminate several mycoplasmas in a single analysis enhances diagnostic rapidity and may represent a useful tool to screen occasionally mycoplasmas affecting animal farming in territories where diagnostic laboratory support is limited. The heat-map of the hybridization results of the comparative genomic hybridizations DNA-designed chip clearly indicates that the microarray performs well for the identification of the tested <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides reference and field strains, discriminating them from other mycoplasmas.

Extracted EPS was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, resulting in the identification of a homopolymer of ?(1 ? 2) -glucopyranose (glucan) in M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae and M. leachii. Monoclonal antibodies specific for this glucan and for the <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides-secreted galactan were used to detect the two polysaccharides. While M. mycoides subsp. capri strains of serovar LC produced only capsular galactan, no polysaccharide could be detected in strains of serovar Capri. All strains of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae and M. leachii produced glucan CPS and EPS, whereas glucan production and localization varied among M. capricolum subsp. capricolum strains. Genes associated with polysaccharide synthesis and forming a biosynthetic pathway were predicted in all cluster members. These genes were organized in clusters within two loci representing genetic variability hot spots. Phylogenetic analysis showed that some of these genes, notably galE and glf, were acquired via horizontal gene transfer.

40|$|AbstractEthnopharmocological relevanceMembers of ‘Mycoplasma mycoides cluster’ are {{important}} ruminant pathogens in Africa. Diseases caused by these Mycoplasma negatively affect {{the agricultural sector}} especially in developing countries through losses in livestock productivity, mortality and international trade restrictions. There is therefore urgent need to develop antimicrobials from alternative sources such as medicinal plants to curb these diseases. In Kenya, smallholder farmers belonging to the Maasai, Kuria and Luo rely on traditional Kenyan herbals to treat respiratory symptoms in ruminants. In the current study extracts from some of these plants were tested against the growth of members of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> cluster. AimThis study aimed at identifying plants that exhibit antimycoplasmal activities using an ethnobotanical approach. Materials and methodsKenyan farmers of Maasai, Luo and Kuria ethnic groups were interviewed for plant remedies given to livestock with respiratory syndromes. The plant materials were thereafter collected and crude extracts prepared using a mixture of 50 % of methanol (MeOH) in dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2), neat methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and water to yield four crude extracts per plant part. The extracts were tested in vitro against five strains of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. capri, five strains of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides and one strain of Mycoplasma capricolum subsp capricolum using broth micro-dilution assays with an initial concentration of 1 mg/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) {{of the most active}} extracts were determined by serial dilution. ResultsExtracts from five plants namely: Solanum aculeastrum, Albizia coriaria, Ekebergia capensis, Piliostigma thonningii and Euclea divinorum exhibited the highest activities against the Mycoplasma strains tested. <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. mycoides were more susceptible to these extracts than <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>mycoides</b> subsp. capri and Mycoplasma capricolum susp. capricolum. The activities of the crude extracts varied with the solvent used for extraction. The MICs mean values of the active extracts varied from 0. 02 to 0. 6 mg/ml.
