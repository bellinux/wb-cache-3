The book challenges traditional ideas of sovereignty centered around the nation-state, and develops a theory of geopolitics that accounts for sovereignty in terms of planetary-scale computation at various scales. Its two core arguments are (1) that planetary-scale computation “distorts and deforms traditional Westphalian logics of political geography” and creates new territories in its own image, and (2) that different scales of computing technology can understood as forming an “accidental megastructure” that resembles a <b>multi-layer</b> <b>network</b> architecture stack, what Bratton calls “The Stack.” The Stack {{is described as a}} platform. Bratton argues that platforms represent a technical and institutional model equivalent to states or markets but reducible to neither.

The identification of the nodes that allow a better spreading efficiency of these kind of viruses is becoming a determinant part of the defensive strategy against malware. These multi-vector viruses can be modeled in <b>multi-layered</b> <b>networks</b> in which each node belongs simultaneously to different layers, adapting the spreading vector to {{the properties of the}} layer. This way, the same virus has different propagation rates in each layer and also in the <b>multi-layered</b> <b>network</b> considered as a whole. The set of nodes selected as initial group of infected subjects can determine the final propagation of the infection. In this work, we analyze the spreading of a virus in a <b>multi-layered</b> <b>network</b> formed by M layers, given different sets of initial infected nodes, and, in particular, the effect of the initial selection on the efficiency of the infection. The initial group of infected nodes is selected according to properties of the nodes considered as part of a layer and also of the whole system.
