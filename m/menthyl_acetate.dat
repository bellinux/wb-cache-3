40|$|Mint descends {{from the}} Latin word mentha, which {{is rooted in}} the Greek word minthe, {{mentioned}} in Greek mythology as Minthe, a nymph who was transformed into a mint plant. The word itself probably derives from a now extinct pre-Greek language. Mints commonly known, as Pudina in India is an essential culinary herb for thousands of years. Belonging to the genus Mentha and family Lamiaceae, this perennial herb possesses a characteristic olfactory sensation. Among various species three species are mainly cultivated in India as menthol mint- Mentha arvensis, peppermint- Mentha pipperita and spearmint- Mentha spicata. This genus yields various secondary metabolites of immense commercial importance. Among them the most important is menthol along with menthone, <b>menthyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> limonene, carvone and isopeperitone. The chemical constituents associated with the typical smell of this oil are monoterpenes {{and to a lesser extent}} sesquiterpenes which are both structurally diverse group of natural product known as isoprenoids. The leaf, fresh or dried, is the culinary source of mint in global scenario. Fresh mint is usually preferred over dried mint when storage of the mint is not a problem. The leaves have a pleasant warm, fresh, aromatic, sweet flavor with a cool aftertaste. Mint leaves are used in teas, beverages, jellies, syrups, candies, and ice creams. In Middle Eastern cuisine mint is used on lamb dishes. In British cuisine, mint sauce is popular with lamb. Mint is a necessary ingredient in Touareg tea, a popular tea in northern African and Arab countries. Alcoholic drinks sometimes feature flavor of mint, namely the Mint Julep and the Mojito. Almost in all the states of India use this herb for making a green chutney which is used with fish, meat and vegetables. It is also used as a spice for flavouring curries. It is mixed with other spices for making pickles...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Two field {{experiments}} were established {{during the spring}} of 1970 in an effort to characterize the effects of nitrogen fertilizer and plant maturity on the yield, composition and quality of peppermint (Mentha piperitta var. Mitcham) oil. These {{experiments were}} located in central Oregon, near Madras, and in the Willamette Valley, near Corvallis, thus representing the two major peppermint producing regions in the state of Oregon. The objectives of these experiments were (1) To evaluate the effects of various nitrogen treatments on oil yield when harvested at different stages of plant maturity and (2) To determine how the various terpene compounds, which characterize oil quality were affected by nitrogen fertilizer treatments and crop maturity. The experiments were maintained over a period of two years, 1970 and 1971. Both the Corvallis and Madras experiments were randomized block designs having five replications. The nitrogen fertilizer treatments applied to the plots varied in both rate and time of application. Plant maturity treatments consisted of sampling plots at various degrees of inflorescence. These samples were evaluated for oil yield and composition. Oil yield determinations were made using steam distillation and water separation techniques similar to commercial mint oil distilleries. Measurement of terpene hydrocarbons, <b>menthyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> menthone, menthol and menthofuran was accomplished using liquid gas chromatography. The samples of oil were also evaluated for odor by professional graders. Generally, higher oil yields were obtained with heavier nitrogen rates. For Willamette Valley peppermint, rates of 200 to 250 pounds of nitrogen per acre appeared optimum. Slightly higher rates of 250 to 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre seem optimum for high oil yields in the central Oregon production areas. The level of terpene hydrocarbons, the light boiling fractions of mint oil constituents, generally decreased with crop maturation. Nitrogen treatments had little effect on terpene hydrocarbon contents. Acceptable levels of terpene hydrocarbons (9. 5...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{monoterpene}} ketone l-[G- 3 H] menthone is reduced to the epimeric alcohols l-menthol and d-neomenthol in leaves of flowering peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), and that a portion of the menthol is converted to <b>menthyl</b> <b>acetate</b> while the bulk of the neomenthol is transformed to neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside which is then transported to the rhizome (Croteau, Martinkus 1979 Plant Physiol 64 : 169 - 175). Analysis of the disposition of l-[G- 3 H]menthone applied to midstem leaves of intact flowering plants allowed the kinetics of synthesis and transport of the monoterpenyl glucoside to be determined, and gave strong indication that the glucoside was subsequently metabolized in the rhizome. Studies with d-[G- 3 H]neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside as substrate, using excised rhizomes or rhizome segments, confirmed the hydrolysis of the glucoside as an early step in metabolism at this site, and revealed that the terpenoid moiety was further converted to a series of ether-soluble, methanol-soluble, and water-soluble products. Studies with d-[G- 3 H]neomenthol as the substrate, using excised rhizomes, showed the subsequent metabolic steps to involve oxidation of the alcohol back to menthone, followed by an unusual lactonization reaction in which oxygen is inserted between the carbonyl carbon and the carbon bearing the isopropyl group, to afford 3, 4 -menthone lactone. The conversion of menthone to the lactone, and of the lactone to more polar products, were confirmed in vivo using l-[G- 3 H]menthone and l-[G- 3 H]- 3, 4 -menthone lactone as substrates. Additional oxidation products were formed in vivo via the desaturation of labeled neomenthol and/or menthone, but none of these transformations appeared to lead to ring opening of the p-menthane skeleton. Each step in the main reaction sequence, from hydrolysis of neomenthyl glucoside to lactonization of menthone, was demonstrated in cell-free extracts from the rhizomes of flowering mint plants. The lactonization step is of particular significance in providing a means of cleaving the p-menthane ring to afford an acyclic carbon skeleton that can be further degraded by modifications of the well-known β-oxidation sequence...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{monoterpene}} ketone l-[G- 3 H]-menthone is reduced to the epimeric alcohols l-menthol and d-neomenthol in leaf discs of flowering peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), and that a portion of the menthol is converted to <b>menthyl</b> <b>acetate</b> while the bulk of the neomenthol is transformed to neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside (Croteau, Martinkus 1979 Plant Physiol 64 : 169 - 175). The metabolic disposition of the epimeric reduction products of the ketone, which is a major constituent of peppermint oil, is highly specific, in that little neomenthyl acetate and little menthyl glucoside are formed. However, when l-[3 - 3 H]menthol and d-[3 - 3 H]neomenthol are separately administered to leaf discs, both menthyl and neomenthyl acetates and menthyl and neomenthyl glucosides are formed with nearly equal facility, suggesting that the metabolic specificity observed with the ketone precursor was not a function of the specificity of the transglucosylase or transacetylase but rather a result of compartmentation of each stereospecific dehydrogenase with the appropriate transferase. A UDP-glucose:monoterpenol glucosyltransferse, which utilized d-neomenthol or l-menthol as glucose acceptor, was demonstrated in the 105, 000 g supernatant of a peppermint leaf homogenate, and the enzyme was partially purified and characterized. Co-purification of the acceptor-mediated activities, and differential activation and inhibition studies, provided strong evidence that the same UDP-glucose-dependent enzyme could transfer glucose to either l-menthol or d-neomenthol. Determination of Km and V for the epimeric monoterpenols provided nearly identical values. The acetylcoenzyme A:monoterpenol acetyltransferase previously isolated from peppermint extracts (Croteau, Hooper 1978 Plant Physiol 61 : 737 - 742) was re-examined using l-[3 - 3 H]menthol and d-[3 - 3 H]neomenthol as acetyl acceptors, and the Km and V for both epimers were, again, very similar. These results demonstrate that the specific in vivo conversion of l-menthone to l-menthyl acetate and d-neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside cannot be attributed to the selectivity of the transferases, and they clearly indicate that the metabolic specificity observed is a result of compartmentation effects...|$|E

40|$|Essential oils (EO) are plant {{secondary}} metabolites {{that are}} known for their fragrance and food flavour properties. They consist of a complex mixture of mono- and sesquiterpenes, phenyl propanoids and oxygenated compounds. EOs can be present in different plant organs and materials, and their storage is related to specialised secretory structures. The yield of EOs from plant raw materials by distillation or pressing may on average vary from 0. 1 – 1 %, thus restricting the major EO production to the plant group of aromatic plants. Due to their function as signalling compounds between different types of organisms and diverse biological systems, their general antimicrobial and antioxidative effects and medicinal activity, EOs offer a promising potential for future applications within the fields of agriculture, medicine, pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology. Changed consumer demands and raised interest in natural product compounds, especially essential oils, have formed the basis for initiating the research project “Norwegian Herb Production (Norsk Urteproduksjon NUP) ” to encourage the cultivation, processing, marketing and distribution of aromatic and medicinal plants. The production, composition and quality characteristics of EOs (yield and terpene composition) from chamomile, lemon balm, oregano, peppermint, sachalinmint, thyme and yarrow have been investigated in the project period between 1994 - 1998. Much focus has been put on the application of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the analysis of EO volatiles from various aromatic and medicinal plants. SPME is a fast, solvent-free and non- destructive sample preparation technique where the analytes are extracted from fluid or solid matrices by headspace (HS) or direct immersion sampling (DI). Apart from EO isolation by common distillation, the applicability and sensitivity of the SPME fibre has made it feasible to carry out qualitative and semi-quantitative HS analyses of aromatic plants with regard to changes of EO metabolism during ontogenesis and plant development. Based on NUP-results from field trials in the period between 1995 - 1996, the mint species peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.) and sachalinmint (Mentha sachalinensis (Briq.) Kudô) have been studied in detail (Papers B, D and E). Comparative analyses by applying distillation sampling and SPME have been carried out in order to study {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both techniques (Papers B and E). It could be shown, that SPME offers a fast and reliable method for detecting quality-impact compounds from the p -menthane group (menthol, menthone, neomenthol, isomenthone and <b>menthyl</b> <b>acetate).</b> A distinct increase in the menthol/menthone ratio in the basipetal direction could be detected for peppermint and sachalinmint by applying SPME, thus revealing within-plant quality differences according to pharmacopeial requirements. Taking the increase of EO production from the vegetative to the generative growth stage into account, the harvest of mint plants in bloom will result in better EO yield and quality with regard to higher amounts of menthol. When applying HS-SPME on complex EO volatile matrices such as known for yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.; Paper C), one might deal with fibre-partitioning effects of the different mono- and sesquiterpenes due to their physical and chemical properties. Despite these disadvantages, HS-SPME appears to be a sensitive extraction method for the screening of EO volatiles from complex sample matrices. Comparative analyses of volatiles from rose root rhizomes (Rhodiola rosea L.) have been carried out in order to characterize the rose-like odour compounds (Paper F). A total of 75 and 59 compounds have been identified by distillation sampling and HS-SPME, respectively, thus underscoring the excellent extraction properties and applicability of the SPME fibre. Paper A gives a brief overview of EO biosynthesis and chemical structures, plant sources and methods of EO production. Before leading over to the main topic of HS-SPME applications by referring to numerous examples from the research work at The Plant Biocenter in the past 5 years, an introduction of solid-phase microextraction with regard to devices, procedures and extraction parameters is given. The advantages and disadvantages of distillation vs. SPME are outlined on the background of comparative analyses of peppermint, chamomile, basil and dill. Furthermore, the utilization of HS-SPME for quantitative studies with regard to extraction time and analyte concentration is being highlighted. Examples for the screening of chemotypes (hops − Humulus lupulus L.) and cultivars (dill – Anethum graveolens L.) and ontogenetic studies are given (Mentha species; arnica − Arnica montana L.). Finally, the applicability of HS-SPME for the quality assessment of processed herbs (sweet basil − Ocimum basilicum L.) and phytomedicinal preparations (red coneflower – Echinacea purpurea L.) is being discussed. The advantages of HS-SPME over classical distillation and headspace applications are impressive due to drastically reduced analysis time and will introduce new frontiers in plant volatile research with regard to secondary metabolism, plant-insect interactions and in vivo studies. The user-friendliness of operating SPME will initiate the development of future applications and equipment for the monitoring of volatiles for plant biological and environmental studies, extraction automation, on-site sampling and on-fibre storage of analytes.
