2500|$|The first natural problem {{proven to}} be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete {{contains}} technical details about Turing machines {{as they relate to}} the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that if you could solve Sudoku in polynomial time, you could use this to complete Latin squares in polynomial time. [...] This in turn gives {{a solution to the problem}} of partitioning tri-partitite graphs into triangles, which could then be used to find solutions for 3-sat, which then provides a solution for general boolean satisfiability. [...] So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of <b>mechanical</b> <b>transformations,</b> to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-complete problem in polynomial time.

40|$|We propose new {{optimality}} {{criterion for}} {{the estimation of}} state-dependent cloning. We call this measure the relative error because the one compares the errors in the copies with contiguous size {{taking into account the}} similarity of states to be copied. A copying transformation and dimension of state space are not specified. Only the unitarity of quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>transformations</b> is used. The presented approach is based on the notion of the angle between two states. Firstly, several useful statements simply expressed in terms of angles are proved. Among them there are the spherical triangle inequality and the inequality establishing the upper bound on the modulus of difference between probability distributions generated by two any states for an arbitrary measurement. The tightest lower bound on the relative error is then obtained. Hillery and Buzek originally examined an approximate state-dependent copying and obtained the lower bound on the absolute error. We consider relationship between the size of error and the corresponding probability distributions and obtain the tightest lower bound on the absolute error. Thus, the proposed approach supplements and reinforces the results obtained by Hillery and Buzek. Finally, the basic findings of investigation for the relative error are discussed.

In the somatosensory vibrissal system, the physical event of touch is conveyed by the whisker to the follicle mechanoreceptors, which then provide the input to the brain. We used high speed video and artificial whisking to assess how mechanical variables of the whisker reflect the coordinates of the object in space. During active touch, the radial (from the snout outward) and horizontal (front-back) position of an object {{was reflected in the}} whiskers' curvature, whisker angle absorption (the amount of protraction movement blocked by the object), and change of velocity. The phase plane spanned by angle absorption and curvature contained invariant representations of horizontal and radial object location. The slope of whisker trajectory in this plane represented radial positions independent of horizontal ones, and the magnitude represented horizontal position independent of radial ones. We also present preliminary results which suggest that during continuous touch (i. e. when a whisker is sweeping on a surface) the radial distance from the surface is encoded by the frequency of the whisker vibrations and their amplitude. We conclude that the first encoding step is composed of <b>mechanical</b> <b>transformations</b> from external physical variables to whisker-related mechanical variables.

The oxygen carrier has {{a central role in the}} chemical-looping combustion process. Ilmenite, a natural mineral composed of FeTiO 3, has been extensively used as oxygen carrier in CLC systems due to its availability, relatively low cost and demonstrated reactivity. During the looping process ilmenite undergoes a series of chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>transformations</b> that eventually lead to the break-down of particles into smaller fragments, which are unfit for use in circulated fluidized bed (CFB) applications. In the present study a 100 kW chemical-looping system was operated with ilmenite particles as oxygen carrier and with biomass char as fuel. Ilmenite particles were collected at the end of the run. The collected particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally obtained results. The aim of the study was to understand the change in morphology and chemical compositions of the collected ilmenite particles and to relate them to the exposure conditions in the CLC reactor.

Furthermore, a possible mechanism for the transformation of the ilmenite particles during the cyclic chemical-looping process was proposed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
