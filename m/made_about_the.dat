5|$|Citing {{opposition}} {{from within the}} Republican Party, as well as fallout from controversial comments he <b>made</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8.

Ryan also received calls from Mitt Romney and Trey Gowdy, among others, encouraging him to run for Speaker. Additional Ryan endorsements came from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise from Louisiana. On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films. Radio series such as the Renfrew of the Mounted and Challenge of the Yukon continued the portrayal of the mounted police as iconic heroes, Challenge later translating onto television in the 1950s as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Over 250 films were <b>made</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical Rose Marie. The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.|$|E

5|$|International {{and local}} media criticized the {{military}} government for inadequate warnings prior to Giri's landfall in the country. However, the junta claims to have informed the public appropriately. Little assistance had reached thousands of survivors days after the storm's passage, fueling anger from local media sources. Government relief slowly reached the area; however, workers only cleared debris left by the storm and only encouraged residents to rebuild by giving them the supplies needed to do so. Further criticism was <b>made</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> government withholding information on {{the loss of life}} and scale of damage. Requests were also made to postpone a national election for residents in Arakan State; however, no response was given and the elections were still planned to be held on November7.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed {{government}} at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was <b>made</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future of the peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s. By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat. Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea. He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April, and a fourth on 22 April. Eager to get his fifth victory to be deemed a flying ace, Jabara voluntarily transferred to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been <b>made</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the great {{depression}} until the closure of the network only one lot of trams was purchased by the MTT. Due to shortages there was minimal maintenance of the network during World War II and post-war shortages prevented the purchase of new trams. In 1951–1952 the MTT lost £313,320 and made the decision to convert the Erindale, Burnside and Linden Park lines to electric trolleybuses. The last trams on these lines ran on 24 May 1952 with the lines lifted from 18 April 1953. A 1953 royal commission was held to inquire into the financial affairs of the MTT resulting in a completely reconstituted board. Late the same year, with driver safety concerns about the conflict with increasing traffic on the road, the Glen Osmond line was temporarily converted to motor buses. The line was never converted back to trams and much comment was <b>made</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> continuing maintenance of unused overhead lines.|$|E
