2500|$|In the UK, {{health and}} safety {{legislation}} is drawn up and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HASAWA). [...] HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; {{with the intention of}} giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably <b>practicable</b> (<b>deviations</b> from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment). [...] The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated. [...] HSE has continued to make some regulations giving absolute duties (where something must be done with no 'reasonable practicability' test) but in the UK the regulatory trend is away from prescriptive rules, and towards 'goal setting' and risk assessment. Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected {{health and safety}} representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example.|$|R
40|$|Rainfall data {{is one of}} the {{meteorological}} parameters that have a greater bearing on the livelihood of individuals not only in Zambia but also the world over. It is therefore very important that quality management of this data is enhanced. Data are of good quality when they satisfy stated and implied needs. The purpose of quality management is to ensure that data meet requirements for the intended application at <b>minimum</b> <b>practicable</b> cost. To maintain data quality management, the best quality meteorological system operate continuously at all points in the whole observation system from network planning and training, through installation and station operations to data transmission and archiving. The system includes spatial checking, feedback and follow-up provisions on time scales from near real time to annual reviews. The main objective of this research study was to develop a spatial framework for flood and drought disasters in Zambia. The paper is based on a realistic possibility of disasters that do happen whenever we have above normal rainfall over the Northern half and below normal rainfall over the Southern half. The rainfall data was sourced from the National meteorological centre (NMC) database. In particular the paper emphasises on the discussions of the factors affecting data quality, components of data quality management and quality control not only for rainfall but all meteorological data in general. 1...|$|R
40|$|Engine and {{airplane}} {{performance data}} have been gathered {{from various sources}} and analyzed to determine indications of the most economical methods of flight operation from a consideration of fuel expenditure. The analysis includes the influence of such facts as fuel-air ratio, engine speed, engine knock, altitude, cylinder cooling, spark timing, and limits of cruising brake mean effective pressure. The {{results indicate that the}} cheapest power is obtained with approximately correct mixture at low engine speed and highest permissible manifold pressure. If more power is desired, the methods of obtaining it are, in order of fuel economy: (a) increasing the engine speed and maintaining safe cylinder temperatures by cooling; (b) retarding the spark or cooling further to permit higher manifold pressure; and, (c) riching the mixture. The analysis further shows that the maximum time endurance of flight occurs at the air speed corresponding to minimum thrust horsepower required and with <b>minimum</b> <b>practicable</b> engine speed. Maximum mileage per pound of fuel is obtained at slightly higher air speed. The fuel-air ratio should be approximately the theoretically correct ratio in both cases. For an engine equipped with a geared supercharger, as in the example presented, and with knock as the limiting condition, a comparison of operation at sea level and at 6, 000 feet shoes flight at altitude to be more economical on the basis of both range and endurance...|$|R

40|$|A housing Warrant of Fitness (WoF) {{has been}} {{independently}} proposed by three organisations {{as a way}} of improving the quality of rental housing in New Zealand and reducing housing related injuries and health problems. The New Zealand Green Building Council and the Housing and Health Research Programme (University of Otago, Wellington) have jointly developed a WoF based on Homestar and the Healthy Housing Index (labelled the GH WoF in this document). Housing New Zealand {{is in the process of}} developing a WoF for their properties (HNZ WoF), it has been tested on a number of state houses but the results have not yet been fully released. Both the GH WoF and the HNZ WoF target thermal and moisture performance amongst other minimum requirements for rental housing. The WoFs specify slightly different housing features as minimum acceptable standards. Both of the WoFs are structured as a checklist, with all items considered mandatory to pass the assessment. This research investigated the impact of meeting the WoF criteria which impact thermal performance. A thermal model of a villa style house suitable for a family of 4 was modelled in the thermal simulation programme EnergyPlus with a <b>minimum</b> <b>practicable</b> level of thermal performance. A range of New Zealand input values were sought and a number of sensitivity analyses were carried out to validate the modelâ€™s performance. Combinations of features each meeting the different criteria of the WoFs (such as insulation, ventilation and curtains) were then added to this house. The results of these models demonstrated that while adding these features will improve thermal performance, a simple pass/fail may be misleading because a house which fails may have equivalent thermal performance to a house which passes. The pass/fail result does not acknowledge trade-offs between temperature, energy consumption and running cost. Neither WoF accounts for the impact of climate on the ability to achieve comfortable indoor conditions, which has a greater impact than passing or failing a WoF. The criteria targeted at moisture performance were unable to be analysed as the moisture loads put into EnergyPlus could not be adequately verified. The research showed that while both WoF could lead to improved thermal comfort in rental housing, meeting the GH WoF requirements would bring about greater thermal performance benefits, the HNZ WoF enables the affordability of heat to be considered when insulating is not feasible...|$|R
40|$|Steeply sloped roofs, low sloped roofs, flooded {{roofs and}} roof {{terraces}} discussed. A perfectly flat roof cannot {{be achieved in}} normal construction and slopes will inevitably develop owing to structural deflections. It is better to build in slopes to control water on a roof. The <b>practicable</b> <b>minimum</b> for main roof areas is about 1 / 4 inch per foot, and greater slope is desirable. Where drainage is achieved by a folded plate type of arrangement, crickets should be placed {{at the intersection of}} the larger slopes to direct water to the drains. When controlled flow drainage or evaporative cooling are required on roofs, a sloping roof produces a less hazardous condition than a flat roof. For protected membrane type roofs, the principal membrane at the deck below insulation and landscaping should be sloped, continuous and sealed round all penetrations.

40|$|Programs are demarcated as {{administrative}} structures established to realize planned organizational strategies through multi-project activities. Programs occupy a distinct locus in organizational hierarchy, so therefore necessitate specialized management approaches. Risks in programs tend {{to widen the}} gap between the organizational plans and the actual program realizations. However, effective risk management can minimize these gaps. This research frames a structured approach for program risk management, called Risk Leveling in Program Environments (RLPE), which suggests (a) a deliberate shift of risks to the right organizational level where they can be addressed most effectively; and (b) a unique procedure for risk management, which attempts to stabilize the risky contexts in programs. RLPE tracks the standard risk management process, preserves distinct program locus, and employs certain qualitative and quantitative measures to achieve risk leveled environments for program success. It has been demonstrated how certain tools and concepts, such as Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), As Low As Reasonably <b>Practicable</b> (ALARP), standard <b>deviation,</b> etc. can be employed for risk oriented decision making in programs. RLPE is an instrumental approach, which can help the policy makers in controlling the risky contexts thereby providing sustainable growth for development programs. The offered approach can be particularly advantageous for risk management in large-scale (development) programs...|$|R
40|$|In {{reviewing}} {{methods of}} predator control, it would first seem appropriate {{to define what}} is meant 2 Ì† 2 by 2 Ì† 2 methods 2 Ì† 2 and {{what is meant by}} 2 Ì† 2 control. 2 Ì† 2 Taking the last term first, control, as applied to the predatory coyotes, bobcats, and foxes, may be defined as regulating the numbers of these animals {{to the point where the}} economic losses for which they are responsible will be reduced to a <b>practicable</b> <b>minimum.</b> In some situations, area control, i. e., limiting the numbers of the offending predator over wide areas, may be necessary for satisfactory reduction of economic losses; in other situations, spot control or localized reduction of numbers of a certain predator may be called for; in still other situations, elimination of an individual animal may be all the control that is needed. In no sense is control, as applied to coyotes, bobcats, and foxes, intended to mean extermiÂ¬nation of a species. The term 2 Ì† 2 methods 2 Ì† 2 is interpreted as meaning the procedures employed against coyotes, bobcats, and foxes, and not the broader systems of predator control such as the paid hunter system, the extension system, or the much-discredited bounty system.

40|$|Colonization with Candida {{species is}} an {{independent}} risk factor for invasive candidiasis (IC), but the <b>minimum</b> and most <b>practicable</b> parameters for prediction of IC have not been optimized. We evaluated Candida colonization in a prospective cohort of 6, 015 nonneutropenic, critically ill patients. Throat, perineum, and urine were sampled 72 h post-intensive care unit (ICU) admission and twice weekly until discharge or death. Specimens were cultured onto chromogenic agar, and a subset underwent molecular characterization. Sixty-three (86 %) patients who developed IC were colonized prior to infection; 61 (97 %) tested positive within the first two time points. The median time from colonization to IC was 7 days (range, 0 to 35). Colonization at any site was predictive of IC, with the risk of infection highest for urine colonization (relative risk [RR] = 2. 25) but with the sensitivity highest (98 %) for throat and/or perineum colonization. Colonization of â‰¥ 2 sites and heavy colonization of â‰¥ 1 site were significant independent risk factors for IC (RR = 2. 25 and RR = 3. 7, respectively), increasing specificity to 71 % to 74 % but decreasing sensitivity to 48 % to 58 %. Molecular testing would have prompted a resistance-driven decision to switch from fluconazole treatment in only 11 % of patients infected with C. glabrata, based upon species-level identification alone. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were low (2 % to 4 %) and negative predictive values (NPVs) high (99 % to 100 %) regardless of which parameters were applied. In the Australian ICU setting, culture of throat and perineum within the first two time points after ICU admission captures 84 % (61 / 73 patients) of subsequent IC cases. These optimized parameters, in combination with clinical risk factors, should strengthen development of a setting-specific risk-predictive model for IC. 7 page(s...|$|R
