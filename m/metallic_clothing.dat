5000|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Shigenori Soejima, {{who had previously}} worked at Atlus with Kazuma Kaneko on Atlus' Persona series. While he had heard rumors about the project, his assignment to the project {{came out of the}} blue when the game's director asked him if there was an available illustrator for the game. Soejima managed to get the post, which was his first as a character designer as well as art director. One of his major problems was that he had yet to refine his own drawing style. Describing himself as initially [...] "at a loss", much of his memory of the experience is dominated by finding his chosen style rather than specific character designs. To get the feel he needed, he used brushes as opposed to cel-shaded drawing he used in later projects. The characters' <b>metallic</b> <b>clothing</b> and contrasting colors of items was influenced by The Lord of the Rings, while some characters and the environmental textures were inspired by the films of Hayao Miyazaki. The cutscenes used cel-shaded animation, and were created by Japanese studio Kamikaze Douga. Character sprites and status images used high-resolution artwork. The game's setting was in a vast desert, so this needed {{to be taken into account}} with environment and character designs. Not only did the developers need to provide places of interest to players, but Soejima needed to create realistic clothes for characters. For instance, there was a lack of classic armor in the game as the hot desert climate would have made it impractical. There was also a concern over whether the swords in the world were made using casting or forging, which would affect their design and other aesthetic elements. While creating the atmosphere, the developers tried to stay away from standard fantasy tropes. The artwork for the game was produced by artist group Kusanagi, who had also worked on Xenogears and Final Fantasy IX.|$|E

50|$|Contemporary to {{the garage}} bands of the early 1970s, glam punk fashion, pioneered by bands like the New York Dolls, {{includes}} glitter, androgynous make-up, brightly dyed hair, drainpipe jeans, bright colours like electric blue, elements of leather fetish wear, and unusual costumes like leopard print, spandex, or satin shirts. Leftover baroque pop clothing like ruffled pirate shirts or brocade were also worn, together with more typical glam rock fashions like platform boots, tartan, kipper ties, and <b>metallic</b> silver <b>clothing</b> like jumpsuits.|$|R
50|$|Common to all carders is card {{clothing}}. Card {{clothing is}} made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded. The shape, length, diameter, and spacing of these wire pins are dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used. A later version of the card clothing product developed during {{the latter half of}} the 19th century and found only on commercial carding machines, whereby a single piece of serrated wire was wrapped around a roller, became known as <b>metallic</b> card <b>clothing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In January 1944, Hollingsworth {{received}} his first patent for [...] "an invention that allowed textile machinery to better process synthetic fibers." [...] Shortly thereafter {{he was both}} drafted into the U.S. Navy and married his bookkeeper, Ella Mae Bennett, who managed the business in his absence. In the 1950s, Hollingsworth perfected <b>metallic</b> card <b>clothing,</b> revolutionizing the textile carding process. He also purchased and rebuilt used cards for sale. Though Hollingsworth products and his reputation for excellent service soon made him a wealthy, internationally significant manufacturer of textile machinery, {{he could be a}} slapdash businessman. In 1964, a newly hired accountant was horrified to discover that although Hollingsworth's company had annual sales of about $9 million, the business was not incorporated and Hollingsworth had kept no accounting books. Hollingsworth was also overly enamored of innovative textile machinery and made many uneconomical purchases.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} uses for {{metallic}} fibers is upholstery fabric and textiles such as lam√© and brocade. Many people also use metallic fibers in weaving and needlepoint. Increasingly common today are <b>metallic</b> fibers in <b>clothing,</b> anything from party and evening wear to club clothing, cold weather and survival clothing, and everyday wear. Metallic yarns are woven, braided, and knit into many fashionable fabrics and trims. For additional variety, metallic yarns are twisted with other fibers such as wool, nylon, cotton, and synthetic blends to produce yarns which add novelty effects {{to the end}} cloth or trim. Stainless steel and other metal fibers are used in communication lines such as phone lines and cable television lines. Stainless steel fibers are also used in carpets. They are dispersed throughout the carpet with other fibers so they are not detected. The presence of the fibers helps to conduct electricity so that the static shock is reduced. These types of carpets are often used in computer-use areas where the chance of producing static is much greater. Other uses include tire cord, missile nose cones, work clothing such as protective suits, space suits, and cut resistant gloves for butchers and other people working near bladed or dangerous machinery.|$|R
