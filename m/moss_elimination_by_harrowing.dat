40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the best tillage method for making planting beds forvegetables cultivation using a two-wheel type tractor. Five tillage methods using a two-wheel type tractorwith its equipments were tested and evaluated in this study. The methods which were tested were: 1) plowing using a reversible type plow, followed by ridging using a ridger and finished <b>by</b> <b>harrowing</b> using arotary tiller (B-F-G 1 method); 2) plowing, followed <b>by</b> <b>harrowing</b> and finished <b>by</b> ridging (B-G-F method); 3) plowing, followed <b>by</b> <b>harrowing</b> followed <b>by</b> ridging and finished <b>by</b> 2 nd <b>harrowing</b> (B-G-F-G method); 4) plowing, followed by 40 cm width of <b>harrowing</b> and finished <b>by</b> ridging (B-G-F 2 method); and 5) plowing,followed by 40 cm width of <b>harrowing</b> and finished <b>by</b> ridging with 40 cm tractor wheel-base (B-G-F 3 method). The experiments were conducted on several plots of dry land. The results of the experimentsshowed that the B-G-F 3 method produced the best planting bed form, an appropriate bed size and abetter soil condition for vegetables cultivation. The field capacity of this method was 74 m 2 /hour and wasthe highest capacity among the five methods...|$|R
40|$|An {{assortment}} of 10 winter wheat cultivars was tested for specific effects on weed suppression. Furthermore cultivar specific effects of weed infestation and weed control measures on the crop yield were investigated. Two trial series conducted from 2005 to 2010 demonstrated a wide cultivar specific range of shading capacity and weed suppression. Light penetration and the dry {{matter of the}} model weed Sinapis alba were highly correlated (r = 0. 87) in trial series A (2005 - 2007). Consequently, the weed dry matter in the less competitive cultivar Dekan was 5 times higher compared to the weak competitor Cubus. Mechanical weed control <b>by</b> <b>harrowing</b> reduced ears density of all cultivars tested in trial series A. These reductions were significantly higher in the cultivars Bussard and Pegassos {{compared to the other}} cultivars. Since the weed infestation was low and negative crop effects <b>by</b> <b>harrowing</b> could be compensated by a higher number of kernels/ear, the yield effects were the same for all cultivars. Contrary to the hypothesis, a cultivar specific yield response <b>by</b> <b>harrowing</b> could not be assessed. Higher competition effects by sowing the model weed Sinapis alba could be realised in trial series B (2008 - 20120). Consequently, the control measures (a) harrowing (b) 50...|$|R

40|$|Spatial choice {{models have}} been criticized for their {{restrictive}} assumptions. In particular, the independence or constant-ratio axiom of Luce has been questioned because of its failure to account for the effects of similarity between alternatives. Tversky's <b>elimination</b> <b>by</b> aspects model provides a natural explanation of similarity effects, but cannot be estimated from binary probabilities. The <b>elimination</b> <b>by</b> tree or, equivalently, hierarchical elimination model is less restrictive than the constant-ratio model and more parsimonious than <b>elimination</b> <b>by</b> aspects. To estimate this model in a spatial interaction context, a hierarchical regionalization based upon interareal flow data is first obtained. The lengths of the links in the resultant tree structure are reestimated on the basis of choice probability ratios. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tillage {{is a very}} {{important}} crop production activity which may affect crop performance differently. An experiment was conducted during the during the 2009 and 2010 major crop growing seasons in Kumasi, Ghana, to compare the effect of four different tillage practices on Asontem cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp) performance. The treatments consisted of disc ploughing only, disc ploughing followed <b>by</b> disc <b>harrowing,</b> disc harrowing only and no tillage. There was significant difference in Asontem cowpea growth, dry matter yield and yield components between tillage practices. Disc ploughing followed <b>by</b> disc <b>harrowing</b> gave the best results producing the highest percentage seedling emergence, tallest plant, biggest stem girth and greatest number of leaves. Furthermore, disc ploughing followed <b>by</b> disc <b>harrowing</b> resulted in the longest root length, highest dry matter yield, highest number of pods per plant, highest number of seeds per pod and highest 1000 seed-weight. The no tillage plots produced the shortest plant, smallest stem girth and smallest number of leaves. In addition, the no tillage plots gave the shortest root length, lowest dry matter yield, smallest number of pods per plant, smallest number of seeds per pod and smallest 1000 seed-weight. Therefore, considering the soil and weather conditions of the experiment the best tillage practice for Asontem cowpea growth and yield is disc ploughing followed <b>by</b> disc <b>harrowing...</b>|$|R
