40|$|Dengue {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} arboviral infection worldwide, infecting up to 390 million people and causing 25, 000 deaths annually. Although a licensed dengue vaccine is available, it is not efficacious against dengue serotypes that infect people living in South East Asia, where dengue is an endemic disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient dengue vaccine for this region. Data from different clinical trials indicate that a successful dengue vaccine must elicit both neutralizing antibodies and cell mediated immunity.

40|$|Multiple HLA class I alleles can bind {{peptides}} {{with common}} sequence motifs due to structural {{similarities in the}} peptide binding cleft, and these groups of alleles have been classified into supertypes.

Evidence for this A 24 supertype is limited to HLA sequence homology and/or similarity in peptide binding motifs for the alleles. To investigate the immunological relevance of this proposed supertype, we have examined two viral epitopes (from EBV and CMV) initially defined as HLA-A* 2301 -binding peptides. The data clearly demonstrate that each peptide could be recognized by CTL clones {{in the context of}} A* 2301 or A* 2402; thus validating the inclusion of these three alleles within an A 24 supertype. Furthermore, CTL responses to the EBV epitope were detectable in both A* 2301 (+) and A* 2402 (+) individuals who had been previously exposed to this virus. These data substantiate the biological relevance of the A 24 supertype, and the identification of viral epitopes with the capacity to bind promiscuously across this supertype could aid efforts to develop CTL-based vaccines or immunotherapy.

Guiding these functions, and NK cell education, are killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR), NK cell receptors that recognize HLA class I.

To assess {{how much of}} this diversity is necessary, we studied KIR and HLA class I at high resolution in the Yucpa, a small South Amerindian population that survived an approximate 15, 000 -year history of population bottleneck and epidemic infection, including recent viral hepatitis. The Yucpa retain the three <b>major</b> <b>HLA</b> epitopes recognized by KIR. Through balancing selection on a few divergent haplotypes the Yucpa maintain much of the KIR variation found worldwide. HLA-C* 07, the strongest educator of C 1 -specific NK cells, has reached unusually high frequency in the Yucpa. Concomitantly, weaker variants of the C 1 receptor, KIR 2 DL 3, were selected and have largely replaced the form of KIR 2 DL 3 brought by the original migrants from Asia. HLA-C 1 and KIR 2 DL 3 homozygosity has previously been correlated with resistance to viral hepatitis. Selection of weaker forms of KIR 2 DL 3 in the Yucpa can be seen as compensation for the high frequency of the potent HLA-C* 07 ligand.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an {{autoimmune}} disease characterized by chronic {{inflammation of the}} joints that affects approximately 1 % of the population worldwide. The HLA-DRB 1 gene locus {{plays a major role}} in genetic susceptibility to RA, a condition that has been associated with a high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in many studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The aim of this work was to investigate which types of HLA class II genes are associated with RA in patients from the Brazilian Amazon and their influence on high cardiovascular risk status in this population. For this purpose, a case-control study was carried out with a total of 350 non-Indian individuals made up of a cohort of 132 consecutive RA sufferers and 218 healthy controls. A χ(2) test showed that HLADRB 1 * 04 (p< 0. 0016; OR = 1. 89; 95 % CI = 1. 29 - 2. 79) and HLADRB 1 * 10 (p = 0. 0377; OR = 3. 81; 95 % CI = 1. 16 - 12. 50) are the <b>major</b> <b>HLA</b> genes associated with susceptibility to RA. A logistic regression model also showed that the interaction between HLADRB 1 * 04 (p = 0. 027; OR = 6. 02; 95 % CI = 1. 21 - 29. 7), age (p = 0. 0001; OR = 1. 26; 95 % CI = 1. 13 - 1. 39) and smoking (p = 0. 0001; OR = 23. 6; 95 % CI = 4. 25 - 32. 1) is associated with a probability of a high cardiovascular risk status at an early age. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study show for the first time that HLA class II type is associated with RA in Brazilian Amazon populations and that a specific interaction between the HLA-DRB 1 * 04 gene and smoking is associated with a high cardiovascular risk status, as initially reported in the European population.

PBMC proliferative responses to recombinant B 13 protein were restricted to individuals bearing HLA-DQA 1 * 0501 (DQ 7),-DR 1, and -DR 2; B 13 peptides bound to the same HLA molecules in binding assays. the HLA-DQ 7 -restricted minimal T cell epitope [FGQAAAG(D/E) KP] was identified with an overlapping combinatorial peptide library including all B 13 sequence variants in T cruzi Y strain B 13 protein; the underlined small residues (G) under barQ (A) under bar were the <b>major</b> <b>HLA</b> contact residues. Among natural B 13 15 -mer variant peptides, molecular modeling showed that several variant positions were solvent (TCR) -exposed, and substitutions at exposed positions abolished recognition. While natural B 13 variant peptide S 15. 9 seems to be the immunodominant epitope for Chagas' disease patients, S 15. 4 was preferentially recognized by CCC rather than ASY patients, which may be pathogenically relevant. This is the first thorough characterization of T cell epitopes of a tandemly repetitive protozoan antigen and may suggest a role for T cell help in the immunodominance of protozoan repetitive antigens.

40|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} {{consists of}} a variety of disorders arising from specific defects in the enzymes of the adrenal cortex, which is transmitted autosomal recessively. The most common enzyme deficiency is 21 -Hydroxlase defect causing accumulation of precursors proximal to the blocked enzymatic step, so shifting the pathway into the androgen overproduction. Deficiency of 21 -Hydroxlase is closely linked to <b>HLA</b> <b>major</b> histocompatibility complex on the short arm of chromosome 6. There is a specific association between HLA and molecular genetic analysis and the type of the disease ranging from asymptomatic carrier to fully symptomatic and salt loser patients. In this article we present four sisters with 21 OH deficiency and late onset of clinical symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The human <b>major</b> {{histocompatibility}} complex <b>HLA</b> {{is located on}} the short arm of chromosome 6. It is known to be the most polymorphic genetic system in humans. The biological role of the HLA class I and class II molecules is to present processed peptide antigens. The HLA system is clinically important as transplantation antigens. Molecular HLA allele typing is routinely performed to provide HLA class I and class II allele matching in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Prospective lymphocyte crossmatching is critical in solid organ transplantation to prevent allograft rejection. HLA alloimmunization causes various problems in transfusion therapy. The HLA system is associated with certain diseases, but its underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explained...|$|R
40|$|Unregulated or {{increased}} {{expression of}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGF-R) is a common event in neoplastic transformation; modulation of such a receptor by physiological agents could be, therefore, of clinical interest. We have studied the binding ability, the availability at cell surface, and the synthesis of EGF-R in the A 431 and KB human epidermoid cancer cell lines after treatment with recombinant alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha). After 48 h of treatment, IFN-alpha induces, in both cell lines, growth inhibition and enhances class I <b>major</b> histocompatibility <b>HLA</b> complex expression, which is a common marker of IFN action. [I- 125]EGF total binding assessed after 48 h of treatment with IFN-alpha shows a dose-dependent upregulation of EGF-R binding capacity. Saturation plots of the binding data show that IFN-alpha treatment does not dramatically alter the affinity of the EGF-R and indicate that IFN-alpha only increases the number of low affinity receptors. We show that this effect {{is due to a}} specific increase in the synthesis of the receptor protein, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of [S- 35]methionine-labeled cell extracts. Electron microscopy analysis has confirmed an increase of EGF-R proteins at cell surface without major changes in the morphology of the cells. Taken together, these results indicate that IFN-alpha consistently induces both the binding capacity and the synthesis of EGF-R in human epidermoid cancer cells and suggest the use of such a mechanism for new anticancer therapies...|$|R
40|$|The past 15 {{years have}} seen major {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the effects of anti-donor antibodies on renal allografts at various stages after transplantation. These advances have been {{due in large part to}} pathologic examination of both early and late renal allograft biopsies, including both routine histologic evaluation and immunohistology to detect complement split products. As pathologists have become increasingly adept at diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) on allograft biopsies, substantial progress has been made in the treatment of AMR and in successful renal transplantation in recipients with pre-existing antibodies against donor blood group (ABO) and/or <b>major</b> histocompatibility (<b>HLA)</b> antigens. This article reviews the pathologic features of hyperacute, acute, and chronic AMR, including some newer findings impacting diagnosis and outcomes, and differences in the implications of similar pathologic findings in ABO- versus HLA-incompatible renal allografts.

However, it is only in the past 15 years that we have started to understand the full spectrum of antibody effects on the allograft, which include hyperacute rejection, early and late acute rejection, and chronic rejection. This increased under-standing is based in large part on pathologic observations an...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{internalization}} of cell surface proteins encoded by genes {{of the human}} <b>major</b> histocompatibility complex (<b>HLA)</b> transferred into murine L cells, in comparison with mouse (H- 2) histocompatibility determinants. This internalization {{was measured by the}} use of monoclonal antibodies directed at these determinants, to which were bound methotrexate- and carboxyfluorescein-containing liposomes covalently coupled to protein A. In addition to the effect of methotrexate on the cells, the technique of fluorescence self-quenching release was used to measure the kinetics of internalization for single cells using a flow cytofluorometer. The native and foreign gene products were internalized in an apparently identical manner. These techniques can be applied to cells expressing genes with altered or deleted segments thus providing a basis for the analysis of the effect of sequence modifications on the internalization of the encoded molecule...|$|R
