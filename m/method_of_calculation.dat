25|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, {{commonly referred to as}} the Pauling scale (χr), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen= 2.20).

25|$|R.T. Sanderson {{has also}} noted the {{relationship}} between Mulliken electronegativity and atomic size, and has proposed a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> based on the reciprocal of the atomic volume. With a knowledge of bond lengths, Sanderson's model allows the estimation of bond energies {{in a wide range}} of compounds. Sanderson's model has also been used to calculate molecular geometry, s-electrons energy, NMR spin-spin constants and other parameters for organic compounds. This work underlies the concept of electronegativity equalization, which suggests that electrons distribute themselves around a molecule to minimize or to equalize the Mulliken electronegativity. This behavior is analogous to the equalization of chemical potential in macroscopic thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|The normal <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> {{in ancient}} Rome, as in Greece, was by moving {{counters}} on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (calculi) were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, jetons were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. {{as in the}} Roman numeral system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century. Due to Pope Sylvester II's reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.|$|E

2500|$|The gradual {{development}} of Hindu–Arabic numerals independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal {{base and the}} use of a digit representing 0. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early [...] the Indian mathematician Aryabhata incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7thcentury, Brahmagupta established the use of0 as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of division by 0. His contemporary, the Syriac bishop Severus Sebokht (650AD) said, [...] "Indians possess a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> that no word can praise enough. Their rational system of mathematics, or of their <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation.</b> I mean the system using nine symbols."

2500|$|The size of {{the fraud}} was stated as $65 billion early in the investigation. Former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt {{estimated}} the actual net fraud to be between $10 and $17 billion. One difference between the estimates concerns the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation.</b> One method calculates losses as the total amount that victims thought they were owed, but will never receive. The smaller estimates use a different method, subtracting the total cash received from the scheme from the total cash paid into the scheme, after excluding from the calculation persons accused of collaborating with the scheme, persons who invested through [...] "feeder funds," [...] and anyone who received more cash from the scheme than they paid in. Erin Arvedlund, who publicly questioned Madoff's reported investment performance in 2001, stated that the actual amount of the fraud might never be known, but was likely between $12 and $20 billion.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese {{remainder}} theorem: The Chinese remainder theorem, including simultaneous congruences {{in number}} theory, was first {{created in the}} 3rd century AD in the mathematical book Sunzi Suanjing posed the problem: [...] "There is {{an unknown number of}} things, when divided by 3 it leaves 2, when divided by 5 it leaves 3, and when divided by 7 it leaves a remainder of 2. Find the number." [...] This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> was used in calendrical mathematics by Tang Dynasty (618907) mathematicians such as Li Chunfeng (602670) and Yi Xing (683727) {{in order to determine the}} length of the [...] "Great Epoch", the lapse of time between the conjunctions of the moon, sun, and Five Planets (those discerned by the naked eye). Thus, it was strongly associated with the divination methods of the ancient Yijing. Its use was lost for centuries until Qin Jiushao (c. 12021261) revived it in his Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections of 1247, providing constructive proof for it.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> of {{the rankings}} has changed {{considerably}} over the years. Initially, the rankings were calculated {{over a three-year}} period, with the current year's points multiplied by four (three in 1986), the previous year's points by two and the third year's points by one. Rankings {{were based on the}} total points and points awarded were restricted to integer values. All tournaments recognised by the world's professional tours, and some leading invitational events, were graded into categories ranging from major championship (whose winners would receive 50 points) to [...] "other tournaments" [...] (whose winners would receive a minimum of 8). In all events, other finishers received points on a diminishing scale that began with runners-up receiving 60% of the winners' points, and the number of players in the field receiving points would be the same as the points awarded to the winner. In a major, for example, all players finishing 30th to 40th would receive 2 points, and all players finishing 50th or higher, 1 point.|$|E
2500|$|Partly {{following}} a heuristic <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> pioneered by Boltzmann for gas molecules, Planck considered the possible ways of distributing electromagnetic energy over the different modes of his hypothetical charged material oscillators. This {{acceptance of the}} probabilistic approach, following Boltzmann, for Planck was a radical change from his former position, which till then had deliberately opposed such thinking proposed by Boltzmann. Heuristically, Boltzmann had distributed the energy in arbitrary merely mathematical quanta [...] , which he had proceeded to make tend to zero in magnitude, because the finite magnitude [...] had served only to allow definite counting {{for the sake of}} mathematical calculation of probabilities, and had no physical significance. Referring to a new universal constant of nature, , Planck supposed that, in the several oscillators of each of the finitely many characteristic frequencies, the total energy was distributed to each in an integer multiple of a definite physical unit of energy, , not arbitrary as in Boltzmann's method, but now for Planck, in a new departure, characteristic of the respective characteristic frequency. His new universal constant of nature, , is now known as Planck's constant.|$|E
