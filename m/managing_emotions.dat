Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply <b>managing</b> <b>emotions</b> on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them.

50|$|The view of {{cognitive}} ability {{has evolved over}} the years, {{and it is no}} longer viewed as a fixed property held by an individual. Instead, the current perspective describes it as a general capacity, comprising not only cognitive, but motivational, social and behavioural aspects as well. These facets work together to perform numerous tasks. An essential skill often overlooked is that of <b>managing</b> <b>emotions,</b> and aversive experiences that can compromise one's quality of thought and activity. The link between intelligence and success has been bridged by crediting individual differences in self-efficacy. The theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations. Thus, the theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly, averagely or excellently based on differences in self-efficacy.|$|E

50|$|Sport {{psychology}} is a specialization within psychology {{that seeks to}} understand psychological/mental factors that affect performance in sports, physical activity and exercise and apply these to enhance individual and team performance. The sport psychology approach differs from the coaches and players perspective. Coaches tend to narrow their focus and energy towards the end-goal. They {{are concerned with the}} actions that lead to the win, as opposed to the sport psychologist who tries to focus the players thoughts on just achieving the win. Sport psychology trains players mentally to prepare them, whereas coaches tend to focus mostly on physical training. Sport psychology deals with increasing performance by <b>managing</b> <b>emotions</b> and minimizing the psychological effects of injury and poor performance. Some of the most important skills taught are goal setting, relaxation, visualization, self-talk awareness and control, concentration, using rituals, attribution training, and periodization. The principles and theories may be applied to any human movement or performance tasks (e.g., playing a musical instrument, acting in a play, public speaking, motor skills). Usually, experts recommend that students be trained in both kinesiology (i.e., sport and exercise sciences, physical education) and counseling.|$|E
5000|$|... “As {{the nature}} of the U.S. and global economies is {{increasingly}} transforming from manufacturing to service, organizational participants are coping with new challenges, and those challenges often involve complex processes of emotion in the workplace. The initial shift in the economy involved a move to customer service (including industries such as retailing, restaurants and the travel industry), leading to scholarly consideration of the way emotional communication is used in the service of customers and in the advancement of organizational goals. This type of work has come to be labeled as emotional labor...the emotions and displays in emotional labor are largely inauthentic and are seen by management as a commodity that can be controlled, trained and set down in employee handbooks.” [...] “This relates to the induction or suppression of feeling in order to sustain an outward appearance that produces a sense in others of being cared for in a convivial safe place.”. Emotional labor refers to effort to show emotions that may not be genuinely felt but must be displayed in order to “express organizationally desired emotion during inter-personal transaction.” “Commercialization of emotional labor and the trends towards the homogenization of industrial and service-sector labor processes have, in turn, been shaped by the adoption of new management practices designed to promote feeling rules and personal patterns of behavior that enhance the institutions or enterprises performance or competitive edge”. In order to define the image that they want their organizations to portray, leaders use a “core component of “emotional intelligence” to recognize emotions.”. that appear desirable. Organizations have begun using their employee’s “emotion as a commodity used for the sake of profit”. Emotional labor inhibits workers from being able to participate in authentic emotional work. Emotional work is described as “emotion that is authentic, not emotion that is manufactured through surface acting…rarely seen as a profit center for management”. “The person whose feelings are easily aroused (but not necessarily easily controlled) is going to have far more difficulty in dealing with emotionally stressful situations. In contrast, empathic concern is hypothesized to have positive effects on responsiveness in international and on outcomes for the worker. A worker with empathic concern will have feelings for the client but will be able to deal more effectively with the client’s problems because there is not a direct sharing of the client’s emotions”. “Although emotional labor may be helpful to the organizational bottom line, there has been recent work suggesting that <b>managing</b> <b>emotions</b> for pay may be detrimental to the employee”. Emotional labor and emotional work both have negative aspects to them including the feelings of stress, frustration or exhaustion that all lead to burnout. “Burnout is related to serious negative consequences such as deterioration in the quality of service, job turnover, absenteeism and low morale…It seems to be correlated with various self report indices of personal distress, including physical exhaustion, insomnia, increased use of alcohol and drugs and marital and family problems”.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between <b>managing</b> <b>emotions</b> scores and the variables of education level, affiliation, number of relationships, commitment to relationships, and parental divorce. The instrument used in the study was the Iowa Development Inventory-B with questions added to measure behavior relative to the independent variables. The sample included 521 first term freshmen and eleventh term senior women at Oregon State University. Two-way analyses of variance provided information on the relationships and interactive effects between <b>managing</b> <b>emotions,</b> education, affiliation, number of relationships, and commitment to relationships. The t-tests and correlations were performed to further identify relationships. The significant variables were used to build a model for multiple regression. Based on the results of the study, the following conclusions were reached: 1. <b>Managing</b> <b>emotions</b> scores, number of relationships and commitment to relationships rose from the freshman to senior year for both affiliated and nonaffiliated women. 2. Affiliation with a sorority did not have a significant effect on rise in <b>managing</b> <b>emotions</b> scores. 3. Affiliation with a sorority had a stronger relationship with number of relationships than did educational level. 4. Number of relationships and commitment to relationships were significantly higher for affiliated women than for nonaffiliated women. 5.

40|$|Emotions may {{influence}} the firm’s decision to pursue international activity yet emotions’ influence in international entrepreneurial research has primarily been neglected.

We argue that in order to allow entrepreneurs to effectively <b>manage</b> <b>emotions</b> and succeed in technology-driven environments, examination of emotions {{in the context of the}} next-generation entrepreneur is imperative. The aim of this paper is to further understand and offer an explanation as to why some next-generation international entrepreneurs are better able to <b>manage</b> <b>emotions</b> and draw on healthier coping styles to regulate and process their emotions.
