30|$|In the UK {{there is}} the {{so-called}} foreclosure, which could {{be defined as a}} debt enforcement procedure aimed at recovering money owed to secured creditors (Djankov et al. 2008). Derived from the above definition we must directly rule out a direct legal equivalence between foreclosure and ejecución oracción hipotecaria. That is, we must be very specific when using these terms. Therefore, we should “translate” ejecución de un bien mueble pignorado (acción pignoraticia) as a foreclose on a pledged <b>movable</b> <b>asset</b> under UK Law. Then, if the property is an immovable asset (e.g. a building, a plant, the entrepreneur’s home), we could use the term “mortgage over land and buildings” foreclosures {{in the case of an}} execution (acción hipotecaria in Spain). In the main text we simplify the terminology and, for brevity of exposition, we use the term mortgage foreclosure.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the uncertificated securities in the context of financial law. Proper and prudential legal regulation of the securities is considered to be key element of efficient financial markets of which the importance for the economics is systematically growing in past few decades. From the beginning, financial markets were dominated by certificated securities represented by legal fiction incorporating rights arising from the security into a certificate and considering this certificate as a tangible <b>movable</b> <b>asset.</b> In the consequence of the development of financial markets and securities trading uncertificated securities were developed to make transfers of the securities and asset management feasible. Uncertificated securities can be defined as substitutable physical securities incorporating private rights which are prerequisite for the exercise and transfer of those rights and which are replaced by a record entered in the central register of securities, mainly central securities depositories. The form of the uncertificated securities determines the necessity of their special legal regulation taking into account their legal nature and connected legal aspects of record keeping. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse relevant Czech legislation and highlight both [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} function of RFID in vehicle tracking is to store information concerning tagged elements {{in order to}} improve the overall performance of <b>movable</b> <b>asset</b> management. There is a need to discover an RFID system for the tracking of vehicles, as existing vehicle tracking systems are undependable. Experiments were performed with SIRIT, SAVI, and RF code RFID systems under differing conditions, attaching the tag to the license plate instead of the windshield. Different spacers were also tested to reduce the effect of metal surfaces on RFID signals. Preliminary experiments were performed before stationary and motion testing in order to better understand the RFID systems. Testing was also conducted to identify the angle at which the reader should be fixed and the ideal placement of the tag on the license plate. Stationary and motion testing were then performed on the three RFID systems, using different spacers and speeds, and the effect of spacers and speed on signal strength was found to be significant. In addition, environmental testing was performed on RF code systems in low temperature conditions. Upon completion of these experiments, the resulting data was analyzed to identify not only the best material to embed between tag and license plate in practical situations, but also the most effective thickness of that material and the optimum height of the reader. Finally, a benefit cost analysis was performed comparing both the RF code RFID and mobile plate hunter (MPH) - 900 camera system. Results were compared for varying amounts of cars, and the analysis clearly showed that the RFID RF code system is better, compared to camera systems, for use in the tracking of vehicle license plate.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{cross-country}} differences in collateral laws regarding <b>movable</b> <b>assets</b> on lending and sectoral allocation of resources.
