This has led to protest from local pregnant women for the government to remedy the issue, as they have found difficulty in securing a bed space for giving birth and routine check-ups.

40|$|A {{critical}} step towards reducing errors {{in health care}} is the collection and assessment of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> data so that potential harms to patients can be identified and steps taken to prevent or mitigate them. However, no standardized framework for classifying and evaluating such data currently exists. This paper describes our efforts in developing a comprehensive <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> ontology {{to serve as a}} standard representation for <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> concepts from various existing published taxonomies. Eight candidate taxonomies were selected from the published literature and merged to create a reference ontology consisting of 12 multidimensional axes that encompass all the aspects of a <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> event. The ultimate goal of the project is to use the <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> ontology to identify strategies for preventing future adverse events in health care...|$|R
40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>error</b> {{taxonomies}} {{are used}} to report and analyse patient safety incidents. <b>Medical</b> <b>error</b> taxonomies can be generic or domain-specific. In comparing generic and domain-specific <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> taxonomies, the literature compares the information both type of taxonomies classify. There is little evidence the taxonomies have been compared in terms of usability and reliability. Twenty nurses and 21 pharmacists participated in a study comparing the usability and reliability of a generic <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> taxonomy and a medication <b>error</b> taxonomy. The <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> taxonomies utilized were the Patient Safety Event Taxonomy and the NCC MERP Taxonomy of Medication Error. The study found {{no significant difference in}} the usability ratings of both taxonomies. The taxonomies required different amount of time to classify patient safety incidents and had significantly different reliability levels. The reliability of the NCC MERP Taxonomy of Medication Error was significantly different when used by nurses and pharmacists. The taxonomy was also preferred by the majority of participants. Some recommendations are made about the design of future <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> taxonomies. 5 page(s...|$|R

25|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>errors</b> are {{associated}} with inexperienced physicians and nurses, new procedures, extremes of age, and complex or urgent care. Poor communication (whether in one's own language or, as {{may be the case}} for medical tourists, another language), improper documentation, illegible handwriting, inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios, and similarly named medications are also known to contribute to the problem. Patient actions may also contribute significantly to <b>medical</b> <b>errors.</b> Falls, for example, may result from patients' own misjudgements. Human error has been implicated in nearly 80 percent of adverse events that occur in complex healthcare systems. The vast majority of <b>medical</b> <b>errors</b> result from faulty systems and poorly designed processes versus poor practices or incompetent practitioners.|$|E

40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>error</b> {{stems from}} {{inadequate}} professional conduct that {{is capable of}} producing harm to life or exacerbating the health of another, whether through act or omission. This situation has become increasingly common in Brazil and worldwide. In this study, the aim was to understand what being the victim of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> is like and to investigate the circumstances imposed on this condition of victims in Brazil. A semi-structured interview was conducted with twelve people who had gone through situations of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> in their lives, creating a space for narratives of their experiences and deep reflection on the phenomenon. The concept of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> has a negative connotation, often being associated with the incompetence of a <b>medical</b> professional. <b>Medical</b> <b>error</b> in Brazil is demonstrated by low-quality professional performance and represents the current reality of the country because of the common lack of respect and consideration for patients. Victims often remark on their loss of identity, as their social functions have been interrupted and they do not expect to regain such. It was found, however, little assumption of error in the involved doctors’ discourses and attitudes, which felt a need to judge the medical conduct in an attempt to assert their rights. <b>Medical</b> <b>error</b> in Brazil presents a punitive character and is little discussed in medical and scientific circles. The stigma of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> is closely connected to the value and cultural judgments of the country, making it difficult to accept, both by victims and professionals...|$|R

At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration work shifts and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration work shifts. Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration work shifts. Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration work shifts may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated and}} evaluated the reporting process {{with regard to}} <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> as under the Accident Rehabilitation Compensation Insurance Act (1992) {{and the impact of}} that process with regard to the prevention of injury. It considers: (a) whether the legislation is consistent with regard to the aim of the prevention of injury; (b) the outcomes of the reporting process in terms of injury prevention; (c) if anything else could be done in terms of injury prevention. Under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act (1992) the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) was specifically required to 'report the circumstances [of the injury] to the appropriate body with a view to the institution of disciplinary proceedings, and to any other body that may be appropriate' if the Corporation was satisfied that negligence or inappropriate action had caused personal injury (ARCI Act, 1992). Reporting of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> by health professionals is one mechanism available to the ACC to prevent injury. Reporting to bodies such as the Health and Disability Commissioner's (HDC) office and organisations responsible for the registering of health professionals can result in changes which minimise the re-occurrence of the <b>medical</b> <b>error.</b> This research is based on a formative policy evaluation. It seeks to improve ACC's <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> reporting process and employs the methodological tools of document research and case studies. The study is based on a random selection of sixty claims accepted on the basis of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act (1992). The process of data analysis was informed by grounded theory in that four analytical categories established were based on similarity of content, according to their injury prevention outcome. The key findings of this evaluation resulted in recommendations which relate to improving the ACC's <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> reporting process. These may be of interest to those working in the area of policy development and/or process improvement, with regard to the reporting of <b>medical</b> <b>error</b> for the purpose of injury prevention. It is clear {{that there is a need}} for further research into the outcome of injury prevention initiatives undertaken by professional bodies and for the uptake of injury prevention initiatives by the ACC and the HDC's office...|$|R
