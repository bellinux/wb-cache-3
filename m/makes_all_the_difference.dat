500|$|In {{reaction}} {{to the introduction of}} the bikini in Paris, American [...] compromised cautiously by producing their own similar design that included a halter and a midriff-bottom variation. Though size <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in a bikini, early bikinis often covered the navel. When the navel showed in pictures, it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen. Navel-less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts. By {{the end of the decade}} a vogue for strapless styles developed, wired or bound for firmness and fit, along with a taste for bare-shouldered two-pieces called Little Sinners. But, it was the halterneck bikini that caused the most moral controversy because of its degree of exposure. So much so as bikini designs called [...] "Huba Huba" [...] and [...] "Revealation" [...] were withdrawn from fashion parades in Sydney as immodest.|$|E
500|$|In the yeshiva setting, {{students}} {{prepare for}} and review the shiur (lecture) with their chavrusas during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as sedarim. On average, a yeshiva student spends ten {{hours per day}} learning in chavrusa. Since having the right chavrusa <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch chavrusas eight or nine times {{in a class of}} 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides. If a chavrusa gets stuck on a difficult point or needs further clarification, they can turn to the rabbis, lecturers, or a sho'el u'mashiv (literally, [...] "ask and answer", a rabbi who is intimately familiar with the Talmudic text being studied) who are available to them in the study hall during sedarim. In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the chavrusas.|$|E

2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whether some {{qualities are}} virtues or vices depends on circumstance: [...] "The benevolence and open-handed {{generosity}} which adorn a rich man, {{may make a}} pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a [...] "failure" [...] will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> I sometimes wonder whether people, who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very [...] "fit," [...] indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when {{it would have been}} only too easy to qualify for a place among the [...] "unfit."" ...|$|E
2500|$|The term 'Objectivist' {{developed}} because Harriet Monroe {{insisted on}} a group name for the February 1931 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, which Monroe had allowed Zukofsky to guest edit, at Pound's urging. [...] Zukofsky recounts the occasion with Monroe in Prepositions: [...] "Harriet Monroe at the time insisted, we'd better have a title for it, call it something. I said, I don't want to. She insisted; so, I said, alright, if I can define it in an essay, and I used two words, sincerity and objectification, and I was sorry immediately. But it's gone down into the history books; they forgot the founder, thank heavens, and kept the terms, and, of course, I said objectivist, and they said objectivism and that <b>makes</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> Well, that was pretty bad, so then I spent the next thirty years {{trying to make it}} simple." [...] It also seems that the core group did not see themselves as a coherent movement but rather as a group of individual poets with some shared approach to their art. As well as the matters covered in Zukofsky's essays, the elements of this approach included: a respect for Imagist achievement in the areas of vers libre and highly concentrated language and imagery; a rejection of the Imagists' interest in classicism and mythology; for Reznikoff, Zukofsky, Rakosi and Oppen, a shared Jewish heritage (which, for all but Oppen included an early childhood in which English was not their first language); generally left-wing, and, in the cases of Zukofsky, Rakosi, and Oppen at least, Marxist politics.|$|E
