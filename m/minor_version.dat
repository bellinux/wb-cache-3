25|$|GNOME version numbers {{follow the}} scheme v.xx.yy. Here, v {{is a major}} version, which can include large changes such as ABI breakage; these have no regular {{schedule}} and occur in response to requirements for large-scale changes. xx is a <b>minor</b> <b>version,</b> released on the above schedule of approximately every 6 months, in which the 1- or 2-digit number's parity indicates the type of release: if xx is even (e.g. 3.20) the release is considered stable, whereas if xx is odd it represents a current development snapshot (e.g. 3.21) that will eventually evolve into the next stable release. yy indicates a point release, e.g. 3.20.6; these are made on a frequency of weeks in order to fix issues, add non-breaking enhancements, etc.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Rhinemaidens' joy and {{greeting}} to the gold": [...] "Heiajaheia, Heiajaheia! Wallalallalala leiajahei! Rheingold! Rheingold!..." [...] (Das Rheingold Scene 1) is a [...] triumphant greeting song {{based on}} two elements, which are developed and transformed later in the Ring and put to many uses. For example, the joyful [...] "heiajaheia" [...] cries are converted, in Rheingold Scene 2, into a dark <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> as Loge reports the theft of the gold to the gods and the consequent rising power of the Nibelungen. The [...] "Rheingold!" [...] repetition is sung by the Rhinemaidens to the same falling step that marked the start of Woglinde's song. This figure recurs constantly in the later stages of the drama; in Das Rheingold Scene 3 a [...] minor key version {{is used as a}} motive for the evil power of the ring that Alberich has forged from the gold. It comes to represent the theme of servitude to the ring; in Götterdämmerung, enslaved to the ring by his desire for it, Hagen utters his [...] "Hoi-ho" [...] call to his vassals using the same minor two-note figure.|$|E

50|$|Claris {{changed the}} product's name to FileMaker II {{to conform to}} its naming scheme for other products, such as MacWrite II, but the product changed little from the last Nashoba <b>version.</b> Several <b>minor</b> <b>versions</b> followed, before its {{replacement}} by the release of FileMaker Pro 1.0 in 1990.|$|R
2500|$|The Japanese {{method of}} {{identifying}} model numbers of aircraft engines {{is unique in}} that the model number always has two digits and may be followed {{by one or more}} letters. [...] The first digit represents the major version of the engine and the second number represents the <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> of that model engine. The model number follows the name (IJNAS engines) or the Ha number (IJAAF engines).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first model}} number {{assigned}} to an engine is always 11, meaning {{the first major}} design and first <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> of that design. A major change to the design increments the first number and resets the second number to one. [...] A minor change to the engine model increments the second number by one. [...] If a very minor change is made, suffix letters are added after the model number.|$|E
2500|$|McCreary saw {{his main}} {{theme for the}} series, which also {{represents}} the central team of agents, as primarily being a theme for Phil Coulson. McCreary noted that [...] "in one of the movies that would be inappropriate. You wouldn't do that for Coulson when Thor or Captain America {{are in the same}} story. But here Coulson is the hero ... It's all about him." [...] McCreary initially wrote the theme in F major, [...] "giving it a very triumphant sound", with one instance in the pilot diminishing it to F minor. Executive producer Jed Whedon [...] "astutely pointed out that the <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> was more satisfying than the major version", and so McCreary 'tweaked' the theme permanently into F minor. ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to use a full symphonic orchestra for every episode, and so there is [...] "a full section of brass that's pounding out his theme when he comes out in his heroic moments." [...] McCreary had to work harder than usual to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. To accompany the main theme, McCreary wrote an ostinato [...] "that doesn’t draw as much attention to itself as a full-blown melody. I use this catchy little riff to build up steam before sweeping statements of the Main Theme." ...|$|E

50|$|Appserver.io {{follows a}} naming {{convention}} based on major and <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> numbers. The major digit specifies {{a context for}} <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> names exist. The 1.*.* major version is named Iron which stands for a mythological view on the medieval age. Every <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> 1.x.* within this major release consist of a noun describing something common to this major context.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very common}} {{solution}} to this problem is to have a standardised numbering system, wherein software uses a specific number for each version (aka major version), and also a subnumber for each revision (aka <b>minor</b> <b>version),</b> e.g.: 10.1, or 5.7. The major version only changes when programs that used that version will no longer be compatible. The <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> might change with even a simple revision that does not prevent other software from working with it. In cases like this, software packages can then simply request a component that has a particular major version, and any <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> (greater than or equal to a particular <b>minor</b> <b>version).</b> As such, they will continue to work, and dependencies will be resolved successfully, even if the <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> changes.|$|E

50|$|Between the 1.0 and the 2.6.x series, the Linux kernel used odd <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> {{numbers to}} denote {{development}} releases and even <b>minor</b> <b>version</b> numbers to denote stable releases; see Linux kernel: Version numbering.
