500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album. In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images remind me of the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> melodrama but it not just me. I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E

Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: [...] "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, Pokémon Gold and Silver blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a time element... Although it <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating.

2500|$|Sufferers of AOS {{present with}} {{prosodic}} errors which include irregular pitch, rate, and rhythm.

On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound.

Manohla Dargis compared Eastwood's presence on film to Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, stating: [...] "Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in Gran Torino, not as a character, but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course, most obviously, in Mr. Eastwood’s face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated {{that it no longer}} looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood." [...] The Los Angeles Times also praised Eastwood's performance and credibility as an action hero at the age of 78. Kenneth Turan said of Eastwood's performance, [...] "It is a film that is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical.

Roger Ebert wrote that the film is [...] "about the belated flowering of a man's better nature. And it's about Americans of different races growing more open to one another in the new century." [...] Sang Chi and Emily Moberg Robinson, editors of Voices of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander Experience: Volume 1, said that within the mainstream media, the film received [...] "criticial acclaim" [...] "for its nuanced portrayal of Asian Americans."
