5|$|After {{the rolls}} were {{presented}} to the king they were archived in the royal collections. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, a navy administrator and avid book collector. Pepys did not disclose {{the details of how}} the rolls were given to him, but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king's account of how he escaped from the Battle of Worcester (1651). The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677–89 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of William III and Mary II, which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time. After Pepys' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson. After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library, along with the codex, was then passed on to Pepys' old college at Magdalene, Cambridge, where it remains to this day.|$|E

25|$|Two {{decades before}} the Industrial Revolution an {{improvement}} {{was made in}} the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s. The raw <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was blister steel, made by the cementation process.|$|E

25|$|Various {{scientific}} disciplines have developed taxonomic classification systems to describe natural phenomena or individuals, like for example, plants or animals. These systems {{are based on}} specific characteristics like shape of organs or nature of reproduction. Differently, in landslide classification, there are great difficulties because phenomena are not perfectly repeatable; usually being characterised by different causes, movements and morphology, and involving genetically different <b>material.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, landslide classifications are based on different discriminating factors, sometimes very subjective. In the following write-up, factors are discussed by dividing them into two groups: {{the first one is}} made up of the criteria utilised in the most widespread classification systems that can generally be easily determined. The second one is formed by those factors that have been utilised in some classifications and can be useful in descriptions.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Kijé {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} sound films made in the Soviet Union. The origin of the story was a 1927 screenplay by the critic and novelist Yury Tynyanov, written for the Soviet film director Sergei Yutkevich. This project failed, and Tinyanov recast his script into a novella that was published in January 1928. In the early 1930s, when the Belgoskino studios announced their interest in making the film, Tynyanov produced a second script. The story has been described by Prokofiev's biographer Harlow Robinson as [...] "a satire on the stupidity of royalty and the particularly Russian terror of displeasing one's superior". By his own account Prokofiev was at this time [...] "restive, and afraid of falling into academism"; a later critic thought the Kijé story provided ideal <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> [...] "so-often caustic and witty composer".|$|E

500|$|In 2004, in {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "On Some Apparent Sketches for Sibelius's Eighth Symphony", the musical theorist Nors Josephson identifies around 20 manuscripts or fragments held in the Helsinki University Library as being relevant to the symphony and concludes that: [...] "Given the abundance of preserved <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> work, one looks forward with great anticipation to a thoughtful, meticulous completion of the entire composition". Another Sibelius scholar, Timo Virtanen, has examined the same material and is more restrained, concluding that {{although some of the}} sketches may relate to the Eighth Symphony, {{it is not possible to}} determine exactly which, if any, these are. Even the fragment marked [...] "VIII", he maintains, cannot with certainty be said to relate to the symphony, since Sibelius often used both Roman and Arabic numerals to refer to themes, motifs or passages within a composition. Virtanen provides a further note of caution: [...] "We should be aware that [...] are, after all, drafts: unfinished as music, and representing only a certain stage in planning a new composition".|$|E
500|$|Waffle-iron {{filters are}} used in {{industrial}} microwave processes. [...] The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, sterilising, and vulcanisation. [...] In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. [...] Steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. [...] It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave absorbent <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose. [...] However, the absorbed microwaves have a heating effect and this can be severe enough to damage the absorbent material. [...] Waffle-iron filters are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth. [...] An ideal filter will reflect all the unwanted radiation rather than absorbing it so will not suffer from overheating. [...] This {{is an example of a}} filter being used in a choke application. [...] In some processes both techniques are used simultaneously. [...] The waffle-iron is placed nearest the microwave chamber to first reduce the energy to a level which will not cause the absorbent lining to overheat. [...] The absorbent lining then removes the small residue.Metaxas and Meredith, pp.301–303 ...|$|E
500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is going to turn out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{his career}} Kubíček {{realised}} that the third dimension would render his work more complex and complete. Perspex seemed to him the ideal <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose. Moreover, the layering of sheets in space allowed the viewer to see through objects, and multiple layers accentuated colors, proferring tones distinct from those available through the conventional mixing of acrylic paints. [...] "The essence of my geometric work is simplicity and comprehensiveness," [...] said Kubíček. “When I transform my sketches into artefacts made of wood, plastic and other materials, some elements of the construction will always remain hidden from the viewer's eye. Perspex, on the other hand, makes the construction transparent and legible, revealing details otherwise obfuscated by opaque materials." ...|$|E
2500|$|The symphony {{opens with}} a strenuous string figure in canon, {{initially}} leaping and falling in minor sixths then narrowing to minor thirds. The sharply dotted rhythm of this figure remains to accompany a broadly lyric melody played by the first violins. Variants of this theme return throughout the 3rd and 4th movements. The second theme is built out of octaves and sevenths. Whereas the first theme {{is based on a}} sharp dotted rhythm, the second relies on a static long-short-short pattern. [...] With that is found all the musical <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> movement—one that is tremendously varied, its climax harsh. The coda, with the gentle friction of minor in strings against chromatic scales in celesta, ends on a note of haunting ambiguity.|$|E
