However, many factors may affect ration homogeneity, including particle size, shape, and density and <b>mixer</b> <b>discharge</b> location. Forages are often ground prior to mixing in a total mixed ration to reduce variation in forage particle length.

40|$|The Savannah River Site F-Tank Farm Closure {{project has}} {{successfully}} performed Mechanical Sludge Removal (MSR) using the Waste on Wheels (WOW) {{system for the}} first time within one of its storage tanks. The WOW system is designed to be relatively mobile with the ability for many components to be redeployed to multiple waste tanks. It is primarily comprised of Submersible Mixer Pumps (SMPs), Submersible Transfer Pumps (STPs), and a mobile control room with a control panel and variable speed drives. In addition, the project is currently preparing another waste tank for MSR utilizing lessons learned from this previous operational activity. These tanks, designated as Tank 6 and Tank 5 respectively, are Type I waste tanks located in F-Tank Farm (FTF) with a capacity of 2, 840 cubic meters (750, 000 gallons) each. The construction of these tanks was completed in 1953, and they were placed into waste storage service in 1959. The tank's primary shell is 23 meters (75 feet) in diameter, and 7. 5 meters (24. 5 feet) in height. Type I tanks have 34 vertically oriented cooling coils and two horizontal cooling coil circuits along the tank floor. Both Tank 5 and Tank 6 received and stored F-PUREX waste during their operating service time before sludge removal was performed. DOE intends to remove from service and operationally close (fill with grout) Tank 5 and Tank 6 and other HLW tanks that do not meet current containment standards. Mechanical Sludge Removal, {{the first step in the}} tank closure process, will be followed by chemical cleaning. After obtaining regulatory approval, the tanks will be isolated and filled with grout for long-term stabilization. Mechanical Sludge Removal operations within Tank 6 removed approximately 75 % of the original 95, 000 liters (25, 000 gallons). This sludge material was transferred in batches to an interim storage tank to prepare for vitrification. This operation consisted of eleven (11) Submersible Mixer Pump(s) mixing campaigns and multiple intraarea transfers utilizing STPs from July 2006 to August 2007. This operation and successful removal of sludge material meets requirement of approximately 19, 000 to 28, 000 liters (5, 000 to 7, 500 gallons) remaining prior to the Chemical Cleaning process. Removal of the last 35 % of sludge was exponentially more difficult, as less and less sludge was available to mobilize and the lighter sludge particles were likely removed during the early mixing campaigns. The removal of the 72, 000 liters (19, 000 gallons) of sludge was challenging due to a number factors. One primary factor was the complex internal cooling coil array within Tank 6 that obstructed <b>mixer</b> <b>discharge</b> jets and impacted the Effective Cleaning Radius (ECR) of the Submersible Mixer Pumps. Minimal access locations into the tank through tank openings (risers) presented a challenge because the available options for equipment locations were very limited. Mechanical Sludge Removal activities using SMPs caused the sludge to migrate to areas of the tank that were outside of the SMP ECR. Various SMP operational strategies were used to address the challenge of moving sludge from remote areas of the tank to the transfer pump. This paper describes in detail the Mechanical Sludge Removal activities and mitigative solutions to cooling coil obstructions and other challenges. The performance of the WOW system and SMP operational strategies were evaluated and the resulting lessons learned are described for application to future Mechanical Sludge Removal operations...|$|E

Evaluating {{the effect}} of {{manufacturing}} porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) -contaminated feed on subsequent feed mill environmental surface contamination. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 77 - 77. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 164 With the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) to the United States in 2013 and the subsequent identification of feed as a route of transmission, identifying sources of feedstuff contamination and methods {{to reduce the risk}} of transmission at feed mills has become paramount. As with other biological hazards, contaminated ingredients can easily lead to cross-contamination of finished feeds and contamination throughout the facility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to monitor equipment and environmental contamination after manufacturing PEDV-positive feed and after the production of subsequent PEDV-negative feed. PEDV-positive feed (50 kg with 4. 5 × 104 TCID 50 /g, Ct 11) was mixed in a 0. 11 m 3 paddle <b>mixer,</b> <b>discharged</b> into a bucket elevator, and collected. Following processing of the contaminated feed, 4 subsequent batches of PEDV-free feed (sequence 1 – 4) were processed through the mixer and bucket elevator with no decontamination between batches to mimic commercial feed production. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus contamination of equipment and surrounding areas were monitored via the collection of swabs that were analyzed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) for PEDV RNA. Swabs were collected from equipment and facility surfaces prior and after processing contaminated feed and after processing subsequent sequenced batch diets. Monitored areas for equipment included the interior of the mixer and bucket elevator. Facility areas included high and low foot traffic areas (concrete), floor drain (concrete), worker boot bottoms (rubber), table (metal), and door (metal). Three replications of contaminated feed and subsequent sequence batch diet processing was completed, with equipment and facility decontamination between replicates. Following qPCR analysis, Ct values ? 40 were considered PEDV-positive and all numerical data was converted to ± for statistical analysis via PROC MIXED procedure of SAS. The interactions feed contact surface by sequence were found to be significant (P < 0. 01). All swabs collected from equipment surfaces after processing of PEDV-positive feed were positive for PEDV, while 16 of 18 of the collected facility swabs were positive for PEDV RNA. Following processing of the first sequence batch diet, 100 % of equipment surfaces and 88. 9 % of facility surfaces were positive for PEDV. Surprisingly, a large percentage of equipment and facility surfaces remained PEDV-positive through the processing of the subsequent sequence batch diets. Furthermore, all swabs collected from concrete and rubber surfaces remained PEDV-positive through all processing of all diets. This study demonstrates the extent of equipment and facility contamination that could occur in a feed manufacturing facility after processing of PEDV-contaminated feed...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. This thesis {{attempts}} to resolve {{some of the}} major problems associated with lime treatment in waste water reclamation. The contribution to knowledge is briefly outlined below. One of the major problems associated with lime treatment is the instability of lime-treated effluent, which may result in serious calcium carbonate scale formation problems. In the thesis this instability is attributed to two fundamental causes, (1) Incomplete precipitation, i. e. a kinetic problem. (2) The unintentional absorption of carbon dioxide from the air by the highly alkaline lime-treated effluent, i. e. a contamination problem. Calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide precipitation are time dependent. As a consequence of this time dependency unstable effluent may be produced under reaction conditions commonly encountered in practice. An exhaustive study identified the major factors affecting the precipitation kinetics. Reaction system conditions required for producing a stable effluent are, (1) Lime slurry and sludge, in that sequence, must be thoroughly mixed with the waste water, preferably by means of in-line static <b>mixers,</b> before <b>discharge</b> to a completely stirred tank reactor. (2) A completely stirred tank reactor with a minimum mean residence time of two minutes must be provided for the dissolution and precipitation reactions to go as near to completion as possible. (3) The reactor contents must have a sludge concentration of the order of 10 000 mg l⁻¹...|$|R
