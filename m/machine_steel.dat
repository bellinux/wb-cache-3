40|$|AbstractUltra short laser pulses are used, when high {{requirements}} concerning machining quality are demanded. The cost- effectiveness {{plays an}} important role for a successful transfer of this technology into industrial applications. Therefore systems with longer ps-pulses could offer an attractive alternative compared to short ps- and fs systems. Beside fiber based systems with ∼ 50 ps pulse durations also small systems with sub-ns pulses are available today. In contrast to the dramatic drop of the material removal rate when the pulse duration is raised from 10 ps to 50 ps the impact is weaker for a further increase to 540 ps and the removal rate even increases when the pulse duration is raised to 1. 4 ns. As no crater formation is observed and the surface quality is better than for 1. 4 ns pulses, sub-ns pulses could be an attractive alternative to <b>machine</b> <b>steel</b> compared to fiber based systems with ∼ 50 ps pulse duration...|$|E

40|$|Hardened {{steel is}} widely used in the {{manufacture}} of dies, mould and automotive components such as bearings, gears and shafts. The continuous improvements and developments in cutting tool technology coupled with the availability of suitable machine tools have made it possible to <b>machine</b> <b>steel</b> in its hardened form thereby eliminating the heat treatment step, which is required in the conventional approach. Commercially available plastic mould steel, Stavax ESR, which is a premium grade stainless tool steel, has been hardened to (43 ~ 45 HRC) and turned using two commercially available cutting tool inserts with various side cutting edge angles and at various cutting speeds and feed rates. Turning was performed dry and a constant depth of cut was set. The cutting tool inserts used were physical vapor deposition (PVD) multi coated TiCN based cermet grade with TiN inner layer, TiCN intermediate layer and a TiN outer layer (KT 315); and a cobalt enriched, multi coated carbide grade with thick moderate temperature chemical vapor deposition (MTCVD) - TiCN inner layer, an Al 2 O 3 intermediate layer and TiCN and TiN outer layers (KC 9110). Tool performance, tool failure modes and wear mechanisms of the said tools were investigated under various cutting conditions. The surface roughness of the turned part and the chip morphology were studied while the cutting forces were also measured. The performance of the cutting tools is described using response surface methodology. The cutting speed and feed are found {{have an effect on the}} various responses investigated. Additionally, the side cutting edge angle is also found to provide secondary contribution to the tool life and surface roughness. The use of - 5 o side cutting edge angle resulted in longest tool and better surface roughness. The mathematical models developed are statistically valid and sound, particularly for Fc. These are verified by the confirmation run experiments and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. KC 9110 outperformed KT 315 in terms of tool life for almost all of the cutting conditions tested. The only exception is at a low feed rate of 0. 09 mm/rev and a low cutting speed of 100 m/min where the tool life of KT 315 was more than 30 minutes and this was the longest tool life achievable. For KT 315, flank wear and catastrophic failure are the dominant failure modes whereas for KC 9110 it was end clearance wear and flank wear. Flank and end clearance wear probably occur by both abrasive and adhesive wear mechanisms with abrasive wear being the major source of material removal. Catastrophic failure could be associated with a combination of abrasion, adhesion, diffusion, fracture and plastic deformation wear mechanisms. Saw-tooth chips are produced at almost all conditions with the exception of cutting at low cutting speed and feed. White layers are also detected on the chip underside...|$|E
40|$|Stainless {{steel is}} {{the most widely used}} alloys of steel. The reputed variety of {{stainless}} steel having customised material properties as per the design requirements is Duplex Stainless Steel and Austenitic Stainless Steel. The Austenite Stainless Steel alloy has been developed further to be Super Austenitic Stainless Steel (SASS) by increasing the percentage of the alloying elements to form the half or more than the half of the material composition. SASS (Grade-AL- 6 XN) is an alloy steel containing high percentages of nickel (24 %), molybdenum (6 %) and chromium (21 %). The chemical elements offer high degrees of corrosion resistance, toughness and stability in a large range of hostile environments like petroleum, marine and food processing industries. SASS is often used as a commercially viable substitute to high cost non-ferrous or non-metallic metals. The ability to <b>machine</b> <b>steel</b> effectively and efficiently is of utmost importance in the current competitive market. This paper is an attempt to evaluate the machinability of SASS which has been a classified material so far with very limited research conducted on it. Understanding the machinability of this alloy would assist in the effective forming of this material by metal cutting. The novelty of research associated with this is paper is reasonable taking into consideration the unknowns involved in machining SASS. The experimental design consists of conducting eight milling trials at combination of two different feed rates, 0. 1 and 0. 15 mm/tooth; cutting speeds, 100 and 150 m/min; Depth of Cut (DoC), 2 and 3 mm and coolant on for all the trials. The cutting tool has two inserts and therefore has two cutting edges. The trial sample is mounted on a dynamometer (type 9257 B) to measure the cutting forces during the trials. The cutting force data obtained is later analyzed using DynaWare supplied by Kistler. The machined sample is subjected to surface roughness (Ra) measurement using a 3 D optical surface profilometer (Alicona Infinite Focus). A comprehensive metallography process consisting of mounting, polishing and etching was conducted on a before and after machined sample {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the microstructural changes due to machining. The microstructural images were capture using a digital microscope. The microhardness test were conducted on a Vickers scale (Hv) using a Vickers microhardness tester. Initial bulk hardness testing conducted on the material show that the alloy is having a hardness of 83. 4 HRb. This study expects an increase in hardness mostly due to work hardening may be due to phase transformation. The results obtained from the cutting trials are analyzed in order to judge the machinability of the material. Some of the criteria used for machinability evaluation are cutting force analysis, surface texture analysis, metallographic analysis and microhardness analysis. The methodology followed in each aspect of the investigation is similar to and inspired by similar research conducted on other materials. However, the novelty of this research is the investigation of various aspects of machinability and drawing comparisons between each other while attempting to justify each result obtained to the microstructural changes observed which influence the behaviour of the alloy. Due to the limited scope of the paper, machinability criteria such as chip morphology, Metal Removal Rate (MRR) and tool wear are not included in this paper. All aspects are then compared and the optimum machining parameters are justified with a scope for future investigation...|$|E
