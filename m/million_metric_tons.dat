40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{prospect}} of biodiesel from rice bran in Bangladesh. Rice bran is the non-edible portion of paddy. It can be easily collected from the rice husk of the paddy. The estimated production of paddy in Bangladesh in year 2010 - 11 is about 33. 54 <b>million</b> <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> (source: BBS). If 18 - 20 wt% rice is rice husk then the amount of rice husk becomes 6. 71 <b>million</b> <b>metric</b> <b>ton.</b> This rice husk contains about 16 to 20 % of crude rice bran oil of its weight. An estimate of about 1. 34 <b>million</b> <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> of crude rice bran oil can be obtained annually. The current consumption of Petroleum Products in Bangladesh is 3. 7 MT/annum and annual growth rate is 4 % (source: BPC). Diesel consumption in Bangladesh is about 2. 4 MT/annum. If the estimated amount of rice bran oil (RBO) is converted into biodiesel, this can satisfy 60 - 70 % of our diesel need. This study involves the investigation of oil properties collected from rice bran to ensure the production of biodiesel by the well-known transesterification process. In order to inveterate the clarity of cost of biodiesel production, the aim fix with the determination of fuel properties, economic analysis and comparison with other non-edible sources...|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 <b>million</b> <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
