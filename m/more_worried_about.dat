25|$|Certain {{issues have}} brought {{criticism}} to missionary activity. This has included concerns that missionaries have a perceived {{lack of respect}} for other cultures. Potential destruction of social structure among the converts has also been a concern. The Akha people of South East Asia are an example of those who believe that missionaries are only converting others for personal gain. The Akha people have complained the missionaries are <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> building a church than building a clinic in a village that is very unhealthy. Many traditional values of the Akha have been lost {{as a result of these}} conversions. The Huaorani people of Amazonian Ecuador have had a well-documented mixed relation with Evangelical Christian missionaries and the contacts they brought to their communities, criticized by outsiders.|$|E

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that people perceive women as experiencing more fear than men (Brody & Hall, 1993) and research {{also shows that}} worry is related to fear (Borkovec, Robinson, Pruzinsky, & Depree). The purpose of this Study 1 was to explore how people perceive {{men and women to}} worry overall as well as in specific domains. Three hundred and one Concordia University students completed two worry questionnaires to measure overall amount of worry and worry in specific domains. The results showed that people perceive women as experiencing <b>more</b> <b>worry</b> than men and men as experiencing <b>more</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> achievement, finances, and incompetence. A second objective was to compare people's perceptions of men and women's worry to their perceptions of high and low-status individuals' worry to determine if a status model is a viable option for explaining the gender stereotypes of worry that emerged in Study 1. Women generally have lower status than men (Rhoodie, 1989), which leads to the hypothesis that people perceive low-status individuals as <b>worrying</b> <b>more</b> overall as well as <b>worrying</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> relationships. In contrast, people perceive high-status individuals as <b>worrying</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> achievement, finances and incompetence. Sixty-two Concordia University students listened to a tape describing a culture that consists of high and low-status individuals. Participants completed modified versions of the worry questionnaires used in Study 1 to measure their perceptions of low and high-status individuals' worry. The findings suggest that status is a viable model for explaining the stereotype of overall worry that emerged from Study 1...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> spoilage than {{the effect of}} corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|E
25|$|Tywin Lannister calls {{a meeting}} of the Small Council. He demands {{knowledge}} of Jaime's location, which the spymaster, Lord Varys, is unable to provide. Tywin then announces plans to have Lord Petyr Baelish wed Lysa Arryn to deprive Robb Stark of more allies in the war. Tywin names his son Tyrion as Baelish's replacement as Master of Coin (treasurer), despite Tyrion's pointing out his lack of expertise. Later, while retrieving the ledgers for his new appointment, Lord Baelish advises Tyrion on the job. Tyrion then rewards his virgin squire Podrick Payne with the services of three prostitutes for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater; Tyrion is later surprised to discover that they refuse payment due to Podrick's skill in lovemaking. While going over the books, Tyrion discovers that as treasurer Baelish has borrowed millions in gold from Tywin, as well as tens of millions from the Iron Bank of Braavos. A debt to Tywin is a problem since, regardless of his familial relationship with the king, Tyrion fears he will not forgive the debt despite the crown's dire straits. However, he is <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the Iron Bank, since if they are not paid back in due time they may very well begin funding the Crown's enemies.|$|E
40|$|Administered a 31 -item worry measure, {{based on}} {{criteria}} from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3 rd ed., rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) for anxiety disorders, to referred children with anxiety disorders (n = 72) or {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD; n = 50), and to nonreferred, never psychiatrically ill controls (n = 55). Anxiety and ADHD groups did not differ for self-reported worries. Anxious children did report <b>more</b> "intense" <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> separation and social evaluation than controls. ADHD children reported <b>more</b> intense <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> friends and school than controls. Separation worries were most prevalent in children with separation anxiety disorder, thus distinguishing this subgroup from both control groups. Results suggest that intense worries specific to one's anxiety disorder are more clinically relevant than the overall level of worry. Implications for assessment of worry are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was {{able to get out of}} the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{that there is a}} {{significant}} gender difference in the worry report of women and men, with women consistently reporting <b>more</b> <b>worry</b> than men (Stavosky & Borkovec, 1988). This study investigated this phenomenon by looking at gender differences in cognitive variables associated with excessive worry. Intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, positive beliefs <b>about</b> <b>worry,</b> and cognitive avoidance have been linked with the generation and maintenance of worry (Dugas et al., 1998). Two-hundred and twenty-one female and 103 male university students completed six questionnaires assessing trait worry, intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, positive beliefs <b>about</b> <b>worry,</b> and cognitive avoidance. The results showed that women reported significantly <b>more</b> <b>worry</b> than men on two trait worry scales, as well as significantly <b>more</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> lack of confidence issues. In relation to cognitive variables associated with worry, women also reported engaging in significantly more thought suppression and negative problem orientation than men. A non-significant trend emerged for a closer relationship between positive beliefs <b>about</b> <b>worry</b> and trait worry for men. It is postulated that thought suppression and negative problem orientation may account for women's increased reporting of worry, and that positive beliefs <b>about</b> <b>worry</b> may have a closer relationship to worry in men. Hypotheses accounting for the observed gender effects in the cognitive variables used in this study are discussed...|$|R
