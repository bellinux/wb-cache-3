5|$|Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> already {{residing}} at home, {{due to the}} cyclone striking {{during the}} Chinese New Year. Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed. Officials also ordered for cars to be off the roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.|$|E
5|$|Despite never making landfall, the {{tropical}} cyclone disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on Bermuda and Newfoundland. In the former, the hurricane brought winds {{in excess of}} , downing power lines and felled trees. Property damage also resulted from the strong winds. Overall damage on the island totaled $400,000. After passing west of Bermuda, {{the tropical}} cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes. Two ships, the Leicester and Gaspar, encountered the hurricane and became stricken in open waters. Though <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> rescued from both ships, six people perished on the former while one died on the latter. Beginning on September15, the hurricane tracked east of Newfoundland, producing heavy rainfall on land. The precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow, inundating additional areas. On the island, two people were killed. Overall, the hurricane caused eight fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated {{the men from}} the women and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E

Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's had followed the courtesy campaigns by the STPB with 'interest and amusement: interest because <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> responsive to the campaign; amusement because no one protested that it was absurd to teach Singaporeans to be polite to tourists’.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{struck at}} 05:03 a.m while {{many people were}} still sleeping or preparing for morning prayer. Hundreds of people panicked and ran through the streets as the earthquake struck, with eyewitnesses stating that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> crying and screaming as their memories of the massive earthquake in 2004 were triggered.

25|$|Some {{traditional}} {{accounts of}} the transmission of the Mahayana sutras claims that many parts were actually written down {{at the time of}} the Buddha and stored for five hundred years in the realm of the nāgas (serpent-like supernatural beings who dwell in another plane of being). The reason given for the late disclosure of the Mahayana teachings is that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> initially unable to understand the Mahayana sutras {{at the time of the}} Buddha (500 BCE) and suitable recipients for these teachings had still to arise amongst humankind.|$|E
25|$|The main shock on 4 September caused {{widespread}} {{damage and}} several power outages, {{particularly in the}} city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city. Two residents were seriously injured, one by a collapsing chimney and a second by flying glass. One person {{died of a heart attack}} suffered during the quake, although this could not be directly linked to the earthquake. Mass fatalities were avoided partly due to there being few houses of unreinforced construction, although this was also aided by the quake occurring during the early hours of the morning when <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> off the street.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} relocation was controversial, {{and although}} some welcomed the proposal, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> against moving the landmark fountain. Opponents stated {{that since the}} fountain has an underground system of passages, {{it is impossible to}} move it without destroying and rebuilding it, and the fountain might not work at all if moved. Concerns were also raised that the Triton figures would be damaged if they were to be moved. In December 2011, Minister Austin Gatt announced that the fountain will not be moved, and after restoration it will serve as the centerpiece of Piano's redesigned entrance to Valletta.|$|E

25|$|The high {{loss of life}} {{caused by}} the {{earthquake}} {{can be attributed to}} the time it struck and how suddenly it struck, as well as to the quality and nature of building construction in China. The earthquake lacked the foreshocks that sometimes come with earthquakes of this magnitude. It also struck at just before 4a.m., when <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> asleep and unprepared. Tangshan itself was thought to be in a region with a relatively low risk of earthquakes. Very few buildings had been built to withstand an earthquake, and the city lies on unstable alluvial soil. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The Latino {{demographics}} caused {{controversy in}} the 1970s, when many drug cartels were selling drugs, even though <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not actually affected by it. While some media sources placed culpability on the wire transfer stores along Roosevelt Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful to the community. Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed to as another trace of evidence, even though most were actually just places for typical Latino immigrants to hang out. Little India was also controversial. Although Indians are a minority in Jackson Heights, a vibrant commercial area developed on 74th Street in the 1990s, and by 1993, {{it was the largest}} Asian Indian shopping area in the country.|$|E
25|$|By the 12th {{century the}} only known bourgeois were the {{multinational}} inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition {{of a number of}} liberties. In the country, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> freemen, peasants, artisans, or infantrymen, who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to the greed of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of servitude. Finally, servos, libertos, and pueros (serfs and slaves), either obtained in war with the Moors or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (domesticos and scancianes), shepherds, and farmhands. Local charters also show that, in time, they were freed.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} {{as a light}} rail between Majorstuen to Holmenkollen. The {{terminus}} at Majorstuen was an inconvenience for passengers as <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> bound for the city center and had to change to the street trams. For the operator Holmenkolbanen, there were two ways to solve the issue. They could sign trackage rights with Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei to use the Briskeby Line to reach the city center. Alternatively, a tunnel could be built to an underground station in the city center. Applications for a tunnel {{were sent to the}} municipality in 1901. However, disagreements as to whether the tunnel was to be considered a railway or tramway halted progress; the city considered the line a tramway while the company considered it to be a railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of Nevada residents vary, {{but the majority}} appears to support the status quo of prostitution: they support laws allowing licensed brothels {{in the rural areas}} but oppose the legalization of prostitution in Las Vegas. A poll conducted in Nevada in 2002 found that 52% of the 600 respondents favored the existing legal and regulated brothels, while 31% were against laws that allow prostitution and the remainder were undecided, preferred fewer legal constraints on prostitution, or did not offer an opinion. The trend seems to be that new arrivals to Nevada tend to oppose legal prostitution while long-time Nevadans tend to support it. However, nearly 60% of Nevada residents oppose the legalization of brothels and prostitution in Las Vegas (59% oppose this idea, 35% support it and 6% don't know or didn't answer). Again, support is stronger in the rural areas (where <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> born in Nevada) and weaker in Clark County and Washoe County; women are more opposed to the idea than men.|$|E
