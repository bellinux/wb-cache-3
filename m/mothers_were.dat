5|$|According to K.C. Aryan, {{the number}} of Matrikas is {{determined}} {{in the structure of}} the Devanagari alphabet. First is the (A) group which contains the vowels, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (Saptamatrikas) correspond to the seven consonant groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added to it, the eight mother goddesses (Ashtamatrikas) are obtained. The Shaktas hold that the Mothers preside over impurities (mala) and over sounds of the language. The <b>Mothers</b> <b>were</b> identified with fourteen vowels plus the anusarva and visarga– making their number sixteen.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the {{biological}} mother or biological father, or the legal guardian for adopted children. Traditionally, <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. <b>Mothers</b> <b>were</b> responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|Third class {{passengers}} were {{a diverse group}} of nationalities and ethnic groups. In addition to large numbers of British, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants, there were passengers from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East (primarily Lebanon and Syria) and Hong Kong. Some travelled alone or in small family groups. Several groups of <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> travelling alone with their young children—most going to join their husbands who had already gone to America to find jobs, and, having saved up enough money, could now send for their families.|$|E
5|$|Health effects {{extended}} to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths {{have been linked}} to the toxic dust, and the victims' names were included in the World Trade Center memorial. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses {{as a result of the}} toxic dust. There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and {{governor}} of Taiyuan during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused {{in part by}} the Sui failure to conquer {{the northern part of the}} Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Emperor Gong of Sui. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.|$|E
5|$|Moses {{also made}} {{improvements}} to the park itself, building new walkways, paving dirt roads, creating playgrounds, and installing lights. Baseball, soccer, and cricket fields were added in 1938. The Van Cortlandt Stadium was added in 1939 {{on the site of}} a former swamp, and a pool followed in 1970. Moses also landscaped the areas near the Woodlawn and 242nd Street subway stations to attract park visitors from other neighborhoods. During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Moses took aggressive approach to preserving the park's quality. For instance, six <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> issued court summonses in 1942 after letting their children dig in the park, and two airplane pilots were fined in 1947 for unauthorized airplane landings.|$|E
5|$|Porto Alegre {{assumed the}} command of the Brazilian army in Uruguaiana on 21 August 1865. From the very beginning, he had an acrimonious {{relationship}} with Brazil's allies Bartolomé Mitre, president of Argentina, and Venancio Flores, president of Uruguay, who led the armies of their respective nations. The years had not lessened Porto Alegre's prejudice against Hispanic-Americans; on the contrary, his antagonism had increased. On 2 September, Flores suggested an immediate attack on Uruguaiana, an option rejected by Porto Alegre and Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then Viscount and later Marquis of Tamandaré), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian navy. Tamandaré was a first cousin of Porto Alegre; their <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> sisters. When Flores claimed that he could defeat the Paraguayan army alone, he was mocked by both Brazilian officers.|$|E

5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E
5|$|The typical Han-era Chinese {{household}} {{contained a}} nuclear family {{with an average}} of four to five members, unlike in later dynasties when multiple generations and extended family members commonly lived in the same household. Families were patrilineal, which made the father the supreme head of the house. Arranged marriages were the norm, while a new wife was expected to join the clan of her husband. Having sons over daughters was considered extremely important for the sake of carrying on ancestor worship. Although girls and women were expected by custom and Confucian tradition to behave passively towards their male relatives, <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> given a familial status above that of their sons. Women also engaged in various professions in and outside of the home and were given protection under the law. The empress was superior in status to the male relatives of her consort clan, while the mother of the emperor—the empress dowager—had the authority to override his decisions and choose his successor (if one had not been appointed before his death).|$|E
5|$|When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George's {{first cousin}} (their <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> sisters), was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British {{government}} offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening {{conditions for the}} British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George {{to think that the}} presence of the Romanovs would be seen as inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was GeorgeV who opposed the idea against the advice of the government. Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by MI1, a branch of the British secret service, but because of the strengthening position of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were murdered by Bolsheviks in 1918. The following year, Nicholas's mother (George's aunt) Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) {{and other members of the}} extended Russian imperial family were rescued from the Crimea by a British warship.|$|E
