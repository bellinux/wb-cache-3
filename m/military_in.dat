5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men.

Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since {{the creation of the}} American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by the <b>military</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation.
