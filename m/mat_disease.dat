40|$|Little {{information}} is available on coral diseases in the Persian Gulf; however, in the recent years, reports of coral diseases increased in particular from Iranian side of the Persian Gulf. In this paper we report a White <b>Mat</b> <b>Disease</b> resulting in mass mortality of Porites colonies at Hormuz Island. This outbreak infected 96 % of all Porites colonies and killed 58 ± 30 % (mean ± SD) of all Porites tissues...|$|E
40|$|Roseofilum reptotaenium is a gliding, filamentous, phycoerythrin-rich {{cyanobacterium}} {{that has}} been found only in the horizontally migrating, pathogenic microbial <b>mat,</b> black band <b>disease</b> (BBD) on Caribbean corals. R. reptotaenium dominates the BBD mat in terms of biomass and motility, and the filaments form the mat fabric. This cyanobacterium produces the cyanotoxin microcystin, predominately MC-LR, and can tolerate high levels of sulfide produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) that are also associated with BBD. Laboratory cultures of R. reptotaenium infect coral fragments, suggesting that the cyanobacterium is the primary pathogen of BBD, but since this species cannot grow axenically and Koch’s Postulates cannot be fulfilled, it cannot be proposed as a primary pathogen. However, R. reptotaenium does play several major pathogenic roles in this polymicrobial disease. Here, we {{provide an overview of}} the ecology of this coral pathogen and present new information on R. reptotaenium ecophysiology, including roles in the infection process, chemotactic and other motility responses, and the effect of pH on growth and motility. Additionally, we show, using metabolomics, that exposure of the BBD microbial community to the cyanotoxin MC-LR affects community metabolite profiles, in particular those associated with nucleic acid biosynthesis...|$|R
