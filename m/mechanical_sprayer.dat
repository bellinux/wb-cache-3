2500|$|A {{pressure}} washer {{is a high}} pressure <b>mechanical</b> <b>sprayer</b> {{that can be used}} to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles, and concrete road surfaces. Frank Ofeldt in the United States invented the steam {{pressure washer}} or [...] "high-pressure Jenny" [...] in 1927.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common forms of {{pesticide}} application, especially in conventional agriculture, is the use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>sprayers.</b> Hydraulic sprayers consists of a tank, a pump, a lance (for single nozzles) or boom, and a nozzle (or multiple nozzles). Sprayers convert a pesticide formulation, often containing a mixture of water (or another liquid chemical carrier, such as fertilizer) and chemical, into droplets, which can be large rain-type drops or tiny almost-invisible particles. This conversion is accomplished by forcing the spray mixture through a spray nozzle under pressure. The size of droplets can be altered through the use of different nozzle sizes, or by altering the pressure under which it is forced, or a combination of both. Large droplets have the advantage of being less susceptible to spray drift, but require more water per unit of land covered. Due to static electricity, small droplets are able to maximize contact with a target organism, but very still wind conditions are required.|$|R
50|$|The chassis for the {{vehicles}} in the 1930s, were assembled in County Cork and collected by the firm's mechanics. The Clonmel factory was the largest such establishment in the South of Ireland {{at the time and}} one of the most modernly equipped factories in the country. The first <b>mechanical</b> paint <b>sprayer</b> outside Dublin and Cork was installed at O'Gormans. The factory was renowned for its strict discipline. O'Gorman Brothers were the Ford Motor Company main dealers for all County Tipperary, Waterford City and portion of County Waterford. A number of O'Gorman Brothers single decker buses were built for Irish Omnibus Company. Several of them are listed in 1932 and 1934, on the Classic Irish Buses website.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{pesticide}} applicators {{constitute a}} unique pesticide use group. Aerial, mechanical-ground, and focal weed control by application of herbicides, in particular chlorophenoxy herbicides, yield diverse exposure scenarios. In the present work, we analyzed aberrations in G-banded chromosomes, reproductive hormone levels, and polymerase chain reaction-based V(D) J rearrangement frequencies in applicators whose exposures were mostly limited to chlorophenoxy herbicides. Data from appliers where chlorophenoxy use was less frequent were also examined. The biomarker outcome data {{were compared to}} urinary levels of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) obtained {{at the time of}} maximum 2, 4 -D use. Further comparisons of outcome data were made to the total volume of herbicides applied during the entire pesticide-use season. Twenty-four applicators and 15 minimally exposed foresters (control) subjects were studied. Categorized by applicator method, men who used a hand-held, backpack sprayer in their applications showed the highest average level (453. 6 ppb) of 2, 4 -D in urine. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) values were correlated with urinary 2, 4 -D levels, but follicle-stimulating hormone and free and total testosterone were not. At the height of the application season; 6 / 7 backpack sprayers, 3 / 4 applicators who used multinozzle <b>mechanical</b> (boom) <b>sprayers,</b> 4 / 8 aerial applicators, and 2 / 5 skidder-radiar...|$|R
