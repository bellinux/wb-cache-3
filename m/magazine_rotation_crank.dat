50|$|A {{slider-crank}} linkage is a four-bar linkage {{with three}} revolute joints and one prismatic, or sliding, joint.

50|$|Assuming {{the crank}} {{rotational}} speed to be constant, {{this means the}} reciprocating movement of a piston is faster on the top half than on {{the bottom half of}} the <b>crank</b> <b>rotation.</b> Consequently, the inertia force created by the mass of a piston (in its acceleration and deceleration) is stronger in the top half of <b>crank</b> <b>rotation</b> than on the bottom half.|$|R

50|$|Because the small-end {{position}} {{is lower than}} the half-way point of the stroke at 90 degrees and at 270 degrees after TDC, the piston moves less distance when the crank rotates from 90 degrees to 270 degrees after TDC than during the <b>crank</b> <b>rotation</b> from 90 degrees before TDC to 90 degrees after TDC. In other words, a piston must travel a longer distance in its reciprocal movement on {{the top half of the}} <b>crank</b> <b>rotation</b> than on the bottom half.|$|R
50|$|The {{proportions}} {{of each of}} the links in the mechanism are defined to optimize the linearity of the foot for one-half of the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>crank.</b> The remaining <b>rotation</b> of the <b>crank</b> allows the foot to be raised to a predetermined height before returning to the starting position and repeating the cycle. Two of these linkages coupled together at the crank and one-half cycle out of phase with each other will allow the frame of a vehicle to travel parallel to the ground.|$|R

This paper {{presents}} the high-speed ultrasonic testing methods for steel pipes currently, and points the existing difficulties, {{such as the}} instability in signal transmission, the problem of water coupling, and so on. Then the inspection method based on linear reciprocating probes is proposed to achieve the purpose of fewer probes and higher detecting speed. The mathematics model which adopts the slider-crank mechanism to realize the probes swinging fast in line is established as there is blind spot between the adjacent probes in high-speed inspection. With the help of simulation of Matlab, the relation curve between the <b>rotation</b> speed of <b>crank</b> and the <b>rotation</b> angle of <b>crank</b> is acquired, {{as well as the}} line speed of the steel pipe and the <b>rotation</b> angle of <b>crank.</b> The experiment platform is set up according to the simulation data, and the results verify the feasibility of the method...|$|R

50|$|Compared {{to three}} and four {{cylinder}} designs, a major advantage in 4-stroke format is the overlap in power stroke, where the combustion at every 144° of <b>crank</b> <b>rotation</b> ensures a continuous driving torque, which, while not as much noticeable at high rpm, translates to a much smoother idle.|$|R

40|$|During {{the recent}} era of arthroscopic surgery, many {{distinct}} shoulder pathologies {{such as the}} superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesion have been identified. The unfortunate fact of arthroscopy {{is that it is}} invasive and extremely costly. There are clinical examinations that aid in the diagnosis of SLAP lesions, but they are not considered stand-alone diagnoses like arthroscopy. Therefore, it is beneficial to improve the overall accuracy of the current clinical tests used to diagnose SLAP lesions. Of the existing tests, 10 are meant to actively engage the long head of the biceps brachii (LHBB) to create tension in the biceps tendon. The tension in the LHBB elicits pain and/or apprehension in the superior glenoid region, a positive sign of superior labral pathology. Eleven male subjects with no history of shoulder pathology were recruited to participate in the study. Their average age was 25 years. Each subject was subjected to 10 provocative tests for SLAP lesions. The ten tests were: Active Compression, Anterior Slide, Biceps Load, Biceps Load II, Compression <b>Rotation,</b> <b>Crank,</b> Pronated Load, Resisted Supination External Rotation, Speed 2 ̆ 7 s and Supination Sign test. Each test was performed three times in a random order. During the tests electromyography (EMG) of seven muscles surrounding the shoulder was monitored (Noraxon Telemyo 900, 1250 Hz). The muscles monitored included: long and short head of biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, infraspinatus, and supraspinatus. Six of the muscles were monitored with surface electrodes while the supraspinatus was monitored using an indwelling electrode. Maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were used to normalize the EMG data among subjects. The variables analyzed from the EMG data were LHBB activation (...|$|R
50|$|A {{four-stroke}} {{spark-ignition engine}} is an Otto cycle engine. It consists of following four strokes: suction or intake stroke, compression stroke, expansion or power stroke, exhaust stroke. Each stroke consists of 180 degree rotation of crankshaft rotation and hence a four-stroke cycle is completed through 720 degree of <b>crank</b> <b>rotation.</b> Thus for one complete cycle {{there is only}} one power stroke while the crankshaft turns by two revolutions.|$|R
40|$|A novel geared {{infinitely}} variable transmission (IVT) that can generate a continuous output-to-input speed ratio from zero to a certain value is developed and analyzed. The principle of changing the output-to-input speed ratio {{is to use a}} crank-slider mechanism; the output-to-input speed ratio is controlled by adjusting the crank length. Since the crank-slider mechanism can lead to relatively large variation of the output-to-input speed ratio in one <b>rotation</b> of the <b>crank,</b> the instantaneous input and output speeds and accelerations have variations and the corresponding forces exerted on each part of the IVT can have obvious changes in one <b>rotation</b> of the <b>crank.</b> Since forces on some parts of the IVT are critical and can cause failure of the IVT for vehicle and wind turbine applications, a dynamic analysis of the IVT is necessary to simulate the input and output speeds and accelerations. A method that combines Lagrangian dynamics and Newtonian dynamics is developed here to analyze the motion of the IVT. The dynamic analysis results can be used to evaluate the current design of the IVT...|$|R
50|$|Boxer engines tend to {{be better}} {{balanced}} than other four-cylinder configurations. The more common inline-four configuration suffers from a secondary balance problem caused {{by the fact that}} the pistons travel faster on the top half of the <b>crank</b> <b>rotation</b> than the bottom half, which causes the engine to vibrate up and down twice per <b>crank</b> <b>rotation</b> for a total of four times per crankshaft revolution for ordinary up-down-down-up crank throws. This problem becomes worse with increased piston speed and weight, effectively limiting the capacity of these engines. Inline-fours larger than 2.0 L usually have balance shafts whilst engines over 3.0 L are seldom used in passenger cars. In contrast, the flat-four has much less secondary imbalance at the expense of larger rocking vibrations, that cause it to rotate back and forth around a vertical axis. This is because the cylinders cannot be directly opposed, but must be offset so the connecting rods can be on separate crank pins, which results in the forces being slightly off-centre. The rocking vibration is usually not serious enough to require balance shafts.|$|R
25|$|The {{wheel is}} usually {{similar to a}} bicycle wheel with a special hub {{designed}} so the axle is a fixed part of the hub.

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of flat-four boxer configuration is its requirement for long exhaust pipes merging the exhaust from those exhaust ports located on opposing banks {{in order to}} achieve evenly spaced exhaust pulse. In a four stroke engine, each cylinder creates an exhaust pulse every 720 degrees of <b>crank</b> <b>rotation,</b> {{and they need to be}} paired with another pulse that is 360 crank degrees offset in a four-cylinder configuration to achieve an even scavenging of exhaust gas in the cylinders, which is needed for uniform filling of intake and uniform combustion.|$|R
50|$|In most {{reciprocating}} piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder {{by the same}} port. The complete engine cycle occupies one <b>rotation</b> of the <b>crank</b> and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events - admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, {{of which there are}} many types.|$|R
50|$|The {{vibration}} {{caused by}} this inertia force (or {{the difference of}} its strength between {{the top and bottom}} half of <b>crank</b> <b>rotation)</b> is small at lower engine speed, but it grows with the increase in crank rotational speed squared, making it a major problem in high-revving engines. Inline 4, inline 6 and 90° V8 engines with flat-plane crankshaft move two pistons always in synch, making the imbalance twice as large (and a half as frequent) as in other configurations that move all pistons in different, evenly spaced, reciprocal phases (e.g. Crossplane inline-four and crossplane V8).|$|R
