5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E

Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, in his speech said that, by giving the prize to Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to encourage attention on achievements of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> on the women's perspective, and on the fight against poverty.|$|E
5|$|The House of Seljuk was {{a branch}} of the Kınık Oğuz Turks who resided on the {{periphery}} of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> in the Yabgu Khaganate of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the Caspian and Aral Seas, in the 9th century. In the 10th century, the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into Persia, which became the administrative core of the Great Seljuk Empire, after its foundation by Tughril.|$|E

5|$|Another {{work from}} Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume {{encyclopedia}} about herbal medicine {{written in the}} middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the medieval <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> had {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), {{each with its}} own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, a preference for the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, was supported by the Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, they launched a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (also a time of civil war in the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world),</b> a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Led by Enver Pasha, a coup in Turkey in 1913 sidelined Sultan Mehmed V and {{concentrated}} {{power in the}} hands of a junta. Despite the secular nature of the new government, Turkey retained its traditional influence over the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world.</b> Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled the Muslim holy city of Mecca throughout the war. The Sultan's title of Caliph was recognised as legitimate by most Muslims, including those in Afghanistan and India.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from the Quran to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning philosophy of materialism as unsound to human origins and a denial of Allah. Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the Western world.|$|E
50|$|Abu Mashar Sindhi was <b>Muslim</b> <b>world’s</b> noted {{scholar of}} Seerah and Fiqh. He lived at Medina {{for a number}} of years and later shifted to Baghdad where he died. He was a very {{respected}} figure and in fact, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mahdi led his funeral prayers.|$|R

5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany {{in taking}} aim at the {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires in the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world.</b> Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim jihad. His hope was to provoke and aid a vast Muslim revolution, particularly in India. Translations of the proclamation were sent to Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, the proclamation {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Sharia (or Islamic law), {{the primary}} source of law in modern Saudi Arabia, was {{developed}} gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries. From the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century, the developing Sharia was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> including the Arabian peninsula, and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant for some time, and, for instance, was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} {{occurred at a}} time of unusually strained relations between the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world</b> and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries. The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests {{in a wide variety of}} local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.|$|E
5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008).

He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world,</b> and how Muslim countries can benefit from them in order to consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the <b>Muslim</b> <b>world.</b> Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
