This research is done in PT Air Mancur. This location research is selected on purpose because PT Air Mancur is a factory that processing plant medicine becomes an herb product more than 40 years, this company doesn’t pay attention for feasibility analysis if economic age of <b>machines</b> finished, and data that needed for this research is available. Based on infestations criteria Pay Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are know that all of investation alternatives and feasible to do. But then, the infestation alternative for buy for new Filling and Packaging Sachet <b>Machine,</b> Honey Liquid Filler <b>Machine,</b> Auto strip Packaging <b>Machine,</b> Coding <b>Machine</b> Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 <b>Machine,</b> Filling Sachet <b>Machine,</b> Honey Stick <b>Machine,</b> Coding <b>Machine,</b> Tank and Mixer <b>Machine,</b> Conveyor <b>Machine,</b> and Gear and Pump Brand <b>Machine</b> is the best alternative. This decision is taken based on value of infestation criteria NPV and PI for buying new <b>machine</b> alternative is more than value infestation criteria NPV and PI for repairing <b>machine</b> alternative.

5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for <b>machining</b> internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for <b>machining</b> other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of these many allotropes makes <b>machining</b> plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has <b>machining</b> characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable β (beta) form at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision <b>machining</b> properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during <b>machining.</b> The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} <b>machining</b> is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E

5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for <b>machining</b> ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed <b>machining,</b> leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools.

Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for <b>machining</b> ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed <b>machining,</b> leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{is not as}} hard as some {{grades of}} {{heat-treated}} steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. <b>Machining</b> requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used.

Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E

5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC <b>machining</b> or by using electrical discharge <b>machining</b> processes.|$|E

5|$|Those {{materials}} are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even {{higher than that}} of diamond. Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond.
