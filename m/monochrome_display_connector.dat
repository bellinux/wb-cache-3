5000|$|Simultaneously announced, The <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> and Printer Adapter (MDPA), often {{shortened}} to <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> Adapter (MDA), {{which did}} not support pixel-addressable graphics of any sort, offered a high-quality 80x25 character mode, having a relatively high pixel-resolution of 720x350 (character box size 9x14), {{that could be used}} on a monochrome monitor (originally, specifically the IBM 5151 Personal Computer Display).|$|R

40|$|In {{diagnostic}} radiology, medical-grade <b>monochrome</b> <b>displays</b> {{are usually}} recommended {{because of their}} higher luminance. Standard color displays {{can be used as}} a less expensive alternative, but have a lower luminance. The aim of the present study was to compare image quality for these two types of displays. Images of a CDRAD contrast-detail phantom were read by four radiologists using a 2 -megapixel (MP) color display (143  cd/m 2 maximum luminance) as well as 2 -MP (295  cd/m 2) and 3 -MP <b>monochrome</b> <b>displays.</b> Thirty lumbar spine radiographs were also read by four radiologists using the color and the 2 -MP <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> in a visual grading analysis (VGA). Very small differences were found between the displays when reading the CDRAD images. The VGA scores were − 0. 28 for the color and − 0. 25 for the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 24; NS). It thus seems possible to use color displays in diagnostic radiology provided that grayscale adjustment is used...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> Adapter (MDA, also MDA card, <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> and Printer Adapter, MDPA) is IBM's {{standard}} {{video display}} card and computer display {{standard for the}} PC introduced in 1981. The MDA {{does not have any}} pixel-addressable graphics modes. It has only a single monochrome text mode (PC video mode 7), which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.|$|R

50|$|Like the IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> Adapter it {{improved}} on, the Hercules Graphics Card {{had both}} a parallel printer port {{and a video}} output port.|$|R
50|$|It only {{produced}} green colors {{because it}} used P39 phosphor. IBM designed its MDA <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> system to deliver extremely well-formed characters for the time. The monitor {{was meant to}} be hooked up to an IBM <b>Monochrome</b> <b>Display</b> Adapter which had no graphics modes at all, and only supported the 80 x 25 text mode, using 9 x 14 pixels per character. The Hercules Graphics Card had its resolution designed around this monitor, allowing cheap high-resolution PC graphics, and some people also used 5151 monitors with EGA boards for their mono modes.|$|R

50|$|All the Visual Workstations {{supported}} conventional CRT {{monitors and}} had VGA <b>display</b> <b>connectors.</b> As the 230 330, and 550 models used Nvidia Quadro cards they also supported DVI. The SGI 320 and 540 models shipped with the groundbreaking and stylistically matched 1600SW LCD display, using an OpenLDI <b>display</b> <b>connector</b> that required an accessory flat panel adapter. The SGI O2 also supported the 1600SW with an adapter.|$|R

50|$|The Educator 64 was {{not sold}} in great numbers. It {{suffered}} from its <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> - many 64 titles assumed {{the availability of}} color. And, by that time, the US education market was firmly in Apple's grasp.|$|R
50|$|Like most Nokia's phones, {{users can}} {{customize}} the case easily {{from its original}} colors: blue or orange mixed with silver and black. The 5210 is only Nokia phone with orange backlight unlike other Nokia models with <b>monochrome</b> <b>display.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Nokia 3410 is {{a mobile}} phone made by Nokia which was {{released}} in early 2002, being the successor of the Nokia 3310. The 3410 was the first Java phone by Nokia. The phone features a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display.</b>|$|R

50|$|At {{that time}} a typical desktop {{computer}} {{such as an}} early IBM Personal Computer might have 1/8 of a megabyte of memory (128K), 1/4 of a million pixels (640x400 <b>monochrome</b> <b>display),</b> and run at 0.33 million instructions per second (5Mhz 8088).|$|R
50|$|The Apple II {{video output}} {{is really a}} <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> based upon the bit {{patterns}} in the video memory (or pixels). These pixels are combined in quadrature with the colorburst signal to be interpreted as color by a composite video display.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{monochrome}} video adapter {{memory area}} ran from 704 to 736 KiB (0xB0000-0xB7FFF). If only a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> adapter was used, the address space between 0xA0000 and 0xAFFFF {{could be used}} for RAM, which would be contiguous with the conventional memory.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conductive}} {{qualities and}} standards-compliance of connecting cables, circuitry and equipment can also alter the electrical signal at any {{stage in the}} signal flow. (A partially inserted VGA connector {{can result in a}} <b>monochrome</b> <b>display,</b> for example, as some pins are not connected.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to the use}} of {{different}} address mappings for different modes, it is possible to have a monochrome adapter (i.e. MDA or Hercules) and a color adapter such as the VGA, EGA, or CGA installed in the same machine. At the beginning of the 1980s, this was typically used to display Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets in high-resolution text on a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> and associated graphics on a low-resolution CGA display simultaneously. Many programmers also used such a setup with the <b>monochrome</b> card <b>displaying</b> debugging information while a program ran in graphics mode on the other card. Several debuggers, like Borland's Turbo Debugger, D86 (by Alan J. Cox) and Microsoft's CodeView could work in a dual monitor setup. Either Turbo Debugger or CodeView could be used to debug Windows. There were also DOS device drivers such as ox.sys, which implemented a serial interface simulation on the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> and, for example, allowed the user to receive crash messages from debugging versions of Windows without using an actual serial terminal. It is also possible to use the [...] "MODE MONO" [...] command at the DOS prompt to redirect the output to the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display.</b> When a <b>monochrome</b> adapter was not present, it was possible to use the 0xB000-0xB7FF address space as additional memory for other programs (for example by adding the line [...] "DEVICE=EMM386.EXE I=B000-B7FF" [...] into config.sys, this memory would be made available to programs that can be [...] "loaded high", that is loaded into high memory.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Nokia 5510 is {{a mobile}} phone {{announced}} on October 11, 2001. The Nokia 5510 features a full QWERTY keyboard, an 84 x 48 <b>monochrome</b> <b>display,</b> and is notable for its digital music player. It has a 64 MB memory for storing audio files.|$|R
50|$|The {{flag bit}} in each byte affects colour by {{shifting}} pixels half a pixel-width to the right. This half-pixel shift was exploited by some graphics software, such as HRCG (High-Resolution Character Generator), an Apple utility that displayed text using the high-resolution graphics mode, to smooth diagonals. (Many Apple II users had <b>monochrome</b> <b>displays,</b> or {{turned down the}} saturation on their colour displays when running software that expected a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display,</b> so this technique was useful.) Although it did not provide a way to address subpixels individually, it did allow positioning of pixels at fractional pixel locations and can thus be considered a form of subpixel rendering. However, this technique {{is not related to}} LCD subpixel rendering as described in this article.|$|R
5000|$|Although it cited {{flaws in}} the {{hardware}} and software, BYTE called the Hercules Graphics Card [...] "a fine product" [...] that gave owners of monochrome monitors graphics capability. PC Magazine reported successfully running CGA-compatible games on a <b>monochrome</b> <b>display,</b> and using the card with a Columbia MPC.|$|R

50|$|The Virtual Boy from Nintendo was {{released}} in 1995 {{as one of the}} first consumer consoles providing 3D depth perception, but did not achieve high sales, largely due to the <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> and the lack of third-party support. In 1996 the Virtual Boy was taken off the market.|$|R

50|$|Because small {{devices such}} as {{cellular}} phones have hardware restrictions such as lower memory, low-power CPUs with limited or no storage capabilities, small <b>monochrome</b> <b>display</b> screens, single-character fonts and restricted input methods (the absence of a keyboard or a mouse), {{there is a need}} for a simpler form of HTML.|$|R
