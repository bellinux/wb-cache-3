25|$|In {{the years}} after the line's construction, {{increased}} subway ridership led to longer trains, and thus longer platforms, in the 1940s and early 1950s. The City Hall station, built on a tight curve, {{would have been difficult}} to lengthen, and it was also quite close to the far busier Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station. In addition, the new, longer trains had center doors in each car, which were an unsafe distance from the platform edge. <b>Movable</b> <b>platform</b> extensions were installed to fill the gap similar to the ones at the South Ferry, Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall (which no longer has gap fillers), Times Square, and 14th Street–Union Square stations, which had a similar problem.|$|E

She performed the song on a <b>movable</b> <b>platform</b> while wearing a floor-length gown covered with red LED lights. Neil McCormick of The Telegraph, {{in a review}} of one of the tour's concerts, said: [...] "She kicked off with the homicidal pop-rock ballad Russian Roulette to screen imagery of burning naked mannequins and had shed most of her clothes by her second song...". Later the track was excluded from the setlist for the Australian leg of the tour, together with [...] "Rehab", and was replaced with [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] as the tour starter. English singer George Michael covered [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] during his orchestral concert tour, titled the Symphonica Tour (2011—12).|$|E

2500|$|The organ at The Church of St. Paul the Apostle is M.P. Möller Pipe Organ Company's Opus 9987, {{built in}} 1965. With 4,965 pipes, the {{instrument}} has 4 manuals (keyboards), 83 ranks, and 78 stops. Twelve of the stops {{are made up}} of pipework from the church's previous instrument, E.M. Skinner Opus 544, built in 1925. The organ speaks from two different parts of the room, giving the effect of two instruments in one. At the front of the sanctuary, with large pedal towers that surround the high altar, sits the main organ. Perched on the south wall of the sanctuary is the nave organ. Both organs are playable from one French-style console, built by the Peragallo Pipe Organ Company in 2000, which rests on a <b>movable</b> <b>platform.</b> Visitors from around the world have experienced the sound of this instrument in the sanctuary's famously reverberant acoustic. Renowned organist Virgil Fox recorded The Christmas Album on the Möller Organ in 1965.|$|E

60|$|This queen Nitocris {{seems to}} have been quite {{distinguished}} for her engineering and architectural plans. It was she that built the bridge across the Euphrates, within the city; and as there was a feeling of jealousy and ill will, as usual in such a case, between the two divisions of the town which the river formed, she caused the bridge to be constructed with a <b>movable</b> <b>platform</b> or draw, by means of which the communication might be cut off at pleasure. This draw was generally up at night and down by day.|$|E
60|$|The pier of the Euterpe was not {{far from}} the great Long Island and New Jersey Bridge, and Roland Clewe, when he reached the broad {{sidewalk}} which ran along the river-front, walked rapidly towards the bridge. When he came to it he stepped into one of the elevators, which were placed at intervals along its sides from the waterfront to the far-distant point where it touched the land, and in company with a dozen other pedestrians speedily rose {{to the top of the}} bridge, on which moved two great platforms or floors, one always keeping on its way to the east, and the other to the west. The floor of the elevator detached itself from the rest of the structure and kept company with the <b>movable</b> <b>platform</b> until all of its passengers had stepped on to the latter, when it returned with such persons as wished to descend at that point.|$|E
60|$|The Studio was a {{large and}} lofty room, lighted by a skylight, and running {{along the side of}} the house {{throughout}} its whole depth. Its walls were covered with plain brown paper, and its floor was only carpeted in the middle. The most prominent pieces of furniture were two large easels placed at either extremity of the room; each supporting a picture of considerable size, covered over for the present with a pair of sheets which looked woefully in want of washing. There was a painting-stand with quantities of shallow little drawers, some too full to open, others, again, too full to shut; there was a <b>movable</b> <b>platform</b> to put sitters on, covered with red cloth much disguised in dust; there was a small square table of new deal, and a large round table of dilapidated rosewood, both laden with sketch-books, portfolios, dog's-eared sheets of drawing paper, tin pots, scattered brushes, palette-knives, rags variously defiled by paint and oil, pencils, chalks, port-crayons--the whole smelling powerfully at all points of turpentine.|$|E

50|$|An {{extensively}} used {{technique in}} The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was an enhancement of this principle {{which could be}} used in moving shots. Portions of sets were mounted on <b>movable</b> <b>platforms</b> which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera, so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times {{for the duration of the}} shot. The same techniques were used in the Harry Potter movies to make the character Hagrid look like a giant.

50|$|Type 12, another {{land-based}} early-warning system, followed during 1942. It {{was similar}} to its predecessor but lighter in weight (about 6,000 kg) and on a <b>movable</b> <b>platform.</b> Three versions were made; they operated at either 2.0 m (150 MHz) or 1.5 m (200 MHz), each with a peak-power of only 5 kW. The lower power significantly reduced the range. About 50 sets of all versions of these systems were built.|$|E

The cars would be purchased using $190 million from the Transportation Bond Act voters approved in November 1979. Advantages of the car {{were the same as}} in the R44 and R46 orders—fewer subway cars of longer length can make up a 510-foot train and reducing operating and maintenance costs; however, drawbacks identified for these cars included not lining up with the <b>movable</b> <b>platforms</b> at 14th Street–Union Square, and not fitting tight curves, such as at South Ferry. After paying consultant Louis T. Klauder and Associates $894,312 to evaluate the merits of the 63-foot car, the plans were dropped.|$|R
