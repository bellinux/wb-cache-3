5|$|By 1998, Kelley had rejoined and <b>Macpherson</b> {{had left}} the group, and by 2000 Lerma and Farley had also left. The Breeders, with a line-up {{including}} the Deal sisters and new members Mando Lopez and Jose Medeles, released the albums Title TK in 2002 and Mountain Battles in 2008. Meanwhile, <b>Macpherson</b> {{was a member of}} Guided by Voices from 1998 to 2001, and participated in other projects with Guided By Voices' Robert Pollard until 2005. Lerma and Farley have been members of the Tasties, and in 1999 participated in Pollard's Lexo and the Leapers side project group; Farley was also a member of Guided by Voices from 1999 to 2004. In 2013, the Last Splash-era Breeders line-up of Kim and Kelley Deal, <b>Macpherson,</b> and Wiggs reunited to tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that album.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} {{her mother had}} died, and Bryher had {{divorced}} her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth <b>Macpherson.</b> H.D., Bryher, and <b>Macpherson</b> lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet and critic Barbara Guest termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and <b>Macpherson</b> adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and <b>Macpherson</b> set up the magazine Close Up (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, Borderline (1930), which featured H.D. and Paul Robeson in the lead roles. In common with the Borderline novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states {{and their relationship to}} surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in Close Up.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Melbourne in Australia in 1903, but {{was brought up in}} New Zealand. He was educated at Winchester College, where they did not play rugby, and then went to Oxford University. It was at Oxford that he was persuaded to play rugby by GPS <b>Macpherson.</b> Up until then he had only played {{association}} football. <b>Macpherson</b> captained Oxford when Smith played in the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1923 – Smith scored two tries in Oxford's victory.|$|E
5000|$|The Mackintoshes later {{claimed that}} the <b>Macphersons</b> were coaxed into the battle by a man from Clan Mackintosh who turned up at the Macphersons’ camp pretending to be from Clan Cameron and calling the <b>Macphersons</b> cowards. The <b>Macphersons</b> then {{attacked}} the Camerons’ camp, making a dreadful slaughter of them—even killing Charles MacGilony, the Camerons' top archer—at a place now called Charles’s Valley (in Gaelic Coire Thearlaich).|$|R

5000|$|The Chattan Confederation forces {{consisted}} of the Mackintoshes, Davidsons and <b>Macphersons.</b> As {{a result of a}} disagreement as to whether the Davidsons or <b>Macphersons</b> would occupy the right wing, which was the post of honour, the <b>Macphersons</b> withdrew in disgust from the army. The combined Clan Chattan had outnumbered the Camerons but with the loss of the <b>Macphersons</b> the Camerons now had the greater number. The battle resulted in a defeat for the remaining Clan Chattan forces. It is said that an ally of Cameron known as Charles MacGilony led the clan into battle; he is believed to have changed the outcome of the day with his uncanny ability as an archer.|$|R

5|$|From the {{formation}} of the Breeders in 1989 until the mid-1990s, the line-up changed several times. Vocalist and songwriter Kim Deal was the band's sole consistent member. The line-up that recorded the group's debut Pod (released in 1990) included guitarist Tanya Donelly and drummer Britt Walford; they were replaced by Deal's sister Kelley and Jim <b>Macpherson</b> by the time the band's 1993 album Last Splash was recorded. Kelley Deal and original bassist Josephine Wiggs left in 1995. Kim Deal formed the Amps that year, but reformed the Breeders in 1996—initially using the Amps' line-up: Deal (vocals), <b>Macpherson</b> (drums), Luis Lerma (bass), and Nate Farley (guitar).|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Breeders {{released}} {{their second}} album, Last Splash. At this time, the group’s line-up consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim <b>Macpherson</b> on drums. Last Splash went {{silver in the}} United Kingdom, gold in Canada, and platinum in the United States. The group toured extensively and participated in Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs decided to pursue other musical projects. <b>Macpherson</b> continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, {{and then in the}} 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' line-ups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and <b>Macpherson</b> rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.|$|E

50|$|In 1370 the Battle of Invernahavon {{took place}} between the Chattan Confederation and the Clan Cameron. There was a dispute between the <b>Macphersons</b> and another clan of the confederation, the Clan Davidson over who should take the right wing in the battle. The Clan Mackintosh, whose chiefs were also chiefs of the Chattan Confederation favored the Davidsons {{and as a result}} the <b>Macphersons</b> left the field of battle. The Clan Cameron took {{advantage}} of this situation and gained the upper hand, however the <b>Macphersons</b> were eventually coerced back into the battle and the Camerons were defeated. The feud between the Clan Cameron and Chattan Confederation continued for many years after and in 1396 the Battle of the North Inch took place, which was watched by Robert III of Scotland and his whole court.|$|R

5|$|It soon {{becomes clear}} that <b>MacPherson</b> is being poisoned. Nikola {{believes}} that Brandt is responsible, because of his recent disappearances, but is proven wrong. After <b>MacPherson</b> dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay. The squad continues the war, and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, the Hegemony denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{played a}} total of 32 Tests for Scotland, and scored 24 tries, which still gives him {{a share of the}} Scottish record with Tony Stanger. Smith's record for {{international}} tries was not beaten until 1987 when it was overtaken by Australian David Campese. Remarkably, Smith's first 17 tries were scored in only 14 Test matches. His 24 career tries in the Five Nations – now Six Nations – remained a record until first equalled and then surpassed by Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll in 2011. Smith spent much of his playing career playing in the backline with GPS Macpherson; 21 of Smith's 24 Scotland tries were scored outside the three-quarter <b>Macpherson.</b> When Smith scored four tries against France in 1925, <b>Macpherson</b> contributed to all those scores.|$|E
