25|$|Because RC4 is {{a stream}} cipher, {{it is more}} {{malleable}} than common block ciphers.

25|$|The HTTP {{scheme was}} {{designed}} by Phillip Hallam-Baker at CERN in 1993 and does not incorporate subsequent improvements in authentication systems, such as the development of keyed-hash <b>message</b> <b>authentication</b> code (HMAC). Although the cryptographic construction that is used {{is based on the}} MD5 hash function, collision attacks were in 2004 generally believed to not affect applications where the plaintext (i.e. password) is not known. However, claims in 2006 cause some doubt over other MD5 applications as well. So far, however, MD5 collision attacks have not been shown to pose a threat to digest authentication, and the RFC 2617 allows servers to implement mechanisms to detect some collision and replay attacks.|$|E
25|$|PGP {{supports}} <b>message</b> <b>authentication</b> {{and integrity}} checking. The latter {{is used to}} detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former {{to determine whether it}} was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.|$|E

In {{order to}} resolve the message safety problem in {{vehicular}} ad hoc networks (VANET) and improve traffic efficiency, a privacy-preserving and scalable scheme was proposed for VANET <b>messages</b> <b>authentication,</b> in which identity (ID) -based signcryption was used to help vehicles to secretly receive a secret member key from an RSU, and then the vehicles can anonymously send messages {{on behalf of the}} group.

Each record has a content type field that designates the type of data encapsulated, a length field and a TLS version field. The data encapsulated may be control or procedural messages of the TLS itself, or simply the application data needed to be transferred by TLS. The specifications (cipher suite, keys etc.) required to exchange application data by TLS, are agreed upon in the [...] "TLS handshake" [...] between the client requesting the data and the server responding to requests.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} zero-distortion {{authentication}} watermarking to produces a watermarked signal. With the same decoder, the watermarked signal {{has the same}} quality as the original one. To this end, the scheme replaces the original signal with its equivalence so as to embed <b>authentication</b> <b>message.</b> We employ this concept to authenticate palette images by regulating the palette. Because the visual appearance of the watermarked image is not modified, {{there is no need}} to reconstruct the original image at all. We also employ the idea to provide the software integrity protection by re-arranging the software instructions or modules to embed the <b>authentication</b> <b>message.</b> Because the software control flow and data flow remain unchanged,the watermarked software is equivalent to the original software.
