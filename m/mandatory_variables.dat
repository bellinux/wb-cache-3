40|$|Variable {{selection}} and estimation for high-dimensional data {{have become a}} topic of foremost importance in modern Statistics. This is largely driven {{by the need to}} analyze massive data sets due to recent technological advancements (Fan and Li, 2006; Yu, 2007). For instance, bioengineering innovations have presented new statistical challenges by introducing functional MRI and gene microarray data. In many of these applications, we wish to achieve better prediction accuracy and allow easier interpretability by reducing the number of variables to obtain a parsimonious or sparse model. In this thesis, we study and propose several new methodologies for regression and variable selection under high-dimensionality. ^ In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we propose the weighted fusion, a new penalized regression and variable selection method for data with correlated variables. The weighted fusion can potentially incorporate information redundancy among correlated variables for estimation and variable selection. Weighted fusion is also useful when the number of predictors p is larger than the number of observations n. It allows the selection of more than n variables in a motivated way. Real data and simulation examples show that weighted fusion can improve variable {{selection and}} prediction accuracy. ^ In the second part of the thesis, we propose the covariance-thresholded lasso. Covariance-thresholded lasso presents as an important marriage of covariance-regularization and penalized regression methods to allow better variable selection and prediction accuracy for high-dimensional data. Covariance-thresholded lasso improves upon excessive variability and rank deficiency of the sample covariance matrix of the lasso by utilizing covariance sparsity. In high-dimensions, where many predictors are independent or weakly correlated, covariance sparsity is a natural assumption. Real-data and simulation examples indicate that our method can be very useful in improving performances. ^ In the third part of the thesis, we propose the ridge-lasso hybrid estimator (ridle), a new penalized regression method that simultaneously estimates coefficients of mandatory predictors while allowing selection for others. The ridle is useful when some predictors are known to be significant due to prior knowledge or must be kept for additional analysis. Further, we propose the adaptive ridle, for use when good initial estimates are available. Through theoretical studies, we show that the ridle and adaptive ridle can improve variable selection for regression with <b>mandatory</b> <b>variables.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis is {{the most}} common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder affecting elderly Australians and is a leading cause of lower limb total joint replacement (TJR). The incidence of TJR has risen substantially over the past two decades, reflecting the ageing population, and increases in the prevalence of risk factors such as obesity. Primary TJR is considered to be relatively safe with low rates of adverse outcomes, however, there is increasing evidence that elderly, and male patients who undergo the procedure may be at higher risk for postoperative complications and mortality. The retrospective cohort studies presented in this thesis used data, drawn from Health In Men Study (HIMS), that were linked with Western Australia (WA) linked data system to assess risk and outcomes of primary TJR in a large population-based cohort of men. The studies closely examined three issues - obesity, co-morbidities, and smoking - about which there is continuing debate in regard to their association with the risk of undergoing the procedure, and their roles as determinants of outcome of TJR. These risk factors are particularly important because they are amenable to modification. Objectives: The main objectives of this thesis were: 1. To validate WA hospital morbidity data (HMD) and to assess the performance of HMD-based co-morbidity adjustment methods in predicting mortality among men undergoing elective primary TJR. 2. To assess risk of undergoing elective primary TJR in elderly men. 3. To assess risk of adverse outcomes following elective primary TJR including: • in-hospital complications, • prolonged length of stay in hospital (LOS), • all-cause readmission, and • short- and long-term mortality. 4. To assess the role of obesity in predicting postoperative complications following TJR. Methods: The electronic records of 12, 203 men from HIMS were linked with WA HMD, Cancer Registry, Mental Health Services System and mortality records. Linkage with hospital morbidity data was done to identify TJR, in-hospital complications, LOS, and readmission in the target population. Significant morbidity was retrieved from HMD in the period 1970 - 2007. Multivariable analyses including logistic, Cox proportional hazards, and competing risk regressions were undertaken to assess study outcomes. Main findings: • WA HMD are more likely to identify major co-morbidities and major operations with relatively high sensitivities and positive predictive values than co-morbidities of a less serious nature. • Co-morbidity as recorded in HMD, irrespective of method used to measure it, independently increased risk of adverse outcomes. Model discrimination of 5 -year mortality following TJR improved by 13 % when HMD-based Deyo-Charlson index (Deyo-CI) was added to the baseline model that only accounted for age (Harrell's C: 0. 69 for baseline model vs. 0. 78 for model including age and Deyo-CI). • A dose-response relationship between both weight and smoking, and risk of TJR was observed. Being overweight independently increased the risk, while smoking lowered it. Engaging in vigorous exercise and having a high socioeconomic status were associated with higher risk of TJR. • Of the 819 men who had had elective TJR, 331 (40. 4 %) developed an in-hospital complication of which 155 were major. Weight, co-morbidity, and minor complications independently predicted major complications. Any in-hospital complications significantly increased risk of short- and long-term mortality. Similarly, weight was independently associated with 5 -year mortality following TJR. • Length of stay in hospital was significantly longer in the overweight or obese and those who had had a total knee replacement [TKR] (compared with total hip replacement [THR]) and these two groups {{were more likely to be}} readmitted. All-cause readmission was also significantly high among the socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. • All-cause 90 -day and 1 -year readmission following TJR independently increased risk of postoperative 5 -year mortality. • Augmenting HMD with actual weight and height significantly improved the model fit when predicting major in-hospital complications following TJR. Conclusions:  HMD-based co-morbidity adjustment methods (Deyo-Charlson, Enhanced-Charlson or Elixhauser) significantly improve HMD-based predictive models and are appropriate in epidemiological research.  Compared to men with normal weight, the obese are at higher risk of undergoing elective TJR and are more likely to develop major complications, stay longer in hospital and be readmitted following the procedure.  Adding minimal information to routinely collected HMD improves the latter's predictive ability.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} profiling {{is moving}} from the research setting to the practical clinical use. Gene signatures able to correctly identify high risk breast cancer patients {{as well as to}} predict response to treatment are currently under intense investigation. While technical issues dealing with RNA preparation, choice of array platforms, statistical analytical tools are taken into account, the tissue collection process is seldom considered. The time elapsed between surgical tissue removal and freezing of samples for biological characterizations is rarely well defined and/or recorded even for recently stored samples, despite the publications of standard operating procedures for biological sample collection for tissue banks. Methods Breast cancer samples from 11 patients were collected immediately after surgical removal and subdivided into aliquots. One was immediately frozen and the others were maintained at room temperature for respectively 2, 6 and 24 hrs. RNA was extracted and gene expression profile was determined using cDNA arrays. Phosphoprotein profiles were studied in parallel. Results Delayed freezing affected the RNA quality only in 3 samples, which were not subjected to gene profiling. In the 8 breast cancer cases with apparently intact RNA also in sample aliquots frozen at delayed times, 461 genes were modulated simply as a function of freezing timing. Some of these genes were included in gene signatures biologically and clinically relevant for breast cancer. Delayed freezing also affected detection of phosphoproteins, whose pattern may be crucial for clinical decision on target-directed drugs. Conclusion Time elapsed between surgery and freezing of samples appears to have a strong impact and should be considered as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>variable</b> to control for clinical implications of inadequate tissue handling. </p...|$|R

40|$|Several {{previous}} studies of exposure to chromium waste in New Jersey have shown that Cr levels are elevated in household dust in homes adjacent to waste sites and that Cr levels in the urine of residents near sites are also elevated compared to control populations. It has not been possible until now, however, to examine these external and internal measures of exposure together in a large population {{to determine whether the}} external exposure is predictive of the internal exposure. We investigated the relationship between various adjusted and unadjusted measures of spot urine Cr concentration and household dust Cr from residents and residences adjacent to known Cr waste sites. Statistically significant bivariate relationships were found between log-transformed urine Cr concentration and Cr dust concentration (micrograms of Cr per gram of dust) but not Cr dust loading (nanogram Cr per square centimeter). Log-transformed urine concentration was used as the dependent variable in multiple regression analysis of the total population (n = 329), the population [less than/equal to] 10 years old (n = 67), and the population > 10 years old (n = 262), with Cr dust concentration as a <b>mandatory</b> independent <b>variable.</b> Other potential direct influences on urine Cr were investigated as potential confounders of this relationship. In the final models for the entire population and those [less than/equal to] 10 years old, but not for those > 10 years old, Cr dust concentration remained significant.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} baseline characteristics, management and outcome in real life ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] cohorts from a gender perspective. We aimed to evaluate the total STEMI population as well as certain subgroups, such as the youngest. Moreover we aimed to analyse gender differences in renal function, and the prognostic impact of reduced renal function in {{men and women with}} STEMI. In Paper I all STEMI patients registered in RIKS-HIA between 1 st Jan 1995 and 31 st Dec 2006 were included, in total 54 146 patients, 35 % women. Women were 7 years older than men, with 30 min longer median symptomto-door time. They had higher prevalence of co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart failure whereas men were more often smokers, had a previous myocardial infarction [MI] or were previously revascularised. During hospital care, fewer women than men, 63 % vs. 72 %, p 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2). In total 67 % of women compared to 27 % of men were classified as having renal insufficiency [RI] (eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) and female sex was a strong independent factor associated with RI, OR 5. 06 (95 % CI 2. 66 – 9. 59). Reduced eGFR per 10 mL/min decline was independently associated to higher risk of death and MACE (death, new MI or stroke) within one year in women whereas we found no such associations in men. There was a borderline significant interaction between gender and eGFR regarding one year mortality (p= 0. 08) but not regarding MACE (p= 0. 11). As we found a remarkable gender difference in RI prevalence in Paper  IV, we analysed an updated SWEDEHEART database including the years since S-creatinine became a <b>mandatory</b> <b>variable</b> to register. In Paper V all STEMI patients registered between 1 st of Jan 2003 and 31 st of Dec 2009 were included, in total 37 991 patients (36 % women). RI was present in 38 % in women vs. 19 % in men according to MDRD and in 50 % of men vs. 22 % of men according to Cockcroft Gault [CG] (p< 0. 001 for both comparisons). Female gender was independently associated with RI regardless of used formula. In both genders, RI patients were older, had higher co-morbidity, suffered from more complications and had lower chance of receiving reperfusion therapy and evidence-based therapy at discharge compared to non RI patients. Among both RI and non RI patients, men had significantly higher chance than women of getting these therapies. In-hospital mortality was four to five times higher in RI vs. non RI patients. RI compared to non RI patients had approximately doubled risk of inhospital mortality in women and 2. 5 times higher risk in men after multivariable adjustment. Regardless of used formula, the risk of dying at hospital increased with approximately 30 % and the risk of long term mortality with approximately 10 % in both genders per 10 mL/min decline of eGFR. There was no significant interaction between gender and eGFR regarding short- or long term outcome according to any of the formulas. Women had twice as high in-hospital and also higher cumulative long term mortality than men. After multivariable adjustments including all confounders except kidney function women had 7 % lower risk of long term mortality but still 11 % higher risk of in-hospital mortality. If eGFR according to any of the formulas was also included, there was no longer a gender difference regarding in-hospital mortality and women had lower risk of long term mortality. This was also the case if only adjusting for eGFR according to CG. Conclusion: In the real life STEMI setting, women were older with higher co-morbidity, longer delay, more complications and twice as high in-hospital mortality. They had significantly less chance of receiving acute reperfusion therapy, also after adjusting for possible confounders. During the fibrinolytic era women had higher risk of severe bleedings. We hypothesised that the gap in management would have decreased during the new primary PCI era, with a less time-dependent regime with less risk of fatal complications. Our hypothesis failed, and future studies ought to further scrutinise this gender difference in management. The less chance of reperfusion therapy did anyhow not explain the higher in-hospital mortality in women, which was 10 - 20 % higher after multivariable adjustments, consistent with previous findings. Moderate to severe chronic kidney disease was very common in women with STEMI, 50 % according to the Cockcroft Gault formula. Estimated GFR has seldom been taken into account in studies evaluating gender differences in outcome. If adjustment for eGFR was done, alone or added to the all other co-variates, women had no longer higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Adjusted long term outcome was better in women than in men, which was also the case in the youngest cohort when studied separately...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{questions}} in statistical genomics can be formulated {{in terms of}} variable selection of candidate biological factors for modeling a trait or quantity of interest. Often, in these applications, additional covariates describing clinical, demographical or experimental effects must be included a priori as mandatory covariates while allowing {{the selection of a}} large number of candidate or optional variables. As genomic studies routinely require mandatory covariates, it is of interest to propose principled methods of variable selection that can incorporate mandatory covariates. Methods In this article, we propose the ridge-lasso hybrid estimator (ridle), a new penalized regression method that simultaneously estimates coefficients of mandatory covariates while allowing selection for others. The ridle provides a principled approach to mitigate effects of multicollinearity among the mandatory covariates and possible dependency between <b>mandatory</b> and optional <b>variables.</b> We provide detailed empirical and theoretical studies to evaluate our method. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm for the ridle. Software, based on efficient Fortran code with R-language wrappers, is publicly and freely available at [URL]. Results The ridle is useful when mandatory predictors are known to be significant due to prior knowledge or must be kept for additional analysis. Both theoretical and comprehensive simulation studies have shown that the ridle to be advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves. A microarray gene expression analysis of the histologic grades of breast cancer has identified 24 genes, in which 2 genes are selected only by the ridle among current methods and found to be associated with tumor grade. Conclusions In this article, we proposed the ridle as a principled sparse regression method for the selection of optional <b>variables</b> while incorporating <b>mandatory</b> ones.

Following the success of the Pilot, smart motorways are being rolled-out to other sections of Highways England’s strategic road network. This research has been carried out to understand the performance of smart motorways and its limiting factors. A review of the concept of highways capacity was carried out to understand the parameters that influence traffic conditions during smart motorway operations. This was followed by a series of analysis using empirical data which examined the performance of existing smart motorways schemes on the M 42 and M 6 motorways near Birmingham, UK. Overall, smart motorway schemes have significantly reduced average journey times and journey time variability, improved motorway capacity and smoothed traffic flow. The level of benefits observed varied from one scheme to another mainly due to the different site conditions (road geometry, traffic demand and patterns). However, each scheme consistently demonstrated considerable improvements when compared to non-smart motorway conditions. One of the aims of smart motorways is to improve the distribution of traffic between lanes. Examination of the data showed that hard shoulder utilisation increased with traffic demand, however, it was potentially underutilised and influenced by the proportion of traffic leaving at the next junction. A multivariate analysis was carried out to establish a model which described motorway capacity during smart motorway operations using various traffic parameters. The findings from this research can be applied to assist in the application of smart motorways both in and outside of the UK, to reduce wasted time for commuters, business trips and freight movement. It is recommended that the study is taken further with the newly introduced smart motorway schemes, which will include additional parameters such as local physical characteristics of the road (e. g. width, gradient, curvature) and the operation of All Lane Running...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Routinely {{collected}} data such as hospital morbidity data (HMD) are increasingly used in studying clinical outcomes among patients undergoing total joint replacement (TJR). These data {{are readily available}} and cover large populations. However, since these data were not originally collected {{for the purpose of}} health research, a rigorous assessment of their quality is required. We assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of obesity in HMD and evaluated whether the augmentation of HMD with actual weight and height of patients could improve their ability to predict major in-hospital complications following total joint replacement in men. Methods The electronic records of 857 participants in the Health In Men Study (HIMS) who had had TJR were linked with Western Australia HMD. HMD-recorded diagnosis of obesity was validated using the actual weight and height obtained from HIMS. In-hospital major complications were modelled using multivariable logistic regressions that either included the actual weight and height or HMD-recorded obesity. Model discrimination was calculated using area under ROC curve. Results The HMD failed to detect 70 % of the obese patients. Only 64 patients (7. 5 %) were recorded in HMD as obese although 216 (25 %) were obese [BMI: ≥ 30 kg/m 2] (sensitivity: 0. 2, positive predictive value: 0. 7). Overall, 174 patients (20 %) developed an in-hospital major complication which was significantly higher in the overweight and obese comparing with patients with normal weight.

The {{electronic}} {{version of}} this article is the complete one and can be found online at: [URL] Routinely collected data such as hospital morbidity data (HMD) are increasingly used in studying clinical outcomes among patients undergoing total joint replacement (TJR). These data are readily available and cover large populations. However, since these data were not originally collected for the purpose of health research, a rigorous assessment of their quality is required. We assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of obesity in HMD and evaluated whether the augmentation of HMD with actual weight and height of patients could improve their ability to predict major in-hospital complications following total joint replacement in men. METHODS: The electronic records of 857 participants in the Health In Men Study (HIMS) who had had TJR were linked with Western Australia HMD. HMD-recorded diagnosis of obesity was validated using the actual weight and height obtained from HIMS. In-hospital major complications were modelled using multivariable logistic regressions that either included the actual weight and height or HMD-recorded obesity. Model discrimination was calculated using area under ROC curve. RESULTS: The HMD failed to detect 70 % of the obese patients. Only 64 patients (7. 5 %) were recorded in HMD as obese although 216 (25 %) were obese [BMI: ≥ 30 kg/m 2] (sensitivity: 0. 2, positive predictive value: 0. 7). Overall, 174 patients (20 %) developed an in-hospital major complication which was significantly higher in the overweight and obese comparing with patients with normal weight. HMD-recorded obesity was not independently associated with major complications, whereas a dose-response relationship between weight and these complications was observed (P= 0. 004). Using the actual weight and height of the participants instead of HMD-recorded diagnosis of obesity improved model discrimination by 9 %, with areas under ROC curve of: 0. 69, 95 % CI: 0. 64 - 0. 73 for the model with HMD-recorded obesity compared with 0. 75, 95 % CI: 0. 70 - 0. 79 for the model with actual weight and height, P< 0. 001. CONCLUSION: Body weight is an important risk factor for in-hospital complications in patients undergoing TJR. HMD systems do not include weight and height as variables whose recording is mandatory. Augmenting HMD with patients' weight and height may improve prediction of major complications following TJR.
