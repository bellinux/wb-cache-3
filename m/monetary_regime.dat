5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new <b>monetary</b> <b>regime</b> with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

50|$|For {{more than}} three decades, this <b>monetary</b> <b>regime</b> {{successfully}} faced many shocks. However, {{the extent of the}} external debt crisis unleashed in 1981, the adjustments necessary to bring an unbalanced economy back into equilibrium, fiscal pressures, unbridled inflation and, above all, the need to reorder the whole economy to return to a more appropriate growth path, made yet more drastic changes necessary. To this end, in May 1992, the government issued the Law of <b>Monetary</b> <b>Regime</b> and State Bank, whereby the Central Bank of Ecuador was able to intervene in the financial system through open market operations. With this powerful instrument of policy, it has been possible to control inflation, unprecedented in the monetary history of Ecuador. Additionally, the need for new commitments for public sector austerity forced to violate the power to grant credit to the Treasury. Finally, {{in order to protect the}} interests of customers of the banking system, the Central Bank of Ecuador was authorized to operate as a lender of last resort, within strict financial parameters. It is clear now that the primary commitment of an institution of issue is to ensure price stability and external viability.|$|E

50|$|Ireland is {{an example}} of a country in which, in recent years, the {{progressive}} income tax system has allowed government revenues to swell due to both nominal and real fiscal drag without either increases in the tax rates or decreases in the thresholds.

Whereas others attribute to the economic and educational policies of the Irish government, in subsidizing education and eliminating taxation of the arts, two historically low-income demographics that would thus respond strongly to an increase in income, resulting in price inflation and thus wage inflation to retain purchasing power parity.|$|E

50|$|By {{consideration}} {{financial crisis}} one key {{difference is the}} <b>monetary</b> <b>regime.</b> In the 19th century it occurred under the fixed exchange rates of the gold standard. But in the 20th century it {{took place in a}} regime of managed flexibility. Furthermore, in the 19th century countries had developed effective lenders of last resort, but the same was not true at the periphery and countries there suffered the consequences. A century later there was a domestic safety net in most emerging countries so that banking panics were changed into situations where the debts of an insolvent banking system were taken over by the government. The recovery from banking crisis is another key difference. It has tended to begin earlier in the recent period than in the typical crisis episode a hundred years ago. In the 19th century there were no international rescue packages available to emerging economies. But in the recent period such rescues were a typical component of the financial landscape all over the world.|$|E

This consists of the tasks of everyday existence—food preparation, laundry, and so forth—that maintain the worker and his or her ability to work. Since roughly the 16th century, much of this domestic labor has been made the responsibility of women, through various developments put in motion by powerful institutions in the transition period from feudalism to capitalism. Adding to the process of social degradation of women in that period was the devaluation of the reproduction of labor. As Silvia Federici notes, [...] "In the new <b>monetary</b> <b>regime,</b> only production-for-market was defined as value-creating activity, whereas the reproduction of the worker began to be considered as valueless from an economic viewpoint and even ceased to be considered as work". Thus it is of particular interest in feminist economics. For example, it was reported in 1988 that the paid work done by both men and women outside the home in West Germany totalled 55,000 million hours a year, earning them a total of $335 billion; but housework done by women inside the home totalled 53,000 million hours a year, which earned them no salary at all.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} a growing {{consensus}} has emerged for price stability as the overriding, long-run goal of monetary policy.

40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} examines {{an imaginary}} <b>monetary</b> <b>regime</b> {{in which the}} private provision of global public goods that reduce greenhouse gases ("emissions reducers," e. g., forests) is enhanced and the public goods are held {{in the private sector}} as monetary assets. We consider a <b>monetary</b> <b>regime</b> where the government or the central bank makes public goods a means of payment by committing itself to conversion of emissions reducer into cash (and probably by adopting appropriate banking regulations). Using a simple cash-in-advance setting, we show that the <b>monetary</b> <b>regime</b> internalizes the externality of public goods by endowing them with a private function as a means of payment. In the <b>monetary</b> <b>regime,</b> private agents buy and hold emissions reducers voluntarily, and the government need not impose caps on emissions nor pay any costs for public goods provision. Moreover, in an economic boom when greenhouse gas emissions increase, emissions reducers may also increase automatically. Due to the network externalities of money, emissions reducers may become used as money internationally and thus the international free-rider problem may be mitigated. Our results imply that the <b>monetary</b> <b>regime</b> may be a promising extension of existing policy plans for global warming. ...|$|E
