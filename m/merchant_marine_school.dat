5000|$|In 1942, {{the federal}} {{government}} purchased 10 acre of land on Coyote Point for one of three <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Cadet Basic <b>schools,</b> the Pacific Coast Cadet Corps (the other two were for the Atlantic Coast Cadet Corps at Kings Point, New York and the Gulf Coast Cadet Corps at Pass Christian, Mississippi). The <b>merchant</b> <b>marine</b> training program had been shortened from 48 to 18 months, in three stages: ...|$|R
50|$|Fort Trumbull {{served as}} the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Officers Training <b>School</b> from 1939 to 1946 and trained most of the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> {{officers}} who served during the Second World War. One of the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> officers trained there was actor Jack Lord, who {{is best known for}} playing Steve McGarrett on the popular TV series Hawaii Five-O in the 1960s and 70s. The Fort was the site of a satellite campus of the University of Connecticut from 1946 to 1950, educating war veterans attending college under the GI Bill.|$|R
50|$|The main building, or Escola de Oficiais da Marinha Mercante (<b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Officers' <b>School)</b> has an orthogonal, {{longitudinal}} {{plan with}} principal entrance in the centre, from which expand two wings destined for {{classes in the}} west and east. This structure is three to four floors and a third oriented to the south (of two-storeys), used for support services offices. Circulation occurs across ample corridors, with adequate capacity, and by staircases with two flights, located on the extremes of the corridors. There are also two elevators alongside the atrium that serves the five floors of the building.|$|R
50|$|After the {{surrender}} of the Japanese, the 1st Division was given responsibility for occupying the entire city of Tokyo and the adjacent parts of Tokyo and Saitama Prefectures. The command posts of the 1st Brigade, 5th Cavalry and 12th Cavalry were situated at Camp McGill at Otawa, approximately 20 mi south of Yokohama. The 2nd Brigade maintained its command post at the Imperial Guard Headquarters Buildings in Tokyo, while the 7th Cavalry was situated at the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>School.</b> The 8th Cavalry occupied the 3rd Imperial Guard Regiment Barracks in Tokyo, which provided greater proximity to security missions at the American and Russian Embassies and the Imperial Palace grounds. Division Headquarters and other units were stationed at Camp Drake near Tokyo.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, the Portuguese President, Américo Thomaz, promulgated Decree 43245 (18 October), {{recognizing}} {{the need to}} provide decent <b>schools</b> for the <b>merchant</b> <b>marine,</b> a preparatory <b>school</b> for nautical officials and schools for mechanics; there was a need for training to support sailors to officers. It was considered advantageous that these schools be constructed on the same site, justifying the construction of the Infante D. Henrique Nautical School.|$|R
50|$|Fort Trumbull {{served as}} the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Officers' Training <b>School</b> from 1939 to 1946, {{providing}} officers for merchant ships carrying troops and supplies overseas. The fort was also a sonar laboratory during the war, hosting part of Columbia University's Division of War Research, {{with many of the}} offices built inside the stone fort. After the war this activity remained at Fort Trumbull as the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory.|$|R
5000|$|The Pacific Coast <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Cadet Basic <b>School</b> {{had started}} aboard the ex-riverboat Delta Queen on 1 July 1941; {{enrollment}} quickly outgrew the ship, {{and the school}} moved to land-based facilities on Treasure Island. With the outbreak of war, enrollment exceeded the capacity of facilities on Treasure Island and [...] was appropriated to enlarge the school in May 1942. Plans were swiftly drawn up by Cdr. Ralph M. Sheaf, and construction began on the facilities at Coyote Point on June 25, 1942. The Basic School opened on August 15, 1942 and was officially dedicated on August 21, 1943 with a capacity of 528 cadets.|$|R
50|$|World War II {{required}} the Academy to forgo its normal operation and to devote {{all of its}} resources toward meeting the emergency need for <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> officers. Its enrollment rose to 2,700 men, and the planned course of instruction was reduced in length from four years to 18 months. To meet the wartime needs for qualified <b>merchant</b> <b>marine</b> officers two additional <b>merchant</b> <b>marine</b> cadet training <b>school</b> sites were established, one located in Pass Christian, Mississippi, {{and the other in}} San Mateo, California. (The San Mateo location was closed in September 1947, and the students transferred to Kings Point. The location in Pass Christian was similarly closed in 1950.) In spite of the war, shipboard training continued to {{be an integral part of}} the Academy curriculum, and midshipmen served at sea in combat zones the world over. One hundred and forty-two midshipmen gave their lives in service to their country, and many others survived torpedo and aerial attacks. From 1942-1945, the Academy graduated 6,895 officers. As the war drew to a close, plans were made to convert the Academy's wartime curriculum to a four-year, college-level program to meet the peacetime requirements of the <b>merchant</b> <b>marine.</b> In 1948, such a course was instituted.|$|R
50|$|Since the First World War and World War II, many <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> {{officers}} have also held commissions in the United States Naval Reserve. Graduates of the U.S. <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Academy are commissioned into the USNR by default {{if they do}} not choose to be commissioned in another service of the armed forces. A special badge, known as the Naval Reserve <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Badge, has existed since the early 1940s to recognize such <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> personnel who are called to active duty in the Navy. World War II USMM were eligible for the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Distinguished Service Medal, <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Mariner's Medal, <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Combat Bar, <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Atlantic War Zone Bar, <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Mediterranean-Middle East War Zone Bar, and <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Pacific War Zone Bar. In 1946, a <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> World War II Victory Medal was established.|$|R

50|$|Several {{military}} installations {{have been part}} of New London's history, including the United States Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard Station New London. Most of these {{military installations}} have been located at Fort Trumbull. The first Fort Trumbull was an earthwork built 1775-1777 that took part in the Revolutionary War. The second Fort Trumbull was built 1839-1852 and still stands. By 1910, the fort's defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the Endicott Program, primarily located on Fishers Island. The fort was turned over to the Revenue Cutter Service and became the Revenue Cutter Academy. The Revenue Cutter Service was merged into the United States Coast Guard in 1915, and the Academy relocated to its current site in 1932. During World War II, the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Marine</b> Officers Training <b>School</b> was located at Fort Trumbull. From 1950 to 1990, Fort Trumbull was the location for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory, which developed sonar and related systems for US Navy submarines. In 1990, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the Naval Underwater Systems Center in Newport, Rhode Island, and the New London facility was closed in 1996.|$|R
