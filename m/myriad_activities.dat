6000|$|Coming {{out of the}} theatre, {{we found}} it utterly {{impossible}} to get a taxicab; and, though it was raining slightly, walked through Leicester Square {{in the hope of}} picking one up as it returned down Piccadilly. Numbers of hansoms and four-wheelers passed, or stood by the curb, hailing us feebly, or not even attempting to attract our attention, but every taxi seemed to have its load. At Piccadilly Circus, losing patience, we beckoned to a four-wheeler and resigned ourselves to a long, slow journey.

[...] But gradually the steady patter of the horse's hoofs, the rattling of the windows, the slow thudding of the wheels, pressed on us so drowsily that when, at last, we reached home we were more than half asleep. The fare was two shillings, and, standing in the lamplight to make sure the coin was a half-crown before handing it to the driver, we happened to look up. This cabman appeared to be a man of about sixty, with a long, thin face, whose chin and drooping grey moustaches seemed in permanent repose on the up-turned collar of his old blue overcoat. But the remarkable features of his face were the two furrows down his cheeks, so deep and hollow that it seemed as though that face were a collection of bones without coherent flesh, among which the eyes were sunk back so far that they had lost their lustre. He sat quite motionless, gazing at the tail of his horse. And, almost unconsciously, one added the rest of one's silver to that half-crown. He took the coins without speaking; but, as we were turning into the garden gate, we heard him say: ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} school {{leadership from}} two perspectives, {{both of which}} provide a context to the process.

The second draws international comparisons and contrasts between these networks in selected Western and Asian communities {{with the purpose of}} illustrating cross-cultural differences. Two important themes underpin the argument presented. The first is that leadership is best thought of — not as a separate or discrete set of processes — but in relation to the <b>myriad</b> <b>activities</b> that take place in school communities. Leadership, above all, is interactive and interdependent. The second is that much of the existing body of knowledge on school leadership is based on Anglo-American ideas and empiricism. Consequently, relatively little is known about school leadership elsewhere in the world. This second theme centers on leadership being an essentially social and cultural process...|$|E
