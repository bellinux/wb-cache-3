25|$|Depending on geology {{and soil}} type, pump and treat {{may be a}} good method to quickly reduce high {{concentrations}} of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support <b>microbial</b> <b>degradation</b> of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide).|$|E

However, the effects of dispersants on oil biodegradation rates are debated. In laboratory experiments, we simulated environmental conditions comparable to the hydrocarbon-rich, 1, 100 m deep plume that formed during the Deepwater Horizon discharge. The presence of dispersant significantly altered the microbial community composition through selection for potential dispersant-degrading Colwellia, which also bloomed in situ in Gulf deep waters during the discharge. In contrast, oil addition to deepwater samples in the absence of dispersant stimulated growth of natural hydrocarbon-degrading Marinobacter. In these deepwater microcosm experiments, dispersants did not enhance heterotrophic microbial activity or hydrocarbon oxidation rates. An experiment with surface seawater from an anthropogenically derived oil slick corroborated the deepwater microcosm results as inhibition of hydrocarbon turnover was observed in the presence of dispersants, suggesting that the microcosm findings are broadly applicable across marine habitats. Extrapolating this comprehensive dataset to real world scenarios questions whether dispersants stimulate <b>microbial</b> oil <b>degradation</b> in deep ocean waters and instead highlights that dispersants can exert a negative effect on <b>microbial</b> hydrocarbon <b>degradation</b> rates...|$|R
40|$|Two {{synthetic}} wastewaters, with mean NH 4 {{concentrations of}} 471 ± 19 and 475 ± 17 mg/L, were treated in six planted columns. Under steady hydraulic and pollutant loading, average NH 4 removal rate in each column {{was in the}} range of 21 - 47 g/m 2 d, while average TN removal rate was 0 - 27 g/m 2 d. In general, higher redox potential values benefitted ammonia removal but limited TN removal. The supply of organic carbon, by adding glucose into the synthetic wastewater, slightly reduced the rate of ammonia removal, but significantly enhanced TN removal. The seeding of microorganisms using diluted activated sludge, and submerging the columns with treated effluent for three days per week, intensified microbial activities; oxygen consumption reached 53 - 363 gO 2 /m 2 d due to <b>microbial</b> <b>degradations</b> of organics and nitrogen.

30|$|Composting {{requires}} oxygen for aerobic activity, although {{too much}} aeration {{can lead to}} excessive cooling, which inhibits the thermophilic condition required for optimum decomposition. However, too little aeration can lead to anaerobic conditions. The optimum aeration rate provides sufficient oxygen for aerobic decomposition. The aeration flow rate affects <b>microbial</b> activity, <b>degradation</b> rate and temperature during the composting process (Kuter et al. 1985). For successful composting, factors such as moisture content, C:N ratio, aeration rate, temperature, pH, composting materials and the method used should be appropriately controlled.
