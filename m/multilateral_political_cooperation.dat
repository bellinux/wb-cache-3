40|$|<b>Political</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{between the}} {{different}} races in the Malay Peninsula started in a period following the Second World War. Given the existing challenges of that time, some had succeeded and some {{had come to a}} dead end. The Malays‟ political maturity and openness started with the joint cooperation of Pusat Tenaga Rakyat (PUTERA) with THE All Malayan Council of Joint Action (AMCJA) in 1947. This political tolerance succeeded in giving birth to the People‟s Constitution. However, it was promptly rejected by the British as it was put forward by radical group. Thereafter, another <b>political</b> <b>cooperation,</b> this time of the moderate parties, involving the United Malayan National Organization (UMNO) and Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) gave birth to what is famously called PERIKATAN in 1949. In the run-up to the Independence, there was another failed effort at <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> among the radical groups, known as SOCIALIST FRONT. Eventually, the <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> managed to prove to the British that the Malays and non-Malays can exist together and politically cooperate in order to fulfill their common aspiration of achieving independence.

40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} problems have {{become one of}} the most important international issues. The current Master’s thesis is about international environmental and <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Baltic Sea Region after World War II. The Baltic Sea is surrounded by nine states and the degradation of the marine environment of the Baltic Sea has become a common problem. However, international environmental cooperation depends on many political factors: financial support, international organizations, attitude of states, international law and status of environmental issues in the international arena. The Master’s thesis focuses on different forms of <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> which have influenced international governance in the Baltic Sea area. These forms of <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> include the Cold War political situation, the division between the East and the West, increased cooperation after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Helsinki Commission and the European Union. International environmental <b>cooperation</b> needs appropriate <b>political</b> environment where states around a sea have incentives and will to protect the environment. The Baltic Sea is a good example of international governance of maritime environment...|$|R
