The muscles action before and after the centration has been evaluated according to Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis {{is part of a}} study undertaken by the Post Office to determine criteria for the evaluation of training. In particular the training of operators for switchboards at Auto <b>Manual</b> <b>Centres</b> (AMCs) is investigated. This is done both at AMCs and in training centres known as Wing Schools. The similarilies and differences between the training at AMCs and Wing Schools are discussed, together with a brief outline of the work itself and the recruitment process. The work is considered quasi-repetitive, and includes an element of decision-making. Measures of output exist, which are used by management to determine staffing levels. These measures are considered for the purpose of assessing training effectiveness, which is seen as the core of the problem of evaluating training. However, they are shown to be unsuitable in this role, and a simpler measure of progress is proposed. By activity sampling methods, the existence of activity profiles is shown for experienced operators. The profiles are affected by the traffic mix in the AMC, but are seen as a means of comparing trainees' progress in different locations. Activity sampling observations of trainees compare the effects of practice on live and simulated traffic during their initial training period, and for a further five months of post-training experience. Additionally, comparisons are drawn between successful and unsuccessful trainees. Next, objective tests using partial simulation of call situations are used to compare different methods of studying programmed texts. No difference is found between the methods but a comparison is made also between two different orders of training, wilh positive results. A brief study of costs shows that training in an AMC is Iikely to cost very much less than in a school, but also indicates that improved selection would show financial returns. The principal conclusions are that (a) Common activiy-profiles exist for trained operators within a particular exchange. (b) The profiles can be used in the assessment of training performance. (c) The benefit of training operators for Directory Enquiry work initially and subsequently training for switchboard operation should be given further investigation. (d) Training in an AMC is more cost-effective than at a Wing School. (e) A trainability test should be a useful addition to the present selection procedures...|$|R

Swanbourne Hospital was created consisting of the original 1904 buildings and was established to primarily treat psycho-geriatric patients and adults with developmental disabilities. Graylands Hospital became a reduced site utilising buildings that had {{been built in the}} second phase of building 1910-1911. The earliest buildings being the former X block, the former kitchen (becoming the patient library and Pastoral Centre) and former dining room (becoming Anderson Hall) as well as Gascoyne House. Graylands Hospital became the designated comprehensive psychiatric hospital and consisted of X Block (now Fortescue House), which at the time consisted of Nedlands, Osborne and Palmyra wards and an occupational therapy unit(the 1910-11 wards subsequently renamed), Riverton House (renamed Gascoyne House in 1989), and Shenton (Shaw) and Tuart (Moore) Houses (1966 rehabilitation wards). In 1975 a new creative expression centre (Drysdale House) comprising offices, studios, pottery areas and other work areas was constructed at Graylands Hospital. Today this is known as Creative Expression and Centre for Art Therapy, or CECAT. In 1978 three further buildings were constructed, including a new <b>manual</b> training <b>centre,</b> a new administration block (Ord House) and an intensive therapy unit or secure unit (Wembley House; renamed Ashburton House in 1989).|$|R

Physical morbidity mediated the relationship between anxious attachment and psychological morbidity. Psychological morbidity mediated the relationship between anxious attachment and physical morbidity. The present results expand the literature on attachment by presenting evidence that anxious and avoidant partners experience loneliness differently. Implications for couple’s therapy are addressed.

40|$|Abstract The primary {{objective}} of Workers ‟ Compensation Rehabilitation Centre {{is to provide}} clinical rehabilitation services to patients who have work related injuries. To do this, the centre requires complete rehabilitees ‟ {{data to be transmitted}} from the referrer to the centre as well as across internal departments for the centre. This is because documentation of medical records is a fundamental tool for communication between health professionals. It informs the care provided, treatment, care planned and the outcome of that care as a continuous and contemporaneous record. However, the researcher was not aware of any clinical audit of documented rehabilitees‟ data with respect to compliance with this requirement. This prompted a review of rehabilitees ‟ data for its completeness as a vital initial step towards optimisation of rehabilitees ‟ care pathways. The research method was a non-participatory document review of quota sampled discharged rehabilitees ‟ files using a descriptive and analytical research design. Data were captured using a structured data collection instrument designed and tested by the experts in the medical fraternity. The instrument was designed from information prescribed in internationally referred documents and refined using information prescribed in the Procedures <b>Manual</b> for the <b>centre.</b> Generally, rehabilitees‟ information was incomplete thereby making the referral and review of patients difficult. Clinical template forms in use at the research site had inadequate form fields and this was an important factor which modelled the level of completeness of rehabilitees ‟ information. These inadequate form fields resulted in important facts about th...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{in recent}} {{years there has been}} {{increasing}} demand for more streamlined lodgement of cadastral plans and for their later dissemination. There are a number of approaches to meeting this demand, one of which is developed in detail in this dissertation. The current status of digital lodgement and Digital Cadastral Databases (DCDB) throughout Australia and New Zealand is reviewed. Each of the states and territories in Australia and also New Zealand are examined, looking at the process involved in the lodgement of survey plans and the state of the DCDB in each jurisdiction. From this examination the key issues in digital lodgement and dissemination are extracted and a needs analysis for an Australia-wide generic system is carried out. This needs analysis is directed at technological change allied with sound cadastral principles. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is considered for the storage and transport of all the required data and to facilitate the dissemination of information over the Internet. The benefits of using XML are comprehensive, leading to its selection and the use of related technologies LandXML, Extensible Structured Query Language (XSQL) and Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Vector graphics are introduced as the means to display plans and maps on the Internet. A number of vector standards and Web mapping solutions are compared to determine the most suitable for this project. A new standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), is chosen. A prototype Web interface and the underlying database and Web server were developed using Oracle as the database and Apache as the Web server. Each aspect of the development is described, starting with the installation and configuration of the database, the Web server and the XSQL servlet. Testing was undertaken using LandXML cadastral data and displaying plans using SVG. Both Internet Explorer and Mozilla were trialled as the Web browser, with Mozilla being chosen because of incompatibilities between Internet Explorer, LandXML and SVG. An operational pilot was created. At this stage it requires <b>manual</b> intervention to <b>centre</b> and maximise a plan in the display area. The result indicates that an automated system is feasible and this dissertation provides a basis for further development by Australian land administration organisations...|$|R
