40|$|A 100 -year (1862 – 1961) {{continuous}} {{observation of}} air temperature measurements at the Zagreb-Grič meteorological Observatory has provided {{data for the}} study of <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> of this meteorological element. Data has been analysed in successive mean diurnal air temperature values and in frequencies of certain changes in mean diurnal air temperature. The annual average of <b>interdiurnal</b> air temperature <b>variability</b> (IDVT) at Zagreb-Grič is 1. 76 °C. The main maximum is in January (1. 99) and the secondary ones are in March (1. 87) and June (1. 85). The main minimum is in September (1. 42) and the secondary ones are in February (1. 78) and May (1. 75). The average cooling values from February to November exceed the average warming values, i. e. in about 75 % days in a year. This means that at the Zagreb-Grič Observatory the processes cooling the atmosphere are more intensive than those heating it. The IDVT frequencies have only been considered for January and July, showing an outstandingly narrow interval of IDVT values where all warming frequencies in July (IDVT < 6. 0 °C) are included. As many as 86 % of all heating cases are included in IDVT < 3. 0 °C. The results obtained are compared to analogous results of other authors...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the widely-used international/ Zürich {{sunspot number}} record, R, {{with a view}} to {{quantifying}} a suspected calibration discontinuity around 1945 (which has been termed the “Waldmeier discontinuity” [Svalgaard, 2011]). We compare R against the composite sunspot group data from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) network and the Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON), using both the number of sunspot groups, NsubG, and the total area of the sunspots, AsubG. In addition, we compare R with the recently developed <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> geomagnetic indices IDV and IDV(1 d). In all four cases, linearity of the relationship with R is not assumed and care is taken to ensure that the relationship of each with R is the same before and after the putative calibration change. It is shown the probability that a correction is not needed is of order 10 sup− 8 and that R is indeed too low before 1945. The optimum correction to R for values before 1945 is found to be 11. 6...|$|R
40|$|We present two {{separate}} time {{series of the}} near-Earth heliospheric magnetic field strength (B) based on geomagnetic data and sunspot number (SSN). The geomagnetic-based B series from 1845 - 2013 is a weighted composite of two series that employ the <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> index; this series is highly correlated with in situ spacecraft measurements of B (correlation coefficient, r[*]=[*] 0. 94; mean square error, MSE[*]=[*] 0. 16 nT 2). The SSN-based estimate of B, from 1750 - 2013, is a weighted composite of eight time series derived from {{two separate}} reconstruction methods applied to four different SSN time series, allowing determination of the uncertainty from both the underlying sunspot records and the B-reconstruction methods. The SSN-based composite is highly correlated with direct spacecraft measurements of B and with the composite geomagnetic B time series from 1845 - 2013 (r[*]=[*] 0. 91; MSE[*]=[*] 0. 24 nT 2), demonstrating that B can accurately reconstructed by both geomagnetic and sunspot-based methods. The composite sunspot and geomagnetic B time series, with uncertainties, are provided as supplementary electronic material...|$|R
40|$|Sun: {{activity}} –Sun: rotation The {{interaction between}} differential rotation and magnetic fields inthe solar convection zone was recently modelled by Brun (2004). One consequence of that model {{is that the}} Maxwell stresses can oppose the Reynolds stresses, and thus contribute to the transport of the angular momentum towards the solar poles, leading to areduced differential rotation. So, when magnetic fields are weaker, amore pronounced differential rotation can be expected, yielding ahigher rotation velocity at low latitudes takenonthe average. This hypothesis isconsistent with thebehaviour of thesolar rotationduring the Maunder minimum. In this work we search for similar signatures {{of the relationship between}} the solar activity and rotation determined tracing sunspot groups and coronal bright points. We use the extended Greenwich data set (1878 – 1981) and aseries of full-disc solar images taken at 28. 4 nmwith the EIT instrument on the SOHO spacecraft (1998 – 2000). We investigatethe dependence of thesolar rotationonthe solar activity (describedbythe relative sunspot number) and the interplanetary magnetic field (calculated from the <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> index).

40|$|When {{supplemented}} by absolute reflection height measurements, low frequency wind measurements in the 90 - 100 km height range become truly competitive {{in comparison with}} the more widely used radar meteor wind observations. For example, height profiles of the wind parameters in the so-called meteor zone can be obtained due to the considerable <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> of the average nighttime reflection heights controlled by geomagnetic activity. The phase of the semidiurnal tidal wind is particularly height-dependent. The measured vertical gradient of 1 / 4 h/km in winter corresponds to a vertical wavelength of about 50 km. Wind measurements in the upper atmosphere, at heights between 90 and 100 km, were carried out at the Collm Geophysical Observatory of Karl Marx University Leipzig for a number of years. These measurements use the closely-spaced receiver method and three measuring paths, on 179, 227, and 272 kHz. They take place every day between sunset and sunrise, i. e., nightly. A night in this sense may last as long as 18 hours in winter. Both the measurements and their evaluation are completely automatic, and the prevailing winds and tides are separated...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{constructed}} long-term geomagnetic index, the <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> (the IDV index; defined {{to be the}} unsigned {{difference between}} hourly averages of the H-component of the field near local midnight at a midlatitude station for consecutive days), has the useful property that its yearly averages are highly correlated with the solar wind magnetic field strength (B) and are independent of solar wind speed (V). Existing geomagnetic records allow us to construct IDV since 1890 and thus to determine solar wind B over that period. Once B is known, we use other long-term indices with known dependence on B and V to determine the variation of V since 1890. Average B during 1872 - 2003 was 6. 4 nT with no long-term trend (other than a general correlation with the sunspot number) and average V for the interval 1890 - 2003 was 433 km/s also with no apparent trend. These results are confirmed using polar cap data available from 1926 to the present and magnetic observations of the Amundsen and Scott polar expeditions for years near 1900. Focusing on geomagnetic activity at local midnight hours cleanly separates the EUV-regulated regular variation (SR) of geomagnetic activity from the solar wind driven component, allowing us to determine EUV variability since 1901. Using older data, all these time series might be extended possibly back to th...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSix {{levels of}} {{meteorological}} sensors {{have been deployed}} along a 45 m tower at the French-Italian Concordia station, Dome C, Antarctic. We present measurements of vertical profiles, the diurnal cycle, and <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> of temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction for 3 weeks during the southern summer of 2008. These measurements are compared to 6 -hourly European Center for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses and daily radiosoundings. The ECMWF analyses show a 3 - 4 °C warm bias relative to the tower observations. They reproduce the diurnal cycle of temperature with slightly weaker amplitude and weaker vertical gradients. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle of relative humidity is overestimated by ECMWF because the amplitude of the absolute humidity diurnal cycle is too small. The nighttime surface-based wind shear and Ekman spiral is also not reproduced in the ECMWF analyses. Radiosonde temperatures are biased low relative to the tower observations in the lowest 30 m but approach agreement {{at the top of}} the tower. Prior to bias correction for age-related contamination, radiosonde relative humidities are biased low relative to the tower observations in the lowest 10 m but agree with tower observations above this height. After correction for the age-related bias, the radiosonde relative humidity agrees with tower observations below 10 m but is biased high above this height. Tower temperature observations may also be biased by solar heating, despite radiation shielding and natural ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{analyze the}} widely used international/Zürich sunspot number record, R, {{with a view}} to {{quantifying}} a suspected calibration discontinuity around 1945 (which has been termed the “Waldmeier discontinuity”). We compare R against the composite sunspot group data from the Royal Greenwich Observatory network and the Solar Optical Observing Network, using both the number of sunspot groups, NG, and the total area of the sunspots, AG. In addition, we compare R with the recently developed <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> geomagnetic indices IDV and IDV(1 d). In all four cases, linearity of the relationship with R is not assumed and care is taken to ensure that the relationship of each with R is the same before and after the putative calibration change. It is shown the probability that a correction is not needed is of order 108 and that R is indeed too low before 1945. The optimum correction to R for values before 1945 is found to be 11. 6 %, 11. 7 %, 10. 3 %, and 7. 9 % using AG, NG, IDV, and IDV(1 d), respectively. The optimum value obtained by combining the sunspot group data is 11. 6 % with an uncertainty range 8. 1 – 14. 8 % at the 2 σ level. The geomagnetic indices provide an independent yet less stringent test but do give values that fall within the 2 σ uncertainty band with optimum values are slightly lower than from the sunspot group data. The probability of the correction needed being as large as 20 %, as advocated by Svalgaard (2011), is shown to be 1. 6 × 105. 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the epidemiology, risk factors, {{clinical}} course, and outcomes of ischemic stroke (IS) {{on the basis of}} a 20 -year follow-up of patients in Surgut (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District (KMAD)). Patients and methods. About 9 thousand patients with IS were followed up during the study. The follow-up results obtained in 1990, 2000, and 2012 were compared. The study was conducted in accordance with the procedure described in the Register of Stroke, by using the records of neurological hospitals of the town, its emergency service, urban polyclinics, and forensic medical examination bureau. Results. The incidence of IS significantly increased in Surgut in the examined period: there were about 300 primary and secondary IS cases in 1990; about 600 in 2000, and above 1, 000 in 2012; the increment being nearly 100 % per decade. The rise in the incidence of IS was due to the higher prevalence of its major risk factors: hypertension (by 42 %), atherosclerosis (by 24 %), diabetes mellitus (by 101 %), and cardiac arrhythmia (by 18 %). Major cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis and occlusion were identified in 162 (43. 2 %) of 375 IS cases with their neuroimaging diagnosis. The rate of MCA stenotic lesions was not high, increased with age, and assumed considerable significance in patients over 51 – 55 years of age. There was a seasonal non-uniform pattern of morbidity, its peak (about 70 % of IS) occurred in May-June (this is a spring in the KMAD) when there was a dramatic <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>variability</b> in major meteorological factors. The clinical course of stroke was characterized by relatively favorable outcomes, low mortality rates that declined from 14. 5 % in 1990 to 6. 7 % in 2012, which stemmed from the improved delivery of health care. </p...|$|R
40|$|A WGEN-like four-variate (maximum {{and minimum}} temperature, {{precipitation}} and solar radiation) stochastic daily weather generator Met&Roll {{is used to}} provide synthetic weather series for models simulating crop growth and hydrological regime in present and changed climate conditions. Since impacts of climate change will be largely affected by changes in climate variability and extreme events, present climate models should satisfactorily reproduce both <b>interdiurnal</b> and interannual <b>variability</b> of the weather series and the occurrence of extremes. Three improvements of Met&Roll aiming at a better reproduction of <b>interdiurnal</b> and interannual <b>variability</b> have been introduced: (i) lag- 0 and lag- 1 correlations among solar radiation and daily extreme temperatures are allowed to vary during a year; (ii) a Markov chain of the third order (instead of the first order) is used to model precipitation occurrence; (iii) the synthetic daily weather series is adjusted to fit the series of the monthly means, which is generated using the four-variate first-order autoregressive (AR) model. Model performance regarding the simulation of extreme temperature events is evaluated against observations at 83 stations covering most of Europe. None of the improvements of the generator lead to a generally better reproduction of extreme high and low temperatures (1 day extremes); the basic version of the generator performs best for annual maxima, whereas {{the inclusion of the}} annual cycle of correlations slightly enhances the simulation of annual minima.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{reconstruction}} of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF, B) for 1846 – 2012 with a full analysis of errors, based on the homogeneously constructed IDV(1 d) composite of geomagnetic activity presented in Part 1 (Lockwood et al., 2013 a). Analysis of the dependence of the commonly used geomagnetic indices on solar wind parameters is presented which helps explain why annual <b>means</b> of <b>interdiurnal</b> range data, {{such as the new}} composite, depend only on the IMF with only a very weak influence of the solar wind flow speed. The best results are obtained using a polynomial (rather than a linear) fit of the form B = χ · (IDV(1 d) − β) α with best-fit coefficients χ = 3. 469, β = 1. 393 nT, and α = 0. 420.

40|$|The {{submitted}} {{thesis is}} focused on abrupt day-to-day air temperature drops. The theoretical part describes the meteorological and physical-geographical factors which influence air temperature. Abrupt air temperature drops were ascertained by daily data of maximum, minimum and mean air temperature in order to detect their potentional varying seasonalities. In thesis were used data from Praha-Ruzyně station between 1 st January and 31 st December. The {{results indicate that the}} interdiurnal air temperature drops vary in each temperature characteristics. While daily maximum air temperatures exhibit the greatest rates of decrease in summer months (July - August), the greatest drops of daily minimum air temperatures occur exclusively in December and January. Significant abnormality was ascertained during abrupt cooling {{at the turn of the}} years 1978 and 1979, when abrupt temperature drop was detect in both maximum and minimum air temperature. The seasonality of <b>interdiurnal</b> <b>mean</b> air temperature drops exhibit changes of both daily maximum and minimum air temperature.
