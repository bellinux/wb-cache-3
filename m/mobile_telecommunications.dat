The issue was coordinated by the Ministry of Justice, and the issue was first discussed politically in 1997, and in 1998 a project group was created. In 2001, a pilot project was established in Trondheim, which included all three agencies. The trial was successful and terminated in June 2003. Later that year, the Parliament of Norway made the principal decision to establish the network.

In April, with a complement of over 800 officers and men, and Nos.167, 168, 308, 354 and 355 Radar Stations under its command, it embarked for Morotai in the Dutch East Indies. From there it departed for Tarakan, arriving with the main invasion force on 1May. Controlled by No.78 (Fighter) Wing under the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), No.114 MFCU became operational on the island four days after the landing. In addition to its regular duties, it temporarily took responsibility for maintaining contact with No.1 TAF headquarters on Morotai and US Army Air Forces commands in the Philippines, when equipment belonging to the RAAF's <b>Mobile</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> Unit failed to be unloaded at Tarakan before the departure of its transport ship.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The <b>mobile</b> <b>telecommunications</b> in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the high performance requirements inherent to multi-media processings or to W-CDMA, future generation mobile telecom-munications bring new constraints to the semiconductor design world. In fact, the traditional solutions based {{on the use of}} hard-ware devices (ASIC) or software ones (DSP) are unable to asso-ciate the flexibility and the high level of performance to the low energy consumption required by this application domain. In this paper, we study the efficiency of an architecture based {{on the use of the}} functional reconfiguration for such systems. Thanks to the implementation of key applications of UMTS, we will show that reconfigurable architectures can offer new compromises to asso-ciate high performances and low energy consumption in a flexible architecture and so, can be the solution to the set of problems as-sociated with the future generation <b>mobiles</b> <b>telecommunications</b> systems. 1...|$|R

Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{spread through}} parkland, {{crossing}} the Tuggeranong Parkway and Sulwood Drive finally engulfing Mount Taylor. Within an hour, houses were also burning in Torrens, {{on the slopes}} of Mount Taylor, and in Weston. The fires by now had inflicted severe damage to the city's infrastructure. Power supplies were cut to several suburbs. These outages affected both the Emergency Services Bureau's own headquarters in Curtin and the Canberra Hospital (running on back-up generators), which was under intense pressure from people suffering burns and smoke inhalation. In Curtin, the ESA headquarters was in danger from the fires. With back-up power available only to the Communications Centre, many personnel were forced to work on tables outside as Army Reserve personnel hosed down the building. It was later noted that the ESB could have moved its operations away from danger to other emergency service locations such as the AFP Winchester Centre or Tuggeranong Police Station. Water, gas, sewerage, and communications were heavily affected. Water, gas, and landline communications was unavailable to several suburbs due to damage to supply lines and city reservoirs. <b>Mobile</b> <b>telecommunications</b> were severely affected due to increased traffic, causing serious disruption to mobile phone networks and the ESA's own radio and dispatch networks. A local generator services business later reported on their website that the ash and smoke were so intense, that some back-up power diesel generators at communication and data centres failed to produce enough power due to air intake filters clogging up. At least one generator air intake filter burned as it sucked in burning leaves blowing in the strong winds.|$|E

In an attempt to keep abreast of customer demands, service providers rethink their marketing strategies that include inter alia rebranding a fraction or multiple facets of their corporate brands. Corporate rebranding is the latest development in the <b>mobile</b> cellular <b>telecommunications</b> service industry in South Africa. What is intriguing about the South African rebranding phenomenon is that corporates opted to rebrand by focusing on permutations such as colour, logo and slogans.

Furthermore, the paper examines the implications, challenges and opportunities of corporate rebranding for the industry.
