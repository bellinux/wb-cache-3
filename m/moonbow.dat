50|$|<b>Moonbows</b> {{are most}} easily viewed {{when the moon}} is at or nearest to its {{brightest}} phase full moon. For <b>moonbows</b> to have the greatest prospect of appearing, the moon must be {{low in the sky}} (at an elevation of less than 42 degrees, preferably lower) and the night sky must be very dark. Since the sky is not completely dark on a rising/setting full moon, this means they can only be observed 2 to 3 hours before sunrise (a time with few observers), or 2 to 3 hours after sunset. And, of course, there must be rain falling opposite the moon. This combination of requirements makes <b>moonbows</b> much rarer than rainbows produced by the sun. <b>Moonbows</b> may also be visible when rain falls during full moonrise at extreme latitudes during the winter months, when the prevalence of the hours of darkness give more opportunity for the phenomenon to be observed. One good location for viewing 'true moonbows' is Waimea 'Kamuela', Hawaii Island, Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|<b>Moonbows</b> {{have been}} {{mentioned}} at least since Aristotle's Meteorology (circa 350 BC), and also in an 1847 publication.|$|R
50|$|Spray <b>moonbows</b> {{are also}} seen with some {{regularity}} {{in the cloud}} forests of Costa Rica, in mountain towns like Monteverde and Santa Elena. These occur when clouds of mist are blown in from the Caribbean by the Christmas Winds. The Christmas Winds happen {{from the end of}} December through late January or early February. These clouds of mists create a streaming pattern of stripes giving rise to their popular name in Spanish of Pelo de Gato or Cat's Hair. <b>Moonbows</b> happen in this part of Costa Rica almost every full moon in the months of December through February. The bows that are caused by Pelo de Gato are not limited to just before dawn but can happen after sunset too, but it does need a full or nearly full moon. <b>Moonbows</b> are also found in Kauai, with the moon rising in the east, during light rain, but must be captured by a time-exposure photo, as they appear white to the naked eye of most people.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Moonbow</b> {{that appears}} here may be {{observed}} under {{a full moon}} and a clear sky. An arch of white light is usually produced at base of Falls and continues downstream. Generations of people have visited here to see this natural phenomenon. The last hotel on this site, <b>Moonbow</b> Inn, was named for the <b>moonbow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Moonbows {{are much}} fainter than solar rainbows, {{due to the}} smaller amount of light {{reflected}} {{from the surface of}} the moon. Because the light is usually too faint to excite the cone color receptors in human eyes, it is difficult for the human eye to discern colors in a <b>moonbow.</b> As a result, a <b>moonbow</b> often appears to be white. However, the colors in a <b>moonbow</b> do appear in long exposure photographs.|$|E

50|$|Bree Brandon was {{to follow}} her father into finance, yet her heart and desire was in drama. She {{enrolled}} into Vandermeer University and became bored with her business courses. She created the identity of <b>Moonbow</b> using a steel longbow and trick arrows. She set her sights on two rival gangs and stole drug payments from each gang on alternating nights. Underground tensions were about to start a gang war with each rival gang suspecting the other for the stolen drug payments. Firestorm was deputized and put on her trail. Their first confrontation was inconclusive. <b>Moonbow</b> sneaked into Arnie Benedict's house to steal receipts hidden in a wall safe. She was wounded and thrown into the deep part of his pool. Firestorm rescued her and let her go. She {{has not been seen}} since either because of her wounds or a growing wisdom of not being prepared. She would later join Circe's team of villains against Wonder Woman's team of heroines.|$|E
50|$|A <b>moonbow</b> (also {{known as}} a lunar rainbow or white rainbow), is a rainbow {{produced}} by moonlight rather than sunlight. Other than the difference in light source, its formation {{is exactly the same}} as for a solar rainbow: It is caused by the refraction of light in many water droplets, such as a rain shower or a waterfall, and is always positioned in the opposite part of the sky from the moon relative to the observer.|$|E
50|$|Cumberland Falls State Resort Park is a park {{located just}} {{southwest}} of Corbin, Kentucky and is contained entirely within the Daniel Boone National Forest.

50|$|Pelor {{appears as}} one of the deities {{described}} in the Players Handbook for this edition (2008).

Pelor's antithesis is not the cool shadow cast by Sehanine <b>Moonbow,</b> but rather, the cold shroud of the Raven Queen.|$|E
