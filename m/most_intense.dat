5|$|Hurricane Kenna is {{currently}} {{tied with a}} hurricane in 1957 and the 1959 Mexico hurricane as the third <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico. The only Pacific hurricanes to strike Mexico at a greater intensity were Patricia of 2015 and Madeline of 1976. Kenna is the third <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> October tropical cyclone to {{have occurred in the}} East Pacific, and is the fourth <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> East Pacific hurricane on record, behind Hurricane Patricia of 2015, Hurricane Linda of 1997 and Hurricane Rick of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
5|$|During the year, a {{total of}} 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, six {{hurricane}}s and two major hurricanes formed. The <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane, Dean, tied for the seventh <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic hurricane ever recorded {{as well as the}} third <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only four on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category5 storm. It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from Dean and Felix, none of the storms exceeded Category1 intensity.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall. Additionally, it made the third <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic hurricane landfall. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.|$|E

25|$|Sea-level {{data for}} the Pacific Islands suggest that sea level in the region fell, {{possibly}} in two stages, between 1270 and 1475. This {{was associated with a}} 1.5nbsp&°C fall in temperature (determined from oxygen-isotope analysis) and an observed increase in El Niño frequency. Tropical Pacific coral records indicate the <b>most</b> frequent, <b>intense</b> El Niño-Southern Oscillation activity in the mid-seventeenth century.|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the strongest}} {{recorded}} tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise. However, three of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some {{of the strongest}} landfalling hurricanes– three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity, making it the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic landfall. Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900mbar (hPa; 26.58inHg) at landfall, making its landfall the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula, though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its landfall marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.|$|E
5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, {{it should be noted that}} this list is not identical to the list of <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Pacific hurricanes. The <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda {{was tied}} with Cyclone Inigo for the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Australian {{tropical}} cyclone on record, with a barometric pressure of 900hPa (mbar) and was the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> storm worldwide in 1999. Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. On 4April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda. It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day, and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7April, the storm's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph) and its barometric pressure decreased to 900hPa (mbar). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was an active}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}}, {{although most of the}} storms were weak and short-lived. Despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007, it was the first season to feature more than one Category 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until 2017. It produced 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, sixhurricanes, and twomajor hurricanes. It officially started on June1 and ended on November30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December13. The <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only six on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category5 hurricane. It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from hurricanes Dean and Felix, none of the storms in the season exceeded Category1 intensity.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Anita {{maintained}} its strength as it approached land, and at 1100 UTC on September 2 it made landfall on Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, about 145 miles (235 km) south of Brownsville, Texas or 80 miles (130 km) north of Tampico, Mexico. Moving ashore with a pressure of 926 mbar, Anita {{was the third}} <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone to strike the nation, and was the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane to hit from the Gulf of Mexico. It rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and on September 3, about 25 hours after moving ashore, Anita emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression. Reclassified as Tropical Depression Eleven, the system continued to the west, and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures. The depression gradually lost its deep convection, and on September 4 it dissipated off of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ioke, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Ioke, was the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke was a record breaking, long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17days, reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on three different occasions.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Patricia set {{multiple}} {{records for}} maximum strength, rate of intensification, {{and rate of}} weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Patricia is the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, {{it is also the}} second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h), a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg). Despite record over-water weakening prior to striking Mexico, Patricia became the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Pacific hurricane to make landfall, with a pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.52inHg).|$|E
30|$|Electromagnetic {{transient}} simulation [64] is a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation {{technique used}} to assess stresses and phenomena caused by switching actions, harmonics, resonance, surges, and other high-speed dynamics.

Repeated spins, however, unearth a highly sophisticated aesthetic that borrows evenly from punk, noisecore, avant garde, and good old-fashioned indie. Although highly discordant and often atonal, it's a curiously engaging record, aided in part by Björk's darkly emotive vocals and the presiding, almost mythical, sense of impending lunacy. It may not be for everyone, but this is gutsy, non-conformist music as authored {{by one of the}} <b>most</b> passionate, <b>intense</b> bands in Iceland's esteemed history".|$|R
