40|$|Assembly work {{frequently}} requires {{workers to}} move their hands, arms and body repeatedly, sometimes assuming poor postures while exerting high forces and with little time to rest. These movements and posture conditions are causal factors of work related musculoskeletal disorders. This dissertation develops and provides supporting evidence for a conceptual model that describes {{the conditions under which}} workers of mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) with cycle to cycle task variations are exposed to awkward postures and insufficient recovery time. To evaluate the effect of variations on worker posture and recovery time, an observation study was conducted. It found that the workstation with the most variations had 89 % less recovery time and 57 % more reaching outside the normal reach ranges than the workstation with the least. A discrete event simulation model of this system was created to predict work time and frequency of worker reaching upstream/downstream to complete the assigned tasks {{for a longer period of}} time. It may also be used to evaluate the changes in the assembly line parameters. A second study was conducted in the laboratory. In it, subjects’ recovery time and frequency of reaching outside the normal reach ranges were tested under 3 conveyor types and 3 product mix/sequence configurations. It found that the asynchronous indexing conveyor reduced reaching the most (19 % vs. 63 %) but none of the configurations provided sufficient recovery time (< 5 %). Third, a field study was conducted to evaluate worker posture and recovery time as customer demand fluctuated in a made to order, <b>manual</b> <b>conveyor</b> MMAL. This study found that increases in demand did not result in increased reach but it reduced recovery time by 15 %. Recovery time exceeded 10 % in all cases because workers were required to wait for processing time to complete the tasks. Finally, recommendations are provided to reduce the impact of cycle-to-cycle variations on workers’ exposure to reaching and insufficient recovery time. Providing workers with the opportunity to complete the work at their own pace, but with controls in the system to prevent them from working continuously, allows them to reduce reaching and provides time for recovery time...|$|E
