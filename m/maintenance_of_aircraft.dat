A large hangar accommodates the club fleet, most of the private gliders owned by club members being stored in trailers or a large, modern back-to-back hangar when not being flown.

25|$|For {{parking and}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{aircraft}}</b> five hangars are used. Each hangar may keep up to 24 helicopters. The apron offers space for about 40 aircraft of various types. Additional space is {{offered in the}} north-, the southwest- and southeast-spider. These are spider-like platforms for aircraft, partly covered with trees and bushes as during the Cold War. Most of these platforms {{are no longer in}} active use but can be activated for military exercises.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the air arm within the Department of War remained {{essentially the same as}} before, that is, the flying units were under the operational control of the various ground forces corps area commands and not the Air Corps, which remained responsible for procurement and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> supply, and training. Because of a lack of legally specified duties and responsibilities, the new {{position of}} Assistant Secretary of War for Air, held by F. Trubee Davison from July 1926 to March 1933, proved of little help in promoting autonomy for the air arm.|$|E

The division and analysis of the methods for the maintenance was made. There were defined and discussed definitions used in the theory <b>of</b> <b>maintenance,</b> in conjunction with the construction <b>of</b> the <b>aircraft</b> and the tasks arising for constructor-manufacturer.

25|$|The project, termed AACMO (Army Air Corps Mail Operation), {{was placed}} under the {{supervision}} of Brigadier General Oscar Westover, assistant chief of the Air Corps. He created three geographic zones and appointed Lieutenant Colonel Henry H. Arnold to command the Western Zone, Lieutenant Colonel Horace M. Hickam the Central Zone, and Major Byron Q. Jones the Eastern Zone. Personnel and planes were immediately deployed, but problems began immediately with a lack of proper facilities (and in some instances, no facilities at all) for <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> and quartering of enlisted men, and a failure of tools to arrive where needed.|$|E

The Basic Survival course introduces cadets to elementary survival skills and encourages them to pursue specialist training in this area of interest. Basic Aviation [...] introduces cadets to the fundamentals of aviation and provides incentive to pursue specialist training in this area. Basic Fitness and Sports course prepares cadets to serve as an assistant sports instructor while developing personal habits to maintain a good fitness and healthy living. The Basic Aviation Technology and Aerospace course introduces cadets to the fundamentals of the aerospace industry, of airfield operations and the construction and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The Basic Musician course develops cadets' competence in music and prepare them to support their local military or pipe band.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} crash, Atlasjet's CEO Tuncay Doğaner assured {{in a press}} conference that [...] "the {{accident}} was caused by a pilot error, there was no technical fault with the aircraft".

2500|$|The inquiry was {{critical}} of the operator and the Department of Civil Aviation. In particular, it {{was critical}} of the operator's poor standards of <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> instruments. [...] For this reason, the inquiry recommended the operator's airline licence should be suspended or cancelled. [...] It also considered the Department should have made more checks of the operator's methods and record keeping. [...] The Minister declined {{to take action against}} the operator, saying its maintenance record keeping had improved significantly since the accident. [...] He also cited the hardship that would be inflicted on many remote communities in Western Australia if the operator's airline licence were to be suspended or cancelled. [...] The Minister said his Department would be extra vigilant towards the operator but conceded there were limits to what could be done without significant increases in staff numbers.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1962 SAC renamed its {{units that}} were {{responsible}} for both bomber and missile operations to include the word [...] "aerospace". [...] The division became the 819th Strategic Aerospace Division and its 96th and 310th wings were renamed the 96th and 310th Strategic Aerospace Wings.

[...] Unlike the wings previously assigned to the 819th, the 95th wing flew the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. [...] The B-52 brought with it a new mission, the periodic <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> on airborne alert, in Operation Chrome Dome. [...] In addition, half of SAC B-52 wing aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert at their home stations, fully fueled, armed and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.|$|E
