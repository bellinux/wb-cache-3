60|$|As {{he saw his}} <b>mate</b> <b>go</b> down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang {{upon the}} captain {{crushing}} him to his knees with a single mighty blow.|$|E
6000|$|... "No shoot, senor," [...] he said {{in broken}} English, for this man had served upon an American ship, [...] "Me driver, Antonio. My <b>mate</b> <b>go</b> down there," [...] and {{he pointed to the}} precipice; [...] "he dead, me not hurt. You run from bad men, me run too, for {{presently}} they come look. Where you go?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{founders of}} this project had a good purpose in mind - to connect lonely people. But now there are many devious tricks. There now is an {{atmosphere}} of bargaining. The [...] "bride" [...] and [...] "groom" [...] advisers - friends and family have with their advice destroyed more than one strong family. As a result those unfortunate individuals {{who are trying to}} find a <b>mate</b> <b>go</b> home empty handed. In an attempt to find happiness, they become just a commodity.|$|E
60|$|The man growled {{something}} inaudible, {{while his}} <b>mates</b> <b>went</b> below to feed.|$|R
60|$|Such {{were some}} of the {{observations}} made, as Wilson and the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> below conversing.|$|R
5000|$|The team then splits into two. Bocca, Coco {{and another}} team <b>mate</b> <b>goes</b> to save Sayoko.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Habits, mating and reproduction== The webs of both B. insignis and B. longinqua are a messy-looking {{construct}} of irregular sail-like shapes. There is a funnel-shaped, silken retreat, {{usually in the}} middle or corner of the web, where the spider spends most of its time waiting for prey. The female spider never leaves the web unless forced to. They seem quite attached to their location, rarely changing the position of their webs and because of this, old webs can be quite messy, often with small objects or dust stuck in them. At night the spider comes out to repair {{and add to the}} web, often just adding new silk over the old. Males, when ready to <b>mate,</b> <b>go</b> in search of females. The male plucks the web of the female to attract her attention. Once the male has made sure that the female will be receptive, he will approach and inseminate her with his palps. They may then stay together for several days, and may mate again several times.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} now on deck, {{and he and}} the first <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> up to the top.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Donohue (Second <b>Mate)</b> <b>went</b> on to captain , {{replacing}} Desmond Fortune who {{was unable}} to walk following the RAF attack on it.|$|R
60|$|The <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> {{into the}} captain’s cabin, and on coming out again asked Stephen to follow him. The captain {{looked at him}} attentively.|$|R
60|$|A pause as {{of extreme}} astonishment followed. They both {{seemed to have}} lost their tongues. Then the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> on with a {{discreet}} glibness.|$|R
50|$|Bill Chinnock {{was born}} in New Jersey but settled in Portland, Maine. Some of his early band <b>mates</b> <b>went</b> on to The E Street Band.|$|R
60|$|While the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> {{forward to}} muster the people, the captain took Paul aside with a request {{that he would}} perform the last offices for the deceased.|$|R
60|$|The <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> {{into the}} pantry and secured {{another glass of}} liquor. Then he ordered old Jerry to take the bundle of {{clothing}} {{and put it in}} the rowboat.|$|R
60|$|As the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> {{down the}} girls gave a scream, and even Tom and Sam looked at Dick in wonder. Never had {{any of them}} seen the eldest Rover so aroused.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said I did {{not know}} for certain; but that when my <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> in for grub, two days before, he had heard say that you had been along there that morning.|$|R
6000|$|... “Don’t {{you think}} you’ve {{stretched}} that neck of yours just about enough? It’s unhealthy, you know. The <b>mate’s</b> <b>gone,</b> so I can’t {{afford to lose}} you too. You must be very, very careful of your health, Cooky. Understand?” ...|$|R
60|$|The first <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> forward, {{and he and}} Pengarvan saw the anchors got in readiness, and {{the cables}} ranged along, so as to run out with perfect freedom. Then Pengarvan made his way aft again to the poop.|$|R
6000|$|Folded, {{and sealed}} with {{a drop of}} tar, the Round Robin was {{directed}} to [...] "The English Consul, Tahiti"; and, handed to the cook, was by him delivered into that gentleman's hands {{as soon as the}} <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> ashore.|$|R
60|$|The <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> hot all over, {{and at once}} descended. He found Miss Alsen, {{her eyes}} sparkling, with the mustard-pot in her left hand and the spoon in her right, {{executing}} a war-dance {{in front of the}} second portrait.|$|R
6000|$|With a seaman on {{each side}} holding him up under the arms, the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> over the gangway more sullen than ever. We built him up with pillows in the gharry, and he {{made an effort to}} say brokenly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I half {{expected}} it,” the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> on, after examining her; “the shock has started the butts of three planks on one side, and {{two on the}} other. We will get the sand out first and turn her over, bottom upwards.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then she's {{stuck on}} you, and it's all the same," [...] the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> on. [...] "You won't be ashore {{half an hour}} before you'll have a flower behind your ear, a wreath on your head, and your arm around Taitua." ...|$|R
50|$|Tim {{has participated}} in Everyoned, a {{supergroup}} which also includes members from Pigface, TV Pow, Joan of Arc, Town & Country, Revolting Cocks, and Central Falls. Though a Chicago favorite, album sales never translated and each band <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> back to their preoccupying gig.|$|R
60|$|The <b>mate</b> <b>went,</b> albeit he {{was rather}} {{surprised}} at himself for doing so, and hid his annoyance and confusion beneath the mattress which {{he brought up}} on his head. His job completed, he came aft again, and, sitting on the hatches, lit his pipe.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the skipper and <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> ashore to transact a little business, leaving the old man smoking peacefully in the cabin. The crew, having {{adjusted}} their differences, had already gone ashore to treat each other to beer, leaving Henry in sole charge.|$|R
60|$|The <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> to his assistance. There was {{but little}} wind, {{and the task}} was soon accomplished, and both men, after a hasty glance round, ran below. The wet body of the sailor lay on a locker, and {{a pool of water}} was on the cabin floor.|$|R
60|$|And with lagging feet, {{from time}} to time pausing and holding on as spray and the tops of waves swept over him, the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> for'ard along the bridge to vent his scorn on the two watches of a four-masted ship that could not reef a foresail.|$|R
60|$|Breakfast finished, the skipper, who {{had been}} on deck all night, retired to his bunk. The <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> on deck and took charge, {{watching}} with great interest the movements of the passenger as she peered into the galley and hotly assailed the cook’s method of washing up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't, sir," [...] the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> on. [...] "She {{will never}} hold, mast or no mast; {{and if it}} stands, we make a shift to run her head {{foremost}} on the rocks, and this {{will give us a}} better chance than if she drifts broadside on." ...|$|R
60|$|The other made no reply, {{but as soon}} as the {{potatoes}} were finished set his young friend to clean brass work, and after that to tidy the cabin up and help the cook clean his pots and pans. Meantime the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> below and overhauled his chest.|$|R
60|$|The idea {{which these}} words {{suggested}} sent a thrill to Staniford's heart, {{but he continued}} silent, and the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> on, with the queer smile, which could be inferred rather than seen, working under his mustache and the humorous twinkle of his eyes evanescently evident under his cap peak.|$|R
60|$|Two seamen, {{sent by the}} <b>mate,</b> <b>went</b> {{to the top of}} the gangway, and {{the fellow}} who had brought the party from the station stood on guard near. Dick {{afterward}} realized that much depended on the choice he swiftly made and wondered whether it was quite by chance he did so.|$|R
60|$|NO SHORE leave {{was granted}} {{the crew of}} the Halfmoon while the vessel lay off Honolulu, and deep and ominous were the grumblings of the men. Only First Officer Ward and the second <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> ashore. Skipper Simms kept the men busy {{painting}} and holystoning as a vent for their pent emotions.|$|R
60|$|During {{this time}} the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> to {{the man at the}} wheel, and told him to steer a little to the starboard. This brought the {{schooner}} somewhat around, and gave us a chance to take in the man, should he be fortunate enough to grasp {{one or the other of}} the ropes.|$|R
60|$|As the <b>mate</b> <b>went</b> down Tom leaped {{directly}} {{on top of}} him, thus holding {{him to the floor}} for the moment, and then struck out for the nearest man, hitting him in the chin. Then Dick came to his brother's aid with a blow that reached the sailor's ear, and he too fell back.|$|R
