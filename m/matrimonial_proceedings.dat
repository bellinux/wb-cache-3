25|$|A {{wide range}} of liberal {{measures}} were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Proceedings</b> and Property Act 1970 made provision {{for the welfare of}} children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent. This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage. That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the Matrimonial Property Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed. Another important reform, the 1967 Welsh Language Act, granted 'equal validity' to the declining Welsh language and encouraged its revival. Government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts. The Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969, passed in response to the Aberfan tragedy, made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public. In 1967, corporal punishment in borstals and prisons was abolished. 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts, and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from £7.7 million in 1964/64 to £15.3 million in 1968/69. A Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was also set up, which had paid out over £2 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968.|$|E

40|$|Treball de Final de Grau en Dret. Codi: DR 1052. Curs acadèmic 2015 - 2016 The present work is {{dedicated}} {{to the study of the}} intra-judicial mediation agreement which is defined as the mediation process’ final part, in which are enshrined. Also, it is “intra-judicial” in this way because it is played in the interior of the separation or divorced legal process, reducing the familiar conflicts in them. Related with the agreement, we can studied the mediation, which is defined, like “the structured negotiation according to this law’ principles, in which two or more parts in conflict are trying voluntarily to get an arrangement by own themselves to solve the conflict with the involvement of a third part, called organs mediators” (LMACM). In the other hand, authors in the doctrine consider that the concept means “a way, a third one tries parts, outside the subject, reach an arrangement to solve their troubles, in order to put an end to the conflict”, as Barona Vilar, S. mentions. 81 Also it can be considered like a “volunteer process to solve familiar conflicts, in especial, in matter of couples with children, of recently application in our que se ha legal context”, in Afonso Rodríguez, M. E’s, words 82. Afterwards, it be indicated the context where the mediation agreement is celebrated, that is in the matrimonial ordinary divorce or separation proceedings. The dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy defines this term as “the breakdown of the marriage stablished by judicial statement with effective cessation of marital cohabitation”; while separation was conceptualized by the RAE as the “disruption of conjugal life for conformity of the parties or court ruling, without leaving it extinguished the link matrimonial”. The differences between separation and divorce are that the first is interrupted the married life, by the parties or by court ruling, and the second is extinguished the marriage linked by a ruling of the competent judge. Then, highlight that the mediation agreement is the most important part of the procedure of mediation because it serves for that process to be as fruitful for parties 81 BARONA VILAR, S., «Integration of mediation…», cit., p. 22. 82 AFONSO RODRÍGUEZ, M. E., «Family mediation …», cit., p. 55. - 52 - and affected third parties, and also, it can be implemented the advantages of mediation procedure to the contraries. At that point, we refer to the principles which govern the mediation agreement, which are the same as the whole process. Such principles are regulated establishing that "the Government will send to the courts a draft law on mediation based on the principles laid down in the provisions of the European Union ", and in any case on voluntariness, fairness, neutrality and confidentiality and respect for the mediation services created by the autonomous communities" (art. 3 Law 15 / 2005). The principles applicable to the mediation highlighted are studied and analysed by García Villaluenga,I. in the next terms 83 : In first place, the confidentiality, applicable to all discussed during mediation sessions. It is defined as the obligation to remain silent regarding what is known during the procedure, to be binding for the mediator who will participate in the process by performing an activity mediating between the parties. In second place, the voluntary is conceived as the lack of compulsatoriedad both the process and the adoption of the agreement conciliator, in base to which parties may voluntarily choose to go or not to such conciliation instrument. But, if the parties opt to go to it, it is necessary that they commit themselves to comply with the adopted in the mediation agreement. Added to the before, it’s stipulates that "the mediation referred to in the present directive should be a voluntary procedure, insofar as the parties are responsible for it and can organise it as they want and give it to terminate at any time" (E. M. paragraph 13 Directive 2008 / 52). In the next place, we can emphasize the impartiality which is the principle that applies to the mediator and that is that in acting, the parties should avoid making it with partisan interests to facilitate the parties to adopt a conciliatory solution, objective and serious. In the last place, we can indicate the mediator neutrality, which is a feature related to the above principle and it is defined as the need for the mediator to act as 83 GARCÍA VILLALUENGA, l., «Mediation through its principles…», cit., p. 722. - 53 - arbitrator, avoiding opting for the adoption of an agreement that provides one of the parties to the detriment of the other. Therefore, the mediator must act merely as a facilitator of the adoption of the agreement settling the procedure. Besides, the legal framework of family mediation which is characterisation of mediation agreements is established in: - The Spanish Constitution, in particular, article 29 CE. - Recommendation 1 / 98 of the Council of Europe on family mediation, and in particular, in its paragraph 11 which States that "encourages the Governments of the Member States introduce or promote mediation family or, where appropriate, strengthen the existing family mediation" and sets forth the principles that govern the family mediation. -The "green paper on alternative modalities of conflict resolution in the civil and commercial field" of 19 April 2002 of the Commission, which aims to respond to consultations on legal issues about the alternative methods of dispute settlement in the field of civil and commercial law. -Directive 2008 / 52 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters, which has transposed into Spanish law, due to the article 96 EC. - Regulation 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 of the Council of Europe, concerning jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and parental responsibility, whereby the way of protecting the child is expected in case of put an end to the marital cohabitation. - Articles 770. 7, 777. 2 LEC that establishes how to deal with the processes of separation and divorce in cases where there is the possibility to go to mediation to settle the dispute of the parties. -Law 5 / 2012, July 6, mediation in civil and commercial matters that will transpose to Spanish law rules contained in the Directive 2008 / 52 and it regulates the mediation agreement pointing material and temporal limits and mandatory content of such an instrument (art. 23 LMACM). -The regulation by different laws handed down to regional level. - 54 - On the other hand, in relation to the aspects on which deals with the mediation agreement, noted that they are economic-loyal and educational matters. The economic-loyal aspects are referred to the mention of the judicial consequences that cause family breakdown processes, because the family is an important social institution. In particular, economic and loyal aspects of the mediation are linked to the guardianship and custody of the children, the regime of visits, the food, the spousal, parental, and others, the conflict situations can be derived. But there are matters which are excluded from the mediation and cases where not one can attend to it due to the severity of them, such as cases of ill-treatment, violence or sexual abuse and the lack of free consent, given that it's crimes punishable by the Penal Code and it excludes such matters of mediation (art. 2 LMACM). Instead following, in terms of the educational aspects, mediation is destined to reducing the damages that occur in the separation and that it can affect to children. Besides, other aspects to study of the mediation are, according to Romero Navarro, F 84. : -The distribution of the responsibilities of the separated parents. -The guidelines that separated spouses must be respected. -The educational criteria and guidelines according to the ages and conditions of children. Then, we can observe in relation to the objectives that will aim to achieve by adopting the agreement provided for in the directive of the 2008 are several; including as says Ortuño Muñoz, P. 85 : - Reach practical agreements in such a way that with the mediation to facilitate a quick and suitable response to the differences between the parties in a position of equality before the conflict that are being resolved. - Ensure a lower costs because the aim is to avoid "the huge costs that usually bring a judicial process", but does not imply that it should be free, because in Spain despite consideration of the principle of gratuitousness, mediation is financed by the 84 ROMERO NAVARRO, F. «Family …», cit., p. 45. 85 ORTUÑO MUÑOZ, P., «The judicial approval …",cit., p. 74. - 55 - State, putting such an instrument at the disposal of individuals to resolve disputes between parties. - Provided a quick solution needed to avoid the conflicts of the <b>matrimonial</b> litigation <b>proceedings.</b> -Promoting agreements to maintain a viable relationship. The legal regulation of the obligational and procedural effects doesn’t appear regulated expressly in the LMACM because it makes a referral to the transaction and the contractual common law. However, it regulates the executive effect provides that "when the agreement is reached in developed mediation after initiating a judicial process, the parties may request the court approval in accordance with the provisions of the Civil procedure law" demanding as to constitute the executive title, which is effected by means of public deed or judicial approval of the agreement (art. 25. 4 LMACM). For its part, the obligational effect of the agreement is contracted in reference to the rules of the common law that sets arising from the same obligations for both parties (art. 1091 CC). Therefore, when they have perfected, "the agreement will oblige parties to comply with it seriously in accordance with good faith, to use and in the case of non-compliance, it can go to the courts for resolution”.

The organisation provided practical and emotional support as part of a range of services to women and children experiencing violence.

For example, English law used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Proceedings</b> Act 1973, which removed the wife's domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).|$|E

It recommended that a wife be bound by her promise not to apply for relief unless a material change in circumstances takes place. Through the Matrimonial Property and Proceedings Act 1970 and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, Parliament essentially upheld the decision in Hyman v Hyman, held that the agreement of a spouse not to apply for relief can amount to consideration to a separation contract, and provided the court with a power of variation.

50|$|Lord Sumption {{gave the}} first judgment. He {{said there was}} only a limited power to pierce the {{corporate}} veil, namely when people were under an existing legal obligation which is deliberately evaded. Fraud cuts through everything. A veil could be pierced only for the purpose of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage they would otherwise obtain from the company’s separate legal personality. There had been no evidence that Mr Prest had set up the companies to avoid any obligations in these divorce proceedings, so there was no ground for piercing the corporate veil. The same was true under the MCA 1973 s 24. This did invoke property concepts with established meanings, and did not mean something different in <b>matrimonial</b> <b>proceedings.</b> If someone did try to frustrate a claim, the MCA 1973 section 37 made provision for setting aside certain dispositions. The jurisdiction that Munby J purported to recognise would, however, cut across the statutory schemes of company and insolvency law that protected people dealing with a company. So, MCA 1973 section 24 did not give judges power to order Mr Prest to transfer property that he was not entitled to in law. However, on the facts, the Petrodel Resources Ltd companies could be ordered to transfer the properties under MCA 1973 section 24 because they belonged to him beneficially: under a resulting trust. The evidence was obscure, but this was because of Mr Prest’s obstruction and mendacity. He said the following.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the formal}} {{steps of a}} contract, {{conveyance}} and registration will allow people to acquire legal interests in land, {{over the course of}} the twentieth century Parliament, and the courts, slowly recognised that many people have legitimate claims to property, even without following formalities, and even without gaining the consent of a property owner. The institution of a trust has come to play a major role, particularly in family homes, because according to the Law of Property Act 1925 section 53, while declarations of express trusts require signed writing to take effect, resulting and constructive trusts do not. A [...] "resulting" [...] trust is typically recognised when a person has given property to a person without the intention to benefit that person, so the property jumps back to the person it came from. [...] "Constructive" [...] trusts have been recognised by English courts in about eight unrelated circumstances, whenever it is said it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] that the courts did not recognise properly belonged to the claimant. In the context of family homes, these two types of trust allowed judges to recognise, from around 1970, a spouse's proprietary right in a home because of the contribution (broadly speaking) to home life. Parliament had enacted the same reform already as a part of family law. In the <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Proceedings</b> and Property Act 1970 section 37, [...] "where a husband or wife contributes in money or money's worth" [...] to improve property, a court could recognise an equitable right in it, but also vary the amount to the extent it was deemed just. And under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 section 24, a court was empowered in divorce proceedings to vary the property rights of the parties, especially for the benefit of children, to the extent that was just. In the Civil Partnership Act 2004 sections 65 to 72 and Schedules 5-7 achieved the same for civil partners.|$|E
5000|$|Shared {{ownership}} leases {{were not}} to be treated as long tenancies at a low rent {{for the purposes of the}} Leasehold Reform Act 1967. Rent Officers were asked to determine fair rents on a non-statutory basis for shared ownership properties. Initial enthusiasm was tempered when questions of some difficulty arose in the assessment of a fair rent relating to equity stakes and premiums. These were dealt with later in the Housing and Planning Act 1986.The Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 consolidated certain enactments relating to the rights of a husband or wife to occupy a dwelling house that had been a matrimonial home. Occupation by one spouse was to be treated as occupation by the other spouse. The Act provided for the transfer of certain tenancies on divorce.The Domestic Violence and <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Proceedings</b> Act 1976 made provision for varying rights of occupation where both spouses (and a man and woman living together as man and wife) had rights in the matrimonial home. The 1976 Act and the 1983 Acts were further developed by the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, which also gave powers to the court in relation to the transfer of certain tenancies upon a decree of divorce, of nullity of marriage or of judicial separation.The Mobile Homes Act 1983 replaced sections 1 to 6 of the Mobile Homes Act 1976. It introduced important new rules about security of tenure to owners of residential mobile home sites and to those who owned the mobile home and rented a pitch from the site owner (including local authorities but not traveller sites). It exempted those who rent the mobile home from the site owner and those who only use it for holiday purposes.It also dealt with sales and gifts of mobile homes, inheritance and change of site ownership, pitch fees, other terms of agreements and provided machinery for dealing with disputes.The Rent (Amendment) Act 1985 reversed the decision in Pocock v. Steel (1985 CA), which decided that an owner-occupier had to live in the house immediately before each and every letting to be able to obtain a mandatory order for possession. Words were inserted so that if it had [...] "at any time" [...] before the letting been occupied as the owner-occupier’s residence, Case l l Rent Act 1977 and the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 applied. This restored the original intention that had been destroyed by redrafting in the consolidation in 1968. This Act (apart from emergency legislation) broke all speed records in its passage through the Parliamentary timetables.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of liberal {{measures}} were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Proceedings</b> and Property Act 1970 made provision {{for the welfare of}} children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent. This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage. That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the Matrimonial Property Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed. Another important reform, the 1967 Welsh Language Act, granted 'equal validity' to the declining Welsh language and encouraged its revival. Government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts. The Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969, passed in response to the Aberfan tragedy, made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public. In 1967, corporal punishment in borstals and prisons was abolished. 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts, and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from £7.7 million in 1964/64 to £15.3 million in 1968/69. A Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was also set up, which had paid out over £2 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968. The Commons Registration Act 1965 provided for the registration of all common land and village greens, whilst under the Countryside Act 1968, local authorities could provide facilities [...] "for enjoyment of such lands to which the public has access". The Family Provision Act 1966 amended a series of pre-existing estate laws mainly related to persons who died interstate. The legislation increased the amount that could be paid of surviving spouses if a will hadn't been left, and also expanded upon the jurisdiction of county courts, which were given the jurisdiction of high courts under certain circumstances when handling matters of estate. The rights of adopted children were also improved with certain wording changed in the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938 to bestow upon them the same rights as natural-born children. In 1968, the Nurseries and Child-Minders Regulation Act 1948 was updated to include more categories of childminders. A year later, the Family Law Reform Act 1969 was passed, which allowed people born outside marriage to inherit on the intestacy of either parent. In 1967, homosexuality was partially decriminalised by the passage of the Sexual Offences Act. The First Wilson Government also introduced a thirty-year rule for access to public records, replacing a previous fifty-year rule.|$|E

The goal of my thesis is to provide the overview of law changes in individual <b>matrimonial</b> <b>proceedings</b> and more importantly their characters, supported by both theoretical and practical examples. While exploring above mentioned problematic, at the same time I engage in substantive law as well as in procedural law due to their mutual cohesion. For the sake of the differentiation of proceeding in matrimonial cases, text of this work is divided into four main chapters, where every chapter includes several subchapters to specify the concrete proceeding's character and its process. The first chapter defines general term of proceedings in matrimonial cases and provides an integrated overview of all individual proceedings such as authorization of marriage and status matrimonial cases. In the second chapter, the concept of authorization of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This PHD thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} expert evidence in family processes from the comparative perspective of two legal systems that are a fundamental point of reference for two societies: the civil and the ecclesiastical one. Both the civil law {{as well as the}} canon law share a common concern and special sensitivity when regulating <b>matrimonial</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Each one of them offers a particular view to answer the claims of the parties: in the process of annulling canonical marriages the truth takes priority over the connecting link of the parties, whereas in the civil separation or divorce proceedings the main goal is the modification of the civil status of the couple and how the children are affected by the adoption of measures relating to parental authority and the guardianship regime. The theme chosen, within the marriage processes of separation, divorce and annulment, shows how the claims that arise in these proceedings are based on different types of expert evidence. The regulation of expert evidence in civil law is much wider than the expert evidence in the canon law due to the variety of situations that are discussed in civil proceedings. Therefore, we have limited our research to family proceedings since they respond better to the dynamics of this comparative study. We will examine this overlapping area of law taking into consideration the law of both jurisdictions, the weaknesses and the strengths of their legislations through an evaluation of their similarities and differences. Therefore, we will analyse {{each and every one of}} the elements that integrate the civil and canonical expert evidence, evaluating them from a critical perspective. A compared study of these characteristics represents in itself an innovation under the absence of doctrinal treatment. We have considered it interesting and timely to provide an in depth analysis of the canonical expert evidence and its regulation over its thirty years of existence. The study of both jurisdictions will allow us to examine the procedural dynamics in which this test is applied. Even though its treatment looks similar in both jurisdictions, the expertise shows peculiarities that could be attractive to implement in both legal systems [...] ...|$|E
