It was stated that the failure mode was dependent on the compressive capacity of the <b>masonary</b> due to arching action and the assumed cracking pattern of the barricade. Results from the destructive test on a structural model showed that the predicted capacity based on the material properties was lower than the measured value...|$|E

40|$|Earthquakes {{are natural}} trouble under which {{disasters}} are {{mainly caused by}} damage or collapse of the structure and other man-made structures. When an earthquake occurs natural period of vibration is more on heavy loaded building and less in light loaded building. If the building is light weighted, i. e. steel is less then economy of structure is also achieved. Hence {{it is necessary to}} find out natural/fundamental time period when mass changes with different type of brick masonry and concrete masonry. This is necessary because IS 1893 : 2002 does not incorporate the effect of mass in a formula which they have mentioned for brick <b>masonary</b> structure.

40|$|The present {{research}} work {{is designed to}} compare the seepage of earthen dam using finite element based software GEOSTUDIO subproduct SEEP/W with field observed seepage through earthen dam. GEOSTUDIO software is capable to perform analysis such as, stress-strain, seepage, slope stability, dynamic analysis. SEEP/W,a subproduct of GEOSTUDIO is a finite element software which can simulate the movement and pore-water pressure distribution within porous materials like soil and rock. In present work the seepage of water through earthen portion of Ujjani dam,an earthfill cum <b>masonary</b> dam in Maharashtra is computed and phreatic line is simulated for single chainage. The observed actual field results of seepage are compared with results obtained by GEOSTUDIO software sub product SEEP/W...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{standard}} production unit system is the most basic element in our country construction. However, this {{standard production}} unit system shows a large difference in the actual amount of labor input for works at the Apartment housing construction, Therefore, {{it may be a}} reasonable alternative to estimate the cost of construction by historical cost data, works will be calculated the cost of labor must determine the exact amount and It is necessary to determine the exact amount of labor input for the construction progress management. This study examines the results of comparing the {{standard production unit}} system and the actual amount of labor counting in apartment housing construction was completed in the metropolitan area since 2000, the following results were obtained. the actual amount of labor input are looked for 1. 184 person/ 1000 of <b>masonary,</b> 0. 084 persons/ ㎡ of plaster, 0. 039 persons/ ㎡ of Waterproofing, 0. 059 persons/ ㎡ of tile at the Apartment housing construction. in the actual amount of labor counting Compared with standard production unit system, masonry ratio of 59. 8 %, plaster ratio of 41. 3 %, waterproofing ratio of 31. 5 %, tile ratio of 34. 3 % and The labor rate in the works was the lowest in the plaster. was relatively high in th...|$|E
