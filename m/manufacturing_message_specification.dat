40|$|Virtual reality (VR) is an {{emerging}} technology that has many potential applications in manufacturing. Networked or shared virtual environments (VE) are of {{growing interest in}} modern manufacturing, which is making increasing use of virtual reality technology. An important feature of networked VEs {{is the way in}} which they control and share 3 D information, and the support of this by real-time data transfer. The bottleneck of transferring 3 D data in real-time between networked VEs is the performance of networking protocols. This paper proposes a novel approach to implementing the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Specifications</b> (MMS), an ISO/IEC 9506 communication standard and presents a <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Message</b> Transfer Protocol (MMTP), suitable for a broad range of Internet-based VE communication applications - in particular, virtual manufacturing collaborative design and control.

ICCP began {{as an effort to}} develop an international standard for real-time data exchange within the electric power utility industry. A working group was formed in 1991 to develop a protocol standard, develop a prototype to test the specification, submit the specification to the IEC for standardisation and carry out interoperability testing between developing vendors. The initial driver was to meet European Common Market requirements in 1992. The official designation of the first protocol was TASE.1 (Telecontrol Application Service Element-1). The second protocol TASE.2 [...] making use of the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Specification</b> (MMS) appears to be the version that has become the most popular.|$|E

Holonic and {{agent-based}} paradigms {{are very}} suitable {{in the development}} of distributed manufacturing control systems, taking advantage of their modularity, decentralization, and ability to support dynamic and complex system design features. However, the integration of manufacturing resources within the holonic manufacturing control applications remains a problem, because no efficient standard allows an easy, transparent and essentially independent integration. This paper proposes an integration process that allows the integration of automation resources independently from the holonic control application, using some concepts derived from the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Specification</b> (MMS) application protocol and implemented over a distributed object platform. ...|$|E

40|$|Data about {{products}} and services {{is of paramount importance}} in most inter-organizational business processes. For business-to-business (B 2 B) scenarios, a great number of XML-based <b>message</b> <b>specifications</b> are available, which cover various processes and types of transactions. These specifications support the respective data exchange tasks by providing a common representation for {{products and}} services in the form of syntactical conventions with some light-weight formal semantics. However, an analysis of the underlying models shows that technical product data and commercial product data are being represented in a fundamentally different manner. In particular show the commercial models both a higher syntactical complexity and more semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose to align the representation of technical and commercial views on product data in <b>message</b> <b>specifications.</b> Our approach is based on the PLIB ontology, which was originally described in ISO 13584.

Because the machines, of which the FMS consists, had few possibilities for communication with external devices, effort had to be put into making machine-specific interfaces between the NC machines and the MAP network. The interfaces were implemented by developing applications that translate MMS messages into machine-specific data and vice versa. The results of the project show that MMS can be used for the control of manufacturing machines that were not designed for use in a network for flexible manufacturing. MMS is not yet widely used. Therefore this paper is meant to demonstrate that MMS can easily be put into practice using relatively simple and off-the-shelf equipment...|$|E

Using general-purpose routing strategies while specifying quality-of-service (QoS) properties at the application layer explicitly in messages, QoS-aware strategies for individual messages are obtained.
