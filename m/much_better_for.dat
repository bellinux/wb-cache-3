5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

25|$|The {{free agent}} market {{following}} the 1986 season was not <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the players. Only four free agents switched teams.

Star players that ended up back with their old teams included Jack Morris (Detroit Tigers), Tim Raines (Montreal Expos), Ron Guidry (New York Yankees), Rich Gedman (Red Sox), Bob Boone (California Angels), and Doyle Alexander (Atlanta Braves).|$|E

Queensland's 2005 series loss marked their third straight series defeat to New South Wales.|$|E

Then on Miami's next possession, Jaguars rookie Corey Chamblin blocked Hutton's punt and Chris Howard recovered {{the ball on the}} Dolphins 21-yard line. Faced with third down and 14 again on their ensuing drive, the Jaguars decided not to pass and Stewart ended up scoring with a 25-yard touchdown run.|$|E

25|$|The 1985–86 {{season was}} <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> the Reds and Rush. He scored twice as Liverpool beat Southampton 2–0 in the FA Cup semi-final at White Hart Lane, booking {{a place at}} Wembley to face {{neighbours}} Everton in the first all-Merseyside FA Cup final. The Reds had just pipped their city rivals to the League title (which had also been contested {{with the likes of}} West Ham United and Manchester United) by beating Chelsea 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. Everton opened the scoring when Gary Lineker outpaced Alan Hansen to shoot past Grobbelaar at the second attempt and held this lead until half-time as Liverpool struggled to find their usual rhythm.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 AHRQ {{review of}} the {{evidence}} of the effectiveness of CI in people with bilateral hearing loss - the device's primary use - found low to moderate quality data that showed: speech perception in noisy conditions was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> people who had implants in both ears done at the same time, compared to people who had only one; that no conclusions could be drawn about changes in speech perception in quiet conditions and health-related quality-of-life. There was only one good study comparing implanting implants in both ears at the same time, to implanting them sequentially; this study found that in the sequential approach, the 2nd implantation made no change, or made things worse.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day, Hussey powered on, and was seventh man out for 253, an innings that {{included}} 3 sixes and 33 fours.

Liam Plunkett soon took their first four wickets, and also had one dropped as Leicestershire struggled to 49 for 4. Leicestershire went on to finish their first innings on 123 all out. Plunkett finished on 5 for 43. Leicestershire were then forced to follow-on exactly 400 behind. They made 10 without loss {{by the end of}} the day. Stephen Harmison, England's out of form fast bowler, performed well, but could still not take a wicket and was upstaged by Plunkett.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the game {{could not have been}} <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> East Carolina or worse for Marshall. On the second play from scrimmage, Leftwich threw a screen pass deep in his own {{territory}} that bounced off the arms of intended receiver Denero Marriott into the hands of Ty Hunt, who returned the interception 12 yards for the game's first touchdown. On Marshall's second possession, a snap out of the shotgun went over Leftwich's right shoulder, and Jerome Stewart picked up the ball and ran it back 43 yards for another Pirates touchdown. Marshall appeared to be finding its rhythm on its third drive, with Leftwich completing five consecutive passes. However, that drive also ended in a turnover, with Leftwich throwing an interception to Stewart in the end zone. The quarter would end with the Pirates up 21-0, with Garrard scoring on a 9-yard run.|$|E

25|$|The {{semifinal}} {{series was}} very {{typical of the}} way D.C United played throughout {{the second half of}} the season. The attack, such as it was, generated a handful of chances at best, and United became the first team in league history to fail to record a shot on goal as the home team in a playoff match. The passing accuracy was the 3rd worst for any MLS team in any game since 2010. The Red Bulls dominated possession and finally broke through in the second half as one-time United player Dax McCarty headed home the winner in a 1-0 defeat for United. The return match didn't go <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>for</b> United. Again, the Red Bulls dominated possession, but thanks to some big saves by Hamid, United still had a chance to try and knot the series as the game drifted into stoppage time. The Red Bulls, however, would finish off United's 2015 season, with a counter-attack goal in stoppage time, scored by Bradley Wright-Phillips, giving NYRB a 2-0 aggregate series win.|$|E
