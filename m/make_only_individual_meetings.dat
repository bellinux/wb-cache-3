40|$|Hunger and {{malnutrition}} {{have plagued}} {{the developing world}} for decades. Not <b>only</b> are <b>individuals</b> not <b>meeting</b> their daily energy requirements, but individuals are also not meeting their daily micronutrient requirements. Many researchers and health institutions recommend consuming a diverse diet to {{increase the likelihood of}} meeting nutritional requirements. In the literature debate exists concerning whether households should focus on increasing income by commercializing and improve their diets by purchasing a more diverse mix of foods, or if households should diversify production at home in order to meet nutritional needs. 	This thesis uses household data from Bukidnon, Philippines to develop a Production Diversity Score (PDS) that is used to examine the impact of farm biodiversity on an individual’s Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) and the likelihood that <b>individuals</b> are <b>meeting</b> their micronutrient needs. The results suggest that compared to raising production diversity, a more effective route to increasing dietary diversity is to increase income and total expenditures of the household. A relationship appears to exist between children’s diets and production diversity but the relationship is weak and varies with changes in the specification of the econometric model. Results suggest that to increase dietary diversity and the likelihood that <b>individuals</b> are <b>meeting</b> daily dietary needs, households should in fact commercialize and increase their incomes. Moreover, it appears that improvements in infrastructure could {{have a significant impact on}} diets in this study area...|$|R

The {{purpose of this article is}} to begin deconstructing and reconstructing the field of adult education phenomenologically by (a) exploring the basic historical assumptions and socially constructed, collectivist realities on which adult education founded its theory and practice in the modern era, (b) elucidating the postmodern turn these realities have taken in the past half century, and (c) reconciling adult education’s historical mission with new realities facing the field. This article ultimately concludes that any viable conception of adult education must not <b>only</b> <b>make</b> postmodern <b>individuals</b> better competitors in the global market-place, but must also help them and the organizations they comprise to define themselves within a larger autopoietic web of relations...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{patients are}} classified as either having relapsing onset or progressive onset disease, also known as primary progressive MS (PPMS). Relative to relapsing onset patients, PPMS patients are older at disease onset, are equally likely to be men or women, and have more rapid accumulation of disability that does not respond well to treatments used in relapsing onset MS. Although estimates vary, 5 - 15 % of all MS patients have a PPMS disease course. Genetic variance is a proposed determinant of MS disease course. If distinct genes associated with PPMS were identified study of these genes might lead {{to an understanding of}} the biology underlying disease progression and neural degeneration that are the hallmarks of PPMS. These genes and their biological pathways might also represent therapeutic targets. This chapter systematically reviews the PPMS genetic literature. Despite the intuitively appealing notion that differences between PPMS and relapsing onset MS are due to genetics, definite differences associated with these phenotypes at the major histocompatibility complex or elsewhere in the genome have not been found. Recent large-scale genome wide screens identified multiple genes associated with MS susceptibility outside the MHC. The genetic variants identified thus far <b>make</b> <b>only</b> weak <b>individual</b> contributions to MS susceptibility. If the genetic effects that contribute to the differences between PPMS and relapsing MS are similar in magnitude to those that distinguish MS from healthy controls then, given the relative scarcity of the PPMS phenotype, very large datasets will be needed to identify PPMS associated genes. International collaborative efforts could provide the means to identify such genes. Alternately, it is possible that factors other than genetics underlie the differences between these clinical phenotypes. © 2014 Bruce Cree...|$|R
40|$|This article employs {{interdependence}} {{theory as}} a means of understanding how and why some relationships survive difficult times whereas other promising relationships end. Interdependence theory makes important distinctions between satisfaction and dependence. These distinctions are extended in the investment model, a theory of the process by which individuals become dependent on and committed to their relationships. The investment model suggests that dependence increases not only as a consequence of increasing satisfaction, but also because available alternatives are perceived to be poor and numerous important resources are invested in a relationship. Subjective commitment summarizes the nature of an individual's dependence on a partner, and represents broad, long-term orientation toward a relationship. Strong commitment not <b>only</b> <b>makes</b> <b>individuals</b> more likely to remain with their partners, but also promotes a variety of relationship maintenance behaviors such as adaptive social comparison and perceived relationship superiority, derogation of attractive and threatening alternatives, effective management of jealousy and extrarelationship involvements, willingness to sacrifice for the good of a relationship, and tendencies to accommodate rather than retaliate when a partner behaves poorly...|$|R
