40|$|The toxic and {{propagation}} {{effects on}} Bursaphelenchus xylophilus of 28 Thymus vulgaris red oil and white oil compounds were examined using direct contact and cotton ball bioassays. Results {{were compared with}} those of the trunk-injection nematicides emmamectin benzoate, levamisol hydrochloride and <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate.</b> In direct contact bioassays, geraniol (LC 50, 0. 47 mg/ml) was the most toxic compound, followed by thymol (1. 08 mg/ml), carvacrol (1. 23 mg/ml) and terpinen- 4 -ol (2. 61 mg/ml). In cotton ball tests with 20 inactive compounds at 2 mg/cotton ball, p-cymene significantly inhibited propagation (propagation ratio [PR] 8), compared with the castor oil-ethanol-treated control (PR 56). Propagation stimulation was observed with (–) -caryophyllene oxide, (+) -ledene, (+) - and (–) -limonene, linalool oxide, β-myrcene, (–) -α-phellandrene, (+) -α-pinene and γ-terpinene (PR 63 – 100). The other 10 compounds exhibited low to moderate levels of propagation inhibition (PR 36 – 56). At 0. 1 μg/cotton ball, emmamectin benzoate and <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate</b> exhibited complete suppression of propagation, whereas a very low level of propagation inhibition was obtained from levamisol hydrochloride (PR 6). In conclusion, propagation-stimulating compounds can exist in plants in addition to nematicidal compounds, and careful use of plant preparations containing high quantities of these compounds is mandatory...|$|E
40|$|Morantel {{could not}} be {{detected}} (< 0. 05 microgram/ml) in the plasma of cattle or goats following the oral administration of <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate</b> at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg bodyweight. No morantel was detected in the milk of lactating goats except in one animal where a concentration of 0. 092 microgram/ml was detected at 8 h after drug administration. Morantel was highly effective against Cooperia oncophora infections in calves treated 6, 9 or 18 days after infection; however, was highly effective against Ostertagia ostertagi only when treated 18 days after infection. Morantel {{did not affect the}} fecundity of adult O. ostertagi surviving treatment 18 days after infection which had similar average numbers of eggs in their uteri (range 13. 4 +/- 0. 73 - 16. 8 +/- 0. 98) as did parasites from control animals (range 12. 0 +/- 0. 70 - 13. 6 +/- 0. 66). Morantel could be detected at a concentration of 96 +/- 4. 5 micrograms/g (dry weight) in the faeces of a calf 24 h after treatment with 10 mg/kg bodyweight of <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate.</b> The concentration of morantel in replicate samples of this faeces exposed to natural atmosphere, but not to soil or soil organisms, declined slowly over the following 322 days. At day 322 after the start of the experiment 8. 8 micrograms/g of morantel could be measured in the remaining faecal material. Throughout the faecal degradation study the concentration of morantel in the crusts of the replicate sample pats was lower than the concentration in the core samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{field trial}} {{involving}} 217 dairy cows from 13 herds located in four {{different areas of}} Quebec was conducted to determine the level of subclinical parasitism. The effect on milk production was evaluated on 116 cows following a single anthelmintic treatment with <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate</b> administered at freshening. The results showed that this treatment increased milk production in nine herds, which was statistically significant at P ≤ 0. 05 {{in one of the}} herds and decreased yields in four herds. Overall, this treatment increased milk production by an average of 255 kg per cow for the official 305 day production period. This increase was found to be not statistically significant (P> 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Present paper proposes the {{presentation}} of antiparasitic boluses, veterinary use specific conditionings with importance in gastro intestinal helminth population control, as a modern alternative to the classic antihelmintic therapy. The active substances are released consecutive to: diffusion, osmotic procesess, to progressive erosion, or through electronic programmed devices. Anthelmintic boluses are classified upon the releasing system in: a) anthelmintic sustained release systems: for albendazole (Proftril bolus), <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate</b> (Paratect flex and bolus) ivermectines (Enzec and Alzet, Ivomec SR Bolus), levamisole (Chronominthic bolus), oxfendazol (Synanthic multidose bolus) fenbendazole (Panacur Bolus). b) anthelmintic programmed periodic release systems: Intra Ruminal Pulse Release Electronic Device (I. R. P. R. E. D) and Repidose (Autoworm, Oxfendazole Pulsed Release Bolus) ...|$|E
40|$|Summary – Methanol {{extracts}} of 50 {{plant species}} were assessed for nematicidal activity against the {{pine wood nematode}} (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Out of these, five extracts: Justicia diclipteroides subsp. usambarica; Nerium oleander; Persea americana; Scadoxus multiflorus subsp. multiflorus; and Thespesia populnea, caused 96 - 100 % mortalities of pine wood nematode at 1000 μg ml− 1 for 48 h. Methanol extract of the stem bark of P. americana (avocado) and the n-hexane layer obtained from the methanol extract by solvent partitioning caused 100 % mortality of PWN at low concentrations of 125 and 63 μg ml− 1, respectively. One potent nematicidal compound was isolated from the stem bark of P. americana and its chemical structure {{was determined to be}} isoobtusilactone A (1) by mass and NMR spectral analyses. The chemical showed a very strong nematicidal activity against PWN; it caused mortalities of over 97 % at concentrations higher than 50 μg ml− 1. Compared with a commercial synthetic nematicide, <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate,</b> compound 1 showed a little more potent activity. The results suggested that compound 1 may have the potential to be explored as a natural nematicide or be useful as a lead molecule for development of new nematicidal agents for controlling the pine wilt disease caused by B. xylophilus...|$|E
40|$|The present {{trial was}} aimed to compare {{efficiency}} of prevention of moniaziasis (Treatment Programme 1, TP 1) versus prevention of gastro-intestinal strongylosis (Treatment Programme 2, TP 2) in suckling lambs as assessed by clinical appearance and growing performance. Clinical observations and fecal egg counts {{were conducted on}} 397 three-month-old lambs born {{in the middle of}} the lambing season. Clinical signs suggestive of gastro-intestinal parasitism were found in 59 lambs (14. 9 percent) and 150 out of 213 analysed fecal samples (70. 4 percent) contained eggs of Moniezia. The twelve farms involved in the trial were paired following similarities in husbandry conditions. Ninety lambs from the farms under TP 1 were compared with 90 lambs from the farms under TP 2, following similarities of weight and sex. In the farms under TP 1, the lambs received a single dose of niclosamide, 80 mg/kg bodyweight (drug active against Moniezia only). In the farms under TP 2, the lambs received a single dose of <b>morantel</b> <b>tartrate,</b> 8 mg/kg bodyweight (drug active against gastro-intestinal nematodes only). Clinical symptoms, as assessed during two control visits carried out one and two month after the treatment, disappeared in farms under TP 1 and increased in the farms under TP 2. Eggs of Moniezia were no longer found in fecal samples of the flocks under TP 1 whereas the percentage of animals with eggs of Moniezia stabilized in the flocks under TP 2. Mean daily gains in the month following the treatment were 301 g in the flocks under TP 1 and 128 g in the flocks under TP 2. Mean daily gains in the next month were 178 g and 112 g in both groups, respectively. These results suggest that, in the conditions under study where gastro-intestinal strongylosis is controlled in the adult sheep, prevention of monieziasis must be regarded as the basis of the Herd Health Programme in the growing lambs...|$|E
