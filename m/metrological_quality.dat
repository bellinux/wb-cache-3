50|$|There is a three-level {{hierarchy}} of physical measurement standards. At {{the top of}} the tree are the master standards - these are known as primary standards. Primary standards are made to the highest <b>metrological</b> <b>quality</b> and are the definitive definition or realization of their unit of measure. Historically, units of measure were generally defined with reference to unique artifacts which were the legal basis of units of measure. A continuing trend in metrology is to eliminate as many as possible of the artifact standards and instead define practical units of measure in terms of fundamental physical constants, as demonstrated by standardized technique. One advantage of elimination of artifact standards is that inter-comparison of artifacts is no longer required. Another advantage would be that the loss or damage of the artifact standards would not disrupt the system of measures.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} commercial measurement instruments implementing {{a wide range}} of measurement technologies is rapidly becoming available for dimensional and geometric verification. Multiple solutions are often acquired within the shop-floor with the aim of providing alternatives to cover a wider array of measurement needs, thus overcoming the limitations of individual instruments and technologies. In such scenarios, multisensor data fusion aims at going one step further by seeking original and different ways to analyze and combine multiple measurement datasets taken from the same measurand, in order to produce synergistic effects and ultimately obtain overall better measurement results. In this work an original approach to multisensor data fusion is presented, based on the development of Gaussian process models (the technique also known as kriging), starting from point sets acquired from multiple instruments. The approach is illustrated and validated through the application to a simulated test case and two real-life industrial metrology scenarios involving structured light scanners and coordinate measurement machines.

MethodThe translation of items 8 and 10 taken out of the Tunisian version was conducted according to Beaton's method. Adaptations were made after a pilot study on 100  patients. The validation study included 100  patients suffering from chronic low back pain aged 18 to 65  years old. Intra-observer reliability was assessed using the intra-class coefficient (ICC). Spearman rank correlation coefficient, the Kruskall–Wallis test and factor analysis were used to evaluate construct validity (convergent and divergent validity). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. ResultsOne hundred Saudi patients were included in the study. Intra-observer reliability was excellent (ICC: 0. 99). The correlations of the index with the VAS pain scale (r= 0. 708), the Roland–Morris Low Back Pain Disability (r= 0. 656), and the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (r= 0. 792) suggest good construct validity. Factor analysis unveiled two main factors explaining a cumulative percentage variance of 63. 5 %. The first factor represents static activities and the second factor represents dynamic activities.

The correlations between the Mini-Mental Parkinson and each component of this battery were substantial, especially for the performance subtests of the WAIS-R (r = 0. 62 to 0. 72), the Stroop test (r = 0. 65) the 15 -objects test (r = 0. 64), the word fluency (r = 0. 63) and the Odd Man Out test (r = 0. 61). The validity of each subtest of the Mini-Mental Parkinson was adequate except for one, based on a word choice, which requires a modification in French before definitive use. The test-retest reliability was high (r = 0. 84). There was {{a significant difference in the}} mean scores in cases with confusional event (22. 4), even without current signs of dementia, compared with patients with no such history (27. 2).

30|$|A new, rugged, precise, {{accurate}} and fast primary {{method of measurement}} has been proposed for the determination of gold in various gold articles. Precise and accurate measurement of gold is the primary requirement for hall marking and to trade gold internationally, as {{billions of dollars of}} gold are trading world wide for the various applications. At present Fire Assay ASTM E 1335 – 08 is the only Standard Test Method for the determination of Gold, which is accepted internationally. But the method is time consuming, cumbersome and required expertise to perform the test. In the present investigation, a method has been developed gravimetry based on direct determination of gold after reducing gold in zero-valent state by hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Gravimetry is the most reliable technique and having highest <b>metrological</b> <b>qualities</b> in comparison to titremetry and instrumental method and the results of gravimetry are directly traceable to SI unit. The results of gravimetric method are accepted without reference to a standard of the same quantity. Several experiments were carried out with and without impurities and it has been concluded that gold can be determined accurately and precisely in presence of several impurities. Five replicates of approximate 0.2 [*]g gold samples were analyzed following method proposed and percentage purity were found to be 99.993 [*]±[*] 0.0056 with 95 % confidence level (k[*]=[*] 2). The combined uncertainty in gold measurement has also been evaluated using potential sources of the method according to the EURACHEM/GUM guidelines.|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) foods requires estimation {{of the amount of}} the transgenic event relative to an endogenous gene. Regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU) have defined the labelling threshold for GM food on the copy number ratio between the transgenic event and an endogenous gene. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently being used for quantification of GM organisms (GMOs). Limitations in realtime PCR applications to detect very low number of DNA targets has led to new developments such as the digital PCR (dPCR) which allows accurate measurement of DNA copies without the need for a reference calibrator. In this paper, the amount of maizeMON 810 and hmg copies present in a DNA extract from seed powders certified for their mass content and for their copy number ratio was measured by dPCR. The ratio of these absolute copy numbers determined by dPCR was found to be identical to the ratios measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a plasmid DNA calibrator. These results indicate that both methods could be applied to determine the copy number ratio in MON 810. The reported values were in agreement with estimations from a model elaborated to convert mass fractions into copy number fractions in MON 810 varieties. This model was challenged on two MON 810 varieties used for the production of MON 810 certified reference materials (CRMs) which differ in the parental origin of the introduced GM trait.

BackgroundNo functional index assessing the functional capacities of the shoulder is presently available in Arabic. Patients and methodsThe translation was achieved by means of forward/backward translation. Adaptations were carried out subsequent to a preliminary test involving 15 persons. Patients with periarticular shoulder disabilities were included. Clinical measurements evaluated pain and functional disability by means of the visual analogue scale (VAS). Interrater concordance (repeatability) was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland and Altman method. Construct validity (convergent and discriminant validity) was investigated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and a factorial analysis followed by orthogonal rotation. The internal consistency of each factor was graded in terms of the Cronbach alpha coefficient. ResultsEighty (80) patients were included in the study. Interrater concordance was excellent (ICC= 0. 96). The Bland and Altman method showed a low-variability mean difference. Correlations of the index score with the pain VAS (r=− 0. 49) and functional disability (r=− 0. 58) suggested satisfactory convergent validity, and our index likewise showed good discriminant validity. Factorial analysis led to the extraction of two factors with a cumulative variance rate of 92. 6 % that could not be explained.

On the other end, geometric errors, as defined by tolerance standards, depend heavily on extreme values of the form deviations over the related surface so that a full-field inspection is virtually required. For example, straightness error is the minimum distance between two parallel lines enclosing the actual feature. Thus extreme points {{are more important than}} the others in determining the straightness error. This problem, translated in statistical terms, means using a small sample of form deviations to make inference on a quantity dependent on extreme values of the population, thereby unlikely to be in the sample. Thus sample-based evaluation of geometric errors is naturally prone to be substantially biased and uncertain, especially when the surfaces exhibit systematic form deviations. In spite of this, common practice in industry is to probe very few points according to very simple sampling strategy (uniform, random, stratified). The software packages sold with the machines contain algorithms of computational geometry which are selected by purely economic criteria (easy to implement, fast to compute) regardless of their implications on measurement quality. Moreover, user awareness of the importance of evaluating measurement uncertainty in the inspection of geometric tolerances is exceedingly limited. This is no wonder if we consider that the ISO committees have been working for several years on different four methods for uncertainty evaluation in CMM measurement tasks (ISO 15530 family) and still now only one standard has been officially delivered (ISO 15530 - 3, march 2004).

40|$|The IFMIF (International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility) project aim is {{to build}} a {{facility}} for the mechanical characterization of material that will constitute the wall of the nuclear reactor for DEMO (DEMOnstration power plant). The complexity of this facility, containing numerous components with peculiar specifications, requires the development of a preliminary stage for the engineeristic evaluation that will led to outline the framework of the activities, the so called EVEDA (Engineering Validation Engineering Design Activities) phase, including the LIPAc prototype construction that involve many research institutes around the world each one has in charge the realization of a line components. The description of the IFMIF project and also each contribution of the participating research institutes are briefly reported on chapter 1. Such facility require the realization of a RFQ four-vane particle accelerator, composed of 18 modules, whose part of mechanical design and construction has been entrusted respectively to mechanical design office and workshop of the I. N. F. N. Padova Unit (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). Since the mechanical design of the accelerator ha almost completed, we faced on the production covering over all <b>metrological</b> <b>quality</b> control phases. Metrologic control and qualification stages are strictly related to the cavity behaviour therefore we focus our attention to its working principle. Thus, in the second chapter it has been summarised the basics to understand the basic working principles of such machines, the main parameter affecting their performances and finally the main geometrical parameter of the accelerator concerned. The most critical issues arise from the production concerning the brazing process which does not permit adjustment except with re-brazing causing a strong deterioration of the mechanical properties of the copper components. It should be mentioned that brazing {{turned out to be an}} uncertainty source for the quality of the pieces, therefore, part of the activities have been carried out on the resolution of such problems. The possible causes of defect on brazed geometries have been found and one-dimensional considerations about thermal expansion as well as 3 d thermo-structural simulation confirm all the statements. Such problematics has been reported on third chapter which, moreover, consists on their resolutions: the design of a new brazing cycle with an intermediate plateau. All the remaining modules are then brazed with this new cycle that permitted the disappearance of the brazing distortion. This confirms the reliability of the production phases and methods for the obtainments of modules respecting the project specifications. The quality control of the modules include: vacuum tightening test of the cavity, the coolant circuits seal test, Ultrasonic Test (UT) of the brazed joints, dimensional inspection using a CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) and Radio-Frequency (RF) test that identifies the electromagnetic behaviour of the single modules. These two last quality controls are strictly correlated each other in such a way that the deviations from the nominal dimensions could be used to predict the electromagnetic ones. Therefore in the last chapter, along with descriptions of the production phases and their metrological controls, it exposes a method for predicting the frequency deviation based on the deviations of measurements. The method validation is done thank to the comparison between metrological control results and those of the RF test. To sum up, the first chapter talks about the IFMIF project, its purpose and its main components; the second summarizes the principle of operation of the four-vane RFQ and describes the main parameters of the one used for the project IFMIF / EVEDA; the third introduces the basic concepts of the brazing process, the identification of defects and determining causes by means of a thermal-structural simulation and finally outlines a new brazing cycle; the last chapter describes the main stages of production, the metrological control between them, culminating in an metrological characterization method to predict the electromagnetic behaviour of the cavity...|$|E
40|$|Detection in {{microfluidic}} systems requires {{highly sensitive}} analytical methods, {{because of the}} very short optical interaction length, which is usually {{in the range of}} 100 μm or shorter. Furthermore, the amounts of analytes in detection volumes are extremely small (femto- or attomoles). Thermal lens spectrometry and particularly thermal lens microscopy (TLM) appear as techniques of choice for detection in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip systems, since they enable measurements of absorbance’s or absorbance changes as low as 10 - 7. In addition to ultra-high sensitivity, TLM offers high spatial resolution (≈ 1 μm) and sufficient temporal resolution (ms range), which is required for studies of processes in microfluidic systems. Recent development of TLM theory and instrumentation lead to experimental confirmations of the effects of microfluidic flows on the TLM signal, which affects the sensitivity. On the other hand, these observations have enabled optimization of TLM instruments [1]. As a result of these advancements, applications of TLM were extended from simple laminar flows [2], to highly complex systems such as Tylor-type flows, where TLM detection provided data for description of diffusion processes in n-octane/methanol binary liquid systems [3]. The major streamline of TLM applications was however focused on the development of vanguard analytical systems [4], which are needed in various fields of chemical analysis, including food safety and quality control, environmental monitoring as well as biomedical research and diagnostics. Such systems are used as sample screening systems (sample filters or selectors) when the information is needed quickly to make immediate decisions in relation to the analytical problem. They provide simplicity (e. g. little or no sample pre-treatment), low cost, rapid and reliable response, and frequently give just binary responses. However, their major weakness is low <b>metrological</b> <b>quality</b> of results. Therefore, uncertainties of up to 5 – 15 % are usually accepted as a toll for rapidity and simplicity, which are essential even though in contradiction with conventional analytical concepts. With the objective of developing new vanguard analytical systems, a relevant goal is to exploit the advantages offered by microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems on one hand, and TLM detection on the other. In such combinations, the FIA approach simplifies sample handling (e. g. volume measurements) and transport to the detector, while microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology can facilitate and speed up processes including colorimetric reactions, antigen–antibody or enzyme–substrate interactions in bioanalytical systems, and even extraction and preconcentration steps by introducing continuous flow processing and micro unit operations in chemical analysis [2]. High sensitivity of TLM in such systems offers low limits of detection, which also contribute to low uncertainties that are typically below 10 %. An important advantage of microfluidic systems {{lies in the fact that}} small dimensions of such systems, which consist of capillaries and micro reactors with dimensions about 10 to 100 μm, significantly reduce the molecular diffusion time, which is inversely proportional to the second power of distance. For example, the time required for completion of an ELISA immunoassay for NGAL a biomarker of acute kidney failure was reduced from four hours to only 30 mins. [5, 6] when transferring the assay into a microfluidic system, while maintaining or even improving the sensitivity. Even more evident improvement in sample throughput (reduction of analysis time from 10 hours to 30 minutes) was achieved for determination of antibodies for human papilloma virus (anti L 1 HPV 16) in blood plasma, after immobilizing adequate pseudovirions as antigens on magnetic nanobeads [6]. Other health-related applications include detection of toxins, such as microcystin, or carcinogenic substances such as Cr(VI), which offers improved limits of detection as compared to spectrophotometry as well as sample throughput, which can reach 20 samples/min.

40|$|A rugged, {{precise and}} {{accurate}} new gravimetry method for {{the determination of}} gold: an alternative to fire assay method Nahar Singh* A new, rugged, precise, accurate and fast primary method of measurement has been proposed for the determination of gold in various gold articles. Precise and accurate measurement of gold is the primary requirement for hall marking and to trade gold internationally, as {{billions of dollars of}} gold are trading world wide for the various applications. At present Fire Assay ASTM E 1335 – 08 is the only Standard Test Method for the determination of Gold, which is accepted internationally. But the method is time consuming, cumbersome and required expertise to perform the test. In the present investigation, a method has been developed gravimetry based on direct determination of gold after reducing gold in zero-valent state by hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Gravimetry is the most reliable technique and having highest <b>metrological</b> <b>qualities</b> in comparison to titremetry and instrumental method and the results of gravimetry are directly traceable to SI unit. The results of gravimetric method are accepted without reference to a standard of the same quantity. Several experiments were carried out with and without impurities and it has been concluded that gold can be determined accurately and precisely in presence of several impurities. Five replicates of approximate 0. 2 g gold samples were analyzed following method proposed and percentage purity were found to be 99. 993 ± 0. 0056 with 95 % confidence level (k = 2). The combined uncertainty in gold measurement has also been evaluated using potential sources of the method according to the EURACHEM/GUM guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Healthcare {{professionals}} are increasingly using wikis as collaborative tools to create, synthesize, share, and disseminate knowledge in healthcare. Because wikis depend on collaborators to keep content up-to-date, healthcare professionals who use wikis must adopt behaviors that foster this collaboration. This protocol describes the methods {{we will use}} to develop and test the <b>metrological</b> <b>qualities</b> of a questionnaire that will assess healthcare professionals' intentions and the determinants of those intentions to use wiki-based reminders that promote best practices in trauma care. Methods Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, we will conduct semi-structured interviews of healthcare professionals to identify salient beliefs that may affect their future use of wikis. These beliefs will inform our questionnaire on intended behavior. A test-retest of the survey will verify the questionnaire's stability over time. We will interview 50 healthcare professionals (25 physicians and 25 allied health professionals) working in the emergency departments of three trauma centers in Quebec, Canada. We will analyze {{the content of the}} interviews and construct and pilot a questionnaire. We will then test the revised questionnaire with 30 healthcare professionals (15 physicians and 15 allied health professionals) and retest it two weeks later. We will assess {{the internal consistency of the}} questionnaire constructs using Cronbach's alpha coefficients and determine their stability with the intra-class correlation (ICC). Discussion To our knowledge, this study will be the first to develop and test a theory-based survey that measures healthcare professionals' intentions to use a wiki-based intervention. This study will identify professionals' salient beliefs qualitatively and will quantify the psychometric capacities of the questionnaire based on those beliefs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} applied ultrasound to the evaluation of entheses in spondyloarthritis patients. However, no clear agreement exists on the definition of enthesitis, on the number and choice of entheses to examine and on ultrasound technique, which may all affect the results of the examination. The objectives of this study were to first determine the level of homogeneity in the ultrasound definitions for the principal lesions of enthesitis in the published literature and second, to evaluate the metric properties of ultrasound for detecting enthesitis according to the OMERACT filter. Methods: Search was performed in PUBMED and EMBASE. Both grey-scale and Doppler definitions of enthesitis, including describing features of enthesitis, were collected and <b>metrological</b> <b>qualities</b> of studies were assessed. Results: After selection, 48 articles were analyzed. The definition of ultrasound enthesitis and elementary features varied among authors. Grey-scale enthesitis was characterized by increasing thickness (94 % of studies), hypoechogenicity (83 %), enthesophytes (69 %), erosions (67 %), calcifications (52 %), associated bursitis (46 %) and cortical irregularities (29 %). Only 46 % of studies reported the use of Doppler. High discrepancies were observed on frequency, type of probe and Doppler mode used. Face and content validity were the most frequently evaluated criteria (43 %) followed by reliability (29 %) and responsiveness (19 %). Conclusions: Ultrasound has evidence to support face, content validity and reliability for the evaluation of enthesitis, though {{there is a lack of}} well-reported methodology in most of the studies. Consensus on elementary lesions and standardization of exam is needed to determine the ultrasound definition of enthesitis in grey-scale and in Doppler for future applications. 15 page(s...|$|R
