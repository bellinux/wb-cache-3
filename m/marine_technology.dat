25|$|While {{running for}} reelection in 2008, Coleman was {{mentioned}} in a Texas lawsuit by Paul McKim, CEO of Deep <b>Marine</b> <b>Technology</b> (DMT), against Nasser Kazeminy. Kazeminy was a longtime Coleman supporter who owned a controlling share of DMT. The petition alleged that Kazeminy used DMT to funnel $75,000 or more to Laurie Coleman through her employer, Hays Companies, in order to enrich Senator Coleman. McKim's petition covered several issues, of which the Coleman matter was only one. Coleman's 2009 Senate financial disclosure form disclosed that Laurie Coleman received a salary from Hays Companies, but Senate rules do not require the salary amount to be revealed. Neither Coleman nor his wife were named as defendants in the suit. On October 31, a related suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court by minority shareholders in DMT. The Delaware suit also alleged that DMT {{was used as a}} conduit for unearned funds to Laurie Coleman through Hays Companies, at Kazeminy's behest. As in the Texas case, the Colemans were not named as defendants, and Coleman was not charged with any ethical or legal wrongdoing.|$|E

500|$|In 1945, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Rickenbacker Causeway to make Virginia Key accessible by car. The county offered to give UM {{a part of the}} island adjacent to the Miami Seaquarium in exchange for UM operating the aquarium. However, the aquarium construction was delayed when a bond referendum failed, so UM leased the land in 1951. In 1953, UM built classroom and lab buildings on a 16-acre (65,000 m²) campus to house what would become the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). Additional buildings were added in 1957, 1959 and 1965. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory is located across the Rickenbacker Causeway from the campus. From 1947 to 1959, the State of Florida funded the UM Marine Lab on Virginia Key until the State built a separate marine lab in St. Petersburg.
