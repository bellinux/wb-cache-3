Namely, December, January, February (DJF); March, April, May (MAM); June, July, August (JJA) and September, October, November (SON). The study revealed that both the day and night time surface ozone distribution in DJF season recorded a significant correlation of 0. 7 with the zonal wind flow pattern, and a less significant correlation of 0. 36 with the meridional wind flow pattern. Average <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> of 281. 4 DU southward and 260. 3 DU northward were observed in DJF. In JJA, the meridional wind pattern recorded strong west to east flow which was non-parallel to the latitudinal lines.

40|$|Ground level Ozone {{is one of}} the six common air-pollutants {{on which}} the EPA has set {{national}} air quality standards. In order to capture the spatio-temporal trend of 1 -hour and 8 -hour average ozone concentration in the US, we develop a method for spatio-temporal simultaneous quantile regression. Unlike existing procedures, in the proposed method, smoothing across the sites is incorporated within modeling assumptions thus allowing borrowing of information across locations, an essential step when the number of samples in each location is low. The quantile function has been assumed to be linear in time and smooth over space and at any given site is given by a convex combination of two monotone increasing functions ξ_ 1 and ξ_ 2 not depending on time. A B-spline basis expansion with increasing coefficients varying smoothly over the space is used to put a prior and a Bayesian analysis is performed. We analyze the average daily 1 -hour maximum and 8 -hour <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> level data of US and California during 2006 - 2015 using the proposed method.

Data on ED visits with a presenting complaint of asthma (n = 1987) were abstracted for the period 1984 - 1992 (May-September). Air pollution variables included ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfate, and total suspended particulate (TSP); weather variables included temperature, humidex, dewpoint, and relative humidity. Daily ED visit frequencies were filtered to remove {{day of the week}} and long wave trends, and filtered values were regressed on air pollution and weather variables for the same day and the 3 previous days. The mean daily 1 -hr <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> during the study period was 41. 6 ppb. A positive, statistically significant (p < 0. 05) association was observed between ozone and asthma ED visits 2 days later, and the strength of the association was greater in nonlinear models. The frequency of asthma ED visits was 33 % higher (95 % CI, 10 - 56 %) when the daily 1 -hr <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> exceeded 75 ppb (the 95 th percentile). The ozone effect was not significantly influenced by the addition of weather or other pollutant variables into the model or by the exclusion of repeat ED visits.

Simulated, <b>maximum</b> hourly <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were higher over continental and maritime areas of Greece influenced by the emissions of the large urban agglomerations. When air quality simulations were performed assuming zero maritime transport emissions, the greater part of Greece experienced reductions in <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> levels.

The model included anthropogenic molecular chlorine emissions, anthropogenic hypochlorous acid emissions from cooling towers and swimming pools, and chlorine released from sea-salt aerosols. The release of chlorine emissions from sea-salt aerosols was modeled using heterogeneous reactions involving chloride ions in aerosols and three gas-phase species. The gas-phase chlorine chemistry was combined with the Carbon Bond Mechanism and incorporated into the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system. Air quality model simulations were performed for July 2001 and the results obtained with and without chlorine emissions were analyzed.

Precursor emissions were constrained by the comprehensive data from the field campaign and the routine ambient air quality monitoring network. Simulated plume mixing and transport were examined by comparing with measurements from the G- 1 aircraft during the campaign. The observed <b>concentrations</b> of <b>ozone</b> precursors and ozone were reasonably well reproduced by the model. The effects of reducing precursor emissions on urban ozone production were performed for three representative emission control scenarios. A 50 % reduction in VOC emissions led to 7 to 22 ppb decrease in daily <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> while a 50 % reduction in NO x emissions leads to 4 to 21 ppb increase, and 50 % reductions in both NO x and VOC emission decrease the daily <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> up to 10 ppb.

40|$|Using a {{tethered}} balloon, vertical {{air pollutant}} concentrations (CO, SO, NO, NO, and 03) were measured in central Taiwan during field campaigns in the winters of 1999 and 2001. Modified novel lightweight sampling equipment {{was used to}} take samples at heights of 1, 13, 100, 300, 500 and 1200 m. A balloon was launched every 3 h and in total there were 133 flights during the three campaigns. The data were collected {{in order to examine}} the temporal and vertical variations of pollutants. The average daytime profiles showed greater vertical convection mixing in unstable circumstances. The characteristics of shapes and time behavior of profiles are reported. Except for a slight decrease near the ground and strong photochemical reactions at clear daytime, titration Of 03 by NO was observed at all altitudes in the atmospheric boundary layer during these campaigns. Ground level ozone may be contributed by downward mixing from above. A fair correlation appeared between the <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> at the surface during the daytime ((C) over bar (0 Max) and average ozone concentration above the NBL ((C) over bar (aNBL)) A linear regression equation is shown as (C) over bar (0 Max) = 29 + 0. 91 (C) over bar (aNBL).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) {{for the short term}} prediction of <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the East Austrian region. Various Multilayer Perceptron topologies (MLPs), Elman Networks (EN) and Modified Elman Networks (MEN) were tested. The individual models used ozone, temperature, cloud cover and wind data taken from the summer months from 1995 and 1996. The achieved results were satisfactory. Comparisons with alternative models showed that the neural approaches used in this study were superior. Introduction Ozone O 3 manifests itself in its effect on organisms as a poisonous gas. It results in irritation of the respiratory system and shows effects on the health especially of children. Empirically, the highest concentrations are found downwinds of conurbations such as the Viennese basin and mostly in the summer season. A reason for this is the emission of precessor substances and the available time for producing ozone. In order to provide adequate [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{synoptic}} scale transport climatology during days with {{high and low}} <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> was established for "ve summers from 1991 to 1995 over eastern North America. The airmass transport patterns were estimated from source impact regions derived from forward airmass histories. Daily <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were used to de"ne locally and regionally high- (90 th percentile) and low- (10 th percentile) ozone days. Examination of transport during locally high-ozone days revealed that there is poor transport in {{the central part of}} the domain, i. e. from Tennessee to northern Indiana, and in the South from Texas to South Carolina due to stagnating or recirculating air masses. However, high <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> over the western and northern sections of the domain occurred during strong and persistent southerly and westerly winds, respectively. In addition, on average, high <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> surrounding {{the central part of the}} domain were associated with transport from this region. These results support the notion that ozone exceedances in the central and Southeastern US are predominately ‘homegrownawhile the western and northern section of the domain are also in#uenced by regional transport. In contrast, on low-ozone days, the transport was predominantly from outside (e. g., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico) into the Eastern US. The transport conditions during regionally high-ozone days were characterized by slow meandering transport over Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, with a strong clockwise transport around this region of stagnation.

40|$|The SAPRC 90 {{chemical}} mechanism {{implemented in}} CALGRID is modified and updated {{for the specific}} emissions and applications of the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV) of British Columbia, Canada. Explicit reactions related to biogenic emissions and alternative fuels are added. The sensitivity of ozone formation to rate parameters in the mechanism is determined for an episode specific trajectory which originates under relatively clean marine conditions and passes over the urban core of Vancouver during the morning rush hour. Of the 137 reactions in the modified mechanism, the rate constants of 44 reactions are {{found to have a}} high sensitivity on ozone formation. The 44 reactions are further divided into general sensitive reactions, for which rate constant changes near the base case values have observable effects on <b>maximum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> and limit-sensitive reactions, for which rate constant changes of more than an order of magnitude are required to have an observable impact on <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> For the sensitive reactions, both ozone sensitivity coefficients for small changes (20 %) in the rate constants and effects on ozone caused by large rate constant changes (factors of 0, 0. 5, and 2) are calculated. Of note is the importance of several photolysis reactions and the reactions of OH with a class of reactive aromatics, including xylenes, on <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the LFV.
