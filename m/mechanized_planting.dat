50|$|The villagers have {{initiated}} {{a process of}} regeneration in barren common land. The Youth Club has taken {{the responsibility for the}} project and the whole village has united to protect this land from grazing, lopping and fire. The experience shows that in those areas where soil is present, natural regeneration is the most efficient and least expensive method of bringing barren area under free cover. In the areas in which topsoil is washed off, tree planting - especially of indigenous, fast-growing species - is done. The irony is that the forest department is resorting to the <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> of exotic species, and also uses huge amounts of fertilizers on these exotic, monoculture plantations. This work will definitely harm the soil, and eventually the tree cover, in the area. Two obvious techniques of greening are being performed: one the forest department's method, is capital intensive, and the other, the people's technique of growing through regeneration, is a natural process for sustainable development of the soil.|$|E

In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the operational performance of sugarcane <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> in two operation shifts. The <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> was conducted in the municipality area of Monte Alto – São Paulo (SP), Brazil. The statistical design was completely randomized, totaling 80 sampling points, from which 40 points for daytime operation and 40 points for nighttime operation. The variables evaluated were: displacement speed, engine rpm, engine oil pressure, engine water temperature, effective field capacity, and hourly and effective fuel consumption. The coefficient of variation is greater for the alignment of the tractor at night shift, while the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis are higher during day shift.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{quality of}} the {{sugarcane}} plantation affects the plantation longevity, yield and production costs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of sugarcane <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> in day and night shifts. The <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> {{was carried out in}} Ivinhema, MS, Brazil. For the evaluation of pre-planting seedlings, were collected 40 billets in the seedling area with 10 repetitions for each shift. For the other variables, it was held sampling, totaling 60 points, 30 points assessed for each shift. The variables evaluated were: total of natural damage and total of mechanized damage in pre-planting, shoot per meter, viable shoots per meter, total of unviable shoots, seedlings consumption and failures percentage. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical quality control. The attributes showed stable <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> process, that is, with quality, except only for the seedlings consumption and failures for the day shift that presented unstable process or outside the proposed standards to achieve quality.

In this context, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the operation quality of sugarcane <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> in two operation shifts, by means of statistical process control. The <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> was held on March 2012 and statistical design was completely randomized with two treatments, totaling 40 replications for the day shift and 40 replications for the night shift.

40|$|To {{increase}} <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting,</b> {{planting machine}} productivity must increase {{in order to}} improve cost-efficiency. To determine if excavators with two crane arms could potentially help to increase planting machine productivity under Nordic clearcut conditions, we modelled one- armed and semi-automated two-armed excavators with one- and two-headed planting devices. Using a recently developed tool for discrete-event simulation, these machine models then mounded and planted seedlings on terrain models with moraine soil having various frequencies of obstacles (stumps, roots and stones). Compared to if the two heads were mounted pairwise on only one arm, the results showed that productivity did not increase if two planting heads were attached individually to two separate crane arms. But productivity did increase if the planting machine had four planting heads mounted pairwise on two separate arms. However, despite assuming automated mounding and crane motion between planting spots, the two-armed, four- headed model never achieved high enough productivity levels to make it more cost-efficient than one-armed machines. The simulations illustrate that our terrain models generate realistic root architecture and boulder content distributions in moraine soil, while our machine models functionally describe <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> work. Based on our assumptions, we conclude that further development work on two-armed excavator-based planting machines for Nordic clearcut conditions is not warranted. Our simulations reveal that increasing the number of planting heads per crane arm rather than number of crane arms per base machine offers the greatest potential to raise the productivity of intermittently advancing planting machines...|$|E

Despite this fact, very few Filipinos became contractors, as they were halted from advancing past the position of foreman.

This thesis {{has been carried out}} on behalf of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Umeå, to continue developing the technologies for <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting.</b> Benchmarking of existing devices was carried out to increase the knowledge about earlier problems and successes. The benchmarking comprises basic information about the most influential mechanical planting machines throughout the last three decades and influenced the following need finding as well as the detail design of the final device. The need finding process clarifies the problem to be solved in order to design a successful device by dissecting it to its core values and answers what the customer really needs. The need finding was based on research and interviews carried out with manufacturers and operators.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} mechanizing tree planting in southern Sweden is the biologically good planting results produced by today's tree planting machines. Nevertheless, {{the productivity of}} these tracked excavators with crane-mounted tree planting devices is too low for them to compete economically with manual planting. The objective of this thesis was to investigate concepts for 1) seedling packaging, 2) base machines, 3) planting devices, and 4) seedling carousels that could cost-efficiently increase the productivity of today's planting machines in southern Sweden. Article I analyzed the cost-efficiency of two seedling packaging concepts that decrease {{the time needed to}} reload planting devices with seedlings. The analysis showed, however, that machine-specific seedling packaging was costlier than delivering the seedlings in their cultivation trays, although band-mounted seedlings will probably be the most flexible and cost-efficient packaging system as <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> becomes more common. Article II and III used a discrete-event simulation tool and detailed terrain, machine, and planting device models to simulate the productivity of conceptual two-armed excavators and multi-headed crane-mounted planting devices. Two arms per excavator proved to be an inefficient concept for increasing the productivity of today's planting machines when compared to multi-headed planting devices. Although four planting heads per device was the most productive configuration on easy to moderate terrain, three-headed devices were best at combining high productivity with acceptable silvicultural results on all terrain types. Article IV used a test-rig to study the feasibility of tray-wise seedling reloading on today's most common planting device. Seedling reloading was twice as fast when done tray-wise rather than seedling-wise, and deplugging proved to be a reliable method of extracting seedlings from suitable cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. Overall, this thesis confirms that there is high potential for technical improvements that increase the productivity and lower the planting costs of today's tree planting machines. Such improvements will likely include faster seedling reloading via tray-wise-loaded carousels or band-mounted seedlings, multi-headed planting devices that produce high quality planting spots using adapted soil preparation methods, and sensors that aid the operator in choosing microsites...|$|E

And lastly the <b>mechanized</b> <b>planting</b> system is cheaper than the conventional one {{and none of the}} machines has an adequate mechanism for placing the right amount of sugar cane seed. O Brasil é o maior produtor de cana com área de 7 milhões de hectares. O sistema de plantio mais utilizado é o semimecanizado (sulcação mecânica, distribuição e picamento das mudas manual e cobertura de sulco com máquina). A carência e o custo de mão de obra têm aumentado, mostrando a necessidade de mecanização total da operação. Atualmente a indústria de máquinas oferece seis diferentes modelos de plantadoras (duas de mudas inteiras e quatro de mudas picadas). Todas plantam duas fileiras por vez, no espaçamento de 1, 5 m. O estudo analisou as variáveis velocidade efetiva (km h- 1), capacidade efetiva (ha h- 1), força de tração na barra (kgf), potência na barra (HP), consumo de combustível (L h- 1) e custos (US$ ha- 1), confrontando essas variáveis com o sistema semi-mecanizado. Caracterizaram-se, ainda, as mudas em termos de gemas viáveis (%), não viáveis (%) e comprimento dos rebolos (m). O sistema mecanizado foi mais barato que o semimecanizado. Nenhuma máquina apresentou mecanismo dosador de mudas adequado...|$|E
50|$|Ostashkov {{workshop}} which {{remained in}} the town, repaired the damaged ships. As the Ostashkov tannery was evacuated to Kazakhstan the only industries {{remained in the}} town were: workshop, power <b>plant,</b> <b>mechanized</b> bakery and mill. All of them were mined in case of capturing them by Germans. The power plant was operated by several workers and it was often bombed by Luftwaffe. It was also lacked of fuel and power plant workers had to disassemble the wooden buildings inside the power plant territory and use them as a fuel.|$|R
40|$|A {{mulberry}} {{harvesting machine}} and harvesting & pruning machine {{have been designed}} newly to suit for sericulture use which save cost and labour. The machines were tested in local field and suit better. Sericulture or silk culture is a labour intensive rural industry. At present it faces a shortage of labour force. Harvesting and pruning of mulberry plants are the most critical activities involved in sericulture. In the survey, 80 % sericulturists felt that the harvesting and pruning are most tedious and stressful activities. The main reasons are high work stress, less rest and health problems associated with it. Hence, labourers show less interest towards sericulture. Hence, mechanized way of harvesting and pruning may be an alternative approach to minimize the problem. The Japanese scientists developed a harvesting and pruning equipment attached to tiller. This machine has certain limitation to Indian cultivation. Hence, a design methodology has been framed to develop <b>mechanized</b> mulberry <b>plant</b> harvesting and pruning system to suite Indian mulberry plantation {{and at the same}} time cost effective...|$|R
50|$|Harvesting of {{poppy straw}} is an alternative, largely <b>mechanized</b> method. The <b>plants</b> {{are allowed to}} mature fully, then a machine is used to harvest the entire field. The ripe poppy seeds are {{separated}} out by threshing and winnowing, and the remainder is poppy straw. Poppy straw usually consists of only the above ground parts of the plant, but the roots may be harvested as well. Some producers mow the plants high, so that the harvest consists almost entirely of the fruits (seed pods), omitting the stalks, leaves, and roots. Poppy straw is then processed {{in a manner similar}} to opium to extract opiates and other alkaloids (see Morphine).|$|R
