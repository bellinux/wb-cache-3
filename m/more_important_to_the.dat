As a result, {{he returned to the}} Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses in April 1864, and saw no further combat {{for the rest of his}} career. Before the war was over, on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to brigadier general for meritorious service.|$|E

Tech {{averaged}} 254yards rushing per game, the eighth-highest average in the nation. Important to that success was running back Shyrone Stith, who had 1,119rushing yards during the regular season. Even <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hokies' success, however, was quarterback Michael Vick.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{owes its}} {{survival}} {{to a small}} group of enthusiasts, working with the French National Stud. A genetic study performed in 1994 revealed a genetic bottleneck in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Québec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of inbreeding, leading the Unité Nationale de Sélection et de Promotion de Race to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998. At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and Belgian horses was suggested to increase genetic diversity using morphologically and historically similar breeds. The French government distributes bonuses to the owners of the best stallions, a program <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Poitevin than to other draft breeds because of the significant possibility of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly {{distributed}} between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm {{at a distance of}} up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E

25|$|St. George {{was founded}} as a cotton mission in 1861 under the {{direction}} of Apostle Erastus Snow. It was called Dixie by Brigham Young, who was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While early settlers cultivated cotton as a commodity crop, they did not succeed in producing it at competitive market rates; consequently, cotton farming was eventually abandoned. <b>More</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economy was tourism, which developed as the railroads began to carry visitors to the nearby Zion National Park.|$|E

25|$|The {{first port}} in Taranaki {{to engage in}} {{international}} trade was Waitara, in 1823, when the barque William Stoveld anchored in the river mouth and traded with the Maori.

However the river has a bar at its entrance which can only be crossed at high tide. With the development of a breakwater at the port in New Plymouth, and the railway to New Plymouth the Waitara port quickly became unimportant.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} was substantially {{a repeat of}} the earlier Operation Calendar, in which the American aircraft carrier USS Wasp had flown off 48 British Spitfire fighter reinforcements to Malta. Aircraft, support personnel and airfields had inadequately prepared to receive the Spitfires and the Axis air forces were forewarned of the arrival of the new fighters. Many of the Spitfires had been destroyed on the ground by air attacks after their arrival on Malta.

When Philip of Taranto returned in 1304, one Albanian noble, Gulielm Blinishti, was appointed head of Angevin army in the Kingdom of Albania with the title marascallum regnie Albaniae. He was succeeded in 1318 by Andrea I Muzaka. From 1304 on, other western titles of nobility were bestowed by the Angevins upon the local Albanian lords.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, some groups of Isleños emigrated {{to other areas}} of Louisiana. Many Isleños {{initially}} opposed the coming of the railroad to Saint Bernard parish in 1850, but it meant easier transportation of their sugarcane, harvested produce and dressed game animals to New Orleans. In the 1860s some of the Isleños fought in the American Civil War on the Confederate side. After the end of the war, there were food shortages throughout the South, including St. Bernard parish, and hunting became even <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Isleños, as it already was for the Cajuns around New Orleans.|$|E

25|$|As Jewish {{thought in}} Babylonia declined, the {{tolerance}} of al-Andalus {{made it the}} new centre of Jewish intellectual endeavours. Poets and commentators like Judah Halevi (1086–1145) and Dunash ben Labrat (920–990) contributed to the cultural life of al-Andalus, but the area was even <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of Jewish philosophy. A stream of Jewish philosophers, cross-fertilizing with Muslim philosophers (see joint Jewish and Islamic philosophies), culminated with the widely celebrated Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, Maimonides (1135–1205), {{though he did not}} actually do any of his work in al-Andalus, his family having fled persecution by the Almohads when he was 13.|$|E
25|$|All Orthodox Christians, {{including}} Bulgarians, in the Ottoman Empire were {{subordinated to}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which {{was dominated by}} Greek Phanariotes {{by the end of}} the 19th century. The Orthodox Christians were included into the Rum Millet. Belonging to this Orthodox community grew <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common people than their ethnic origins and the Balkan Orthodox people identified themselves simply as Christians. Nevertheless, ethnonymes never disappeared and some form of ethnic identification was preserved as evident from a Sultan's Firman from 1680, which lists the ethnic groups in the Balkan lands as follows: Greeks (Rum), Albanians (Arnaut), Serbs (Sirf), Vlachs (Eflak) and Bulgarians (Bulgar).|$|E

25|$|But <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a Data Source Name (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a specific data source, versus the DBMS itself.

The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} {{refrigeration}} was {{directly related to}} the growth and development of farming in the country. In the 19th century, the bulk of economic activity was in the South Island of New Zealand. From around 1900, dairy farming became increasingly viable in areas which were less suitable for sheep, particularly in Northland, the Waikato and Taranaki. As dairying developed, the North Island slowly became <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economy. As more land was cultivated and farmed, Britain became the sole market for New Zealand meat and animal products. The dairy farming can therefore be seen {{as a response to the}} powerful market demands in Europe, transforming not only New Zealand’s countryside, economy and production techniques, but also causing migration in order to create the needed supply of dairy farming.|$|E

On 1 July 1957 the U.S. Army Air Defense Center was established at Fort Bliss. Located at this Center, in addition to Center Headquarters, are the U.S. Army Air Defense School; Air Defense; the 6th Artillery Group (Air Defense); the 61st Ordnance Group; and other supporting elements. In 1957 Fort Bliss and its anti-aircraft personnel began using Nike Ajax, Nike Hercules, Hawk, Sprint, Chaparral, and Redeye missiles.
