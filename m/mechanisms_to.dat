5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than a machine gun, but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> {{automatically}} load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a machine gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> maintain function {{in the presence of}} residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the muscle's maximal capacity, enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using ligaments for stability, which enables greater mobility.|$|E

5|$|Properly {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} able to fly through snowstorms under Instrument Flight Rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise {{the safety of the}} aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins had received new designs between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head design for the nickel, and commissioned Fraser to do the work. They were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections.|$|E
5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E

5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins {{to protect themselves from}} their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution has {{led to the development of}} very specific mutualisms in such systems.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 1933, White {{sponsored}} a resolution {{for the creation}} of a special committee on economy and efficiency to study state and municipal government spending. The committee was charged with making investigations, developing recommendations, and drafting bills to empower its recommendations. It was further permitted to summon witnesses, examine records, and to investigate all state and local government organizations to recommend further <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> affect efficiency and economy. White was appointed to the committee, which consisted of the speaker of the House of Delegates, the president of the West Virginia Senate, and two members from each house.|$|E
5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting {{was the creation of}} the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation. Simpson had been thinking about such an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus uses two key <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> {{evade the}} immune system. First, it {{is capable of}} {{surviving}} the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of infected cells {{is to produce}} interferon, a cytokine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting {{the production of a}} large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have <b>mechanisms</b> <b>to</b> slow down this process. Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E
