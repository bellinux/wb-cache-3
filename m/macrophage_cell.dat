However, chemical and biological properties and activities of Anacardium occidentale are poorly investigated and known. Here, we evaluated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities “in vitro” of leaf extract from Anacardium occidentale. Our results show that leaf extract exhibits antioxidant activity when used to treat RAW 264. 7 <b>macrophage</b> <b>cells.</b> Antioxidant effects were observed by decrease in oxidative damage in <b>macrophage</b> <b>cells</b> treated with 0. 5 [*]µg/mL and 5 [*]µg/mL of leaf extract. Moreover, leaf extract reversed oxidative damage and inflammatory parameters induced in LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 <b>macrophage</b> <b>cells.</b> Leaf extract at 0. 5 [*]µg/mL and 5 [*]µg/mL was able to inhibit release of TNF-α and IL- 1 β in LPS-stimulated cells. Taken together, our results indicate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of leaf extract from Anacardium occidentale and reveal the positive effects that intake of these products can mediate in biological system...|$|R
40|$|The {{previous}} artificial infection {{known that}} the Indonesian Thin Tail (ITT) sheep was resistance against the liver fluke of Fasciola gigantica, the resistances occurred in the early infection. In order to observe the immune resistance, some in vitro studies were undertaken in the laboratory, to assay {{the ability of the}} antisera antibody of ITT sheep post-infected with F. gigantica, with the presence of <b>macrophages</b> <b>cells</b> in killing the homologous and heterologous liver flukes. The viability of liver flukes were observed within 24 - 72 hours of incubation period by observing their motility (motile flukes were designated live and non-motile once were death). The results showed that after 72 hours incubation, the motilities of the Newly Excysted Juvenile (NEJ) of F. gigantica incubated with the presence of post-infected sera and <b>macrophages</b> <b>cells</b> solution were significantly lower (P 0. 05). It seems that the occurrence of homologous antibody to the antigens is very important in the development of killing mechanism. The absence of homologous antibody did not reduce the number of flukes or the ability of <b>macrophages</b> <b>cells</b> in killing F. hepatica was not apparent...|$|R
