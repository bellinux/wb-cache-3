5|$|It was {{the first}} <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> great {{importance}} and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but {{the value of the}} codex was differently appreciated by different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of the New Testament manuscripts. Codex Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT uncial manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci (1730) that Codex A is the oldest and the best <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> New Testament, and should be the basis in every reconstruction of the New Testament text. Codex Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the Textus Receptus (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).|$|E

5|$|After a lacuna in the <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> the poem, Hymiskviða {{abruptly}} {{picks up}} again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea. Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his {{line with the}} head of the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Along with Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus is {{considered}} one of the most valuable manuscripts for establishing the original text (textual criticism) of the Greek New Testament, as well as the Septuagint. It is the only uncial manuscript with the complete text of the New Testament, and the only ancient <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> the New Testament written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating the Codex Sinaiticus and the proposed lifetime of Jesus, it {{is considered}} to be more accurate than most later New Testament copies in preserving superior readings where many later manuscripts are in error.|$|E
5|$|Anquetil Duperron, a French Orientalist {{received}} a <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> the Oupanekhat and translated the Persian version into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation {{in two volumes}} in 1801–1802 as Oupneck'hat. The French translation was never published. The Latin version was the initial introduction of Upanishadic thought to Western scholars. However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning.|$|E

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|As local {{hostilities}} {{between the}} loyalists and revolutionaries escalated in the build-up to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Crèvecœur {{decided to return}} to France; scholars have suggested that he did so in order to secure his legal claim to his patrimony. Upon his arrival in New York City in 1778, Crèvecœur found himself under suspicion of being a Revolutionary spy and was detained; whilst in detention, he suffered a nervous collapse. He was released to travel in September 1780, and traveled to London after landing in Ireland. There, he sold the <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> Letters to publishers Davies & Davis before leaving for France.|$|E
5|$|Between 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a {{considerable}} amount of drama, reading many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play The Cenci, and she transcribed the <b>manuscript</b> <b>of</b> his drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate Vittorio Alfieri's play Mirra (1785), a tragedy about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel Mathilda.|$|E
