2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that sleep bruxism is caused by mechanisms related to the central nervous system, involving sleep arousal and neurotransmitter abnormalities. Underlying these factors may be psychosocial factors including daytime stress which is disrupting peaceful sleep. Sleep bruxism is mainly characterized by [...] "rhythmic <b>masticatory</b> muscle activity" [...] (RMMA) at a frequency of about once per second, and also with occasional tooth grinding. It {{has been shown that}} the majority (86%) of sleep bruxism episodes occur during periods of sleep arousal. One study reported that sleep arousals which were experimentally induced with sensory stimulation in sleeping bruxists triggered episodes of sleep bruxism. Sleep arousals are a sudden change in the depth of the sleep stage, and may also be accompanied by increased heart rate, respiratory changes and muscular activity, such as leg movements. Initial reports have suggested that episodes of sleep bruxism may be accompanied by gastroesophageal reflux, decreased esophageal pH (acidity), swallowing, and decreased salivary flow. Another report suggested a link between episodes of sleep bruxism and a supine sleeping position (lying face up).|$|E
60|$|After {{the most}} careful {{dissection}} of very many specimens, and their examination {{in many different}} methods (as by caustic potash, &c.), I can venture positively to assert {{that there is no}} vestige of a mouth, or <b>masticatory</b> organs, or stomach: I did not see any anus, but I will not affirm that such does not exist.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--This {{is seated}} {{in exactly the}} same {{position}} as in the mature Cirripede, on a slight prominence, fronting the thoracic limbs, and so far within the carapace, that it was obviously quite unfitted for the seizure of prey; and it was equally obvious, that the limbs were natatory, and incapable of carrying food to the mouth. This enigma was at once explained by an examination of the mouth, which was found to be in a rudimentary condition and absolutely closed, so {{that there would be no}} use in prey being seized. Underneath this slightly prominent and closed mouth, I found all the <b>masticatory</b> organs of a Cirripede, in an immature condition. The state of the mouth will be at once understood, if we suppose very fluid matter to be poured over the protuberant mouth of a Cirripede, so as to run a little way down, in the shape of internal crests, between the different parts, and in the shape of a short, shrivelled, certainly closed tube, a little way (.008 of an inch in L. australis) down the oesophagus. Hence, the larva in this, its last stage, cannot eat; it may be called a locomotive Pupa;[11] its whole organisation is apparently adapted for the one great end of finding a proper site for its attachment and final metamorphosis.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{the several}} {{foregoing}} modifications would become hereditary, {{if the same}} habits of life were followed during many generations, is not known, but is probable. Rengger[161] attributes the thin legs and thick arms of the Payaguas Indians to successive generations having passed nearly their whole lives in canoes, with their lower extremities motionless. Other writers {{have come to a}} similar conclusion in other analogous cases. According to Cranz,[162] who lived for a long time with the Esquimaux, “the natives believe that ingenuity and dexterity in seal-catching (their highest art and virtue) is hereditary; there is really something in it, for the son of a celebrated seal-catcher will distinguish himself though he lost his father in childhood.” But in this case it is mental aptitude, quite as much as bodily structure, which appears to be inherited. It is asserted that the hands of English labourers are at birth larger than those of the gentry.[163] From the correlation which exists, at least in some cases,[164] between the development of the extremities and of the jaws, it is possible that in those classes which do not labour much with their hands and feet, the jaws would be reduced in size from this cause. That they are generally smaller in refined and civilised men than in hard-working men or savages, is certain. But with savages, as Mr. Herbert Spencer[165] has remarked, the greater use of the jaws in chewing coarse, uncooked food, would act in a direct manner on the <b>masticatory</b> muscles and on the bones to which they are attached. In infants long before birth, the skin on the soles of the feet is thicker than on any other part of the body;[166] and it can hardly be doubted that {{this is due to the}} inherited effects of pressure during a long series of generations.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--This is prominent, {{and almost}} probosciformed (Pl. IX, fig. 4 b), {{and in the}} {{abnormal}} Anelasma (Pl. IV, fig. 2 d), quite probosciformed,--such, also, was its character in the larval condition. In outline, it is either sub-triangular, or oval with the longer axis transverse; the whole is capable, {{as well as the}} separate organs, of considerable movement, as I have seen in living sessile Cirripedes. It is composed (Tab. V, fig. 2) of a labrum, swollen or bullate, often to such an extent as to equal in its longitudinal axis the rest of the mouth; of palpi soldered to the labrum; of mandibles, maxillæ, and outer maxillæ, the latter serving as a lower lip. These organs have only their upper segments free, but there are traces, clearly seen in the mandibles (Pl. X, fig. 1, a, b), of their being formed of three segments. The two lower segments are laterally united, and open into each other, the prominence of the mouth being thus caused: this condition appears to me curious, and is, to a certain limited extent, intermediate between those articulated animals which have their trophi soldered into a proboscis, and those furnished with entirely free <b>masticatory</b> or prehensile organs. The palpi adhere to the corners of the labrum; and I call them palpi only from seeing that they spring laterally from above the upper articulation of the mandibles. The prominence of the mouth, measured from the basal fold by which the whole is separated from the body, is much greater on the half formed by the labrum and mandibles, than on the other half facing the cirri. The trophi surround a cavity--the supra-oesophageal cavity--in the middle of which, between the mandibles is seated the orifice of the oesophagus. The oesophagus is surrounded by long, fine, muscular fasciæ, radiating in all directions, opposing the constrictor muscles, and is capable of violent swallowing movements,--constriction after constriction being seen to run down its whole course: there are also some fine muscles attached to the membrane forming the supra-oesophageal cavity. The trophi serve merely for the prehension of prey, and not for mastication.|$|E
