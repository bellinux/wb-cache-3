5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the <b>mesothorax</b> and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax. The <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and <b>mesothorax.</b> The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the <b>mesothorax,</b> and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|The thorax is a tagma {{composed}} of three sections, the prothorax, <b>mesothorax</b> and the metathorax. The anterior segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the <b>mesothorax,</b> with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the <b>mesothorax</b> is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, {{as well as the}} mesosternum and metasternum, are used.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera. The prothorax is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the <b>mesothorax</b> is the most developed.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the <b>mesothorax</b> {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further {{adaptation}} for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the <b>mesothorax</b> and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a <b>mesothorax,</b> and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears {{three pairs}} of legs, one pair on each segment. The {{prothorax}} (T1) has a functional spiracle which is actually derived from the <b>mesothorax</b> (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, trochanter and femur are fused.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, <b>mesothorax</b> and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} scutellum) and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal plate of the prothorax) is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton plate of the <b>mesothorax)</b> is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E
25|$|The {{prothorax}} on this conehead is shielded {{by a large}} pronotum {{that extends}} from over the cervix (neck) on the anterior side to cover the <b>mesothorax</b> {{and most of the}} metathorax on the posterior side, as well as covering the pleura on the prothorax. The pronotum of the prothorax may be simple in structure and small in comparison with the other nota, but in beetles, mantids, many bugs, and some Orthoptera, the pronotum is expanded, and in cockroaches, it forms a shield that covers part of the head and <b>mesothorax.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pupa: Resembles that of Graphium species. It has {{a smooth}} head and {{prominent}} dorsal horn. It has a green <b>mesothorax</b> and broad yellow dorsal zones on the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The ventral view or sternum {{follows the}} same convention, with the {{prosternum}} under the prothorax, the mesosternum under the <b>mesothorax</b> and the metasternum under the metathorax. The notum, pleura, and sternum of each segment {{have a variety}} of different sclerites and sutures, varying greatly from order to order, and they will not be discussed in detail in this section.|$|E
25|$|Because the <b>mesothorax</b> and {{metathorax}} {{hold the}} wings, {{they have a}} combined name called the pterothorax (pteron = wing). The forewing, which goes by different names in different orders (e.g., the tegmina in Orthoptera and elytra in Coleoptera), arises between the mesonotum and the mesopleura, and the hindwing articulates between the metanotum and metapleura. The legs arise from the mesopleura and metapleura. The <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax each have a pleural suture (mesopleural and metapleural sutures) that runs from the wing base to the coxa of the leg. The sclerite anterior to the pleural suture is called the episternum (serially, the mesepisternum and metepisternum). The sclerite posterior to the suture is called the epimiron (serially, the mesepimiron and metepimiron). Spiracles, the external organs of the respiratory system, are found on the pterothorax, usually one between the pro- and mesopleoron, {{as well as one}} between the meso- and metapleuron.|$|E
25|$|The insect thorax {{has three}} segments: the prothorax, <b>mesothorax,</b> and metathorax. The {{anterior}} segment, {{closest to the}} head, is the prothorax; its major features are the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax; its major features are the second pair of legs and the anterior wings, if any. The third, the posterior, thoracic segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which bears the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron), and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the <b>mesothorax</b> is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, {{there is also the}} mesopleura and metapleura, as well as the mesosternum and metasternum.|$|E
25|$|Haliplidae larvae have a {{long and}} slender body with a tough exoskeleton. They can be {{recognized}} by their specialized mouthparts, carried on a small head. The maxillae and labium are adapted to manipulating the algae the larvae feed on, while the mandibles contain a channel through which fluids are sucked out of the food. The larval legs are short and carry a single claw each, but the forelegs have various adaptations for climbing among water plants. Respiration is via gills which are either long and filamentous, or (in Peltodytes) short microtracheal extensions; they are carried on the tergites of all sternal and all but the tenth (last) abdominal segments. The latter may be absent, but in the larvae of some Haliplidae it is tapering and ends in two prongs (which are not urogomphi though). The last (third) instar has functional spiracles on the <b>mesothorax</b> {{and the first to}} seventh abdominal segments.|$|E
25|$|The species Lucilia cuprina, {{formerly}} named Phaenicia cuprina, is {{more commonly}} known as the Australian sheep blowfly. It belongs to the blow-fly family Calliphoridae, and while some authorities combine the blow flies (Calliphoridae) and the flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) together into the Metopiidae family, distinguishable characteristics allow for the separation. Lucilia cuprina {{is a member of the}} order Diptera, has a pair of short but very strong membranous wings and a pair of hindwings reduced and modified to clublike balancers known as halteres. This adaptation distinguishes the true flies (Diptera) from the other orders with “fly” in their name, and serves as a sensory aid that acts as tiny gyroscopes or inertial navigation system. The <b>mesothorax</b> is much enlarged while the prothorax and metathorax are reduced. Blow flies are about the size of a house fly or a little larger, and though considered to be nuisances indoors are essential agents in the breakdown of organic matter. Most are metallic blue or green, and often have black gena, mostly white calypteres and orange yellow anterior thoracic spiracles.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments [...] the hindmost two, the <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax, being fused. Each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw. The legs are robust and often clad in bristles, hairs or spines. Wing pads develop on the <b>mesothorax,</b> and in some species, hindwing pads develop on the metathorax.|$|E
500|$|In general, meat ants are {{medium to}} large in size, {{measuring}} , {{and can be}} easily recognised by their dark-bluish body and red head. Generally, their heads and pronotums share similar colours and are lighter than the <b>mesothorax</b> (the middle of the three segments in the thorax) and the propodeum (the first abdominal segment), which are reddish brown. However, the head may sometimes be lighter, and the pronotum and <b>mesothorax</b> may share similar colours. The mesosomal setae (as in haur found on the mesosoma) are dark and sometimes translucent. The iridescence between the compound eyes and the lateral portion of the head ranges from slightly purple to strong and dark purple. The colour of the legs and coxae (the basal segment of the insect leg, which attaches to the body) are darker than the <b>mesothorax,</b> and the petiole (narrow waist) is reddish brown and also darker than the <b>mesothorax.</b> The lateral portion of the second gastral tergite (a dorsal segment other than the head) is shiny, and the iridescence varies among workers, from green or blue to plain green and purple. The soft hairs on the head are frequent around the occipital margin, and around the mandibular insertion, three to eight pale setae are usually seen. The soft hairs are also common around the first gastral tergite. Examined specimens show no known ocelli. Erect setae on the pronotum are abundant. The [...] (meaning in front and toward the back) portion of the propodeum is arched and flat.|$|E
500|$|The {{two pairs}} of wings are found on the middle and third segment, or <b>mesothorax</b> and {{metathorax}} respectively. In the more recent genera, {{the wings of the}} second segment are much more pronounced, however some more primitive forms have similarly sized wings of both segments. The wings are covered in scales arranged like shingles, forming the extraordinary variety seen in color. The <b>mesothorax</b> is evolved to have more powerful muscles to propel moth or butterfly through the air, with the wing of said segment having a stronger vein structure. The largest superfamily, Noctuidae, has the wings modified to act as Tympanal or hearing organs Modifications in the wing's venation include: ...|$|E
500|$|Insect {{wings are}} adult outgrowths of the insect {{exoskeleton}} that enable insects to fly. They are {{found on the}} second and third thoracic segments (the <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax), and the two pairs are {{often referred to as the}} forewings and hindwings, respectively, though a few insects lack hindwings, even rudiments. [...] The wings are strengthened by a number of longitudinal veins, which often have cross-connections that form closed [...] "cells" [...] in the membrane (extreme examples include the dragonflies and lacewings). The patterns resulting from the fusion and cross-connection of the wing veins are often diagnostic for different evolutionary lineages and can be used for identification to the family or even genus level in many orders of insects.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments as in all insects. The prothorax is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc which has two transverse ridges. The <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside it. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, veined, and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry haemolymph, which is analogous to blood in vertebrates and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stages (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed {{with a pair of}} claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an [...] "eyebrush", for cleaning the surface of the compound eye.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} L. sericata, and most used when identifying the adult fly {{is the presence of}} three bristles on the dorsal <b>mesothorax.</b> This body region is located on the middle {{of the back of the}} fly. L. sericata is almost identical to its sister species, L. cuprina. Identification between these requires microscopic examination of two main distinguishing characteristics. As opposed to L. cuprina, which has a metallic green femoral joint in the first pair of legs, L. sericata is blue-black. Also, when looking at the occipital setae, [...] L. sericata has one to nine bristles on each side, while L. cuprina has three or less.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} insects, the body {{consists}} of a head, thorax, and abdomen. [...] The thorax is divided into the prothorax, <b>mesothorax</b> and metathorax; the dorsal side of the prothorax is a sclerotized shield, the pronotum. [...] The Hister beetle has an exoskeleton made of chitin which gives protection to the internal organs. [...] The elytra and forewings are normally well developed in beetles, but in Histerdiae the elytra are shortened and rectangular. [...] The shortened elytra expose the final two of the seven tergites. Attached to the body are three pairs of jointed legs and two pairs of wings. [...] The head has compound eyes, a mandible mouthpart, and shortened antennae. [...] The eyes do not move; each takes {{a little piece of}} the picture to make a complete picture. [...] The Hister's mouthpart grasps and grinds the food with two teeth. [...] Lastly, the antennae work as sensory organs. [...] A distinctive characteristic is that the antennae are elbowed and contain three antennomeres that form a club at the end.|$|E
2500|$|The meron may {{be greatly}} {{enlarged}} by an extension distally in the posterior {{wall of the}} coxa; in the Neuroptera, Mecoptera, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera, the meron is so large that the coxa appears to be divided into an anterior piece, the so-called [...] "coxa genuina," [...] and the meron, but the meron never includes {{the region of the}} posterior trochanteral articulation, and the groove delimiting it is always a part of the basicostal suture. A coxa with an enlarged meron has an appearance similar to one divided by a coxal suture falling in line with the pleural suture, but the two conditions are fundamentally quite different and should not be confused. The meron reaches the extreme of its departure from the usual condition in the Diptera. In some of the more generalized flies, as in the Tipulidae, the meron of the middle leg appears as a large lobe of the coxa projecting upward and posteriorly from the coxal base; in higher members of the order it becomes completely separated from the coxa and forms a plate of the lateral wall of the <b>mesothorax.</b>|$|E

50|$|In dragonflies and damselflies the <b>mesothorax</b> and {{metathorax}} are fused {{together to}} form the synthorax.|$|E
50|$|Males {{and females}} have lemon-yellow {{abdominal}} segments. Females have a fine, central, longitudinal, black line along the <b>mesothorax,</b> which is transversely wrinkled. The <b>mesothorax</b> in males has two longitudinal {{lines on the}} side. Both sexes have yellow mandibles and narrow posterior orbits that are broader toward the bottom. Although caste separations are present in P. bellicosus, females in the colony are not morphologically different.|$|E
50|$|It is {{an unmistakable}} species, {{characterized}} by three continuous dark green dorsal lines {{extending from the}} anterior edge of the <b>mesothorax</b> {{to the tip of}} the abdomen. The upperside of the body has a narrow dorsal line and a pair of somewhat broader subdorsal lines running from the <b>mesothorax</b> to the tip of abdomen.

5000|$|The {{level of}} specialization—anatomical, {{functional}} and morphological—is such {{that in general}} these insects fly, often exceptionally, well, with particular reference to agility. All Diptera are equipped with only one pair of functional wings, which are on the <b>mesothorax</b> (front). The wings on the metathorax are transformed into the halteres or rocker arms. From this characteristic comes {{the name of the}} order, from the Greek dipteros, which means [...] "two wings". In consequence of this morphological structure, the <b>mesothorax</b> represents the segment of greater development and complexity, while the prothorax and metathorax are considerably reduced.|$|E
