40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{difficulties}} in definitions related to planted forests over recent decades, highlights trends in use of key definitions, recognizes processes underway to harmonize forest related definitions {{and points to the}} emerging way forward. Planted forests can resemble natural ecological processes {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. Increasingly planted forests of exotic species are referred to as plantation forests (with single or few species, even age class, uniform planting density). Planted forests of indigenous species are increasingly referred to as forms of semi-natural forest or <b>modified</b> <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> (depending on degree of naturalness, including mixed species and age classes and variable planting density). Planted forests are often intensively managed for production purposes, but can also be established for protection, conservation or socio-economic purposes in which case the management may be less intens ive. This distinction is important in global assessments that attempt to capture the extent of productive, protective, conservation of biological diversity, and socio-economic functions of forests, which are key criteria for sustainable forest management. The complementary global forest resources assessment process coordinated by FAO in collaboration with UNEP and UNECE under the guidance of an advisory group; and th...|$|E

In addition, we use the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process to conduct comprehensive-benefit evaluation on implementation of <b>Natural</b> <b>Forest</b> Protection Project in Southwest China. The results show that since ten years of implementation of <b>Natural</b> <b>Forest</b> Protection Project in Southwest China, it has gained considerable comprehensive benefit. The comprehensive evaluation index of <b>Natural</b> <b>Forest</b> Protection Project in Southwest China is 83. 08; the ecological benefit index of <b>Natural</b> <b>Forest</b> Protection Project in Southwest China is 56. 75; the economic benefit index of <b>Natural</b> <b>Forest</b> Protection Project in Southwest China is 19. 05; the social benefit index of <b>Natural</b> <b>Forest</b> Protection Project in Southwest China is 7. 28.

The first level is the classification of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> according to the internal abiotic conditions of the forests and the second is the classification based on the conditions of the external environment, which is in close proximity to the <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> and influence it. As characteristics of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> surroundings the groups of forest types were used as well as the Consolidated layer of ecosystems, which contains information on the anthropogenic influence on the landscape.

30|$|Different {{situations}} require different solutions. What {{would be}} the ecological basis for following different approaches and practices in invasive alien plant control in <b>natural</b> evergreen <b>forest,</b> grassland or shrubland? The taller-growing invasive alien plant stands shade out the light-demanding grassland and shrubland species; {{they need to be}} removed entirely from the landscape to enable the grasslands and shrublands to recover. This is contrary to the situation in <b>natural</b> evergreen <b>forest</b> systems. The disturbance-recovery processes in <b>natural</b> evergreen <b>forests</b> resulted in different species adaptations in terms of their regeneration and establishment ecology, relative to the shady conditions of mature forest. Recovery from severe <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> disturbances follows a successional sequence in which the early shade-intolerant pioneers in the recovery process nurse the establishment of gradually more and more shade-tolerant forest species, i.e. increases species richness of <b>forest</b> species. <b>Natural</b> <b>forest</b> systems have a diverse range of <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> species that form such pioneer stands, facilitating <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> recovery. Such systems can be sources of diverse products for livelihood needs while facilitating recovery of <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> diversity and productivity (Geldenhuys 2013 a; Mala et al. 2009). One could therefore expect differences in behavior in terms of forest recovery via shade-intolerant invasive alien plant stands. Several studies, globally, have shown the role of planted tree stands of both introduced and native species stands to facilitate or nurse the establishment of <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> species under their canopies (Knight et al. 1987; Geldenhuys 1992, 1996 a, 1997; Parrotta 1995; Loumeto & Huttel 1997; Parrotta & Turnbull 1997; Geldenhuys & Delvaux 2007). Forests also provide diverse timber, wood and non-wood products that are essential components of the livelihood needs of rural societies in many areas. Invasive alien plant stands in the <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> environment often provide alternative resources for products in short supply from the <b>natural</b> <b>forests.</b> Clearing such invasive alien plant stands may restart the pressure on <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> species (for poles, fuel wood, etc.) (Geldenhuys 1986, 1992, 1996 a, 2002; Geldenhuys et al. 2016).|$|R

The {{stock in the}} {{standing}} trees was larger in planted than in <b>natural</b> <b>forests,</b> but this difference was compensated by larger stocks in the soil and the debris of <b>natural</b> <b>forests.</b> ContextMost studies on the carbon stocks are focused on management strategies to maximize carbon stocks. We still lack data comparing planted vs <b>natural</b> conifer <b>forests.</b> AimsWe compared carbon storage in the different compartment (vegetation, soil, debris) along a chronosequence of Masson’s pine plantations vs <b>natural</b> <b>forests.</b> MethodsWe investigated 58 Masson’s pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) forest stands (20  m[*]×[*] 50  m plots), that differ in stand management (planted and <b>natural</b> <b>forests)</b> and age (young, middle-aged, and mature ages) and then calculated the carbon stock densities of vegetation biomass (tree, shrub, and herb), debris, and soil. ResultsThe carbon stock densities in the planted and <b>natural</b> Masson’s pine <b>forest</b> ecosystems ranged from 78 to 210  Mg ha− 1 and from 97 to 177  Mg ha− 1 respectively. The carbon stock densities in the vegetation were significantly greater in planted <b>forests</b> than in <b>natural</b> <b>forests.</b> A lower carbon stock density in debris and soil alleviated the increase of biomass carbon stock densities in planted vs <b>natural</b> <b>forests,</b> leading to similar carbon stock densities at ecosystem level.

In Fennoscandia, the decline of <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> has been a long process, including various historical uses of forests. However, the decline and the fragmentation of the remaining <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> profoundly accelerated with the rise of forest industry and intensification of forest management after World War II (Esseen et al. 1997; Keto-Tokoi and Kuuluvainen 2014).

40|$|The term forest {{transition}} {{refers to}} a change in forest cover over a given area from a period of net forest area loss to a period of net gain. Whether transitioning from deforestation to reforestation can lead to improved ecosystem services, depends on the quality and characteristics of the newly established forest cover. Using publicly available data, we examine forest transition in two regions of tropical China: Hainan Island and Xishuangbanna. We found that the overall increase of forest cover in both areas during the 1980 s was due to an increase in plantation forests rather than to increases in the area covered by <b>natural</b> <b>forest.</b> We also found a time lag between the increase in overall forest cover and an increase in <b>natural</b> <b>forest.</b> On Hainan Island, <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> continued to decline beyond the point in time when overall forest cover had started to increase, and only began to recover ten years after the turning point in 1978. In Xishuangbanna, where the transition point occurred ten years later, the decline of <b>natural</b> <b>forest</b> cover is still going on. These divergent trends underlying forest transition are concealed by the continued practice to apply the term “forest” broadly, without distinguishing between <b>natural</b> <b>forests</b> and planted forests.
