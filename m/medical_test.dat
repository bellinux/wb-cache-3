5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a <b>medical</b> <b>test</b> diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with a tap.|$|E

25|$|Test, in this sense, {{can refer}} to any <b>medical</b> <b>test</b> (but usually {{in the sense of}} {{diagnostic}} tests), and in a broad sense also including questions and even assumptions (such as assuming that the target individual is a female or male). The ability to make a difference between pre- and post-test probabilities of various conditions is {{a major factor in the}} indication of medical tests.|$|E
25|$|In this formula, what {{constitutes}} benefit or harm largely varies by {{personal and cultural}} values, but general conclusions can still be drawn. For example, if the only expected effect of a <b>medical</b> <b>test</b> is to make one disease more likely than another, but the two diseases have the same treatment (or neither can be treated), then ri = 0 and the test is essentially without any benefit for the individual.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of CLAT, the autonomous law schools in India conducted their own separate entrance tests, requiring the candidates to prepare and appear separately {{for each of these}} tests. The schedule of the administration of these tests sometimes conflicted with the other or with other major entrance tests such as the Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination and the All India Pre <b>Medical</b> <b>Test.</b> This caused students to miss tests and experience much stress.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{factors that}} {{influence}} a decision whether a <b>medical</b> <b>test</b> should be performed or not include: cost of the test, availability of additional tests, potential interference with subsequent test (such as an abdominal palpation potentially inducing intestinal activity whose sounds interfere with a subsequent abdominal auscultation), time taken for the test or other practical or administrative aspects. Also, even if not beneficial for the individual being tested, the results may be useful {{for the establishment of}} statistics in order to improve health care for other individuals.|$|E

25|$|NEET-UG (Undergraduate), for MBBS and BDS courses, was {{conducted}} in 2013 by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). NEET-UG replaced the All India Pre <b>Medical</b> <b>Test</b> (AIPMT) and all individual MBBS exams conducted by states or colleges themselves. However, many colleges and institutes took a stay order and conducted private examinations for admission to their MBBS and BDS courses. Nevertheless, many other reputed institutes such as the Armed Forces Medical College and Banaras Hindu University have opted to admit students {{on the basis of}} the NEET-UG. The first exam was held on 5 May 2013, and the results were announced on 5 June 2013.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, folic acid {{has begun to}} be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate {{deficiency}} is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for anemia and erythrocyte size are routinely done in even simple <b>medical</b> <b>test</b> clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the MTR-dependent effects of B12 deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine (homocysteinuria). This condition may result in long term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.|$|E
25|$|The issuing authority, {{usually a}} branch of the country's foreign {{ministry}} or department (e.g. U.S. State Department), and typically consular affairs officers, may request appropriate documentation from the applicant. This may include proof that the applicant is able to support himself in the host country (lodging, food), proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant, proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance, etc. Some countries ask for proof of health status, especially for long-term visas; some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses, such as AIDS. The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa. Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long-term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan. However, in Uzbekistan, the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced. Other countries require a <b>medical</b> <b>test</b> that includes an HIV test, even for a short-term tourism visa. For example, Cuban citizens and international exchange students require such a test approved by a medical authority to enter Chilean territory.|$|E
500|$|On 28 April 1941, McKenzie {{accompanied}} 14 of her WESC trainees (twelve telegraphists and two domestic helpers).

The women were dressed in their green WESC uniform which had been designed by McKenzie herself – it was several months before a female Navy uniform was ready. Francis Proven became WRANS number 1. From this initial intake of 14, the WRANS ranks expanded to some 2,600 {{by the end of}} the war, representing about 10 per cent of the entire Royal Australian Naval force at the time. All told, McKenzie trained about 3,000 women, one-third of whom went into the services. Many others remained at the Clarence Street school as instructors.|$|E

[...] She did not subscribe to the stereotypes that were expected of her and experimented with fashion from a young age, often pairing up accessories and clothes that would seem [...] "bizarre" [...] to her neighbours. Ranaut was educated at the DAV School in Chandigarh, where she pursued science as her core subject, remarking that she was [...] "very studious" [...] and [...] "always paranoid about [...] results".

However, a failed unit test in chemistry during her twelfth grade led Ranaut to reconsider her career prospects and despite preparing for the All India Pre <b>Medical</b> <b>Test,</b> she did not turn up for the exam.
