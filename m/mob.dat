40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor thesis {{covers the}} topic of <b>mobbing.</b> This phenomenon can also be labelled as psychological terror or bullying in the workplace. The {{first part of the}} bachelor thesis is theoretical and describes how the term <b>mobbing</b> arises and the history of the term <b>mobbing.</b> Then it describes what the term <b>mobbing</b> means and what similar terms include (bossing, staffing). The thesis further focuses on the causes of <b>mobbing</b> formation, the phases of <b>mobbing</b> and their progress. The thesis also deals with the consequences of <b>mobbing</b> and with the possibilities of <b>mobbing</b> prevention and solutions. The empirical part includes a quantitative analysis of <b>mobbing</b> occurrence and <b>mobbing</b> awareness among employees. Then it compares if there are any differences between the state administration and the commercial sphere.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Mobbing</b> is an {{occupational}} health problem at alarming levels in all cultures and professions worldwide regardless of sex, age, experience, education and hierarchy. <b>Mobbing</b> {{is a dynamic}} process, varying from simple to complex. <b>Mobbing,</b> causing psychological, physiological and social traumas on employee&# 146;s health {{that are hard to}} recover, is mostly seen in public and health sectors and individuals aged 30 - 40 years. It is known that more than 50 % of health care professionals are to be <b>mobbing</b> victims. Nurses are frequently <b>mobbing</b> victims, because they are at risk as they work in health care sector and are women. However, researches revealing reflections of <b>mobbing</b> experienced by nurses on care of sick or healthy individuals are not available. Researches revealing reflections of <b>mobbing</b> experienced by nurses on care of sick or healthy individuals and quality of care are required to evaluate the actual cost of <b>mobbing.</b> Yet, <b>mobbing</b> is legally accepted as guilt, the fight against <b>mobbing</b> is getting more important.

40|$|<b>Mobbing</b> signals {{advertise}} {{the location}} of a stalking predator to all prey in an area and recruit them into the inspection aggregation. Such behavior usually causes the predator to move to another area. However, <b>mobbing</b> calls could be eavesdropped by other predators. Because the predation cost of <b>mobbing</b> calls is poorly known, we investigated whether the vocalizations of the <b>mobbing</b> pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, a small hole nesting passerine, increase the risk of nest predation. We used <b>mobbing</b> calls of pied flycatchers to examine if they could lure predators such as the marten, Martes martes. This predator usually hunts by night and may locate its <b>mobbing</b> prey while resting nearby during the day. Within each of 56 experimental plots, from the top of one nest-box we played back <b>mobbing</b> sounds of pied flycatchers, whereas blank tapes were played from the top of another nest-box. The trials with <b>mobbing</b> calls were carried out before sunset. We put pieces of recently abandoned nests of pied flycatchers and a quail, Coturnix coturnix, egg into each of the nest-boxes. Nest-boxes with playbacks of <b>mobbing</b> calls were depredated by martens significantly more than were nest-boxes with blank tapes. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that repeated conspicuous <b>mobbing</b> calls may carry a significant cost for birds during the breeding season.

40|$|Abstract—People at {{workplace}} always {{face with}} stress and {{feel it in}} their lives. There are many factors that create stress and <b>mobbing</b> is one of them. <b>Mobbing</b> is a psychological terror, conducted systematically toward an individual by others at the same workplace. <b>Mobbing</b> started to become a famous subject last years in U. S and Europe. In Turkey, {{it is a new}} concept not because it does not occur, because of human nature that does not allow confessing it. <b>Mobbing</b> is being ignored by people, organizations and also government in our country. The focus of this study will be <b>mobbing</b> in Turkey by examining the workplace <b>mobbing</b> among Turkish academicians. There are other studies about <b>mobbing</b> in Turkey but none of them studied academy. Because <b>mobbing</b> methods change according to sectors and occupations, it is important to analyze each sector to understand the methods used in <b>mobbing</b> and the reactions of victims to these actions. The concept is analyzed in detail before focusing on <b>mobbing</b> at universities. This paper will be unique because there is no information about this specific subject in Turkish literature. In this paper, both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to describe the <b>mobbing</b> at Turkish academic environment.

40|$|Chickadees produce many vocalizations, {{including}} chick-a-dee calls {{which they}} {{use as a}} <b>mobbing</b> call {{in the presence of}} predators. Previous research has shown that chickadees produce more D notes in their <b>mobbing</b> calls in response to high-threat predators compared to low-threat predators, and may perceive predator and corresponding <b>mobbing</b> vocalizations as similar. We presented black-capped chickadees with playback of high- and low-threat predator calls and conspecific <b>mobbing</b> calls, and non-threat heterospecific and reversed <b>mobbing</b> calls, to examine vocal and movement behavioural responses. Chickadees produced more chick-a-dee calls in response to playback of calls produced by a high-threat predator compared to calls produced by a low-threat predator, and to reversed high-threat <b>mobbing</b> calls compared to normal (i. e., non-reversed) high-threat <b>mobbing</b> calls. Chickadees also vocalized more in response to all playback conditions consisting of conspecific <b>mobbing</b> calls compared to a silent baseline period. The number of D notes that the subjects produced was similar to previous findings; chickadees produced approximately one to three D notes per call in response to low-threat <b>mobbing</b> calls, and produced more calls containing four to five D notes in response to high-threat <b>mobbing</b> calls, although this difference in the number of D notes per call was not significant. The difference in chickadees’ production of tseet calls across playback conditions approached significance as chickadees called more in response to conspecific <b>mobbing</b> calls, but not in response to heterospecific calls. General movement activity decreased in response to playback of conspecific-produced vocalizations, but increased in response to heterospecific-produced vocalizations, suggesting that chickadees may mobilize more in response to predator playback in preparation for a “fight or flight” situation. These results also suggest that chickadees may produce more <b>mobbing</b> calls in response to high-threat predator vocalizations as an attempt to initiate <b>mobbing</b> with conspecifics, while they produce fewer <b>mobbing</b> calls in response to a low-threat predator that a chickadee could outmaneuver...|$|R
