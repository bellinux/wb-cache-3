40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the issues of {{domestic}} violence in the region of Karlovy Vary. Important concepts of domestic violence and forms of domestic violence are explained in the text. The thesis also deals with the description of typical characteristics of victims and aggressors, as well as giving instructions on how to work with them appropriately. Furthermore, the text provides information on possible legal assistance for victims of domestic violence. Last but not least, it describes the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> for victims of domestic violence in the region of Karlovy Vary. The main intention of the practical part of the thesis is to refer to opinions of the social workers of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> to find out, whether they approve of the idea of working with the aggressors in the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> or not. Therefore, the main purpose of the thesis is to determine how exactly the social work with aggressors in domestic violence is implemented in the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> in Karlovy Vary region.

40|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{has been an}} urgent problem also in the Czech Republic. The necessity to solve its complexity upon level of the state, not only through non governmental, non-profit-making institutions, is especially expressed by adopting Act No. 135 / 2006 Collection of Laws, by which some acts in scope of domestic violence protection are amended. This Act allows the Police of the Czech Republic to banish an offender committing domestic violence from mutual residence {{for a period of}} 10 days and the Act has established a new social service the so called "Intervention Centreq, i. e. a specialized facility that provides help with people who are endangered by domestic violence. The objective was to find out the level of public awareness, knowledge of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres</b> in the Moravia-Silesian and Pilsen Regions. Within the first year of that Act operating, there were the least banished offenders v. s. number of inhabitants, just in the Pilsen Region and there were the most ones in the Moravia-Silesian Region. The theoretical work part describes forms of violence in the family, historical relationship of violent actions with women, possibilities how to prevent them or advised help measures to victims of domestic violence. Further, it is focussed on a legislative solution of that problem area in the Czech Republic and some of European countries or the USA as well. The practical work part involves results of a quantity research that was aimed to discovery of public awareness of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres.</b> The research was performed by method of questioning in a way of a questionnaire. The research was focussed on consciousness of general public relating to domestic violence, whether the research respondents have ever met that phenomenon or what is their opinion on information effectiveness of the problem area. The research demonstrated low awareness of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres</b> of inhabitants in both regions. However, most respondents know what domestic violence is. Nearly one third of interviewees have got certain experience with domestic violence. Majority of respondents consider the information on the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres</b> and domestic violence as generally useful. This work may be used to increase public awareness of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres</b> or on the other side to provide the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres</b> employees with general publics reflection as to availability and activity of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres...</b>|$|R

This article analysed perceived service quality in Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres.</b> The sample comprised 397 families receiving Early <b>Intervention</b> at two <b>centres,</b> where they were administered the Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> Quality Inventory.

There were significant differences between the studies in the dimensions Facilities (M= 4. 39, SD= 0. 41) and Treatment Rooms (M= 4. 66, SD= 0. 55).

40|$|Background: Non-communicable {{diseases}} are a {{leading cause of}} death and can largely be prevented by healthy lifestyles. Health care organizations are encouraged to integrate healthy lifestyle promotion in routine care. This study evaluates the impact of a team initiative on healthy lifestyle promotion in primary care. Methods: A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional design compared three <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> that had implemented lifestyle teams with three control centres that used a traditional model of care. Outcomes were defined using the RE-AIM framework: reach, the proportion of patients receiving lifestyle promotion; effectiveness, self-reported attitudes and competency among staff; adoption, proportion of staff reporting regular practice of lifestyle promotion; implementation, fidelity to the original lifestyle team protocol. Data collection methods included a patient questionnaire (n = 888), a staff questionnaire (n = 120) and structured interviews with all practice managers and, where applicable, team managers (n = 8). The chi square test and problem-driven content analysis was used to analyse the questionnaire and interview data, respectively. Results:Reach: patients at control centres (48 %, n = 211) received lifestyle promotion significantly more often compared with patients at <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> (41 %, n = 169). Effectiveness: intervention staff was significantly more positive towards the effectiveness of lifestyle promotion, shared competency and how lifestyle promotion was prioritized at their centre. Adoption: 47 % of staff at <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> and 58 % at control centres reported that they asked patients about their lifestyle on a daily basis. Implementation: all <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> had implemented multi-professional teams and team managers and held regular meetings but struggled to implement in-house referral structures for lifestyle promotion, which was used consistently among staff. Conclusions:Intervention centres did not show higher rates than control centres on reach of patients or adoption among staff at this stage. All <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> struggled to implement working referral structures for lifestyle promotion. <b>Intervention</b> <b>centres</b> were more positive on effectiveness outcomes, attitudes and competency among staff, however. Thus, lifestyle teams may facilitate lifestyle promotion practice in terms of increased responsiveness among staff, illustrated by positive attitudes and perceptions of shared competency. More research is needed on lifestyle promotion referral structures in primary care regarding their configuration and implementation.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} case study was to {{identify}} the needs of families attending Childhood Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres,</b> because professionals working in this setting have noted the low level of participation in the programs offered. An investigation tool was designed to gather information on their needs. In total, 58 families participated in the project. A first descriptive analysis of the data was conducted, followed by an inferential one. Of these families, 55. 7 % considered the Childhood Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> to be the right setting to foster participation, and 67. 24 % considered that these spaces should be permanent. Implementing a support program for families and between families would be easier in a Childhood Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre,</b> because parents focus on their children and their needs when they attend these centres.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was to map possibilities of a co-operation among the <b>intervention</b> <b>centre</b> and other entities interested in helping to people threatened by the domestic violence. The current status {{was taken from the}} professional literature. There is described an issue of the domestic violence, types and forms of the domestic violence, its characteristics and dynamics, causes, consequences, legal framework of the domestic violence, its actors, entities helping to people threatened by the domestic violence and an interdisciplinary co-operation. The qualitative research was used in the thesis. A tool for the data collection was a semi-standardized interview. Questions were based on theme ranges concerning the examined issue. The research sample consisted of 13 workers of the entities helping to people at risk of the domestic violence in the Highland (Vysočina) region. The research showed that the domestic violence is a very wide-spread and still underestimated issue. At the same time it is seen a considerable progress {{in the area of the}} help to people at risk by the domestic violence. Further the research showed that workers do not exactly know services provided by the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> of the Highland (Vysočina) region. Thanks to this fact there can occur a disinformation of people threatened by the domestic violence. The staff can determine the most often demanded help from the side of the potential service users. They can also recognize that not always it is about the help the <b>intervention</b> <b>centre</b> is able to provide. The research does not confirm that the personnel generally would be influenced by prejudices at their work with people at risk by the domestic violence. But they were certainly also in their professional life influenced by a personal experience with the domestic violence that acquired in their neighbourhood. The research raised a possibility of a co-operation among the <b>intervention</b> <b>centre</b> and other entities, namely organizing case conferences. This thesis can be used in practice for an acquisition or addition of professional experience related to the issue of the domestic violence and available provided services...|$|R
