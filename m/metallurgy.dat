5|$|In 1942, during World War II, he {{was called}} into service at the War <b>Metallurgy</b> Committee in Washington, D.C. In April 1943 {{he went to work}} on the Manhattan Project, joining the Chemical-Metallurgical Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory as the head of its <b>Metallurgy</b> Group. When the {{laboratory}} was reorganized in April 1944, he became the Associate Division Leader in charge of <b>metallurgy.</b> His first task was recruiting metallurgists, who were in great demand by the war effort. He also had to arrange for the transport of their metallurgical equipment to Los Alamos under wartime conditions.|$|E

5|$|Around 400 AD, the <b>metallurgy</b> {{became more}} advanced, using the tumbaga alloy and an {{increase}} in the production of offering figures is noted.|$|E
5|$|Manganese has no {{satisfactory}} substitute in {{its major}} applications in <b>metallurgy.</b> In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{founded the}} Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first {{interdisciplinary}} academic organization {{devoted to the}} study of metals in the United States. He studied the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. In 1961, he moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and <b>Metallurgy.</b> He applied the techniques of <b>metallurgy</b> {{to the study of}} the production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords.|$|E
5|$|About 86% of {{molybdenum}} produced {{is used in}} <b>metallurgy,</b> {{with the}} rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and <b>metallurgy</b> during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and <b>metallurgy</b> of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{territorial}} truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced {{a period of}} accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and <b>metallurgy.</b> A great monetary reform was implemented {{during the reign of}} Casimir III.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and <b>Metallurgy.</b> His focus was to transplant the techniques of <b>metallurgy</b> into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{advances}} in civil engineering, nautics, and <b>metallurgy</b> {{were made in}} Song China, {{as well as the}} introduction of the windmill to China during the thirteenth century. These advances, along with the introduction of paper-printed money, helped revolutionize and sustain the economy of the Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Xinyi Xiangfayao was Su's best-known treatise, but the polymath {{compiled}} {{other works}} as well. He completed a large celestial atlas of several star maps, several terrestrial maps, {{as well as}} a treatise on pharmacology. The latter discussed related subjects on mineralogy, zoology, botany, and <b>metallurgy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first Mari {{provided}} the oldest wheels workshop {{to be discovered}} in Syria, and was a center of bronze <b>metallurgy.</b> The city also contained districts devoted to smelting, dyeing and pottery manufacturing, charcoal was brought by river boats from the upper Khabur and Euphrates area.|$|E
5|$|The major {{end uses}} for {{germanium}} in 2007, worldwide, were estimated to be: 35% for fiber-optics, 30% infrared optics, 15% polymerization catalysts, and 15% electronics and solar electric applications. The remaining 5% went into such uses as phosphors, <b>metallurgy,</b> and chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder <b>metallurgy</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{dominant}} use of iron is in <b>metallurgy,</b> iron compounds are also pervasive in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally {{used in the}} Haber-Bosch process {{for the production of}} ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants. Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} sizable {{temperature}} and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For example, in: industrial and extractive <b>metallurgy,</b> surface treatments such as plasma spraying (coating), etching in microelectronics, metal cutting and welding; {{as well as}} in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps, while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering.|$|E
5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium <b>metallurgy.</b> The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper <b>metallurgy</b> was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing <b>metallurgy,</b> over large areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and <b>metallurgy</b> of uranium was poorly understood, that of plutonium was practically unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in <b>metallurgy</b> as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Dnipropetrovsk {{that he met}} Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 {{and by the end}} of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his {{organisational}} skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of Ferrous <b>Metallurgy</b> in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Ferrous <b>Metallurgy,</b> a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the 22nd Party Congress Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd party congress in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.|$|E
5|$|Mining and <b>metallurgy</b> {{developed}} further {{during the}} 16th century, and technical progress {{took place in}} various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers to be transported through ports and land routes. This resulted in a positive trade balance for Poland throughout the 16th century. Imports from the West included industrial products, luxury products and fabrics.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Birmingham, England, on 4 October 1903, the third of four {{children}} of Joseph Seymour Smith, a commercial traveller for Camp Coffee, and his wife, Frances, née Norton. He was educated at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. He read <b>metallurgy</b> at the University of Birmingham, having not met the requirements in mathematics to study his first choice, which was physics, and was awarded a second-class BSc in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Spedding {{took up the}} {{position}} as assistant professor {{and head of the}} department of physical chemistry at Iowa State College in 1937. His efforts at building up the school were so successful that he would {{spend the rest of his}} career there, becoming a professor of chemistry in 1941, a professor of physics in 1950, a professor of <b>metallurgy</b> in 1962, and ultimately professor emeritus in 1973.|$|E
5|$|That the <b>metallurgy</b> of {{plutonium}} was completely unknown {{came as no}} surprise at all, for it had only recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount {{of plutonium}} from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great Leap Forward were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of <b>metallurgy,</b> the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the blast furnace process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The Sami {{were not}} the only people subject to repressions. Thousands of people were sent to Kola in the 1930s–1950s, and in 2007 over two {{thousand}} people—descendants of those forcibly sent here—still live on the peninsula. A significant portion of the people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization. Prisoner labor was often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel <b>Metallurgy</b> Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} considered other methods of recovering active {{material in the}} event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and <b>Metallurgy)</b> group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in <b>metallurgy,</b> as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is <b>metallurgy</b> in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{was used}} by pre-Columbian Americans near modern-day Esmeraldas, Ecuador to produce {{artifacts}} of a white gold-platinum alloy. They employed a relatively sophisticated system of powder <b>metallurgy.</b> The platinum used in such objects was not the pure element, but rather a naturally occurring mixture of the platinum group metals, with small amounts of palladium, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E
5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant Avāram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and <b>metallurgy.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. Different meanings may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on the context. In <b>metallurgy,</b> for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and <b>metallurgy,</b> introduced from China and Korea.|$|E
