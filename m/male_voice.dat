5|$|Arbroath <b>Male</b> <b>Voice</b> Choir was {{established}} in 1934 and {{is now one of}} only a few <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> choirs left in Scotland. At 2012 the choir has over 45 members drawn not just from Arbroath but also Angus and Dundee. The choir's musical director is Sheena Guthrie. They sing a mix of songs from classical, through Scottish, showtunes to pop. The ensemble perform two main concerts each year (one at Christmas and another in spring) and several smaller events for good causes. The choir are notable for attracting well known, often international singers to their annual spring concert as guests. In recent years these have included, Jamie McDougall, Karen Cargill, Gordon Cree, Cheryl Forbes and Colette Ruddy. March 2012 saw international diva Lesley Garrett as the choir's special guest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Male</b> <b>voice</b> choirs {{emerged in}} the 19th century and {{continue}} today. Originally these choirs where formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs.|$|E
40|$|In human voices, low {{fundamental}} frequency {{is thought to}} be a cue to masculinity and reproductive capability and large vocal tracts are associated with large body size of the speaker. Female preferences for males with low fundamental frequencies and large vocal tract lengths are potentially adaptive. Although sexually dimorphic characteristics of <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> have been studied, the impact of manipulations of secondary sexual characteristics on preferences for <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> has not. We manipulated fundamental frequencies and apparent vocal tract lengths of young adult <b>male</b> <b>voices,</b> both independently and simultaneously, and assessed their impact on female ratings of masculinity, size, age and attractiveness. Lowering the fundamental frequencies and/or increasing apparent vocal tract lengths of <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> increased females' ratings of the masculinity, size and age of the speaker. Peer group females preferred <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> with (1) lowered fundamental frequencies to those with raised fundamental frequencies, and (2) original frequencies to <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> with raised fundamental frequencies and decreased apparent vocal tract lengths (a combined manipulation to reflect acoustic characteristics of 16 -year-old <b>male</b> <b>voices).</b> This suggests that <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> with acoustic characteristics that reflect full sexual maturity may be attractive. Although no general preference was observed for <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> with increased or decreased apparent vocal tract lengths, female preferences for <b>male</b> <b>voices</b> with increased apparent vocal tract lengths were positively related to females' own body size. This latter finding may indicate assortative preferences for acoustic cues to body size. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a <b>male</b> <b>voice</b> and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the <b>male</b> <b>voice.</b> Their name was read by the “ignored” <b>male</b> <b>voice.</b> Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E
