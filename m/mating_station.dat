50|$|In the 16th century, {{the area}} was used for hunting by nobility and a table was set up at Predoselj, where they would dine while on hunting expeditions. In 1826, draft evaders threw the table into the Kamnik Bistrica River, {{as a result of}} which the microtoponym Pri firštovi mizi ('At the Prince's Table') became {{established}} for the location. There was also a blast furnace in Kamniška Bistrica in the 16th century; it was recorded as owned by Jožef Žigan in 1739. In 1832, a queen <b>mating</b> <b>station</b> was established in the hamlet of Kopišča. The Bistrica Lodge {{at the head of the}} valley was built in 1902. The road into the valley was laid out in 1934. During the Second World War, Partisans used the area as a refuge. They operated an underground print shop near Kopišča and set up a field hospital below Orličje Falls, which was active from the fall of 1943 to the fall of 1944. A bunker near the quarry at the south end of the valley was set up as a slaughterhouse and meat-processing facility.|$|E

40|$|At pre- sowing {{irrigation}} (mid-March), {{cotton fields}} {{were treated with}} two entomopathogenic nematode species; Steinernema riobravis and S. carpocapsae for control of diapausing Pectinophora gossypiella larvae. Pima S- 6 cotton fields situated in Fort Hancock, Texas were treated {{at a rate of}} one billion nematodes per acre. Caged, diapausing larvae were buried in fields at a depth of one inch, in row tops and furrow bases. Nematodes were applied with a spray rig, fixed winged aircraft, or in furrow irrigation via a constant flow, battery box. Fields were irrigated after ground application, prior to aerial spraying and during furrow application. Caged larvae were recovered 48 hours after nematode application. All application methods resulted in uniform distribution of nematodes over the treated fields. No significant differences ir. larval mortality between nematode species or application method could be determined. However, aerial and furrow application methods gave consistently better parasitism of larvae compared to ground rig delivery. Larval mortality in cassettes buried in furrow bases was significantly higher than in row tops. Larval mortality ranged from 53. 26 - 79. 14 %. Both nematode species could be recovered 50 days post application. At pin-head square Frustrate® PBW pheromone bands (biosys, Inc.) were applied at 100 bands per acre placement rate (16 g a. i. /acre), giving a target release of 115 mg gossyplure/acre/day. Capillary gas chromatography was used to analyze bands throughout the growing season. A uniform release profile indicated sufficient release of pheromone for 144 days after placement. Pink bollworm mating disruption was monitored in three ways: 1. Delta 2 traps were positioned throughout the farm, forming a continuous trap line. Significantly larger numbers of moths were recovered form untreated zones. 2. Virgin female moths were placed in <b>mating</b> <b>stations</b> at dusk. At sun rise moths were collected and later dissected for spermatophores. Significantly higher mating activity occurred in untreated fields (p= 0. 000). 3. Green bolls were collected at random and examined for larvae. Significantly higher infestation levels existed in untreated zones. At harvest (November), seed cotton yields were weighed using trailer scales. Higher yields were recovered from pheromone (1, 864 lb/acre), and pheromone + nematode fields (1, 712 lb/acre), than control fields (1, 450 lb/acre). However, due to large variations between fields, the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0. 436) ...|$|R
50|$|Rush: Players must defend {{or destroy}} pairs of M-COM {{stations}} until either the attackers {{run out of}} respawn tickets {{or all of the}} stations are destroyed. Lost tickets can be regained by reviving fallen team <b>mates.</b> An M-COM <b>station</b> can be destroyed by planting a charge, using explosive weapons or ballistics, or simply by demolishing the building in which it is located. However, not all M-COM stations exist in destructible buildings, forcing players to use a variety of methods to achieve the same goal. When a charge is planted by the attacking team, an alarm is activated and the defenders have a limited amount of time to get to the M-COM station and disarm the bomb before it detonates.|$|R

40|$|Assembly {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modern industry. Flexible Assembly Systems (FAS), as a new, promising production technology, can provide high productivity and flexibility. The research efforts made on FAS problems are insufficient, especially on the loading problem. This research investigates the loading problem in FAS by means of 0 - 1 integer programming modelling. Model 1 is formulated to assign operations to work stations so as to minimize the total processing cost. Important assembly realities such as different component sizes, component <b>mating,</b> operation precedence, <b>station</b> workload balance and different work station characteristics are considered. Model 2 is proposed to deal with the system with large number of work stations. The workload unbalance among work stations is considered as a penalty in the objective function in Model 2 in order to reduce problem size. Some examples are solved using these models for computational experience and also to reflect the utility of these models. The effects of workload balance are investigated. Sensitivity analyses of total available time and component feeder capacity are carried out. The effects of the weight of the penalty term in Model 2 are also investigated. Some important issues related to this study are discussed such as the total cost of system, total available time, cycle time and work station reliability. The comparison of the two proposed models are given. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|With {{the launch}} of the STS- 122 on February 7, 2008, which {{delivered}} the European Columbus science module and the upcoming STS- 124 flight, which will deliver the Japanese Kibo science module in May 2008, the International Space Station will become truly International with Europe and Japan joining the United States of America and Russia to perform science on a continuous basis in a wide spectrum of science disciplines. The last science module, Kibo, of the United States Orbital Segment (USOS) will be <b>mated</b> to the <b>station</b> on time to celebrate its first decade in low Earth orbit in October 2008 (end of Increment 17), thus ushering in the second decade of the station with all the USOS science modules mated and performing science. The arrival of the Kibo science module will also mark continuous human presence on the station for eighty eight (88) months, and, with the addition of the ESA science module during the STS- 122 flight, the USOS will be made up of four space agencies: CSA, ESA, JAXA and NASA, spanning three continents. With the additional partners coming onboard with different research needs, every effort is being made to coordinate science across the USOS segment in an integrated manner for the benefit of all parties. One of the objectives {{of this paper is to}} discuss the integrated manner in which science planning/replanning and prioritization during the execution phase of an increment is being done. The main focus, though, of this paper is to summarize and to discuss the science performed during Increments 16 and 17 (October 2007 to October 2008). The discussion will focus mainly on the primary objectives of each investigation and their associated hypotheses that were investigated during these two Increments. Also, preliminary science results will be discussed for each of the investigation as science results availability permit. Additionally, the paper will briefly touch on what the science complement for these two increments was and what was actually accomplished due to real time science implementation and constraints. Finally, the paper will briefly discuss the science research complements for the next three Increments: Increments 18 to 20, in order to preview how much science might be accomplished during these three upcoming Increments of the station next decade...|$|R
40|$|Alternative designs {{applicable}} to the estimation of breeding values of performance tested boars using mixed model methodology were simulated and evaluated. Designs were based on composite estimates of parameters from the literature and results from a survey of central swine testing station managers in the United States. Of interest were the evaluations for the traits average daily gain and backfat probe. Family size, number of families per test, degree of relationship among animals within and across tests, and strength of genetic ties across tests were varied to determine how changes in one affected the others, {{as well as how}} they interacted with each other. The criterion upon which comparisons were based was accuracy, the correlation of true and estimated breeding values (r(,uu) = SQRT. (1 - V(u-u) /(sigma) (,G) (2 ̆ 72))). The prediction error variance V(u-u) is obtained from the inverse of the coefficient matrix of the mixed model equations. The single-trait animal model was assumed to be y(,ij) = s(,i) + b(,ij) + e(,ij), where y(,ij) was the observation (average daily gain or backfat) on the j(2 ̆ 7 th) boar in the i(2 ̆ 7 th) station-season, s(,i) was the fixed effect due to the i(2 ̆ 7 th) station-season, b(,ij) was the random effect due to the j(2 ̆ 7 th) boar in the i(2 ̆ 7 th) station-season and e(,ij) was the random residual error associated with the observation on the j(2 ̆ 7 th) boar in the i(2 ̆ 7 th) station-season. Small subclass numbers in conjunction with evaluation of closely related families caused average accuracy to decrease instead of increase because directly tied animals were less accurately evaluated. Designing the relationship matrix by requiring entry of specific relatives would help to correct the problem. Tying station-seasons together through the relationship matrix formed a large set of interdependent equations and improved the average accuracy of predicted breeding values, since the slight decrease in accuracy for directly tied animals was more than offset by the increase for their test <b>mates.</b> Full-sibs across <b>stations</b> provided the strongest genetic tie, while the traditional half-sib (sire) tie was 1 / 4 as strong as the full-sib tie. Half-cousin ties were the weakest investigated (1 / 64 as large as full-sib ties), but could allow more genetic progress by increasing the selection differential. Applications of findings to the swine industry were discussed...|$|R
5000|$|... 1991's The Drow of the Underdark, a 128-page sourcebook {{all about}} the drow, {{expanded}} the drow significantly for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition version of the Forgotten Realms setting. The first chapter explains [...] "The Nature of Dark Elves", augmenting {{the information in the}} Monstrous Compendium entry. It describes their variable physical builds, their alert and inquisitive intelligence, their highly developed senses, the personal magic that all drow are trained in; it also details drow wizards (the most dangerous drow likely to be encountered outside the Underdark), as well as the driders, misfit drow who have failed a test of Lolth. Dark Elven Society is detailed in the second chapter. Drow society, being strongly matriarchal, allows the females to hold all positions of power in the government, and to choose and discard <b>mates</b> freely. Social <b>station</b> {{is the most important thing}} in drow society, making ascension to greater power a drow's ultimate goal. Drow have a strong affinity for arachnids, as most worship the spider goddess Lolth, and spiders dwell freely among drow communities. The third chapter details [...] "Drow Religion" [...] in the Forgotten Realms setting; as the majority of drow worship Lolth (or [...] "Lloth", formerly known as Araushnee in ancient times), they simply don't speak of or recognize those who do not. Drow deities in this world include Eilistraee, the [...] "Dark Maiden", the goddess of good-aligned drow, and of song, dance, swordwork, and hunting; Ghaunadaur, That Which Lurks (also known as [...] "The Elder Elemental Eye"), a tentacled dark purple blob served by ropers and patron of oozes and all things subterranean; Lolth; and Vhaeraun, the god of thievery and the patron god of drow males in opposition to the matriarchy of drow society. [...] "The High History of the Drow" [...] in the Realms is revealed in the fourth chapter, detailing the descent of the Ilythiiri (the original [...] "Dark Elves") of the southern jungles into the underground, and their dark wars as they became the drow they are today. The fifth chapter details 27 new [...] "Drow Spells" [...] for both wizards and priests; the sixth chapter includes dozens of [...] "Drow Magical Items", some of which previously appeared in first edition AD&D sources; the seventh chapter details [...] "Drow Craftwork", discussing their unique clothing and weaponry, their poison, as well as mining and engineering, and drow artisans. The eighth chapter briefly describes [...] "Drow Language", while the ninth chapter goes into [...] "Drow Nomenclature" [...] by providing example female and male given names and drow house names, and the tenth chapter provides [...] "A Selected Glossary of Deep Drow". [...] "Dark Elven Symbols" [...] are described in the eleventh chapter, including drow runes such as way-marker runes, sacred glyphs, house defense glyphs; the twelfth chapter, [...] "The Spider and the Axe: War in the Depths" [...] details an [...] "ideal longterm camapaign setting" [...] involving a war between drow and dwarves; the thirteenth chapter provides a brief look at [...] "The Underdark", but advises readers to see the Queen of the Spiders series and the Dwarves Deep sourcebook for further information. The fourteenth chapter provides game statistics for several [...] "Monsters of the Underdark" [...] that associate with drow, or compete with them, including the deep dragon, the myrlochar, the deep rothe, the yochlol, and several species of spider and spider-like creatures. According to The Complete Book of Elves, drow are not welcome in Evermeet and are turned away.|$|R
