30|$|Essential oils of our plants (O. gratissimum) are {{characterized}} by <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> as chemotype, {{with the presence of}} its isomer (t-anethole). These two isomers are different only in the double bond of the propenyl chain, and we can find this natural isomer in many EO of plants, tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L), basil (O. basilicum L) and (Foeniculum vulgare) (Gross et al. 2002) but with different contents. This difference is mainly due to the enzyme complex (O-methyl transferase), which uses chavicol and trans-anol as substrate to produce <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> and trans-anethole respectively (Figure  1) (Lewinsohn et al. 2000; Gross et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|Moreover, Lewinsohn et al. (2000) {{distinguished}} two chemotypes in O.basilicum L, <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> (or estragol) and the methyl eugenol. The isomerization {{between these}} two molecules is mainly due to the complex enzyme O-methyl transferase.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, we {{find that}} water stress causes a {{decrease}} in oxygenated monoterpene levels and a very important increase in hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{benefits}} {{promoted by}} natural products {{on human health}} have motivated industry to search for alternative separation systems in order to purify active compounds present in renewable sources. Amongst natural products of current interest for food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and chemical industries is <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> (MC). MC is a natural ingredient found in several herbs as tarragon, sweet basil, sweet fennel, and their essential oils, and its widest application is in food industry as flavoring agent. In this work, basil essential oil was used as raw material to study MC concentration through a hybrid evaporation system. The evaporative system was constituted of a cylindrical evaporator, an internal condenser located concentrically to the evaporator, and an external condenser. It generates 3 outside streams: distilled, side, and residue, which were recovered {{at the bottom of}} external condenser, internal condenser, and evaporator, respectively. From experimental results, it was verified that higher MC concentration was reached at the side stream because its intermediate volatility when compared with other substances present in basil essential oil. Central composite experimental design using 2 factors and 4 replicates at central point was considered in this work to determine the effect of operating conditions on <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> separation. Response variables were <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> concentration (%MCside) at side stream, distilled (%D) and side (%S) streams amounts. The factors studied in this work were: evaporator temperature (Tevap) and feed flow rate (FFR). Analyzing the variables effects, two variables presented a statistically significant effect on distilled percentage: evaporator temperature and feed flow rate. For the side stream, the variables: evaporator temperature, feed flow rate, and the interaction between evaporator stream and feed flow rate influenced the side amount and <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> concentration...|$|E
30|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{action of}} basil essential oil increases {{with the increase}} in levels of <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> (Pessoa et al. 2002 Kishore Dubey et al. 2000).

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Ocimum selloi essential oil was evaluated for controlling {{the growth of}} mycelia and spores germination Moniliophthora perniciosa. Six compounds (99. 89 %) of the total oil were identified by GC-MS, of which <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol,</b> methyl eugenol, &# 946;-caryophyllene, germacrene-D, bicyclogermacrene and spathulenol. Essential oil was tested for antifungal activity, which was determined by disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination methods. Application of the oil reduced mycelial growth in a dose dependent manner, with maximum inhibition being observed at concentration of 1, 000 ppm. Such antifungal activity {{could be attributed to}} <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> since the pure compound was shown to be similarly effective against Moniliophthora perniciosa at 1, 000 ppm. The oil when applied at a concentration of 1, 000 ppm, reduced the spore germination of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and M. perniciosa by 93 and 87 %, respectively, but had no effect on the Alternaria alternata. It is concluded that the oil from O. selloi and its major constituent, <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol,</b> are efficient in inhibiting M. perniciosa, but less effective against C. gloeosporioides and A. alternata.

The emissions of <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> observed may impact regional atmospheric chemistry, but little is known {{of its ability to}} form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The photo-oxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> was investigated at the European Photoreactor chamber {{as a part of the}} atmospheric chemistry of <b>methyl</b> <b>chavicol</b> (ATMECH) project. Aerosol samples were collected using a particle into liquid sampler (PILS) and analysed offline using an extensive range of instruments including; high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-ITMS), high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOFMS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The SOA yield was determined as 18 and 29 % for an initial VOC mixing ratio of 212 and 460 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) respectively; using a VOC:NO x ratio of ~ 5 : 1. In total, 59 SOA compounds were observed and the structures of 10 compounds have been identified using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The addition of hydroxyl and/or nitro-functional groups to the aromatic ring appears to be an important mechanistic pathway for aerosol formation. This results in the formation of compounds with both low volatility and high O:C ratios, where functionalisation rather than fragmentation is mainly observed as a result of the stability of the ring. The SOA species observed can be characterised as semi-volatile to low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA and LVOOA) components and therefore may be important in aerosol formation and growth...|$|E
