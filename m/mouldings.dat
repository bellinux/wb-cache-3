5|$|The {{particular}} {{character of}} this Early English interior {{is dependent on the}} proportions of the simple lancet arches. It is also dependent on the refinement of the architectural details, in particular the <b>mouldings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2 storey Bath stone {{building}} has a heavy ground floor arcade of round-headed arches on pillars, and retains its original window <b>mouldings</b> and sashes. Building work continued after 1727 under the 23-year-old John Wood, the Elder, his first commission in Bath.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house has}} a {{symmetrical}} facade with projecting wings {{either side of the}} central doorway with a Tuscan portico. The interior of the stone house is decorated with extensive plaster <b>mouldings</b> to ceilings and fireplaces. The grounds and gardens were laid out by Humphry Repton, but have since been reduced in size.|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} bassist Colin <b>Moulding's</b> first A-side {{composition}} for the group.|$|R
5000|$|Leader Andy Partridge has {{subsequently}} described [...] "Wonderland" [...] {{as one of}} <b>Moulding's</b> [...] "most beautiful melodies".|$|R
5000|$|Colin <b>Moulding's</b> {{songs were}} all older {{material}} presented for previous albums but rejected due to space or other considerations. [...] "Standing In For Joe" [...] was originally written for aborted 'Bubblegum' album {{project in the}} early 1990s and [...] "In Another Life" [...] was originally demoed for Oranges & Lemons.|$|R
5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers is a deep entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched <b>mouldings</b> to the arch. The tympanum of the arch contains an empty niche.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are {{in stark contrast to the}} often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine <b>mouldings</b> of the arch.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of the structure is in the Early English style and is greatly enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the <b>mouldings</b> and the vitality of the carved capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end has retained much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large central tower.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moulding's</b> bass playing is self-taught, {{learning}} 1970s rock riffs at 15 years old. He cites Andy Fraser of Free as {{an early}} musical influence and has stated a preference for an intuitive approach to writing and playing rather than study. When writing songs Moulding has used guitars and keyboards rather than the bass guitar.|$|R
5000|$|The 2005 {{inclusion}} in Apple Box {{of the first}} new XTC tracks in five years ("Spiral", written by Partridge and [...] "Say It", by Moulding), offered hope that the band might continue. These songs were available to purchasers of the box set in digital format only, {{with the use of}} a special download code. A follow-up internet-only single, <b>Moulding's</b> [...] "Where Did the Ordinary People Go?", was issued in December.|$|R
40|$|THE ACTIVITY AND DYNAMICS OF THE DIPLOPOD GLOMERIS BALCANICA (VERHOEFF 1906) IN THE SOIL SUBSYSTEM OF AN EVERGREEN - SCLEROPHILLES FORMATION OF THE FOOT OF MT CHORTIATIS (THESSALONIKI, GREECE) WAS STUDIED. THE POPULATION DENSITY OF G. BALCANICA IN THE STUDY SITE WAS HIGH AND ITS FLUCTUATIONS SEEM TO BE ADJUSTEDWITH A 3 YEAR TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION CYCLE EXISTING IN THE AREA OF THESSALONIKI. AS REGARDS THE ACTIVITY OF THE ANIMAL IN THE FIELD THE CYCLE: <b>MOULDING</b> - MATURATION OF THE OVARIES - OVIPOSITION - <b>MOULDING</b> IS ADJUSTED WITH THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE TEMPERATURE - HUMIDITY COMPLEX BY MEANS OF THE FEEDING ACTIVITY OF THE ANIMAL. WITH RESPECT TO ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS G. BALCANICA HAS AN IMMEDIATE BUT MODERATE REACTION TOWARDS TEMPERATURE CHANGES BEING TO AN EXTEND INDEPENDENT FROM THEM. IN ADDITION IT EXHIBITS A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE OF ACTIVITY AND LOW MAINTANANCE COSTS. AS A CONCLUSION THE STUDYOF THE DEMOGRAPHY AND ACTIVITY OF G. BALCANICA SHOWED THAT IT SUCCEEDS IN SMOOTHING THE EFFECTS OF THE STRONG TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY FLUCTUATIONS IN THESTUDY AREA DOMINATING IN A "HOSTILE" FOR OTHER SPECIES ENVIRONMENT. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural <b>mouldings,</b> characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{was influenced by}} the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped Vimana of the shrine with horizontal <b>mouldings</b> and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind arcades above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed arches with capitals, free-standing columns and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and <b>mouldings</b> of the arches are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque in style and the arches early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.|$|E
5000|$|A four-CD compilation—Coat of Many Cupboards—spanning the band's {{time with}} Virgin was also {{released}} in 2002. Timed {{to coincide with}} the release of remastered CDs of their back catalogue, the set included remastered album and single tracks along with voluminous demos, live tracks, unreleased songs, and alternate versions, culminating in the Partridge and Moulding recording of [...] "Didn't Hurt A Bit", built from the studio reference recording of <b>Moulding's</b> composition (with drums and percussion intact, played by Dave Mattacks), taped during the Nonsuch sessions.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Fuzzy Warbles" [...] {{series is}} a {{collection}} of demos and sketches from Andy Partridge's tape archive. They do not include any of Colin <b>Moulding's</b> songs and are produced and compiled by Partridge. The name was probably inspired by a line from A Clockwork Orange, when Alex asks a girl in a record shop if she has anything at home to play her [...] "fuzzy warbles" [...] on. Instead, he invites her to his house where he has a premium quality sound system installed.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, Moulding {{was asked}} to join the Brendan Bottcher rink mid-season, {{replacing}} Pat Simmons (at third) who was suffering from an injury. The announcement was just in time four Moulding {{to play in the}} 2017 Meridian Canadian Open Grand Slam event. The new lineup found immediate success, making the quarterfinals of the event. The next month, the team would win the 2017 Boston Pizza Cup, the Alberta men's provincial championship. The win would be <b>Moulding's</b> first provincial title, sending him to his first ever Tim Hortons Brier. At the Brier, the team finished with a 3-8 record, missing the playoffs.|$|R
5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the outer wall (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty niche on the north, which probably had a goddess figure that was stolen. The lintel of the attendant deity niche has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each niche. The uppermost part of the outer wall has ten horizontal <b>mouldings,</b> ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, curvilinear temple pinnacle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} century, {{the east end}} of Elgin Cathedral {{incorporated}} typical European Gothic <b>mouldings</b> and tracery. In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E
5|$|The Monument in the City of London {{provides}} {{views of}} the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at {{the north and south}} ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster <b>mouldings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under {{the name}} Star Park, the group {{began as a}} trio with drummer Terry Chambers, then {{changing}} their name to Helium Kidz. As the punk movement took off, they settled on the name XTC, debuting on Virgin Records in 1977. In 1982, the group stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding, and guitarist Dave Gregory with various session musicians. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as an outlet for the band's excursions into 1960s psychedelic music. For most of the 1990s, XTC were mired in record label difficulties. The band ceased activity following the disintegration of Partridge and <b>Moulding's</b> creative partnership.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} the first time the band had {{released}} anything since going [...] "on strike" [...] against their label, Virgin Records. Apple Venus Volume 1 was originally supposed to be a double album, but Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding were convinced to break the album up into two, with the orchestral material on Apple Venus Volume 1 and the other material released on Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2). The material for both albums was largely written in the aftermath of Nonsuch. While Partridge continued to write new material, all of <b>Moulding's</b> material was older songs that were submitted for earlier projects and rejected.|$|R
5000|$|PopMatters Sarah Zupko {{called the}} album [...] "more than worth the wait. Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding used their time off well, lavishing extra care and {{attention}} on {{this set of}} tunes that rank among the best music they have ever produced. ... this record is a shoo-in for one of 1999’s best records". Scott Schinder gave the album an A- for Entertainment Weekly, writing: [...] "The gorgeous yet vaguely unsettling arrangements are well suited to the exquisitely flawed humanism of Andy Partridge’s and Colin <b>Moulding’s</b> compositions, lending an appropriately uneasy edge to bittersweet tunes like 'I Can’t Own Her,' 'Greenman,' and 'The Last Balloon.'" ...|$|R
5|$|The Spanish influence. The {{architectural}} {{influence of}} the ruling Spanish (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence {{than that of the}} Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where — owing to minor insurrections — the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as the entrance to a Spanish citadel, would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its ornate <b>mouldings</b> and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake.|$|E
5|$|The choir has broad arches {{with two}} wave <b>mouldings</b> carried down the piers which support the ribs of the vaulting. These {{may have been}} {{designed}} by Thomas Witney or William Joy as they {{are similar to the}} work at Wells Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe. The choir is separated from the eastern Lady Chapel by a 14th-century reredos which was damaged in The reformation and repaired in 1839 when the 17th-century altarpiece was removed. The Lady Chapel was brightly painted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries following existing fragments of colour. To the south east of the choir and Lady Chapel is the Berkeley Chapel and an adjoining antechapel or sacristy, which may have been added in the 14th century, possibly replacing an earlier structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{style that}} {{developed}} from the Romanesque, originating in twelfth-century France, {{is now known as}} Gothic. It was characterised by pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses. It was brought to Britain by the Cistercians, whose abbeys retained thick walls, but pierced them with lancet arches with slender pointed arches. This style became characteristic of the early Gothic in Britain and can be seen at Dundrennan Abbey, begun around 1142, which resembles religious foundations in northern England. The style can also be seen in the East end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic <b>mouldings</b> and tracery.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Moulding {{joined the}} Matthew Blandford rink has his third. That season, Moulding {{won his first}} career tour event, when the rink won the McKee Homes Fall Curling Classic. The next season, the team played in <b>Moulding's</b> second career Slam event, the 2014 National, where they won two games. Later in the season, Moulding was invited to play for his former junior {{teammate}} Brock Virtue's team at the Black Diamond / High River Cash event, which they won. For the 2015-16 season, Virtue joined the Blandford rink as skip, moving Moulding to play second. The team would not win any events. Virtue left the rink {{at the end of}} the season.|$|R
40|$|THE PRESENT STUDY CONSTITUTES AN ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THE ESTHETIC CATEGORIES OF COMIC, AS WELL AS TO POINT OUT AND ELABORATE ON THE PRIMARY CAUSES THAT GENERATE THE LAUGHTER AND THE COMEDY. THE DISSERTATION IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS. IN PART ONE WE STUDY THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE PHENOMENA OF LAUGHTER ANDENQUIRE WHETHER THE LAUGHTER HAS BIOLOGICAL OR SOCIAL ROOTS. BY GOING THROUGH THE BASIC COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE LAUGHTER. WE COME TO REALISE THAT THE LAUGHTER HAS BOTH BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL ORIGINS. THESE TWO ORIGINS DO CO-EXIST, CONSIDERING THAT THEY HAVE BOTH AFFECTED AND ESSENTIALLY AT THAT THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT AND <b>MOULDING</b> OF LAUGHTER WITHIN THE HUMAN SOCIETY. IN PART TWO WE STUDY THE COMIC IN TERMS OF ESTHETIC CATEGORY. IN PARTICULAR WE LOOK INTO THE PRECONDITIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE COMIC, THE SOURCES, THE FIELDS OF ACTIVITY AND THE GENRE AND ESTHETIC VALUE OF HIS. FINALLY, WE FORMULATE OUR PERSONAL VIEW IN WHAT CONCERNS THE CREATIONS OF THE COMIC (THEORY OF MOODS AND DISPOSITIONS) ON THE BASIS OF THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL APPROACHES: JOKES, MOCKERY, IRONY. PART THREE OF THE STUDY EXPLORES THE ROOTS OF THE COMEDY. BASED ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL MATERIAL OF THE "DANCE OF THE GOATS" OF SKYROS ISLAND, WE ATTEMPT TO SPOT THE SUBSTRATUM WHICH COMPRISES THE ROOTS OF THE COMEDY. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) ...|$|R
40|$|IN THIS PIECE OF WORK TEN CASES OF CHRONIC LEAD POISONING WERE EXAMINED. THESE CASES WERE TAKEN FROM FOUR SEPARATE FAMILIES, WHO ALL WORKED WITH PAINTED GLAZE CERAMICS. CASES I, II, III, IV, V AND VI WERE CHILDREN AGED FROM 2 TO 18, BUT THE OTHERS WERE YOUNG ADULTS - THE ELDEST BEING 26. IN THIS WORK PLACE ALL THE PROCESSES (<b>MOULDING,</b> PAINTING AND BAKING IN THE FURNACE) WERE CARRIED OUT WITHIN A CONFINED SPACE. THE PATIENTS WERE ALL IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE FUMESARISING FROM THE PAINT WHILE BEING MIXED AND BAKED TOO. THE CLINICAL AND LABORATORY RESULTS OF THE EXAMINED CASES WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CLASSIC FINDINGS OF LEAD POISONING. ALL CASES SHOWED ANOREXIA AND HAD PALE FACES. THE CHARACTERISTIC LEAD LINE ON THE TEETH WAS COMMON TO ALL EXCEPT FOR CASES VII, VIII AND X. THE X - RAYS REVEALED THE KNOWN CHANGES MADE TO LONG BONES IN ALL THEPATIENTS.

5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple <b>mouldings</b> to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal <b>mouldings</b> running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted <b>mouldings,</b> is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various <b>mouldings</b> and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a dormer window. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century <b>mouldings</b> and above the door is a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a diamond-shaped clock on the south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large <b>mouldings</b> and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
