"December 2012 "Monitoring tool displacement during a milling process allows the operator to identify when there is relative movement between the cutting tool and the workpiece. When the relative movement between the cutting tool and the workpiece becomes large enough, the displacements of the cutting tool become known as chatter. Chatter produces a dimensionally inaccurate cut, poor surface finish, tool breakage, and is the main obstacle in high speed milling. If the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> or <b>operator</b> were able to detect the smaller tool displacements leading up to chatter, then the milling operation can be altered to eliminate the onset of chatter. A new tool design to measure tool displacement during milling operations is presented and validated in this research. The concept behind this new tool design is to indirectly measure the tool's displacement in the x and y direction by attaching a thin disc perpendicular to the neck of the cutting tool. The disc will allow sensors to measure the angle of deflection in the neck of the cutting tool by measuring the resulting tilt in the disc. Measuring the disc's displacement rather than the actual tool's displacement allows for the sensors to be placed above the cutting tool and away from milling operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design and test an {{intelligent}} computer software developed with the purpose of increasing average productivity of milling not compromising the design features of the final product. The developed system generates optimal milling parameters based on the extent of tool wear. The introduced optimisation algorithm employs a multilayer model of a milling process developed in the artificial neural network. The input parameters for model training are the following: cutting speed vc, feed per tooth fz and the degree of tool wear measured by means of localised flank wear (VB 3). The output parameter is the surface roughness of a machined surface Ra. Since the model in the neural network exhibits good approximation of functional relationships, it was applied to determine optimal milling parameters in changeable tool wear conditions (VB 3) and stabilisation of surface roughness parameter Ra. Our solution enables constant control over surface roughness parameters and productivity of milling process after each assessment of tool condition. The recommended parameters, i. e. those which applied in milling ensure desired surface roughness and maximal productivity, are selected from all the parameters generated by the model. The developed software may constitute an expert system supporting a <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> <b>operator.</b> In addition, the application may be installed on a mobile device (smartphone), connected to a tool wear diagnostics instrument and the machine tool controller in order to supply updated optimal parameters of milling. The presented solution facilitates tool life optimisation and decreasing tool change costs, particularly during prolonged operation...|$|E
