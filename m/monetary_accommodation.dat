We model both the supply of {{and the demand for}} excess reserves, treating assets of the Federal Reserve as policy tools, and estimate the effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on overnight funding rates.

Further, assuming a path for removing <b>monetary</b> policy <b>accommodation</b> that is consistent with the FOMC’s exit principles, we project that the federal funds rate increases to 70 basis points, settling in a corridor bracketed by the discount rate and the interest rate on excess reserves, as excess reserves of depository institutions decline to near zero...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. economy {{appears to}} have become less {{responsive}} to monetary policy since the early 1980 s. Empirical analysis shows that while employment has become less sensitive to interest rates over time, changes {{in the conduct of}} monetary policy have not contributed to this decline. The U. S. economy {{appears to have}} become less responsive to monetary policy over the past three decades. Slow recoveries followed recessions in the 1990 s and 2000 s despite sizeable <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodations.</b> In 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee emphasized the importance of the labor market in its policy statements, suggesting a direct link between monetary policy and employment. To examine whether the economy’s interest sensitivity has changed, we analyze the relationship between the federal funds rate and employment. Our findings suggest the economy has indeed become less interest sensitive. The interest rate channel is the most frequently mentioned transmission mechanism through which monetary policy affects the economy. In this channel, a cut in the federal funds rate leads to a decline in real interest rates if prices are slow to adjust. Lower real interest rates, by reducing borrowing costs, increase consumption spending and investment activity. Then, to meet the higher demand for goods and services, firms increase employment. To investigate whether employment has become less interest sensitive, we use a vector autoregression (VAR...|$|R

We show that a model that allows for a role of nominal wage rigidity, coupled with a modest degree of price stickiness as some recent research suggests, provides a better account for the macroeconomic effects of technology shocks on the labor market. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite an {{unprecedented}} degree of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>accommodation,</b> including record-low interest rates, {{the pace of}} the current economic recovery has been only moderate. This moderate pace was unexpected by many forecasters and prompted extensive research into the roles of credit frictions, uncertainty, and other factors. One way these factors may have weakened the recovery is by reducing the stimulative effect that a decline in interest rates usually has on spending by consumers and businesses. This article focuses on consumer spending on durable goods. It finds that the effect of interest rates on this category of spending has weakened in the current recovery. Durable goods purchases, which include residential investment as well as spending on vehicles, recreational goods, and household goods, are a particularly interest-sensitive component of consumer spending. In the first four years of previous recoveries, a decline in interest rates elicited a significant increase i...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, the U. S. economy seems to have become less {{responsive}} to monetary policy. Slow recoveries followed recessions in 1990 - 91, 2001, and 2007 - 09, a con-trast to the much more rapid recoveries that followed pre- 1990 reces-sions. These slow recoveries occurred despite sizeable monetary accom-modation from the Federal Reserve, primarily through reductions in short-term interest rates. This article investigates shifts in the economy’s interest sensitivity by examining how total employment responds to changes in monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has emphasized the important link between monetary policy and employment. For ex-ample, in September 2012, the FOMC announced its intention to provide additional <b>monetary</b> policy <b>accommodation</b> on an open-ended basis that would continue as long as “the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially. ” While this implies a direct transmis-sion channel between monetary policy and employment, the empirical analysis in this article suggests aggregate employment has become les...|$|R
40|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances, {{the fiscal}} implications of central bank policies {{tend to be}} seen as relatively minor and escape close scrutiny. The global financial crisis of 2008, however, demanded an extraordinary response by central banks which brought to light the immense power of central bank balance sheet policies as well as their major fiscal implications. Once the zero lower bound on interest rates is reached, expanding a central bank's balance sheet becomes the central instrument for providing additional <b>monetary</b> policy <b>accommodation.</b> However, with interest rates near zero, the line separating fiscal and monetary policy is blurred. Furthermore, discretionary decisions associated with asset purchases and liquidity provision, as well as with lender-of-last-resort operations benefiting private entities, can have major distributional effects that are ordinarily associated with fiscal policy. In the euro area, discretionary central bank decisions can have immense distributional effects across member states. However, decisions of this nature are incompatible with the role of unelected officials in democratic societies. Drawing on the response to the crisis by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, this paper explores the tensions arising from central bank balance sheet policies and addresses pertinent questions about the governance and accountability of independent central banks in a democratic society...|$|R

Each regime can be characterized by {{the degree to which}} price shocks are accommodated and the width of the exchange rate band. Special cases of <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> are a peg, a clean float and a PPP exchange rate rule. First, the optimal degree of <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> of price shocks is analysed when there is no exchange rate band. Given that the welfare loss is a weighted sum of the asymptotic variances of output and of consumer prices, <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> is particularly strong when the authorities care relatively more about full employment than price stability. More flexible labour markets induce right-wing governments to move towards a cleaner float and left-wing governments towards a PPP exchange rate rule. Second, the effects of exchange rate bands and the accompanying inframarginal interventions are examined when allowance is made for intramarginal interventions as well. Such a framework can, in contrast to the pioneering Krugman analysis, explain the observed hump-shaped unconditional density functions of EMS exchange rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{account for the}} U. S. Fed's {{response}} to money demand shocks by allowing for less-than-complete accommodation in the estimation of the Fed's money supply policy rule. We find a significantly lower degree of money accommodation in the 1979 - 1982 period, which hints at money targeting during that period rather than interest rate targeting. We identify the path of money demand and money supply shocks and comment on their effects on the dynamic behavior of money, interest rates, output and inflation: the monetary policy intermediate target seems {{not to be the}} key determinant of macro-dynamics. Our results allow us to offer comments on the implications for monetary policy of both the degree of money demand accommodation - thus, of the intermediate monetary policy target - and the evolution (reduction) of macroeconomic volatility between 1984 and 2007.

40|$|Central {{banks in}} {{advanced}} economies have deployed {{a variety of}} unconventional policies during the crisis. It {{can be seen that}} the central banks have been mostly successful at achieving their objectives and that spillover to other countries have—thus far at least—been benign overall. Also it can be considered that using unconventional measures may be appropriate in some circumstances, but also they can have disadvantages and all the benefits for using such measures need to be balanced against potential costs. Prior to the crisis the monetary policy was implemented by central banks in a predictable and systematic way, and its transmission mechanism was understood by the economic agents. A transparent central bank reaction function (or broad rule) guided market expectations of future interest rates. After the crisis appeared, the central banks from developed countries applied unconventional tools 1 to address two important objectives: first one is to restore the proper functioning of financial markets and intermediation, and second one is to provide further <b>monetary</b> policy <b>accommodation.</b> Both these objectives need to support financial stability, including the diminishing big risks in acute phases of the crisis (collapse of the financial system, depression, and deflation).

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{investigate}} {{the link between}} exchange rate accommodation and inflation persistence in Europe.

In the estimation procedure we allow {{for the presence of}} an unknown number of shifts in the mean of inflation. Our results provide supportive evidence for the existence of a positive link between exchange rate accommodation and inflation persistence for the smaller and more dependent ERM countries. For the larger countries and the countries that remained outside the ERM for most of the period we find hardly any evidence of such positive link. Overall, our results provide modest support for the existence of the theoretically hypothesized positive link between exchange rate accommodation and inflation persistence. ∗ Kool is at the University Maastricht, while Lammertsma is at the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), the Hague, the Netherlands.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main issues that supply shocks pose for {{the conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy. A simple version of the Gordon-Phelps model shows that the necessary condition for actual real GNP to be maintained at its equilibrium level {{in the wake of a}} supply shock is for the change innominal GNP to exceed the change in the nominal wage by the change in the income share of the raw material in GNP. The required "wedge" between nominal GNP and wage growth can be accomplished by any combination of <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> and nominal wage flexibility. Without this combination a "macroeconomic externality" occurs, with real CNP falling below its equilibrium level. The obstacles to <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> are examined in terms of a taxonomic wage adjustment equation that allows for differing responses to current inflation, lagged inflation, and lagged wage change. <b>Monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> is infeasible when there is full indexation to current inflation and creates a permanent acceleration of inflation following a one-time permanent shock when there is indexation to lagged inflation. With "forward-looking" expectation formation in the sense of Taylor, a supply shock is likely to cause changes in parameters of the wage adjustment equation as workers attempt to avoid the macroeconomic externality. The final section of the paper discusses doctrinal debates that originated in part from the empirical failures of earlier Phillips curves that neglected supply shocks. ...|$|E
40|$|Macroeconomic stabilisatin {{and foreign}} {{exchange}} market interventions are investigated {{within the context of}} a stochastic small open economy. With money demand shocks a peg is optimal, but with goods demand shocks a nominal income target is best. With supply shocks the optimal degree of <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation</b> rises with the welfare weight attached to output rather than to price stability. A nominal exchange rate band is not advisable from a stabilisation point of view, albeit that with money demand shocks no welfare losses are incurred. With goods demand shocks, narrowing the band affects the optimal coefficient of intramarginal <b>monetary</b> <b>accommodation.</b> With supply shocks and no intramarginal interventions, it is desirable to have a wider band if there is a relatively large weight on price rather than output stability.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{expansion in the}} United States became increasingly well established {{in the first half}} of 2004, but the pace of inflation picked up from its very low rate in 2003. At the time of the February Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, considerable evidence suggested that the U. S. economy had moved into a period of more-vigorous expansion. Nonetheless, some businesses remained cautious about hiring and investment. In the event, businesses stepped up their hiring in the spring, and capital spending seems to have continued apace. > Over the first half of this year, energy prices soared, and inflation in core consumer prices increased. To some extent, the upturn in core inflation reflected the indirect effects of higher energy prices. In addition, strengthening aggregate demand worldwide induced a surge in the prices of many primary commodities and industrial materials, and the decline in the dollar in 2003 put upward pressure on import prices. In this environment, firms were better able to pass on the higher costs of imports, raise the prices of domestically produced items that compete with imports, and in many cases boost their profit margins. > Monetary policy was very accommodative at the start of 2004 as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sought to provide continuing support to the {{economic expansion}}. Following some upbeat labor market reports, solid growth in output, and a pickup in core consumer price inflation, the FOMC announced at its May meeting that it believed that the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>accommodation</b> then in place could be "removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

Semi-strong form efficiency in stock market, foreign exchange market and interbank money market is investigated by using the direct Granger-causality tests. The paper reports significant deviations from efficient market hypothesis with respect to changes in market liquidity in all markets above for the period January 1989 to July 1995. It is also found that these markets are pairwise interdependent. However, market liquidity cannot be predicted by using developments in the financial market.

This paper advances a new proposal called PEP: Peg the Export Price. Most applicable for countries that are specialized in the production of a particular mineral or agricultural product, the proposal calls on them to commit to fix the price of that commodity in terms of domestic currency. A series of simulations shows how such a proposal would have worked for oil producers over the period 1970 - 2000. The paths of real oil prices, exports, and debt are simulated under alternative regimes. An illustrative finding is that countries that suffered a declining world market in oil or other export commodities in the late 1990 s, would under the PEP proposal have automatically experienced a depreciation and a boost to exports when it was most needed. The argument for PEP is that it simultaneously delivers automatic accommodation to terms of trade shocks, as floating exchange rates are supposed to do, while retaining the credibility-enhancing advantages of a nominal anchor, as dollar pegs are supposed to do. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate over}} {{monetary}} standards and exchange rate regimes {{for developing countries}} is as wide open as ever. On the one hand, the big selling points of floating exchange rates [...] <b>monetary</b> independence and <b>accommodation</b> of terms of trade shocks [...] have not lived up to their promise. On the other hand, proposals for credible institutional monetary commitments to nominal anchors have each run aground on their own peculiar shoals. Rigid pegs to the dollar, for example, are dangerous when the dollar appreciates relative to other export markets. This study explores a proposal that countries specialized in the export of a particular commodity should peg their currency to that commodity. When the dollar price of the commodity on world markets falls, the dollar exchange rate of the local currency would fall in tandem. The country would thus reap {{the best of both}} worlds: the advantage of a nominal anchor for monetary policy, together with the automatic accommodation to terms of trade shocks that floating rates claim to deliver. The paper conducts a set of counter-factual experiments. For each of a list of countries specialized in particular mineral or agricultural commodities, what would have happened, over the last 30 years, if it had pegged its currency to that commodity, as compared to pegging to the dollar, yen, or mark, or as compared to whatever exchange rate policy it actually followed historically? We compute what would have happened under these scenarios to the price of the commodity in local terms, and we then simulate the implications for exports. Illustrative of the results is that some victims of financial difficulties in the late 1990 s might have achieved a stimulus to exports precisely when it was most needed, without having to go through wrenching currency colla [...] ...|$|R
