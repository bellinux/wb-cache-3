50|$|The <b>Cascade</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserve {{was created}} in September 1893 by {{proclamation}} of President Grover Cleveland. This proclamation {{was in response to}} numerous petitions from local citizens requesting protection of the Cascade mountain range. The <b>Cascade</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserve stretched from the Columbia River almost to the California border. From 1893 to 1897, the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserve was largely managed as a preserve.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserve {{was divided}} into the Oregon National <b>Forest,</b> the <b>Cascade</b> National <b>Forest,</b> the Umpqua National Forest and the Crater National Forest.

40|$|Environmental {{change and}} human {{activity}} {{have been the}} driving forces of fire activity in Pacific Northwest forests throughout the Holocene. Fire exclusion policy following the fires of 1910 was intended to remove fire from federally-managed forest ecosystems. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} fire suppression over the last century, we examined area burned by wildfires in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in decadal intervals using GIS. Analyses of these data indicate that {{for the better part of}} the 20 th century, fire exclusion efforts were very successful. However, despite technological advancements in wildfire suppression the data demonstrate that area burned in recent decades has greatly increased. It is understood that the removal of fire from eastern <b>Cascade</b> <b>forests</b> has increased their susceptibility to high-severity wildfires. In order to more effectively manage these forests it is important to understand how fire regimes have varied in longer timescales. To address this, we retrieved Holocene-length sediment cores from Blue Lake and Doheney Lake in the Sinlahekin Wildlife Area, Okanogan County, WA. Through the use of macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis we will reconstruct the vegetation and fire history for the Sinlahekin study sites. Preliminary results indicate major shifts in fire activity prior to and after Euro- American settlement. Further analysis of these records will establish a Holocene fire record and determine its linkages with vegetation change, climate variability, and human activities. The results of this research will aid in management decisions regarding the use of fire in eastern <b>Cascade</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The Central Western Cascades and {{southeast}} Zaire {{were selected to}} test the distance decay and deforestation models on forest environments. Distance gradients included away from cities, and away from highways/roads. Two forest definitions were used in each study site. The "extended-forest" definition included areas with at least 30 percent canopy cover in the central western Cascades, and with at least 10 percent canopy cover in southeast Zaire. The "restricted-forest" definition included at least 80 years old conifer forests in the central western <b>Cascades,</b> and <b>forested</b> areas least affected by human activities in southeast Zaire. Additional variables included land ownership, population growth rates, per capita gross national products/money income. The distance decay model assumed increasing forest cover with distance. Extended-forest cover was predicted to increase more rapidly than restricted-forest cover. Forest cover was also hypothesized to increase more rapidly with distance away from highways/roads than away from cities, and more rapidly in southeast Zaire than in the central Western Cascades. Furthermore, {{it was hypothesized that}} forest loss rates were higher in southeast Zaire than in the Central Western Cascades. Resulting distance decay curves varied with study sites, land ownership, and forest types. The impact of distance was more identifiable in the restricted than the extended forest definition in the central western <b>Cascades.</b> <b>Forests</b> with at least 30 percent canopy cover increased more rapidly than unmanaged forests. Slope values in the away-from-highways gradient were also higher than in the away-from-cities gradient. There {{was no significant difference between}} forest types, and distance gradients in southeast Zaire. The distance was a constraint in private non-industrial lands in the central western Cascades and in all lands in southeast Zaire. This was not always the case with lands owned by United States Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and private industrial. The deforestation model was not validated in the central western <b>Cascades.</b> The average <b>forest</b> loss rate was 0. 5 percent per year (1972 - 1988), and it was 1. 3 in southeast Zaire (1973 - 1989). Differences in results were due to natural variability of forest environments, external demands, forest cut policy, socio economic reasons, and population density...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient framework to perform recognition and grasp detection of objects from RGB-D images of real scenes. The framework uses a novel architecture of hierarchical <b>cascaded</b> <b>forests,</b> in which object-class and grasp-pose probabilities are computed {{at different levels}} of an image hierarchy (e. g., patch and object levels) and fused to infer the class and the grasp of unseen objects. We introduce a novel training objective function that minimizes the uncertainties of the class labels and the grasp ground truths at the leaves of the forests, thereby enabling the framework to perform the recognition and grasp detection of objects. Our objective function is learned from features that are extracted from RGB-D point clouds of the objects. For that, we propose a novel method to encode an RGB-D point cloud into a representation that facilitates the use of large convolution neural networks to extract discriminative features from RGB-D images. We evaluate our framework on challenging object datasets, where we demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-theart methods in terms of object-recognition and grasp-detection accuracies. We also show experiments by using live video streams from a Kinect mounted on our in-house robotic platform...|$|R
50|$|Sub-ecoregions of the Pacific {{temperate}} {{rain forest}} ecoregion {{as defined by}} the WWF include the Northern Pacific coastal forests, Queen Charlotte Islands ecoregion, Vancouver Island ecoregion, British Columbia mainland coastal forests, Central Pacific coastal <b>forests,</b> Southern <b>Cascades</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion, Klamath-Siskiyou coastal forests, and Northern California coastal forests ecoregions. They vary in their species composition, but are all predominantly coniferous, sometimes with an understory of broadleaved trees and shrubs. Most of the precipitation occurs in winter but summer fogs moisture is extracted by the trees and produces a fog drip keeping the forest moist. The Northern California coastal forests are home to the Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), the world's tallest tree. In the other ecoregions, Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis), Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Western redcedar (Thuja plicata) are the most important tree species. A common feature of Pacific temperate rain forests of North America is the Nurse log, a fallen tree which as it decays, provides ecological facilitation to seedlings. Trees such as the Coast Douglas-fir, Western Hemlock, Western Red Cedar, Pacific Yew, and Vine Maple are more closely related to coniferous and deciduous trees in the temperate forests of East Asia.|$|R
50|$|The High Southern <b>Cascades</b> Montane <b>Forest</b> {{ecoregion}} is an undulating, glaciated, volcanic plateau {{punctuated by}} isolatedbuttes and cones. Many tarns occur. With an elevation that varies from 4,000 to 8,200 feet (1220 to 2500 m), {{it is an}} intermediate zone between the Southern Cascades and the Subalpine/Alpine zone. Cryic soils support mixed coniferous forests dominated by mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and Pacific silver fir; they are colder than the mesic and frigid soils of the Southern Cascades. Grand fir, white fir, and Shasta red fir also occur and become more common toward the south and east. Whitebark pine is found at high elevations. Understory plants include woodrush, Prince’s pine, lupine, and sidebells shinleaf. At the highest elevations, open meadows support Shasta buckwheat, Newberry knotweed, and Brewer's sedge. The region tends to be drier than the <b>Cascade</b> Crest Montane <b>Forest,</b> with a longer summer drought and more intermittent streams. The region covers 915 sq mi in Southern Oregon and includes the lower elevations of Crater Lake National Park.|$|R
