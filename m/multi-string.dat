5000|$|DSPACE is {{traditionally}} {{measured on a}} deterministic Turing machine. Several important space complexity classes are sublinear, that is, smaller than {{the size of the}} input. Thus, [...] "charging" [...] the algorithm for the size of the input, or for the size of the output, would not truly capture the memory space used. This is solved by defining the <b>multi-string</b> Turing machine with input and output, which is a standard multi-tape Turing machine, except that the input tape may never be written-to, and the output tape may never be read from. This allows smaller space classes, such as L (logarithmic space), to be defined in terms of the amount of space used by all of the work tapes (excluding the special input and output tapes).|$|E
5000|$|In 2006 Bluegrass {{created an}} {{underwater}} saw {{and had it}} patented for its use of hydraulic motors in combination with diamond wire {{to create a new}} sawing platform which was operational underwater. The continuous loop, four wheel drive diamond wire saw reduced cut times by providing greater torque and consistent wire grip. These improvements reduced slippage and subsequent wire breaks.Since then the patented underwater saw has been used domestically and globally on offshore decommissioning jobs including cutting single- and <b>multi-string</b> conductors, pipelines, seabed umbilicals, pilings, mooring chains, wellheads, risers, slot recovery and jacket lets. On platforms this technology can be applied to perform modifications, maintenance upgrades, to remove crane pedestals, compressors and topsides, and for hurricane remediation.Sub-sea saws can be installed by divers while being monitored and powered from a barge or platform, or they can be installed and powered by working class ROVs.The robust characteristics of these four wheel drive bespoke underwater wire saws, combined with remote control functionality, makes them suitable to extreme offshore decommissioning conditions such as the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a broader {{understanding}} of the Yepes ten-string guitar. Since its inception, twenty-eight years ago, no authoritative work has been published providing inferential detail which explains the concept and development of the Yepes guitar. As a result, this instrument has been, and still is, criticized by some, largely from ignorance or lack of knowledge about the instrument. In an attempt to rectify this situation and make the instrument's extended possibilities known, the author has undertaken extensive research and has interviewed, amongst others, leading international authorities associated with the Yepes ten-string guitar. As a result of these efforts, a clearer and more positive understanding of the instrument has emerged. This in turn has become the foundation on which this dissertation has been written. The opening chapter of this dissertation provides an overview, showing how the guitar emerged and developed before the concept of <b>multi-string</b> guitars became established in Europe, during the second half of the eighteenth century. Aspects pertaining to the early guitar's physical features, performance practices, music, tuning and stringing methods are discussed. Several <b>multi-string</b> vihuelas and guitars are also mentioned. The following chapter presents a survey of numerous experiments carried out during the 1770 - 1900 period; to 'improve' the capabilities of the guitar. Here a number of early <b>multi-string</b> instruments related to the Yepes ten-string guitar are discussed. These include guitars with added basses, guitars with added trebles, guitars with added basses and trebles, and guitars with multiple necks. The third chapter shows how out of an enormous variety of eccentric forms of the guitar, some professional guitarists opted for <b>multi-string</b> guitars (with added basses) as their instruments, whilst others preferred the six-string variety. The music of guitarist-composers who composed for <b>multi-string</b> guitars is discussed alongside those who wrote specifically for the six-string guitar. The rationale for the tuning and disposition of strings on most of these <b>multi-string</b> guitars, past and present, as well as several illustrations showing their physical features are included. The penultimate chapter comprises an interview with Narciso Yepes and other leading figures associated with the ten-string guitar. The reasons behind Yepes' unique concept for the ten-string guitar, arguments for and against the instrument, as well as its tuning and problems related to playing this instrument are discussed. The chapter includes an inquiry(with examples) showing how the ten-string guitar can be used, amongst other things, to facilitate the playing of difficult passages in music originally composed for the six-string guitar. The extension of the repertoire with music composed specifically for this instrument is also briefly discussed. A comprehensive discography of recordings made by Narciso Yepes on the ten-string guitar is presented in the appendix. A more detailed discussion of the ten-string guitar repertoire in the twentieth century is presented in the final chapter. It includes several compositions originally intended for the traditional guitar, which have become associated with the Yepes guitar. At least five compositions composed and dedicated to Narciso Yepes by various composers are also examined. It is concluded that this instrument clearly offers more than what has been assumed over the past twenty-eight years...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{continuous}} and rampant {{increase in the}} size of domain specific data sources, there is a real and sustained need for fast processing in time-sensitive applications, such as medical record information extraction at the point of care, genetic feature extraction for personalized treatment, as well as off-line knowledge discovery such as creating evidence based medicine.

To solve this data mining need not efficiently handled by traditional information extraction and retrieval techniques, we propose a Block Suffix Shifting-based approach, which is an improvement over the state of the art <b>multi-string</b> matching algorithms such as Aho-Corasick, Commentz-Walter, and Wu-Manber.

They include stationary and dynamical (open, closed, straight, finitely and infinitely long) strings as well as <b>multi-string</b> solutions, in terms of elliptic functions.

In anti de Sitter spacetime, the solutions describe an infinite number of infinitely long stationary strings of equal energy but different pressures. In de Sitter spacetime, outside the horizon, they describe infinitely many dynamical strings infalling non-radially, scattering at the horizon and going back to spatial infinity in different directions. For special values of the constants of motion, there are families of solutions with selected finite numbers of different and independent strings. In black hole spacetimes (without cosmological constant), no <b>multi-string</b> solutions are found.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{single-stage}} constant-current driver with {{power factor correction}} (PFC) and temperature rise compensation for igniting <b>multi-string</b> high-brightness light-emitting diodes (HB-LEDs) in parallel connection. The devised dimmable LED driver is composed of a coupled inductor single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) with PFC mechanism and k-channel current regulators (CRs) with dimming and temperature compensation capabilities. The LED voltage drop features negative temperature coefficient characteristic and is subject to change depending on the forward current and the thermal resistivity of a given package. By regulating the LED feeding voltage continuously, a dynamic voltage regulation (DVR) control is addressed in this paper to automatically minimize the power dissipation of the CR caused by the voltage drop variation due to the LED junction temperature drift. With low implemented outlay, the studied topology of <b>multi-string</b> LED driver has good power conversion efficiency and low total harmonic distortion (THD). The control mechanisms and design considerations are analyzed and discussed. An 80 W laboratory prototype implemented with two low-cost commercial controllers is also built and tested.
