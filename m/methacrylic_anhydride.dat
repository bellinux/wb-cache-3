40|$|International audienceSyntheses of new phosphonated methacrylates with 2 or 3 {{hydrocarbon}} methylene spacers {{were investigated}} {{in order to}} avoid the conventional methacrylation of hydroxyphosphonate compounds with methacryloyl chloride. The first possibility concerns the esterification of <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> in the presence of either 2 -hydroxyethylphosphonate or 3 -hydroxypropylphosphonate. This reaction was proved to be quantitative when a basic catalyst, i. e. n-methylimidazole, was used at 60 °C. However, this reaction also generates a side product, i. e. methacrylic acid, which was difficult to remove due to it having similar solubility to both dimethyl(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate and dimethyl(2 -methacryloyloxypropyl) phosphonate. The second process was based on the alcoholysis of MMA in the presence of the above hydroxy compounds. This reaction also proceeded quantitatively with Zr(AcAc) 4 as acid catalyst. Unlike esterification of <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> this second process did not require any solvent. The final phosphonated methacrylates were obtained with high purity, as the side product of the reaction (i. e., methanol) could be easily removed due to the azeotropic behavior of MMA/Methanol...|$|E

The resin consists of star-shaped methacrylated oligomers of lactic acid (LA).

In the second step, the oligomers were end-functionalized by <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> The resin was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy, NMR, rubber process analyzer, and TOF-SIMS.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Commercial {{light-sensitive}} resins for Rapid Prototyping {{of cellular}} materials are often unsuitable for different molding techniques because {{removal of the}} mold uses thermal decomposition at temperatures of up to 600 °C. In this study, a resin formulation based on water-soluble polymers was developed and evaluated regarding its usabil-ity as sacrificial mold material. The base monomer dimeth-ylacrylamide gave fast curing and excellent polymer solu-bility. Methacrylic acid {{was found to be}} a useful comonomer to improve mechanical strength and feature resolution. The latter criterion was also improved by adding poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) as filler and by using a hydrolytically cleavable crosslinking agent such as <b>methacrylic</b> acid <b>anhydride...</b>|$|R

Octakis(tnethacryloxypropyldimethylsiloxy) octasilsesquioxane (OMPS) was synthesized via the reaction of methacryloyl chloride or <b>methacrylic</b> acid <b>anhydride</b> with OHPS, with the latter giving improved purity. Polymerization of OMPS with methyl inethacrylate using a dibenzoylperoxide initiator gave a highly cross-linked polymer. Characterization of the polymer was performed using Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, Si- 29 NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.

40|$|Double {{chemical}} functionalization of gelatin by methacrylation and acetylation of free amino groups enables {{control over}} both the viscous behavior of its solutions and the mechanical {{properties of the}} resulting hydrogels after photochemical crosslinking. The degree of methacrylation {{is controlled by the}} molar excess of <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> applied. Tenfold molar excess leads to highly methacrylated gelatin (GM 10), resulting in solutions with low viscosities within the inkjet-printable range (10 wt%: 3. 3 ± 0. 5 mPa s, 37 °C) and crosslinked hydrogels with high storage moduli G′ (10 wt%: 15. 2 ± 6. 4 kPa). Twofold excess of <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> leads to less methacrylated gelatin (GM 2) proper for preparation of soft hydrogels (10 wt%: G′ = 9. 8 ± 4. 6 mPa s) but its solutions are highly viscous (10 wt%: 14. 2 ± 1. 1 mPa s, 37 °C) and thus prone to clogging printing nozzles. Here we show that additional introduction of acetyl functionalities into GM 2 results in a significant decrease in solution viscosity (10 wt%: 2. 9 ± 0. 2 mPa s, 37 °C) and prevention of physical gel formation. In such a manner twofold functionalized gelatin can be inkjet-printed while the degree of chemical crosslinking remains low and the resulting gels are soft. Thus, by adjustable twofold modification of gelatin, i. e. inserting photochemically reactive and inert groups, a versatile bioink for inkjet bioprinting is created, which allows for addressing ECM based hydrogel matrices with a broad range of physical properties. Moreover, bioinks are proven to be cytocompatible and proper for inkjet printing of viable mammalian cells...|$|E
40|$|Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) {{networks}} were prepared from macromonomer diols functionalized with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> which {{allows one to}} get self-crosslinkable polymers.

Dielectric and calorimetric experiments allow one to conclude the microphase separation of the system: one phase made of pure PCL domains while the second one consists of caprolactone units, which somehow plasticize PLA and moves its main relaxation (glass transition) to lower temperatures. The effect of crosslinking PLA on {{the dynamics of the}} system was further investigated by comparing with the dynamics for linear PLA...|$|E
40|$|Biochemically {{modified}} proteins {{have attracted}} significant attention {{due to their}} widespread applications as biomaterials. For instance, chemically modified gelatin derivatives have been widely explored to develop hydrogels for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Among the reported methods, modification of gelatin with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (MA) stands out as a convenient and efficient strategy to introduce functional groups and form hydrogels via photopolymerization. Combining light-activation of modified gelatin with soft lithography has enabled the materialization of microfabricated hydrogels. So far, this gelatin derivative {{has been referred to}} in the literature as gelatin methacrylate, gelatin methacrylamide, or gelatin methacryloyl, with the same abbreviation of GelMA. Considering the complex composition of gelatin and the presence of different functional groups on the amino acid residues, both hydroxyl groups and amine groups can possibly react with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> during functionalization of the protein. This can also apply to the modification of other proteins, such as recombinant human tropoelastin to form MA-modified tropoelastin (MeTro). Here, we employed analytical methods to quantitatively determine the amounts of methacrylate and methacrylamide groups in MA-modified gelatin and tropoelastin to better understand the reaction mechanism. By combining two chemical assays with instrumental techniques, such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) and liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), our results indicated that while amine groups had higher reactivity than hydroxyl groups and resulted in a majority of methacrylamide groups, modification of proteins by MA could lead to the formation of both methacrylamide and methacrylate groups. It is therefore suggested that the standard terms for GelMA and MeTro should be defined as gelatin methacryloyl and methacryloyl-substituted tropoelastin, respectively, to remain consistent with the widespread abbreviations used in literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the length of}} an oligo(ethylene glycol) spacer (EGn, where n is the number of ethylene glycol units) in a 1 -pyrenemethoxy-EGn methacrylate (PyEG-MA) monomer on the incorporation of the monomer into a poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) latex and on the diffusion of the pyrene-labeled PBMA (PyEGn-PBMA) in latex films was investigated. The PyEGn-MA monomers were prepared by two different methods. The anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide, using potassium 1 -pyrenemethoxide as initiator, yielded ethoxylated 1 -pyrenemethanol that was reacted with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> to yield the PyEGn-MA monomer. Alternately, monotosylated well-defined ethylene glycol oligomers were successively coupled with 1 -pyrenemethoxide and <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> The monomers were copolymerized with n butyl methacrylate by emulsion polymerization. A longer EG 7. 4 spacer was found to enhance the incorporation of the PyEG 7. 4 MA monomer up to 3. 2 mol%, substantially higher that 1. 9 mol% achieved previously with an EG 3 spacer. The higher incorporation of PyEG 7. 4 MA into the Py-PBMA latex led to a stronger pyrene excimer fluorescence (PEF) signal in the spectrum of the latex film. The goal was to use these fluorescently labeled particles to probe interparticle polymer diffusion (IPD) during film formation. Several issues arose in the copolymerization of PyEG 7. 4 MA and n-butyl methacrylate (BMA). The aggregation of PyEG 7. 4 MA into flower-like micelles was observed. Even though steps were taken to mitigate this effect in the emulsion polymerization process, the pyrene molecules tended to be more concentrated near the surface of the latex particles. This resulted in irreproducible annealing results, and it is recommended that these particles not be employed for the study of IPD...|$|E

Stereolithography was used to build designed porous scaffolds using the resin containing PCL macromer, lrgacure 369 photoinitiator, inhibitor and dye. A suitable resin viscosity was obtained by heating the resin during the curing process. The scaffolds precisely matched the computer-aided designs, with no observable material shrinkage. The average porosity was 70. 5 +/- 0. 8 %, and the average pore size was 465 pm. The pore network was highly interconnected.

For property comparisons, P 1 –OH/HP 7200 thermosets were also prepared. The reaction between active ester and epoxy results in an ester linkage, which is less polar than secondary alcohol resulting from the reaction between phenolic OH and epoxy, so P 1 –MMA/HP 7200 are more hydrophobic and exhibit better dielectric properties than P 1 –OH/HP 7200. The double bond of methacrylate can cure at higher temperatures, leading to epoxy thermosets with a high-Tg and moderate-to-low dielectric properties...|$|E

The influence of MVA loading (10 - 40 %) on the viscosity, gelation time, curing extent, thermo-mechanical properties, and tensile properties of the MAESO-MVA copolymer was investigated. The synthesized MVA exhibited very low volatility relative to styrene, which is beneficial for the development of construction material with low or zero emission. With 40 wt% of MVA content in MAESO, a significant reduction of system viscosity (over an order of magnitude) was achieved. Increasing the MVA content accelerated the crosslinking reaction rate and improved thermal and mechanical properties of the MAESO-MVA system. The glass transition temperature increased with increasing MVA content. Soxhlet extraction experiments showed that more than 90 % of the components were incorporated into the crosslinking network.

Culturing of PC- 12 cells showed that after initial cell adhesion, the cells proliferated {{on the surface of the}} PTMC-MA/rGO composite films, regardless of the amount of rGO loading. The results imply that these PTMC-MA/rGO composites show promise toward their use in the fabrication of NGCs. The electrically conductive materials are expected to increase the rate of axonal regeneration, resulting in improved functional recovery of transected peripheral nerve...|$|E
40|$|Gelatin is {{a natural}} protein with many {{desirable}} properties for application as a biomaterial, including scaffolding for tissue engineering. In this work gelatin A with a molecular weight in the range 50 ? 100 kg mol- 1 was modified with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and processed into a concentrated oil-in-water emulsion. Polymerization of the continuous phase {{gave rise to a}} polyHIPE, a porous material possessing a highly interconnected, trabecular morphology. In the paper, we focused on the goal of obtaining matrixes characterized by suitable sizes of both voids and interconnects, to allow an in depth colonization from transplanted cells. In this respect, we investigated the role of the volume percentage of the dispersed phase and the effect of additives. It was established that high pore volumes (? 90 %) are to be preferred, because they allow the production of solid foams characterized by average void and interconnect diameters of approximately 20 and 10 ?m, respectively. These values are still inadequate for the intended application of these scaffolds but represent a good starting point for further improvements. These were achieved through the use of additives, namely sodium chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide, which partially destabilized the precursor emulsion and allowed a solid foam to be obtained with void and interconnect diameters in the range of 30 ? 150 ?m and 10 ? 50 ?m, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 143 - 147) Solution {{and solid}} state 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy were correlated with infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and weight loss analysis to investigate the structure and composition of poly(methacrylic anhydride) (PMAH). PMAH can be prepared in either of two ways: by the cyclopolymerization of its monomer, <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> or by the thermal conversion of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) or certain of its esters. Although {{the products of the}} two synthesis routes might be assumed to be identical, structural variations can occur that are typical of each method; 1. 2 therefore, in this thesis, the product of the former synthesis route is termed "cy-PMAH" to differentiate it from the product of the latter. A selective hydrolysis process observed in the cy-PMAH samples was interpreted {{to be the result of}} conformational instabilities, possibly related to tacticity, which may be introduced during the cyclopolymerization process. Studies of this polymer also suggest the presence of hydrogen bonding between the hydrolyzed acid units which does not occur in the conventionally-prepared poly(methacrylic acid) homopolymer. Alternative explanations are suggested, one of which is related to the microtacticity of the hydrolyzed areas. A course of future research is suggested to test new hypotheses on the structure and catalysis of cy-PMAH and the hydrogen bonding of PMAA. Isotactic PMAH (i-PMAH) and syndiotactic PMAH (s-PMAH) were prepared by the thermal conversion of 100...|$|E
40|$|Star-shaped {{bio-based}} resins were synthesized {{by direct}} condensation of lactic acid (LA) with xylitol followed by end-functionalizing of branches by <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> {{with three different}} LA chain lengths (3, 5 and 7). The thermomechanical and structural properties of the resins were characterized by 13 C NMR, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, rheometry, DSC, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), TGA and flexural and tensile tests. An evaluation {{of the effect of}} chain length on the synthesized resins showed that the resin with five LAs exhibited the most favorable thermomechanical properties. Also, the resin's glass transition temperature (103 °C) was substantially higher than that of the thermoplast PLA (ca 55 °C). The resin had low viscosity at its processing temperature (80 °C). The compatibility of the resin with natural fibers was investigated for biocomposite manufacturing. Finally, composites were produced from the n 5 -resin (80 wt% fiber content) using jute fiber. The thermomechanical and morphological properties of the biocomposites were compared with jute-PLA composites and a hybrid composite made of the impregnated jute fibers with n 5 resin and PLA. SEM and DMA showed that the n 5 -jute composites had better mechanical properties than the other composites produced. Inexpensive monomers, good thermomechanical properties and good processability of the n 5 resin make the resin comparable with commercial unsaturated polyester resins...|$|E
40|$|Biological hydrogels {{have been}} {{increasingly}} sought after as e. g. wound dressings or scaffolds for regenerative medicine, {{due to their}} inherent biofunctionality in biological environments. Especially in moist wound healing, the ideal material should absorb large amounts of wound exudate whilst remaining mechanically competent in-situ. Despite their large hydration, however, current biological hydrogels still leave much to be desired in terms of mechanical properties in physiological conditions. To address this challenge, a multi-scale approach is presented for the synthetic design of cyto-compatible collagen hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties (from nano- up to the macro-scale), uniquely high swelling ratios and retained (> 70 %) triple-helical features. Type I collagen was covalently functionalized with three different monomers, i. e. 4 vinylbenzyl chloride, glycidyl methacrylate and <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> respectively. Backbone rigidity, hydrogen-bonding capability and degree of functionalization (F : 16 ± 12 &ndash 91 ± 7 mol. -%) of introduced moieties governed the structure-property relationships in resulting collagen networks, so that the swelling ratio (SR : 707 ± 51 &ndash 1996 ± 182 wt. -%), bulk compressive modulus (E c : 30 ± 7 &ndash 168 ± 40 kPa) and Atomic Force Microscopy elastic modulus (E AFM : 16 ± 2 &ndash 387 ± 66 kPa) were readily adjusted. In light of their remarkably high swelling and mechanical properties, these tunable collagen hydrogels may be further exploited {{for the design of}} advanced dressings for chronic wound care.

40|$|Covalent functionalisation of {{collagen}} {{has been}} shown to be a promising strategy to adjust the mechanical properties of highly swollen collagen hydrogels. At the same time, secondary interactions between for example, amino acidic terminations or introduced functional groups also play an important role and are often challenging to predict and control. To explore this challenge, 4 -vinylbenzyl chloride (4 VBC) and <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (MA) were reacted with type I collagen, and the swelling and rheological properties of resulting photo activated hydrogel systems investigated. 4 VBC-based hydrogels showed significantly increased swelling ratio, in light of the lower degree of collagen functionalisation, with respect to methacrylated collagen networks, whilst rheological storage moduli were found to be comparable between the two systems. To explore the role of benzyl groups in the mechanical properties of the 4 VBC-based collagen system, model chemical force microscopy (CFM) was carried out in aqueous environment with an aromatised probe against an aromatised gold coated glass slide. A marked increase in adhesion force (F: 0. 11 +/- 0. 01 nN) was measured between aromatised samples, compared to the adhesion force observed between the non-modified probe and a glass substrate (F: 2. 64 +/- 1. 82 nN). These results suggest the formation of additional and reversible π-π stacking interactions in aromatic 4 VBC-based networks and explain the remarkable rheological properties of this system in comparison to MA based hydrogels.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveIntervertebral disc (IVD) {{degeneration}} is a {{major health}} concern in the United States. Replacement of the nucleus pulposus (NP) with injectable biomaterials represents a potential treatment strategy for IVD degeneration. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and functional properties of NP cell-encapsulated, photo-crosslinked alginate hydrogels in comparison to ionically crosslinked alginate constructs. MethodsMethacrylated alginate was synthesized by esterification of hydroxyl groups with <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Bovine NP cells were encapsulated in alginate hydrogels by ionic crosslinking using CaCl 2 or through photo-crosslinking upon exposure to long-wave UV light in the presence of a photoinitiator. The hydrogels were evaluated in vitro by gross and histological analysis and in vivo using a murine subcutaneous pouch model. In vivo samples were analyzed for gene expression, ECM localization and accumulation, and equilibrium mechanical properties. ResultsIonically crosslinked hydrogels exhibited inferior proteoglycan accumulation in vitro and were unable to maintain structural integrity in vivo. In further studies, photo-crosslinked alginate hydrogels were implanted for up to 8 weeks to examine NP tissue formation. Photo-crosslinked hydrogels displayed temporal increases in gene expression and assembly of type II collagen and proteoglycans. Additionally, hydrogels remained intact over the duration of the study and the equilibrium Young's modulus increased from 1. 24 ± 0. 09 kPa to 4. 31 ± 1. 39 kPa, indicating the formation of functional matrix with properties comparable to those of the native NP. ConclusionsThese findings support the use of photo-crosslinked alginate hydrogels as biomaterial scaffolds for NP replacement...|$|E
40|$|Algae are {{abundant}} sources of bioactive components with extensive therapeutic properties, receiving {{much interest in}} recent years. The research on marine brown algae, namely one of its polysaccharide-fucoidan, has increased exponentially. Fucoidan is a sulfated cell-wall polysaccharide with several reported biological properties including anticancer, antivirus, anticoagulant, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, fucoidan was functionalized by grafting methacrylic groups in the chain backbone, photo-cross-linkable under visible light to obtain biodegradable structures for tissue engineering. The functionalization reaction {{was carried out by}} concentrations (8 and 12 %) of <b>methacrylic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (MA). The modified fucoidan (MFu) was characterized by FTIR and 1 HNMR spectroscopy to confirm the functionalization. Further, modified fucoidan was photo-cross-linked under visible light and using superhydrophobic surfaces, to obtain spherical particles with controlled geometries benefiting from the high repellence of the surfaces. When using higher concentrations of MA, the particles were observed to exhibit a smaller average diameter. Moreover, the behavior of L 929 mouse fibroblast-like cells was evaluated when cultured in contact with photo-cross-linked particles was investigated, being observed up to 14 days in culture. The photo-cross-linking of MFu under visible light enables thus the formation of particles here suggested as potentially relevant {{in a wide range of}} biomedical applications.
