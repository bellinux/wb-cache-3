40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of a low-intensity wheelchair training on propulsion technique in inactive people with long-term spinal cord injury. Design Participants in this multicenter nonblinded randomized controlled trial were inactive manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury for at least 10 yrs (N = 29), allocated to exercise (n = 14) or no exercise. The 16 -wk training consisted of wheelchair treadmill propulsion at 30 %- 40 % heart rate reserve or equivalent in rate of perceived exertion, twice a week, 30 mins per session. Propulsion technique was assessed at baseline as well as after 8, 16, and 42 wks during two submaximal treadmill-exercise blocks using a <b>measurement</b> <b>wheel</b> attached to a participant's own wheelchair. Changes over time between the groups were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests on difference scores (P < 0. 05 / 3). Results Data of 16 participants could be analyzed (exercise: n = 8). Significant differences between the exercise and control groups were only found in peak force after 8 wks (respective medians, - 20 N vs. 1 N; P = 0. 01; r(u) = 0. 78). Conclusions Significant training effects on propulsion technique were not found in this group. Perhaps, substantial effects require a higher intensity or frequency. Investigating whether more effective and feasible interventions exist might help reduce the population's risk of upper-body joint damage during daily wheelchair propulsion...|$|E

Unfortunately the literature is not really precise about its description, stability and performance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} validation of the OptiPush Biofeedback System, a commercially available, instrumented wheel system that records handrim biomechanics and provides stroke-by-stroke biofeedback and targeting for 11 propulsion variables. Testing of the system revealed accurate <b>measurement</b> of <b>wheel</b> angle (0. 02 % error), wheel speed (0. 06 % error), and handrim loads. The maximum errors in static force and torque measurements were 3. 80 % and 2. 05 %, respectively. Measured forces were also found to be highly linear (0. 985. 998).

40|$|Input force {{evaluation}} {{is always a}} crucial step for the adequate design {{of any kind of}} mechanical system. Direct measurements of input forces typically involve devices that are expensive, intrusive or difficult to calibrate. This is also the case for Road Load Data Acquisition (RLDA) testing campaigns, where the loads due to the road excitations acting on a vehicle are acquired. During RLDA testing campaigns, expensive <b>measurement</b> <b>wheels</b> are commonly used. An appealing alternative procedure, which consists of the use of less expensive sensors in combination with a numerical model of the system, is investigated. In order to combine experimental and simulation data, a coupled state-input estimation approach is used in the proposed procedure. In this approach a finite element model of the system provides simulated data, while common accelerometers and strain gauges provide experimental data. A Kalman filter is then used in order to perform the estimation. This paper presents the derivation of the filter equations that are necessary for the envisioned approach. A numerical example is then performed where the system-under-investigation is an automotive suspension component. status: publishe...|$|R

Methods: In this implementation project standardized tests were performed: wheelchair skills tests, 2 questionnaires, and a steady-state exercise test on a treadmill in which propulsion technique (forces and torques) and physical strain (oxygen uptake, heart rate and mechanical efficiency) were measured.

In order to discuss individual wheelchair performance results with patients and clinicians, reference data were developed, smallest detectable differences were calculated and software was developed to simultaneously show video recordings and force and torque signals. Conclusion: Based on pilot results, the greatest barrier to systematic monitoring of the individual wheelchair fitting and learning process in rehabilitation with, among others, instrumented <b>measurement</b> <b>wheels,</b> was interpretation of outcomes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of wheelchair mass, solid vs. pneumatic tires and tire pressure on physical strain and wheelchair propulsion technique. 11 Able-bodied participants performed 14 submaximal exercise blocks on a treadmill with a fixed speed (1. 11 m/s) within 3 weeks to determine the effect of tire pressure (100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % of the recommended value), wheelchair mass (0 kg, 5 kg, or 10 kg extra) and tire type (pneumatic vs. solid). All test conditions (except pneumatic vs. solid) were performed with and without instrumented <b>measurement</b> <b>wheels.</b> Outcome measures were power output (PO), physical strain (heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO 2), gross mechanical efficiency (ME)) and propulsion technique (timing, force application). At 25 % tire pressure PO and subsequently VO 2 were higher compared to 100 % tire pressure. Furthermore, a higher tire pressure led to a longer cycle time and contact angle and subsequently lower push frequency. Extra mass did not lead to an increase in PO, physical strain or propulsion technique. Solid tires led to a higher PO and physical strain. The solid tire effect was amplified by increased mass (tire x mass interaction). In contrast to extra mass, tire pressure and tire type have an effect on PO, physical strain or propulsion technique of steady-state wheelchair propulsion. As expected, it is important to optimize tire pressure and tire type. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|External loads {{acting on}} {{mechanical}} systems represent important quantities which often {{need to be}} determined for design, control or monitoring purposes. For instance in the automotive sector so-called Wheel Center Forces (WCFs), i. e. the forces acting {{on the center of}} the vehicle wheels, are required in order to perform durability analyses. WCFs can be directly measured by means of dedicated <b>measurement</b> <b>wheels,</b> but the latter turn out to be expensive, intrusive and time-consuming to install. An appealing alternative could be to virtually measure those forces by combining information coming from a system model and more economical, less intrusive and easier-to-install sensors. State estimation is the mathematical tool {{that can be used in}} order to combine simulation and sensors data and to estimate the quantity of interest. More specifically, in this work, an augmented Extended Kalman Filter (A-EKF) based on a multibody model of the system and on a random walk model for the unknown forces is used to process the sensors information. A penalty formulation is used in order to write the equations of the multibody system into the form required for the specific state estimator. A virtual experiment on a McPherson suspension system is performed in order to show the feasibility of the approach. The vertical component of the WCFs is estimated by using the suspension deflection and the acceleration of the wheel center as processed measurements in the estimator. It is also shown how modeling errors are partially compensated in the estimation of the states and of the unknown force. status: publishe...|$|R
