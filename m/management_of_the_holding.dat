McKinney, Jr., the head of American Fletcher, replaced John B. McCoy as president of Banc One Corp. and moved McCoy up to chairman of the combined organization. Another change made in the corporate organization was the formation of a two tiered management system with the formation of statewide holding companies that were placed in between the regional member banks and the ultimate Banc One parent holding company. So, in Indiana, American Fletcher Corporation became Indianapolis based Banc One Indiana and all member banks in Indiana, such as Bank One Lafayette, which previously reported directly to the main parent in Columbus, reported to management in Indianapolis instead.

40|$|Financial {{economists have}} long known that {{actively}} managed mutual funds underperform comparable index funds and that investment management fees are a major contributor to this underperformance. This article shows that <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> mutual fund fees is even greater when one examines what funds actually do with investors’ money. Many actively managed mutual funds have returns that are closely correlated with comparable index funds and yet have annual fees that can be 100 times higher. Because such ‘shadow’ or ‘closet’ index funds provide minimal active <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assets they <b>hold,</b> <b>the</b> implied annual cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active <b>management</b> can dwarf the stated cost. This article provides a simple measure of what investors are actually paying fund managers for that active management that they can compute for themselves data available for free on the Internet.

40|$|Introduction: Current <b>management</b> <b>of</b> anxiety, {{a common}} and {{debilitating}} disorder {{with a high}} social and personal cost, is far from satisfactory. Therefore, {{in the last years}} an urgent need for novel pharmacological approaches has emerged. One such strategy involves targeting the endocannabinoid system (ECS), and there is now considerable evidence for the central role played by ECS in coping with <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> stress and emotions. More recently, attention has moved from directly targeting type- 1 cannabinoid (CB 1) receptors to indirectly enhancing <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> their endogenous ligands, a more valuable strategy that preserves <b>the</b> spatiotemporal specificity <b>of</b> endocannabinoid activity. Despite recent evidence suggesting <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that degradates the endogenous CB 1 agonist arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide), {{further research is needed to}} demonstrate <b>the</b> therapeutic efficacy <b>of</b> FAAH inhibitors, and their putative translation into the clinic. Methods: ST 4070, a novel, potent and selective reversible inhibitor of FAAH, was administered per os in CD 1 male mice (3 to 30 mg/ 10 ml/kg), that were tested in the elevated-plus maze, and in Wistar male rats (3 to 30 mg/ 2. 5 ml/kg), that were tested in the light-dark apparatus. In addition, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> ST 4070 on FAAH activity and on <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> FAAH substrates (anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide) in selected brain regions was assessed by radiochromatography and LC-MS analysis. Results: ST 4070 showed clear anxiolytic-like properties in both rodent models, and in parallel it also produced a clear inhibition of FAAH activity, and a significant increase of anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide in behaviorally-relevant brain regions. Conclusions: Investigation into novel pharmacological targets for <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> anxiety <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> promise to further our understanding of its aetiology, and to develop new and more effective anxiolytic drugs, like the reversible FAAH inhibitor ST 4070.

Formal housing surrounds most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site at a greater distance - some 60 m, or further, from the landfill. Both formal and informally housed residents complain of odours, burning eyes, sore throats and headaches - symptoms which they believed were caused by the landfill. The landfill gas and ambient air were analyzed to classify and quantify the VOCs (volatile organic compounds) emitted and then to compare the quantitative data with recognised standards to establish if the residents are at risk. Eighteen target (potentially hazardous) VOCs were quantified. A wide variety of compounds were detected in both the ambient air and landfill gas. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOC analyses {{were similar to those}} of other workers in both the qualitative and quantitative studies. <b>The</b> concentrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOCs were mostly lower than the TLV (threshold limit values) values, but exceeded the MRLs (minimum recommended levels). <b>The</b> combined concentrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOC’s in the ambient air either approached or exceeded the limit values for combined exposure thus indicating that a potential health hazard exists. One third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOCs were detected in both the ambient air and the subsurface gas, however, external pollution sources also appear to contribute to the VOC concentrations ambient air. Dangerously high methane concentrations were repeatedly detected in the landfill gas amongst the informal houses.
