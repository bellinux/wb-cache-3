Behind All-American Roger Stephens, the Bearcats tallied threetouchdowns to Virginia Tech's one. The Hokies managed to block all three Cincinnati extra point kicks, but without touchdowns of their own, the Hokies {{had no chance}} to win. Cincinnati emerged victorious as time ran out, 18–6.|$|E
5|$|City won {{immediate}} promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 22 {{goals in}} 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play {{and willing to}} feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, {{who was able to}} win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.|$|E

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the First United Front, Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising. Having helped orchestrate the uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang. The uprising failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng. He was soon named head of a new First United Front military institute in Nanchang.|$|E

Many of the clergymen featured in the programme were discovered by accident or by word-of-mouth. For example, the production researcher <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> on request, a vicar who had an extensive model railway in his rectory, another whose ministry was based on water (the Chaplain of the Broads) and a vicar whose congregation at the time numbered zero.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a small number}} of top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, Bojić {{reached the}} Greek island of Corfu, {{where he was}} {{recruited}} to work for Serbian military intelligence. That summer, he was transferred to Thessaloniki, where he continued working for the military. In August, he was granted leave and sailed to France, where he reunited with his fiancée and his brother. Bojić returned to Greece several weeks later, and was diagnosed with tuberculosis in September the following year. Owing to the political connections of his patrons, he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> care at an exclusive military hospital in Thessaloniki, but by late October his condition worsened. He died in early November {{at the age of}} 25. He was initially buried at the Allied military cemetery at Zeitenlik, but in 1922, his siblings had his remains relocated to Belgrade, where they were reburied beside those of his parents.|$|E

5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E

After trekking across 200 miles of jungle for five weeks, during which Judy survived an attack from a crocodile, the crew arrived a day after the final vessel had left and subsequently became prisoners of war of the Japanese. She was eventually smuggled into the Medan camp, where she met Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams for the first time, who she would go on {{to spend the rest of}} her life with. Williams convinced the camp Commandant to register her as an official prisoner of war, with the number '81A Gloergoer Medan'. She was the only dog to be registered as a prisoner of war during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E

5|$|The two armies clashed at Pegae in {{the fifth}} week of the Great Lent, between 11 and 18 March 921. The Byzantine commanders formed their battle lines in the {{lowlands}} near the springs, while the Bulgarians occupied the higher ground. The Bulgarians charged with dreadful battle cry. Their initial blow was irresistible and the Byzantine lines broke. John the Rhaiktor immediately fled and a certain Photinus, son of Platipodos, was killed along with many others while trying to protect him. John the Rhaiktor barely escaped aboard of a dromon. Alexios Mosele, who fled in full armour, drowned with his protomandator while attempting to board a ship. The brothers Pothos and Leo Argyros <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> shelter in a nearby fortress. In the subsequent rout most of the Byzantine soldiers {{were killed by the}} sword, drowned or were captured by the Bulgarians. After the battle the Bulgarians burned the palaces in Pegae and looted the area north of the Golden Horn waterway on the opposite shore of the walls of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{was caused}} by dissatisfaction {{of some of the}} {{soldiers}}, who had taken Vandal wives, with Solomon: the soldiers demanded the property once owned by their wives as their own, but Solomon refused, since this land had been confiscated by imperial decree. A first plot to assassinate Solomon in Easter failed and the conspirators fled into the countryside, but soon open rebellion broke out among the army in Carthage as well. The soldiers acclaimed one of Solomon's subalterns, Theodore, as its leader, and began looting the city. Solomon <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> refuge in a church, and under the cover of night, with the aid of Theodore, he departed the city by boat for Missua, accompanied among others by the historian Procopius. From there, Solomon and Procopius sailed to Sicily, which had just been conquered by Belisarius, while Solomon's lieutenant Martin was dispatched to try and reach the troops at Numidia, and Theodore instructed to hold Carthage. Upon hearing about the mutiny, Belisarius, with Solomon and 100 picked men, set sail for Africa. Carthage was being besieged by 9,000 rebels, including many Vandals, under a certain Stotzas. Theodore was contemplating capitulation when Belisarius appeared. The news of the famous general's arrival were sufficient for the rebels to abandon the siege and withdraw westwards. Belisarius immediately gave pursuit and caught up and defeated the rebel forces at Membresa. The bulk of the rebels, however, was able to flee, and continued to march towards Numidia, where the local troops decided to join them. Belisarius himself was forced to return to Italy due to trouble there, and Emperor Justinian appointed his cousin Germanus as magister militum to deal with the crisis. Solomon returned to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E
