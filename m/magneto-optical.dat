5|$|In 1930, Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} element 87 when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his <b>magneto-optical</b> machine. Allison requested that it be named virginium after {{his home state of}} Virginia, along with the symbols Vi and Vm. In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of his discovery.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{announced}} {{a sequel to}} EarthBound for the Nintendo 64 in 1996: Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America). It was scheduled for release on the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a <b>magneto-optical</b> drive, but struggled to find a firm release date as its protracted development entered development hell. It was later canceled altogether in 2000 when the 64DD flopped.|$|E
5|$|The <b>magneto-optical</b> drive {{manufactured}} by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The <b>magneto-optical</b> media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
5|$|A Faraday filter, <b>magneto-optical</b> filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} {{rotating}} the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB <b>magneto-optical</b> (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the <b>magneto-optical</b> trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E

25|$|In physics, the Faraday effect or Faraday {{rotation}} is a <b>magneto-optical</b> phenomenon—that is, {{an interaction}} between light and a magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of polarization which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field {{in the direction of}} propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{cannot be}} stored in a {{container}} made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and {{an equal amount of}} the container. Antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, in a device called a Penning trap. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which atomic traps are used. In particular, such a trap may use the dipole moment (electric or magnetic) of the trapped particles. At high vacuum, the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a <b>magneto-optical</b> trap or magnetic trap. Small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers, using a highly focused laser beam.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the authors}} of this seminal 1986 paper, former United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, would go on to use optical tweezing in his work on cooling and {{trapping}} neutral atoms. This research earned Chu the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D. Phillips.Interview conducted for internal newsletter at Bell Labs. Contains confirmation of Ashkin as the inventor of optical trapping and provides information on the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics. In an interview, Steven Chu described how Ashkin had first envisioned optical tweezing as a method for trapping atoms. Ashkin was able to trap larger particles (10 to 10,000 nanometers in diameter) but it fell to Chu to extend these techniques to the trapping of neutral atoms (0.1 nanometers in diameter) utilizing resonant laser light and a magnetic gradient trap (cf. <b>Magneto-optical</b> trap).|$|E
500|$|NeXT {{released}} a {{second generation of}} workstations in 1990. The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the NeXTcube, and the NeXTstation, nicknamed [...] "the slab," [...] which used a [...] "pizza box" [...] case form-factor. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff {{did not use the}} latter terminology, lest the NeXT machines be compared to competing Sun workstations. The <b>magneto-optical</b> drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive to offer users a way to use their floppy disks. However, individual 2.88 MB floppies were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the CD-ROM drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and the NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new Motorola 68040 processor.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{incompatible}} {{in every}} way with any other consumer electronics product, the 64DD's magnetic storage technology resembles the generic floppy disk, and the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary Zip disk for personal computers. [...] Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being <b>magneto-optical</b> technology, Nintendo's own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic. [...] Complementing their proprietary and copy-protected cartridge strategy, the proprietary 64MB disk format was Nintendo's faster, more flexible, and copy-protected answer to the commodity Compact Disc format, which is cheaper to produce but is much slower, read-only, and easier to copy on personal computers. The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles can hold at least 650megabytes (MB) of information with a peak 300kB/s throughput and more than 200ms seek speed. This compares to the Nintendo 64's cartridge's 4 to 64MB size and 5 to 50MB/s of low latency and instantaneous load times, and the 64DD's 64MB disk size and 1MB/s peak throughput with 75 ms average seek latency. The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a 2x CD-ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many titles, {{in addition to a}} much higher production cost, testing cycle, and potential development time for all the potential extra content.|$|E

50|$|<b>Magneto-optical</b> {{recording}} writes/reads optically. When writing, {{the magnetic}} medium is heated locally by a laser, which induces a rapid decrease of coercive field.

50|$|A <b>magneto-optical</b> {{drive is}} a kind of optical disc drive capable of writing and {{rewriting}} data upon a <b>magneto-optical</b> disc. Both 130 mm (5.25 in) and 90 mm (3.5 in) form factors exist. The technology was introduced commercially in 1985. Although optical, they appear as hard disk drives to the operating system and can be formatted with any file system. <b>Magneto-optical</b> drives were common in some countries, such as Japan because {{of the success of the}} Sony MiniDisc, but have fallen into disuse.|$|E
