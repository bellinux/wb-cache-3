40|$|Automatic batch centrifugals in {{the sugar}} {{industry}} are intensive in relay logic and interdependent cycle sequences. Programmable controllers are specifically designed for rapidly performing relay logic and sequence operations and simultaneously providing the reliability that has become synonymous with modern solid state electronics. This paper describes the successful marriage of these two situations at Ubombo Ranches, and discusses some of the principles pertaining to programmable controllers in industry. In this age of computerisation most people {{have been exposed to}} automation of varying degrees and such a simple device as a programmable controller (PC) may seem a bit of an anticlimax. However, these devices do {{have a role to play}} in process control and offer a degree of simplicity acceptable to plant personnel. Programmable Controllers The distinction between PCs and Microprocessors and Computers is becoming more and more vague as technology progresses and in a lot of cases the same basic electronic chip is used throughout and only the level of communication varies. All the above devices rely upon a fundamental principle of considering the electrical state of a circuit and deciding whether it is "ON " or "OFF". Thus all are making a number of YESIN 0 decisions, the difference lying in the capacity and speed. Such electronic circuitry lends itself then to an application of logic decision making, and this is exactly what the programmable controller does. Industrial Application There are three fundamental elements to any electrical plant. These are control console, relay panel and <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>centre</b> as shown in Figure 1.

This has the disadvantages of poor reliability, high diesel costs and the unwanted consumption of gas that could otherwise be sold to market.

It is intended to employ condition monitoring technologies to aid in achieving this. A literature review was conducted in order to research current CM technologies applicable to HV plant and equipment.

Develop a Statistical Classification Model to discriminate between 2 subgroups of NS-CLBP (Flexion Pattern [FP] and Active Extension Pattern [AEP]) and a control group using biomechanical variables quantifying parameters of <b>motor</b> <b>control.</b> Summary of Background Data. It {{has been well documented}} that many CLBP patients have <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> impairments of their lumbar spine. O’Sullivan proposed a mechanism-based classification system for NS-CLBP with <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> impairments based on a comprehensive subjective and physical examination to establish the relationship between pain provocation and spinal <b>motor</b> <b>control.</b> For the FP and AEP s, 2 groups defined by O’Sullivan and under investigation is this study, the <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> impairment is considered to be the mechanism maintaining their CLBP. No previous studies have used a Statistical Model with measurements of <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> impairment to subclassify NS-CLBP patients. Methods. Thirty-three NS-CLBP patients (20 FP and 13 AEP) and 34 asymptomatic subjects had synchronized lumbosacral kinematics and trunk muscle activation recorded during commonly reported aggravating postures and movements. Biomechanical variables were quantified and a Statistical Classification Model was developed. Results. The Statistical Model used 5 kinematic and 2 electromyography variables.
