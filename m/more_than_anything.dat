5|$|<b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything,</b> {{they just}} made me laugh. I couldn't believe I'd walked into this situation. You didn't care {{if they were in}} time with the dance steps or whether one was {{overweight}} or one wasn't as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.|$|E
5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else.|$|E
5|$|O'Dell {{set about}} {{contacting}} local musicians from the Harrisons' rented house in Nichols Canyon, as Harrison took the long-distance calls, hoping <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> to secure Bob Dylan's participation. Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix {{resulted in the}} latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good time in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|The week {{prior to}} the scenes airing, it was {{revealed}} that Mercedes' relationship to Joe would run into trouble when her former fling Lockie Campbell (Nick Rhys) tells Joe that they had kissed the previous day. Mercedes then tells Joe he is not the baby's father during an argument and unbeknown to Mercedes, he leaves for Canada. When Mercedes discovers their son has died, she realises she needs Joe <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> and regrets her actions. It was revealed that Mercedes would rely on John Paul, Nana and Theresa to comfort her through the birth of her son, whom she names Gabriel. Mercedes would later be left delighted when her mother, Myra returned to support her through Gabriel's funeral before choosing to stay in Hollyoaks.|$|E

With tools our Australian deserts may be turned into gardens... They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us to soar in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us...|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything,</b> drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|The popular view of Richard has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> been {{influenced}} by Shakespeare's play about the king, Richard II. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power. Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions. Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel, who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham. Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard. The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until Henry VII's accession in 1485. The idea that Richard was {{to blame for the}} later-15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th. Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II.|$|E

5|$|In early 1925, Nurmi {{embarked}} on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January. His debut was {{a copy of his}} feats in Helsinki and Paris. Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances. Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances. He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich. Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards. Although he hated losing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything,</b> Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich. The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.|$|E
