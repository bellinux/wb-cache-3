The paper carefully distinguishes between several saving measures and concepts. It separates discretionary savings from <b>mandatory</b> <b>savings</b> and uses two flow measures: first, the sum of purchases of assets minus the sum of sales of assets and, second, the residual of income minus consumption. Our main finding is a hump-shaped age-saving profile with a high overall saving rate. However, savings remain positive in old age, even for most low-income households. How can we explain what may be termed the "German savings puzzle"?

40|$|There {{appears to}} be a growing {{recognition}} among economists and other social commentators that people attempt to enhance their relative position (which is commonly described as status) through consumption choices and other behaviour. It has been less common to consider whether attempts to enhance relative position impact on saving behaviour. This thesis makes a number of contributions relating to the impact of relative position on saving behaviour. In this thesis I: - consider why concern for relative position may impact on saving behaviour. I demonstrate, with a simple intertemporal model the surprising result that when people are concerned with relative position, income risk can lead to most people saving less and the rich saving more. - conduct an empirical study to test the importance of relative position on saving behaviour. I find a statistically and economically significant relationship between peer income and saving behaviour consistent with theories that people actively forgo saving to seek to enhance their relative position. I use the data to demonstrate that relative position can help to explain why prior research has consistently found that the rich have higher saving rates. - consider the policy implications of relative position to saving behaviour. I examine the policies, primarily corrective taxation, that have been advocated to address externalities of relative position in a static setting. I find that there are significant issues when these policies are considered in an intertemporal setting. I examine the policy of <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> in addressing distortions caused by relative position and the possibility that concern for relative position improves the effectiveness of <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the economics of prefunding benefits for the aged, focusing on Social Security but indicating some of the analogous magnitudes for prefunding Medicare Benefits. We use detailed Census and Social Security information to model the transition to a fully funded system based on mandatory contributions to individual accounts. The funded system we examine would permanently maintain the level of benefits now specified in current law and would require no new government borrowing (other than eventually selling the bonds in the Social Security trust fund). During the transition, the combined rate of payroll tax and <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> rises at first by 2 percentage points (to a total of 14. 4 percent) and then declines so that in less than 20 years it is less than the current 12. 4 percent payroll tax. We estimate the impact of such prefunding on the growth of the capital stock and the level of national income and show that the combination of higher pretax wages and lower payroll taxes could raise wages net of income and payroll taxes by more than 35 % in the long run. We also discuss distributional issues and the way that the poor can be at least as well off as under Social Security. A stochastic simulation shows that a small increase in the <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> rate would reduce the risk of receiving less than the scheduled level to less than one percent. Separate calculations are presented {{of the value of the}} 'forward-looking recognition bonds' and 'backward-looking recognition bonds' which the government might issue if it decides not to pay future social security benefits explicitly. ...|$|R

For this purpose, the paper uses two microeconomic databases for 1988 and 1996 - 1997. The main results of the paper support the conventional explanations of saving rates: more than 60 % of the variation of saving rates explained by the estimated model is related to age (consistently with the Life Cycle Hypothesis) and temporary income (consistently with the Permanent Income Hypothesis). The results also give some support to more recent extensions of the classic theories (for instance, related {{to the impact of}} wealth and human capital on saving decisions). Finally, the evidence points out that the effects of some institutions (like credit markets and <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> for retirement) change with different macroeconomic environments. ...|$|R

We distinguish between economies with rational and with hyperbolic consumers and compare the consequences of mandatory and voluntary retirement plans with and without annuitized benefits. While a full taxation of capital income yields the highest efficiency gains in the rational consumer model, annuitization and hyperbolic discounting substantially improve the economic efficiency of IRAs. We also show that annuitization alters the intergenerational welfare consequences of the reform substantially, since it reduces accidental bequests. Finally, even if <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> programs have a clear cost advantage, they are only recommendable if consumers are myopic. individual retirement accounts, annuities, stochastic general equilibrium, hyperbolic consumer...|$|R

I find that the optimal savings plan when temptation is myopic consists of a mandatory minimum level of savings, while the optimal plan for farsighted temptation can have several fully restrictive <b>mandatory</b> <b>savings</b> levels, with only the highest being a mandatory minimum. When temptation is myopic money burning will never be part of an optimal separating contract, though it can be when temptation is farsighted. Also, when temptation is myopic an individual will strictly prefer mandatory deposits to liquidity constraints. Finally, I find that the optimal borrowing plan when self-control is costly consists of regular payments and self imposed debt limit. ...|$|E
30|$|One {{principle}} {{could be}} to set a contribution rate that equates liabilities and savings. This is the contribution rate that essentially equates, on average, current expenditures with current revenues (see previous section). Having a higher contribution (or savings rate) would generate too much <b>mandatory</b> <b>savings</b> (that {{in the case of}} a pure risk-pooling system are taxed at 100 percent). Having a lower contribution rate, on the other hand, would imply that general revenues (i.e., other things being equal higher taxes) are needed to subsidize negative accounts, even if taxes on savings are set at 100 percent. The recommendation therefore would be to truly treat the contribution rate as a savings rate, set it at the point where a 100 percent tax on savings suffices to balance the system, and then address the policy question of replacing part of this tax by other taxes.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{estimate}} the crowding-out effect of the Danish mandatory labour market pension reforms begun in 1993 {{on the level of}} total household savings for renters. The effect is identified via a large panel of individual administrative records utilising the differences in speed, timing and sectoral coverage of the implementation of the reform in the period 1997 to 2005. Little substitutability was found between current mandatory labour market pension savings and private voluntary savings. Each euro paid into mandatory labour market pension accounts results in a reduction in private savings of approximately 0 to 30 cents, depending on age. This low rate of substitution is only, to a minor extent, explained by liquidity constraints. The results point to mandatory pension savings having a large effect on total household savings. Thus, pension reforms that introduce <b>mandatory</b> <b>savings</b> have macroeconomic implications. JEL classification: D 01, D 91, H 3...|$|E

I estimate the determinants of household saving rates in a cross-country panel, augmenting standard measures of social security programme generosity and cost by indicators that proxy the actuarial component of the programme. These indicators affect saving rates as predicted; moreover they also affect labour force participation rates of older women (but not men). The findings are consistent with the view that more actuarially-based public programmes are treated by participants as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>saving</b> programme rather than as a tax-and-transfer system, thereby raising labour force participation rates but also increasing the programme's substitutability for private retirement saving...|$|R
