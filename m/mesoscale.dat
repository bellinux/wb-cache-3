5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a <b>mesoscale</b> {{low-pressure}} {{area which}} trails the <b>mesoscale</b> high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of <b>mesoscale</b> weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|The {{time period}} in the Plains where {{thunderstorm}} areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September. <b>Mesoscale</b> convective systems develop over the region during this time frame, with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time. <b>Mesoscale</b> convective systems bring 30 to 70 percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the Plains. A subset of these systems known as <b>mesoscale</b> convective complexes lead to up to 10% of the annual rainfall across the Plains and Midwest. Squall lines account for 30% of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the region.|$|E
5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of <b>mesoscale</b> weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of <b>mesoscale</b> networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{energy spectrum}} {{as a function}} of horizontal wavenumber over the range from a few kilometers to the synoptic scales was obtained by Nastrom et al. (1984) and Nastrom and Gage (1985). They found that the spectra follow the − 3 power law in the range 1000 to 3000 km and the − 5 / 3 power law in the horizontal scales less than a few hundred km (about 400 – 500 km). While the − 3 power law is interpreted as the property of quasi-geostrophic turbulence (Charney, 1971), the formation mechanism of the − 5 / 3 spectral slope in the atmospheric <b>mesoscales</b> is still uncertain. Lilly (1983) suggested that inverse energy cascade could occur in stratified turbulence. However, Métais et al.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that large-scale (O(100 km)) initial errors in a numerical weather forecast may exert more control on the propagation of errors than small-scale errors potentially as small as butterflies. The intrinsic predictability of the atmosphere at the <b>mesoscales</b> (5 – 400 km) is studied using idealized simulations of organized deep convection under several different profiles of environmental vertical wind shear. Initial errors of equal amplitude are introduced in the moisture field either at small scales (8 km) or large scales (128 km). It is found that small- and large-scale initial errors have virtually identical impacts on predictability at lead times of 4 – 5 h for all wind shear profiles. Reducing the amplitude of the initial errors produces diminishing returns in predictability lead time and reveals no difference be- tween small- and large-scale initial errors. Additionally, the idealized simulations all produce a k^− 5 / 3 spectrum of kinetic energy, in agreement with observations of the atmosphere at the <b>mesoscales.</b> The simulations provide evidence {{of the importance of}} the unbalanced, divergent gravity-wave component of the flow produced by thunderstorms in generating the observed kinetic energy spectrum...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigh {{resolution}} {{simulations of}} ocean turbulence with Rossby number of order one {{have revealed that}} upper layer dynamics significantly differs from the interior dynamics. As reported before, upper layer dynamics is characterized with shallow velocity spectrum corresponding to kinetic energy distributed over a spectral range from <b>mesoscales</b> to small scales. This dynamics is driven by small-scale frontogenesis related to surface density anomalies. Interior dynamics is characterized by steeper velocity spectrum and {{is driven by the}} potential vorticity anomalies set up by the interior baroclinic instability. Impact of the divergent motions related to surface frontogenesis leads to a warming of the upper layers, a cyclone dominance and a negative skewness of the isopycnal displacements. On the contrary, divergent motions in the interior lead to a cooling of the deeper layers, an anticylone dominance and a positive skewness of the isopycnal displacements. These different ageostrophic processes are consistent with an SQG regime extended to Rossby number of order one on one hand and an interior QG regime extended to Rossby number of order one on the other hand, as proposed by previous studies. Synthesis of these characteristics suggest a connection between upper and deeper layers, induced by the divergent motions, through which small scales near the surface interact with <b>mesoscales</b> in the interior...|$|R

40|$|The {{turbulence}} of superfluid helium is investigated numerically at finite temperature. Direct numerical simulations {{are performed}} with a "truncated HVBK" model, which combines the continuous {{description of the}} Hall-Vinen-Bekeravich-Khalatnikov equations with the additional constraint that this continuous description cannot extend beyond a quantum length scale associated with the mean spacing between individual superfluid vortices. A good agreement is found with experimental measurements of the vortex density. Besides, by varying the turbulence intensity only, {{it is observed that}} the inter-vortex spacing varies with the Reynolds number as $Re^{- 3 / 4 }$, like the viscous length scale in classical turbulence. In the high temperature limit, Kolmogorov's inertial cascade is recovered, as expected from previous numerical and experimental studies. As the temperature decreases, the inertial cascade remains present at large scales while, at small scales, the system evolves towards a statistical equipartition of kinetic energy among spectral modes, with a characteristic $k^ 2 $ velocity spectrum. The accumulation of superfluid excitations on a range of <b>mesoscales</b> enables the superfluid to keep dissipating kinetic energy through mutual friction with the residual normal fluid, although the later becomes rare at low temperature. It is found that most of the superfluid vorticity can concentrate on these <b>mesoscales</b> at low temperature, while it is concentrated in the inertial range at higher temperature. This observation should have consequences on the interpretation of decaying turbulence experiments, which are often based on vortex line density measurements. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
