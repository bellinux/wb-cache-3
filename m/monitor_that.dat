25|$|A {{method of}} {{external}} (noninvasive) fetal monitoring (EFM) during childbirth is cardiotocography, using a cardiotocograph {{that consists of}} two sensors: The heart (cardio) sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, similar to a Doppler fetal <b>monitor,</b> <b>that</b> continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive contraction transducer, called a tocodynamometer (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten {{a section of the}} wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction.|$|E
25|$|The Minimed Paradigm series' RF link also {{supports}} a continuous blood glucose sensor {{known as the}} Paradigm REAL-Time Continuous Glucose <b>Monitor</b> <b>that</b> wirelessly provides an interstitial glucose value every 5 minutes on the pump screen. The Medtronic REAL-Time System {{was the first to}} link a continuous monitor with an insulin pump system. In the Minimed 530G with Enlite (in the US) or Paradigm Veo (in other countries), the pump can enter a low glucose suspend mode stopping all insulin delivery (bolus and basal insulin) if interstitial glucose values fall below the hypoglycemia threshold. In the Minimed 640G insulin pump series, low glucose suspend mode can also be entered based on predicted hypoglycemia.|$|E

25|$|IBM-PC Emulation on the 8086-based Wang PC {{was working}} fairly {{reliably}} when IBM released their 80286-based PC-AT. Wang's answer was the 80286-based Wang APC (Advanced Professional Computer) {{which not only}} perpetuated the PC incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful PC emulation strategy: the 8086 decoded and executed instructions on-the-fly and was therefore {{able to respond to}} NMI on every instruction boundary, but the 80286 decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each CPU-mask stepping but which always prevented timely NMI execution. Wang's engineers came up with (and later patented) a rather devious instruction-prefetch <b>monitor</b> <b>that</b> managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty.|$|E
25|$|T-72B3 (Ob'yekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tank's firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a passive device with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a <b>monitor</b> <b>that</b> displays thermal imagery from the gunner's main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and command guidance module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and 2,200 m respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium penetrator) and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740–800mm and 660–740mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E

[...] Although most of the violations were not combat missions, NATO had decided even {{before the end of}} Sky <b>Monitor</b> <b>that</b> the UN ban was ineffective.

500|$|An Israeli attorney's 1987 {{comment to}} the Christian Science <b>Monitor,</b> <b>that</b> his country had never [...] "tried {{to root out}} the PLO in the Arab street" [...] was the first modern use in its present sense without the scare quotes. By {{the end of the}} decade it came into wide use in both American {{academic}} and popular media, as coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada dominated news from the region. This may have been the result of geopolitical shifts taking place at the same time. New York Times language columnist William Safire anonymously quoted a Middle East expert who told him that before the late 1980s the term [...] "Arab masses" [...] had been used instead. [...] "With the eclipse of the Soviet Union, that phrase disappeared because [...] had too much of a Marxist–Soviet–Communist tilt to it." [...] In his 1992 paper on the Arab street as a political phenomenon, David Pollock uses [...] "Arab masses" [...] only once, and in quotes.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the ages}} of three and seven, Copeland lived in Bellflower, California, {{with her mother and}} her mother's third husband, Harold Brown, a Santa Fe Railroad sales executive. The family moved to San Pedro, where Sylvia {{eventually}} married her fourth husband, radiologist Robert DelaCerna, and where Misty attended Point Fermin Elementary School. [...] When she was seven, Copeland saw the film Nadia on television and its subject Nadia Comăneci became her new role model. Copeland never studied ballet or gymnastics formally until her teenage years, but she enjoyed choreographing flips and dance moves to Mariah Carey songs in her youth. Following in the footsteps of her older sister Erica, who had starred on the Dana Middle School drill team that won statewide competitions, Copeland became captain of the Dana drill team. Her captaincy was only a part of her responsibilities; she was also the sixth grade class treasurer and a hall <b>monitor</b> <b>that</b> year.
