25|$|In 2004 {{researchers}} at the University of Oxford demonstrated two new types of zero-power bistable LCDs based on Zenithal bistable techniques. Several bistable technologies, like the 360° BTN and the bistable cholesteric, depend mainly on the bulk properties of the liquid crystal (LC) and use standard strong anchoring, with alignment films and LC mixtures similar to the traditional <b>monostable</b> materials. Other bistable technologies, e.g. BiNem technology, are based mainly on the surface properties and need specific weak anchoring materials.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monostable</b> {{multivibrator}} - is {{a circuit}} with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse {{is applied to}} the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it {{for a period of time}} dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the <b>monostable</b> can be used as a timer or delay element.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Monostable</b> mode - in this mode, the 555 {{functions}} as a [...] "one-shot" [...] pulse generator. Applications include timers, missing pulse detection, bounce-free switches, touch switches, frequency divider, capacitance measurement, pulse-width modulation (PWM) and so on.|$|E
50|$|A <b>monostable</b> {{multivibrator}} is {{an electronic}} circuit that generates an output pulse. When triggered, a pulse of pre-defined duration is produced. The circuit then returns to its quiescent state and produces no more output until triggered again.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>monostable</b> mode, {{the output}} pulse ends when the voltage on the {{capacitor}} equals [...] {{of the supply}} voltage. The output pulse width can be lengthened or shortened to the need of the specific application by adjusting the values of R and C.|$|E

50|$|Shift {{registers}} {{can also}} be used as pulse extenders. Compared to <b>monostable</b> multivibrators, the timing has no dependency on component values, however, it requires external clock and the timing accuracy is limited by a granularity of this clock. Example: Ronja Twister, where five 74164 shift registers create the core of the timing logic this way (schematic).|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} SSI slave interface uses a retriggerable <b>monostable</b> multivibrator (monoflop) {{to freeze}} the current value of the sensor. The current frozen values of the slave are stored in Shift registers. These values are clocked out sequentially when initiated by the controller. The design is being revolutionized with the integration of microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICs into the interface.|$|E
50|$|To provide longer {{lighting}} {{times when}} required the button may be pressed repeatedly. For this reason any timer {{should be a}} retriggerable <b>monostable,</b> i.e. the off delay lasts {{from the time of}} the last button press. There may also be a switch, sometimes a key switch, that can turn the lights on indefinitely for tasks such as cleaning.|$|E
5000|$|While {{using the}} timer IC in <b>monostable</b> mode, the main {{disadvantage}} {{is that the}} time span between any two triggering pulses must be greater than the RC time constant. [...] Conversely, ignoring closely spaced pulses is done by setting the RC time constant to be larger than the span between spurious triggers. (Example: ignoring switch contact bouncing.) ...|$|E
50|$|In the <b>monostable</b> multivibrator, one resistive-capacitive network (C2-R3 in Figure 1) is {{replaced}} by a resistive network (just a resistor). The circuit can be thought as a 1/2 astable multivibrator. Q2 collector voltage is the output of the circuit (in contrast to the astable circuit, it has a perfect square waveform since the output is not loaded by the capacitor).|$|E
50|$|While not {{fundamental}} to circuit operation, diodes connected {{in series with}} the base or emitter of the transistors are required to prevent the base-emitter junction being driven into reverse breakdown when the supply voltage is {{in excess of the}} Veb breakdown voltage, typically around 5-10 volts for general purpose silicon transistors. In the <b>monostable</b> configuration, only one of the transistors requires protection.|$|E
50|$|Containing 163 {{vacuum tubes}} and over 1,000 custom capacitors, the Novachord weighed nearly 500 pounds and was {{roughly the size}} of two spinet pianos. The divide-down {{oscillator}} architecture, based on vacuum-tube <b>monostable</b> circuits, permitted all 72 notes to be played polyphonically by deriving several octaves of notes from twelve top-octave oscillators. A similar design was adopted in polysynthesizers released more than 30 years later by Robert Moog and A.R.P.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monostable</b> multivibrator, {{in which}} one of the states is stable, but the other state is {{unstable}} (transient). A trigger pulse causes the circuit to enter the unstable state. After entering the unstable state, the circuit will return to the stable state after a set time. Such a circuit is useful for creating a timing period of fixed duration in response to some external event. This circuit is also known as a one shot.|$|E
50|$|Stable region (green) (illustrated by line L1): When {{the load}} line lies in this region, it intersects the I-V curve {{at one point}} Q1. For nonreactive {{circuits}} it is a stable equilibrium (poles in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance amplifiers operate in this region. However, due to hysteresis, with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear relaxation oscillator (astable multivibrator) or a <b>monostable</b> multivibrator.|$|E
50|$|A {{watchdog}} timer is an electronic timer that detects abnormal operation of other components and initiates corrective action to restore normal operation. It especially ensures that microcontroller controlled devices do not completely fail if a software error or momentary hardware error occurs. Watchdog timers are typically based on either a <b>monostable</b> timer or digital counter. The timer circuit may be integrated on the microcontroller chip or be implemented as an external circuit. Watchdog timers can significantly improve {{the reliability of}} a microcontroller in an electromagnetically-influenced environment.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{balloons}} often blew {{out of the}} radar's nominal 32,000 yard range, these versions were equipped with a Range Extender device. This was a <b>monostable</b> multivibrator, known as a One-Shot or Kipp Relay, that triggered the coarse time base, offsetting its starting point so it did not trigger immediately after the transmission, but a selected time after that. The Extender had settings for 30,000 or 60,000 yards, so the system could track {{the balloons}} in three general windows, 0 to 32,000 yards, 30,000 to 62,000, and 60,000 to 92,000.|$|E
50|$|YIG {{multipliers}} often want {{to select}} an arbitrary harmonic, so {{they use a}} stateful distortion circuit that converts the input sine wave into an approximate impulse train. The ideal (but impractical) impulse train generates {{an infinite number of}} (weak) harmonics. In practice, an impulse train generated by a <b>monostable</b> circuit will have many usable harmonics. YIG multipliers using step recovery diodes may, for example, take an input frequency of 1 to 2 GHz and produce outputs up to 18 GHz. Sometimes the frequency multiplier circuit will adjust the width of the impulses to improve conversion efficiency for a specific harmonic.|$|E
5000|$|To send a [...] "1", the {{bus master}} sends {{a very brief}} (1-15 µs) low pulse. To send a [...] "0", the master sends a 60 µs low pulse. The falling (negative) edge of the pulse is used to start a <b>monostable</b> {{multivibrator}} in the slave device. The multivibrator in the slave clocks to read the data line about 30 µs after the falling edge. The slave's multivibrator unavoidably has analog tolerances that affect its timing accuracy, {{which is why the}} [...] "0" [...] pulses have to be 60 µs long, and the [...] "1" [...] pulses can't be longer than 15 µs.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the proper}} circumstances, {{positive}} and negative feedback loops can provide the conditions for bistability; for example, by having positive feedback coupled to an ultrasensitive response element with the circuit. A hysteretic bistable system {{can act as a}} robust reversible switch because it is harder for the system to transition between ‘on’ and ‘off’ states (compared to the equivalent <b>monostable</b> ultransensitive response). The system could also be poised such that one of the transitions is physically unattainable; for example, no amount of reduction in the stimulus will return the system to the ‘off’-state once it is already in the ‘on’ state. This would form a robust irreversible switch.|$|E
5000|$|In {{biological}} systems, temporal {{feedback is}} a ubiquitous signal transduction motif that allows systems to convert graded inputs into decisive, all-or-none digital outputs. A system with interlinked fast and slow feedback loops produces a dual-time switch, which is rapidly inducible and robust to noise during stimulus. In contrast, a single fast or slow loop is separately {{responsible for the}} speed of switching and the stability of switches. Computer simulation {{studies have shown that}} linking two loops of the same kind brings no overall advantage over having a single loop, however the dual-loop switch performs in a <b>monostable</b> regime. Both single and dual loops can behave as a bistable switch. [...] Several computational models have been produced to demonstrate the responses of single and dual positive feedback loop switches to stimuli.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 Pomerening et al. {{provided}} {{strong evidence}} for this hypothesis by demonstrating hysteresis and bistability in the activation of Cdk1 in the cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus oocytes. They first demonstrated a discontinuous sharp response of Cdk1 to changing concentrations of non-destructible Cyclin B (to decouple the Cdk1 response network from APC-mediated negative feedback). However, such a response {{would be consistent with}} both a <b>monostable,</b> ultrasensitive transition and a bistable transition. To distinguish between these two possibilities, they measured the steady-state levels of active Cdk1 in response to changing cyclin levels, but in two separate experiments, one starting with an interphase extract and one starting with an extract already in mitosis. At intermediate concentrations of cyclin they found two steady-state concentrations of active Cdk1. Which of the two steady states was occupied depended {{on the history of the}} system, i.e.whether they started with interphase or mitotic extract, effectively demonstrating hysteresis and bistability.|$|E
