Non-opioids like clonidine may also be added to prolong the duration of analgesia (although Clonidine may cause hypotension).

50|$|Excitation of the {{membrane}} is via a loudspeaker (Ø = 45 cm.) and an 11 cm-long wave guide (designed to convey maximum acoustic pressure between {{the center and}} 1/3 of the radius); that is, fairly short {{as far as the}} form factor is concerned. It proved fairly easy to obtain, in addition to the 30 Hz basic frequency, the 68.9 Hz frequency corresponding to the mode (0,2). It was on the contrary impossible to obtain the frequency of 47.8 Hz corresponding to the mode (1,1). At these frequencies, the behavior of the air excited by the loudspeaker can presumably be schematized with a piston motion, which exercises an almost uniform pressure on {{the membrane}}. A uniform excitation is poorly compatible with the <b>modal</b> <b>form</b> (1,1).The loudspeaker was driven by an electric power signal, generated by a feed-back system that sampled the signal issued by a piezoceramic sensor placed on the rim and detecting deflection of the membrane. In this way a “multimodal” oscillator was obtained generating a feed-back on a resonant element, the membrane. The loop gain was controllable by a pedal.|$|E

40|$|In {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} {{and numerous other}} applications, it is desirable to carefully select sensor locations, thereby minimizing the number of sensors and the cost associated with an on-board monitoring system. The best sensor locations in the present context are those with a high sensitivity to the damage of interest, robustness {{in the presence of}} changes in the excitation frequency and structural natural frequencies, and potentially other metrics as well. Sensor locations are commonly optimized using iterative genetic algorithms, a process which becomes lengthy. In this dissertation, a new method of sensor selection is introduced, using sensitivity functions that are calculated using frequency response function data from the healthy structure to maximize the changes in those frequency response functions due to damage. A modal description of the embedded sensitivity functions is developed, and the functions are applied to a lumped parameter system to investigate the additional insight gained from the use of this <b>modal</b> <b>form</b> of the sensitivity functions. The embedded sensitivity function is then applied to two finite element models (a rod with translational motion and a finite element beam with translational and rotational motion) and a test specimen (an aluminum I-beam with translational, rotational, and torsional motion). Embedded sensitivity functions are shown to be effective at identifying locations for sensors on structural beams that maximize the changes in measured frequency response functions within a range of forcing frequencies. Limitations of embedded sensitivity analysis are presented and discussed. Modal parameters of an aluminum I-beam are estimated, and are used to further investigate the <b>modal</b> <b>form</b> of the sensitivity function. From the <b>modal</b> <b>form,</b> modes of vibration most affected by damage in a specified location are identified. It is found that the sensitivity function combines modal vectors in a way that includes effects which are not visually evident. ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout this apogee of avant-garde work, Takemitsu's musical style {{seems to}} have {{undergone}} a series of stylistic changes. Comparison of Green (for orchestra, 1967) and A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977) quickly reveals the seeds of this change. The latter was composed according to a pre-compositional scheme, in which pentatonic modes were superimposed over one central pentatonic scale (the so-called [...] "black-key pentatonic") around a central sustained central pitch (F-sharp), and an approach that is highly indicative {{of the sort of}} [...] "pantonal" [...] and modal pitch material seen gradually emerging in his works throughout the 1970s. The former, Green (or November Steps II) written 10 years earlier, is heavily influenced by Debussy, and is, in spite of its very dissonant language (including momentary quarter-tone clusters), largely constructed through a complex web of <b>modal</b> <b>forms.</b> These <b>modal</b> <b>forms</b> are largely audible, particularly in the momentary repose {{toward the end of the}} work. Thus in these works, it is possible to see both a continuity of approach, and the emergence of a simpler harmonic language that was to characterise the work of his later period.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of an engage, study, {{activate}} (ESA) lesson of teaching modals of present deduction. The lesson has been taken from a published English language teaching course book and {{is typical of the}} way <b>modal</b> <b>forms</b> are presented to teach epistemic modality in many commercially produced English language teaching course books. I argue that for cognitive, social, linguistic and procedural reasons the linguistic forms and structures presented in the lesson are not straightforwardly transferred to the activate stage of the lesson. Using insights from spoken language corpora I carry out a comparative analysis with the <b>modal</b> <b>forms</b> presented in the course book. I then explore the notion of ‘context’ and drawing on systemic functional grammar discuss how <b>modal</b> <b>forms</b> function in discourse to realise interpersonal relations. Moving my research to the English language classroom I collect ethnographic classroom data and using social semiotic multimodality as an analytical framework I explore learner interaction to uncover the communicative resources learners use to express epistemic modality in a discussion activity from the same lesson. My analysis reveals that the modal structures in the course book differ to some extent from spoken language corpora. It shows that the course book offers no instruction on the interpersonal dimension of modality and thus how speakers use signals of modality to position themselves interpersonally vis-à-vis their interlocutors. The data collected from the English language class reveals that during the lesson learners communicate modality through modes of communication such as eye gaze, gesture and posture in addition to spoken language. Again drawing from systemic functional grammar I explain how these modes have the potential to express interpersonal meaning and thus highlight that meaning is communicated through modal ensembles. Based on these findings I propose a number of teaching strategies to raise awareness of the interpersonal function of modality in multimodal discourse, and for the use of language corpora to better inform teaching materials on selections of modality...|$|R
