5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> significantly larger.

50|$|In mathematics, a <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} quantitative measure, {{used in both}} mechanics and statistics, of {{the shape of a}} set of points. If the points represent mass, then the zeroth <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the total mass, the first moment divided by the total mass is the center of mass, and the second <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the rotational inertia. If the points represent probability density, then the zeroth <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the total probability (i.e. one), the first <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the mean, the second central <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the variance, the third central <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> the skewness, and the fourth central moment (with normalization and shift) is the kurtosis. The mathematical concept is closely related to the concept of moment in physics.|$|R

5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E
