The enabling mechanisms are a novel formulation to consider all possible interference patterns or any pre-defined subset of patterns, and efficient sparsity-pursuit algorithms to find the solution. A notable feature of this formulation is that the patterns remain fixed during the resource optimization process. This creates a favorable opportunity for convex formulations while still considering interference coupling. More importantly, {{in view of the fact}} that multi-cell resource allocation is very computational demanding, our framework provides a systematic way to trade off performance for the reduction of computational complexity by restricting the candidate patterns to a small number of feature patterns. Relying on the sparsity-pursuit capability of the proposed algorithms, we develop a practical guideline to identify the feature patterns. Numerical results show that the identified feature patterns can significantly improve the existing strategies, and jointly optimizing the user association and resource allocation indeed brings considerable gain.

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} <b>multi-user</b> <b>resource</b> management in multi-hop cognitive radio networks for delay-sensitive applications. Since the tolerable delay does not allow propagating global information back and forth throughout the multi-hop network to a centralized decision maker, the source nodes and relays need to adapt their actions (transmission frequency channel and route selections) in a distributed manner, based on local network information. We propose a distributed resource management algorithm that allows network nodes to exchange information and that explicitly considers the delays and cost of exchanging the network information over the multi-hop cognitive radio networks. The term “cognitive ” refers in our paper to both the capability of the network nodes to achieve large spectral efficiencies by dynamically exploiting available frequency channels {{as well as their}} ability to learn the “environment ” (the actions of interfering nodes) based on the designed information exchange. Note that the node competition is due to the mutual interference of neighboring nodes using the same frequency channel. Based on this, we adopt a multi-agent learning approach, adaptive fictitious play, which uses the available interference information. We also discuss the tradeoff between the cost of the required information exchange and the learning efficiency. The results show that our distributed resource management approach improves the PSNR of multiple video streams by more than 3 dB as opposed to the state-of-the-art dynamic frequency channel/route selection approaches without learning capability, when the network resources are limited.

Given scalar signals submitted by all users, such a mechanism decides the fraction of the resource that each user will receive and a payment that will be collected from her.

Starting with the seminal work of Johari and Tsitsiklis [Operations Research, 2004], {{a long list of}} papers studied the price of anarchy (in terms of the social welfare [...] - the total users' value) of resource allocation mechanisms for a variety of allocation and payment rules. Here, we further assume that each user has a budget constraint that invalidates strategies that yield a payment that is higher than the user's budget. This subtle assumption (which is arguably more realistic) constitutes the traditional price of anarchy analysis meaningless as the set of equilibria may change drastically and their social welfare can be arbitrarily far from optimal. Instead, we study the price of anarchy using the liquid welfare benchmark that measures efficiency taking budget constraints into account. We show a tight bound of 2 on the liquid price of anarchy of the well-known Kelly mechanism and prove that this result is essentially best possible among all <b>multi-user</b> <b>resource</b> allocation mechanisms.

The scheduler reduces to the traditional gradient scheduling algorithm when the rate variance term in the new utility function is omitted.

This dissertation presents a distributed system design framework and algorithms to achieve power- and-spectrum-efficient wireless communications in ad hoc networks. In the first part, we propose a cross-layer distributed power control and scheduling protocol for delay-constrained applications over mobile CDMA-based ad hoc wireless networks, where power control is employed to combat both the delay occurring on multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks and multiuser interference among mobile users. We also investigate the impact of Doppler spread upon the system performance, and provide a robust system which employs a combination of power control, and coding/ interleaving to combat the effects of Doppler spread by exploiting the time diversity when the Doppler spread gets large. In the second part, a cognitive radio based multi- user resource allocation framework for mobile ad hoc networks is proposed. In particular, given pre-existing communications in the spectrum where the system is operating, a channel sensing and estimation mechanism is provided to obtain information such as subcarrier availability, noise power and channel gain. Given this information, both frequency spectrum and power are allocated to emerging new users (i. e., cognitive radio users), based on a distributed <b>multi-user</b> <b>resource</b> allocation framework, in order to achieve spectrum- efficient and power-efficient communications. In the third part, we investigate the issue of cooperative MIMO communications in ad hoc networks, and the issue of cooperative node selection is described, where a source node is surrounded by multiple neighbors and all of them are equipped with a single antenna. Given energy, delay and data rate constraints, a source node dynamically chooses its cooperating nodes from its neighbors to form a virtual MIMO system with the destination node (which is assumed to have multiple antennas), and adaptively allocates the power level and adjusts the constellation size for each of the selected cooperative node...|$|E

Note that the optimal multi-user waterfilling solution tends to exploit multi-user diversity and schedule {{at any time and}} any subcarrier of the user with the highest sub-carrier power gain-to-noise ratio to transmit to the BS. Consequently, from the system point of view, only the relatively strong sub-carriers, possibly from different users, are selected and the relative weak ones are avoided. In other words, each user is only assigned a set of relative strong sub-carriers. It will be a good choice if the above sub-carrier allocation scheme is applied for each user in SC-FDMA systems, because it is essentially equivalent to performing EGP among the relative strong sub-carriers for each user. As the number of users increases, the weak sub-carriers can be more effectively avoided due to the multi-user diversity. As a result, the effective channel for each user becomes less frequency selective, and the rate loss in SC-FDMA compared to OFDMA becomes smaller. The same effect happens if the BS is equipped with multiple antennas to exploit the spatial diversity to harden the channels. For SC-FDMA with the localized mapping constraint or the equidistantly distributed mapping constraint, multi-user diversity may help to reduce the rate loss with respect to an OFDMA system but with less degrees of freedom because multi-user diversity cannot guarantee that good sub-carriers assigned to each user are adjacent to each other or equidistantly distributed in the entire bandwidth. In this case, spatial diversity is much more important because it can always reduce frequency selectivity of each user's channel by using, for example, a maximum ratio combiner (MRC) at the receiver. As a result, the user specific resource allocation has less influence on the achievable rate no matter which sub-carriers are selected by the users but only the number of sub-carriers assigned to each user is needed to be considered. Consequently, not only is the rate loss mitigated but also the <b>multi-user</b> <b>resource</b> scheduler is greatly simplified. As an additional advantage, SC-FDMA can offer lower PAPR than OFDMA with negligible rate loss.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) {{technology is}} a very popular broadband access technology. It uses the existing telephone infrastructure to provide broadband access. In order {{to cope with the}} increased bandwidth demand to support broadband services, such as, Video on Demand (VoD), real time multimedia streaming, it is important to further improve the DSL. The main performance degradation of the DSL system is caused by channel impairments, such as, crosstalk and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Furthermore, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based discrete multitone (DMT) system has very poor spectral properties, which prohibit the use of tones at the band edges {{in order to meet the}} power spectral density (PSD) constraints of the system, thus reducing the achievable bit rate. In order to mitigate the channel impairments as well as to combat the poor spectral properties of the DFT based DMT, sophisticated signal processing techniques are employed both in single-user DSL and multi-user DSL scenarios. These signal processing techniques increase the overall run-time complexity of the DSL system, which makes them hard to realize in practice. However, the DSL channel is a very slowly time-varying channel, which allows for offline optimization of the signal processing techniques such that their run-time complexity is reduced. This necessitates efficient algorithms to reduce the overall run-time complexity without affecting the system performance significantly. In this dissertation, various resource allocation algorithms are investigated in order to reduce the run-time complexity of the signal processing techniques without sacrificing the performance of the system. In the first part, resource allocation algorithms for the single-user DSL scenario are investigated. In particular, the per-tone pulse shaping filter based DMT transmitter and per-tone equalization (PTEQ) based DMT receiver will be considered. Owing to various properties of the DSL channel, the use of a constant number of non-zero filter taps in both the pulse shaping filter and the PTEQ is seen to unnecessarily increase the run-time complexity and hence an allocation procedure for the non-zero filter taps is called for. It can be seen that the filter tap allocation problem is a combinatorial problem. In this dissertation, we propose two approaches to reduce this combinatorial complexity: The first approach is based on a contiguous filter tap selection and the second approach is based on sparse approximation based filter design. It is shown that with both of these methods the number of required non-zero filter taps and hence the run-time complexity is reduced significantly. Furthermore, it is shown that the filter tap allocation performs even better when employed in combination with transmit power allocation. In the second part, resource allocation algorithms for the multi-user DSL scenario are investigated, where crosstalk cancellation is a crucial component. In the presence of only additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), it has been shown that instead of performing a full so called linear zero-forcing (ZF) crosstalk cancellation only few major crosstalkers may be canceled without significant performance loss. Therefore, an optimum canceler allocation algorithm, known as partial crosstalk cancellation, only cancels the major crosstalkers per line and per tone, resulting in a significant reduction in run-time complexity. In this dissertation, we extend this partial crosstalk cancellation concept to the scenario where spatially correlated background noise is present. It is shown that in this scenario, minimum mean square error (MMSE) based cancelers outperform linear ZF cancelers. However, the optimal canceler allocation problem then has a prohibitively high complexity. In this dissertation, we propose two approaches to reduce the complexity: the first approach is based on a selection metric, which combines the information of in-domain crosstalk with information of spatially correlated background noise. Based on this selection metric the crosstalkers are ordered and selected for inclusion in the linear MMSE cancellation. This approach is then extended to include non-linear MMSE cancelers. The second approach, based on sparse approximation, directly chooses the cancelers to be taken into account by first designing a sparse linear MMSE canceler. Both of these approaches reduce the run-time complexity while performing near optimally under the resource constraint. Furthermore, it is shown that the spectrum balancing, i. e., transmit power optimization, combined with partial crosstalk cancellation further reduces the number of canceler taps required without sacrificing performance. 1 Introduction 1 1. 1 Broadband communication............... 1 1. 1. 1 Wireline broadband technologies.......... 2 1. 1. 2 Wireless broadband technologies [...] ......... 4 1. 2 Digital subscriber line (DSL)............ 6 1. 3 DSL environment................... 8 1. 4 Problem statement.................. 11 1. 5 Thesis objective and approach............ 12 1. 6 Thesis overview and contributions.......... 13 2 Preliminaries 17 2. 1 Introduction.....

40|$|Nowadays, FPGAs are {{integrated}} in high-performance computing systems, servers, or even used as accelerators in System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms. Since the execution is performed in hardware, FPGA gives much higher performance and lower energy consumption compared to most microprocessor-based systems. However, {{the room to}} improve FPGA performance still exists, e. g. when it is used by multiple users. In <b>multi-user</b> approaches, FPGA <b>resources</b> are shared between several users. Therefore, one {{must be able to}} interrupt a running circuit at any given time and continue the task at will. An image {{of the state of the}} running circuit (context) is saved during interruption and restored when the execution is continued. The ability to extract and restore the context is known as context-switch. In the previous work [1], an automatic checkpoint selection method is proposed for circuit generation targeting reconfigurable systems. The method relies on static analysis of the finite state machine of a circuit to select the checkpoint states. States with minimum overhead will be selected as checkpoints, which allow optimal context save and restore. The maximum time to reach a checkpoint will be defined by the user and consideredas the context-switch latency. The method is implemented in C code and integrated as plugin in a free and open-source High-Level Synthesis tool AUGH [2]...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{single cell}} <b>multi-user</b> OFDMA downlink <b>resource</b> allocation on a flat-fading channel such that average supply power is minimized while fulfilling {{a set of}} target rates. Available degrees of freedom are transmission power and duration. This paper extends our previous work on power optimal resource allocation in the mobile downlink by detailing the optimal power control strategy investigation and extracting fundamental characteristics of power optimal operation in cellular downlink. We find that only a system wide allocation of transmit powers is optimal rather than on link level. The allocation strategy that minimizes overall power consumption requires the transmission power on all links to be increased if only one link degrades. Furthermore, we show that for mobile stations with equal channels but different rate requirements, it is power optimal to assign equal transmit powers with proportional transmit durations. To relate the effectiveness of power control to live operation, we take the power model into consideration which maps transmit power to supply power. We show that due to the affine mapping, the solution is independent of the power model. However, the effectiveness of power control measures is completely dependent on the underlying hardware and the load dependence factor of a base station (instead of absolute consumption values). Finally, we conclude that power control measures in base stations are most relevant in macro stations which have load dependence factor of more than 50 %. Comment: 13 pages.

40|$|The mobile {{wireless}} {{environment has}} been a challenge to reliable communications because of the time-varying nature of the channel. Detrimental effects such as path loss, shadowing, and multipath fading can greatly attenuate the transmitted signal. Therefore, adaptive channel estimation and data detecting algorithms must be designed for such channels. Moreover, in a <b>multi-user</b> system, dynamic <b>resource</b> allocation is an important means to transmit information efficiently through the varying channel. In this thesis we first propose two adaptive feedback maximum-likelihood detection techniques, a decision-feedback decoder and an output-feedback decoder, for coded signals transmitted over channels with correlated fading. Both analysis and simulation results demonstrate that they have far better performance than the conventional decoder. We also propose a simple improvement to conventional decoders by using a weighted metric. The BER performance of all these decoders is analyzed through a sliding window decoding method. Next we derive the ergodic (Shannon) capacity region and optimal dynamic resource allocation for an M-user fading broadcast channel under code-division with and without successive decoding, time-division, and frequency-division. For this channel we also derive the outage and zero-outage capacity regions and the corresponding optimal resource allocation strategies under different spectrum-sharing techniques. We obtain the outage capacity region implicitly by deriving the minimum common outage probability or the outage probability region for a given rate vector. The corresponding optimal power allocation scheme is a multi-user generalization of the single-user threshold-decision rule. Finally, we obtain the outage capacity region and optimal power allocation for fading multiple access channels. Successive decoding is proved to be optimal and iterative algorithms are proposed to obtain the optimal decoding order and power allocation in each fading state under the average power and outage probability constraints of each user. We also obtain the average power regions that can support a rate vector with the given average outage probability of each user satisfied. ...|$|R
