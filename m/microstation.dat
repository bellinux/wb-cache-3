50|$|The last {{multi-platform}} release, <b>MicroStation</b> SE (SE {{standing for}} special edition, {{but it was}} actually <b>MicroStation</b> 5.7) was released late in 1997, {{and was the first}} <b>MicroStation</b> release to include button icons that were in color. These icons could also be made borderless, just like in Office 97. This version of <b>MicroStation</b> also included several features to enable more work over the internet. This version also introduced enhanced precision and a very commonly used tool in <b>MicroStation</b> - PowerSelector.|$|E

Aside from being {{the first version of}} <b>MicroStation</b> to not include the version number in its name (<b>MicroStation</b> 95 was actually <b>MicroStation</b> v5.5), <b>MicroStation</b> 95 was a groundbreaking release that included the ability to be mostly graphic button icon driven. This version introduced a host of new features: Accudraw, dockable dialogs, Smartline, revised view controls, movie generation, and the ability to use two application windows (similar to previous Unix driven Intergraph terminals that were dubbed the [...] "Double-Headed Monster"). Many of these features are among the most popular used today. <b>MicroStation</b> 95 was the first version of <b>MicroStation</b> for a PC platform to use 32-bit hardware.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{weather is}} a key factor for {{outbreaks}} of plant diseases. Therefore, the monitoring of climate is essential to any intelligent system of cultivation. Usually, such monitoring is carried through agrometeorological stations that acquire data like temperature, humidity, wind speed and leaf wetness. Unfortunately, {{the high cost of}} stations limits the number of monitoring points within the same area. This forces the use of tools of mathematical interpolation. However, such procedure does not lead to good results in the estimation of precipitation and leaf wetness. In this work was developed a monitoring system, composed for a set of <b>microstations</b> of data acquisition. They presented low cost and highest autonomy. Therefore, they can be installed throughout the area of cultivation, collecting data like temperature and leaf wetness. The <b>microstations</b> communicate with each other through wireless communication. Thus, daily, the data collected are transferred to a central station, where become available for analysis. The system made it possible to monitor the entire area of cultivation, providing reliable data, which make it possible to characterize the microclimate. This makes it possible to, for example, the efficient use of pesticides, reducing production costs and generating healthy foods...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{community}} stations {{began as}} pirates, broadcasting political free-speech and music programs after {{the change from}} socialism. Tilos Rádió in 1991 was the first such station, followed by Fiksz Rádió and Civil Rádió. Since 2004 a new category arose: kisközösségi (small community stations), which are low-power stations. By 2010, more than 70 such <b>microstations</b> have begun broadcasting throughout the country. There are village stations, small-town stations, university stations, subcultural and religious stations. In Budapest Cool FM, Első Pesti Egyetemi Rádió and Fúzió Rádió are small community stations.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{for the water}} supply of some agroindustrial, school collectivities, or for {{restrained}} sectors of some populated areas situated at the towns peripheries, there have been built establishments of water, also called 'microstations of water treatment’, representing a superior solution for water supply {{in comparison with the}} traditional local means. These <b>microstations</b> use underground water sources that frequently accomplish the known criteria of drinkableness. The establishment of water includes only the sectors of capture, storage and distribution. The capture is achieved through two, maximum three wells that are drilled in the immediate vicinity. The main condition for the location of such stations is that the quality parameters of the water drawn through these wells situate themselves in the first category of drinkableness. In other words, the water taken could be distributed for consumption without a too expensive potabilisation proces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two examples}} of exploitation of water energy {{that can be used}} in the irrigation field. First of theseexamples is the hydraulic transformer type A. Barglazan used for irrigation, pumped water is taken directly from theriver’s well, using a hydraulic pump which simultaneously carried out a double transformation in this way: hydraulicenergy into mechanic energy and mechanical energy into hydraulic energy. Technology preparation and devices designwas done in record time, seeing that this constructive solution is more robust, reliable and with improved energyperformance versus the laboratory prototype. The experimental research which was made at 1 : 1 scale proved theirgood function over time. Another example is the hydraulic hammer (hydraulic pump) that uses low-head energy topump water, with a global efficiency of about 10 - 50 %. Currently, the new situation of private ownership of landprovides conditions for new pumping <b>microstations</b> to be made where irrigation is necessary and optimal hydrauliclocations exist...|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of buildings {{in an urban}} scene is made difficult by the large diversity of targets, and the occlusion that targets with different heights cause in the scene. These problems make the detection of buildings based on spectral data problematic and it is why the height information registered with LiDAR sensors is an attractive alternative. The objective of this work is draw the existing buildings of the central region {{of the city of}} Uberlândia/MG based on LiDAR data, using the classification routines available on <b>Microstations</b> plugin TerraScan to filter out the returns of unwanted targets, retaining only the ground and buildings in the scene. The resulting classification was studied to evaluate its precision, making use of a reference map of the buildings in the study area. The errors of omission and commission for each class were calculated, with the relatively high commission error (29. 06 %) of the Buildings class can explainable by gaps on the reference map. Mapping accuracy was also evaluated using Global accuracy, Kappa and Tau coefficients, respectively 88. 68 %, 0. 7054 and 0. 7706, indicating that the classification achieved a good degree of matching with the reference map. The final digital surface model allows for better identification of buildings than the model created using the entire point cloud, and can be more readily used in urban analysis studies.

5000|$|However, {{with the}} advent of <b>MicroStation</b> V8 in 2001 came a new IEEE-754 based 64-bit file format, {{referred}} to as V8 DGN. <b>MicroStation</b> V8 is noted by most users as the most groundbreaking release in Bentley's history. Along with the new file format came many new enhancements, including unlimited levels, a nearly limitless design plane and no limits on filesize. Other features that were added were: Accusnap, Design History, models, unlimited undo, VBA programming, [...]Net interoperability, True Scale, and standard definitions for working units (as the new file format stored everything internally in meters, but can recognize rational unit conversions so that it can know the size of geometry)(some of these features were also available in <b>MicroStation</b> 95 to MicroStation/J). But the most anticipated feature was the ability to work natively with DWG files, an ability perhaps lauded more than any other.|$|E
