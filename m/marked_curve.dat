Which comes back to what I was a moment ago saying-- that just in proportion as you [...] "feel" [...] the morbid charm of Pisa you press on it gently, and this somehow even under stress of whatever respectful attention. I found this last impulse, at all events, so far as I was concerned, quite contentedly spend itself in {{a renewed sense of}} the simple large pacified felicity of such an afternoon aspect as that of the Lung' Arno, taken up or down its course; whether to within sight of small Santa Maria della Spina, the tiny, the delicate, the exquisite Gothic chapel perched where the quay drops straight, or, in the other direction, toward the melting perspective of the narrow local pleasure-ground, the rather thin and careless bosky grace of which recedes, beside the stream whose very turbidity pleases, to a middle distance of hot and tangled and exuberant rural industry and a proper blue horizon of Carrara mountains. The Pisan Lung' Arno is shorter and less featured and framed than the Florentine, but it has the fine accent of a <b>marked</b> <b>curve</b> and is quite as bravely Tuscan; witness the type of river-fronting palace which, in half-a-dozen massive specimens, the last word of the anciently [...] "handsome," [...] are of the essence of the physiognomy of the place. In the glow of which retrospective admission I ask myself how I came, under my first flush, reflected in other pages, to fail of justice to so much proud domestic architecture--in the very teeth moreover of the fact that I was for ever paying my compliments, in a wistful, wondering way, to the fine Palazzo Lanfranchi, occupied in 1822 by the migratory Byron, and whither Leigh Hunt, as commemorated in the latter's Autobiography, came out to join him in an odd journalistic scheme.|$|E

This fin has a marked triangular shape. The angular snout covers {{a little of the}} lower jaw. Another feature is that the lateral line is formed of between 105 and 132 tubular scales, compared to between 116 and 163 for the common sole.

40|$|The Jacobian {{varieties}} of smooth curves fit {{together to form}} a family, the universal Jacobian, over the moduli space of smooth <b>marked</b> <b>curves,</b> and the theta divisors of these curves form a divisor in the universal Jacobian. In this paper we describe how to extend these families over the moduli space of stable <b>marked</b> <b>curves</b> (or rather an open subset thereof) using a stability parameter. We then prove a wall-crossing formula describing how the theta divisor varies with the stability parameter. We use that result to analyze a divisor on the moduli space of smooth <b>marked</b> <b>curves</b> that has recently been studied by Grushevsky-Zakharov, Hain and Müller. In particular, we compute the pullback of the theta divisor studied in Alexeev's work on stable abelic varieties and in Caporaso's work on theta divisors of compactified Jacobians.

30|$|Although it was {{not part}} of the {{original}} aims of the study, we found that several patients were seen on CT or MRI to have a <b>marked</b> <b>curve</b> to the femoral neck itself, rather than a straight neck and a sharp deformity at the physis (Fig.  3). These represented chronic slips with re-modelling. This is more in keeping with one of the early descriptions of SCFE by Ernst Muller in 1888 as “Schenkelhalsverbiegungen im Jungesalter”, meaning “bending of the femoral neck in adolescence” [19]. Knowledge of this deformity would be of obvious benefit before embarking on surgical intervention, as measurement of the displacement of the physis may be more difficult as re-modelling of the femoral head and neck occurs. Although re-modelling in chronic SCFE can cause retroflexion of the neck, the points on the femoral neck and head to measure the slip angle can be accurately delineated.|$|E

40|$|For each simply connected, simple complex group G we {{show that}} the direct sum of all vector bundles of {{conformal}} blocks on the moduli stack M̅_g, n of stable marked curves carries {{the structure of a}} flat sheaf of commutative algebras. The fiber of this sheaf over a smooth <b>marked</b> <b>curve</b> (C, p⃗) agrees with the Cox ring of the moduli of quasi-parabolic principal G-bundles on (C, p⃗). We use the factorization rules on conformal blocks to produce flat degenerations of these algebras. These degenerations are toric in the case G = SL_ 2 (C), and the resulting toric varieties are shown to be isomorphic to phylogenetic algebraic varieties from mathematical biology. We conclude with a proof that the Cox ring of the moduli stack of qausi-parabolic SL_ 2 (C) principal bundles over a generic curve is generated by conformal blocks of levels 1 and 2 with relations generated in degrees 2, 3, and 4.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the moduli theory of (parabolic) sheaves on stable curves. Using {{geometric}} invariant theory (GIT), universal moduli spaces of semistable parabolic sheaves on stable marked curves are constructed: `universal' indicates {{that these are}} moduli spaces of pairs where the underlying <b>marked</b> <b>curve</b> may vary {{as well as the}} parabolic sheaf (as in the Pandharipande moduli space for pairs of stable curves and torsion-free sheaves without augmentations). As an intermediate step in this construction, we construct moduli spaces of semistable parabolic sheaves on flat families of arbitrary projective schemes (of any dimension or singularity type) : this is the technical core of this thesis. These moduli spaces are projective, since they are constructed as GIT quotients of projective parameter spaces. The stability condition for parabolic sheaves depends on a choice of polarisation and is derived from the Hilbert-Mumford criterion. It is not quite the same as traditional stability with respect to parabolic Hilbert polynomials, but it is closely related to it, and the resulting moduli spaces are always compactifications of moduli of slope-stable parabolic sheaves. The construction works over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{have been}} few studies {{focusing}} on the curve pattern of scoliosis caused by lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in adolescents and {{the natural history of}} scoliosis after discectomy. The current study was carried out to identify the curve pattern of scoliosis and investigate the effect of posterior discectomy on the curve improvement in adolescents with LDH. Methods This review focused on a group of 26 adolescents with LDH who initially presented to our clinic for evaluation of scoliosis, followed by posterior discectomy between 2000 and 2009. Radiographic measurements included curve pattern, specific curve features, trunk shift, and sagittal profile. The correlation between the side of disc herniation and the direction of lumbosacral curve and the trunk shift was evaluated. Results A typical curve pattern was initially identified in all of the patients as a short lumbosacral curve accompanied with a long thoracic or thoracolumbar curve toward the opposite side. 23 of 26 patients (88. 5 %) had a trunk shift more than 2. 0 cm away from the midline, showing a poor coronal balance. A relatively straight sagittal profile was noted in all the patients. 84. 6 % (22 / 26) patients had a disc herniation at the convex side of lumbosacral curve. Similarly, 73. 1 % (19 / 26) patients showed a trunk shift toward the opposite side of disc herniation. All of the patients had an <b>marked</b> <b>curve</b> improvement immediately after discectomy. In the 17 patients with a more than 2 -year follow-up, only two had a residual lumbosacral curve {{greater than or equal to}} 20 degrees. The mean ODI improved from 21. 4 % before surgery to 7. 3 % at the final follow-up. Conclusions A short lumbosacral curve accompanied with a long thoracic or thoracolumbar curve toward the opposite side, and a relatively straight sagittal profile have been noted in all the patients. The direction of lumbosacral curve and trunk shift was related to the side of disc herniation. A majority of patients have a small curve size while assosiated with a significant coronal imbalance. Earlier decompression can provide a greater opportunity for spontaneous correction of scoliosis. </p...|$|E
