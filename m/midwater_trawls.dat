5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls</b> {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E

50|$|<b>Midwater</b> <b>{{trawling}}</b> is trawling, or net fishing, {{at a depth}} that {{is higher}} {{in the water column}} than the bottom of the ocean.

5000|$|Bythaelurus naylori, {{also known}} as the Dusky snout {{catshark}} is a catshark of the family Scyliorhinidae. This species is found from the Southwest Indian Ridge, southwesternIndian Ocean. The specimens were collected from 89-1,443 m depth in both bottom trawls and <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls.</b> The shallowest catch record of the new species, possibly at 89 m, came from a midwater trawl. This species can be distinguished from its two closest congeners, B. giddingsi and B. lutarius, by a combination of prominent comb-like dermal denticles along the upper caudal-fin margin, absence of oral papillae, uniform body coloration, and noticeable dark dusky snout; Bythaelurus giddingsi has oral papillae present and a variegated color pattern, while B. lutarius lacks a caudal crest of enlarged denticles and matures at a much smaller size than the new species.|$|E

Problems of delayed flushing of animals into the codend and of entanglement of animals in the netting were not acute. Compared to a 5. 4 m 2 Isaacs-Kidd <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl,</b> this trawl catches many more individuals and species of fishes and larger sizes of some fishes and cephalopods.

5000|$|Commercial {{fishing for}} the roundnose {{grenadier}} {{started in the}} 1960s. The former USSR, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic were the main countries involved, sending factory ships to undertake <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls</b> in the Atlantic Ocean. Catches peaked at over 80000 t in 1971. More recently, French and Spanish vessels have predominated and the total annual catch has been under 20000 t in most years since 1980. The flesh of the fish is white with a pleasant texture and is sold as seafood. In 2010 in the United Kingdom, the roundnose grenadier was listed as a [...] "UK Priority Species" [...] for conservation purposes {{on the grounds that}} it is a long-lived fish taking many years to mature and that numbers were declining. It was suggested that if no actions to conserve the fish were taken, it would become extinct within the next 10 years.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese eel {{and other}} anguillid eels live in fresh water and {{estuaries}} where they feed and grow as yellow eels {{for a number}} of years before they begin to mature and become silver eels. The silver eels then migrate out of fresh water into the ocean and start their long journey to their spawning area. Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in East Asia to their spawning area without feeding. The spawning area of this species was discovered in 1991 by collecting small leptocephali about 10 mm in size, and then in 2005 the same team of Japanese scientists at the University of Tokyo found a more precise location of spawning based on genetically identified specimens of newly hatched preleptocephali only 2 to 5 days old in a small area near the Suruga Seamount to the west of the Mariana Islands (14-17° N, 142-143° E). In more recent years, more preleptocephali have been collected, and even Japanese eel eggs have been collected and genetically identified at sea on the research vessel. The collections of eggs and recently hatched larvae have been made along the western side of the seamount chain of the West Mariana Ridge. Furthermore, mature adults of the Japanese eel and giant mottled eel were captured using large <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls</b> in 2008 by Japanese scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency. The adults of the Japanese eel appear to spawn in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean based on the recent catches of their spawning adults, eggs, and newly hatched larvae. The timing of catches of eggs and larvae and the ages of larger larvae have shown that Japanese eels only spawn during the few days just before the new moon period of each month of their spawning season.|$|E

40|$|IN ADDITION TO the fishes {{and faster}} {{swimming}} invertebrates (euphausiids, squids) usually ob-tained in <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> collections, relatively large species of copepods are also frequently captured. Aside from Sewell's (1929) report of copepods found in six midwater collections {{made in the}} Ind ian Ocean, it has only been {{in recent years that}} midwate r trawl samples have been more or less systematically analyzed for copepods. From the Florida Current, off Miami, an area in which the copepods have been stud ied fairly extensively, Owre and Foyo (1964) re-ported that 21 calanoid species were found only in collections made by the Isaacs-Kidd <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> (Isaacs and Kidd, 1953). Of these, 11 represented new records for the area. In the southwestern Indian Ocean, De Decker and Mombeck (1965) using both vertical plankton net and <b>midwater</b> fish <b>trawl</b> found 274 species of copepods. Of these the fish trawl accounted for 115 species including 43 which were not found in the plankton net collections. In the western Indian Ocean Grice and Hulsemann (1967) studied a series of 30 plankton net and 21 <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> collections obtained between 18 °N and 40 0 S. In the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> col-lections were found 64 species not present in the plankton net collections, including representa-tives of all eight species of the family Mega-calanidae. It thus appears that midwater nets constitute a valuable additional means of sam-pling the calanoid copepod fauna in an open ocean area, and it is hoped that those interested in copepods will examine any available mid-water trawl samples. The samples examined in this study wer...|$|R
