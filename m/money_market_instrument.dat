An Open Buy Back is a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> used to raise short term capital. It {{is a form}} of borrowing using Nigerian Government Securities as collateral.

50|$|As of September 2001, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 280 active ABCP programs, {{with more than}} $650 billion in outstanding. During the mid-2000s, ABCP saw a steady rise in popularity because of their high ratings {{from the perspective of}} investors and the low borrowing rates from companies who need money. Gradually, even more conservative investors, such as money market mutual funds and retirement funds began purchasing ABCP. This optimism pushed the outstanding of ABCP to $1.3 trillion by the time of July 2007. At that time, ABCP was the largest <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> in the United States, following by Treasury Bills with about $940 billion outstanding.

40|$|A passive {{investment}} management model was developed via a critical literature review of portfolio methodologies. This model was developed {{based on the}} fundamental models originated by both Markowitz and Sharpe. The passive model was automated via {{the development of a}} computer programme {{that can be used to}} generate the required outputs as suggested by Markowitz and Sharpe. For this computer programme MATLAB is chosen and the model’s logic is designed and validated. The demonstration of the designed programme using securities traded is performed on Johannesburg Securities Exchange. The selected portfolio has been sub-categorised into six components with a total of twenty- seven shares. The shares were grouped into different components due to the investors’ preferences and investment time horizon. The results demonstrate that a test portfolio outperforms a risk- free <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> (the government R 194 bond), but not the All Share Index for the period under consideration. This design concludes the reason for this is due in part to the use of the error term from Sharpe’s single index model.

40|$|We {{consider}} a passive investor who divides his capital between two assets: a risk-free <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> and an index fund, or an exchange-traded fund, tracking a broad market index. We model {{the evolution of}} the market index by a lognormal diffusion. The agent faces both fixed and proportional transaction costs and solvency constraints. The objective is to maximize the expected utility from the portfolio liquidation at a fixed horizon, but if the portfolio reaches a pre-set target value, then the position in the risky asset is liquidated. The model is formulated as a parabolic impulse control problem and we characterize the value function as the unique constrained viscosity solution of the associated quasi-variational inequality. We show the existence of an impulse policy which is arbitrarily close to the optimal one by reducing the model to a sequence of iterated optimal stopping problems. The value function and the quasi-optimal policy are computed numerically by an iterative finite element discretization technique. We present extended numerical results {{in the case of a}} constant relative risk aversion utility function, showing the non-stationary shape of the optimal strategy and how it varies with respect to the model parameters. The numerical experiments reveal that, even with small transaction costs and distant horizons, the optimal strategy is essentially a buy-and-hold trading strategy where the agent recalibrates his portfolio very few times...|$|E
40|$|Many {{surveys of}} the ECB''s {{monetary}} framework emphasize the inability of financial markets to correctly predict monetary policy decisions. At the same time, these surveys of financial market participants have given relatively high marks to the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England {{on their ability to}} be understood by financial markets. Against this background, this paper examines the ability of financial markets to correctly anticipate these three central bank policy decisions over the first 3 Â½ years of the ECB. The paper relies on calculations that market participants employ in anticipating policy changes and on term structure regressions that provide ex post evidence of market surprises. While the results suggest that all three central banks are broadly predictable, markets have had difficulty anticipating large changes and cuts in ECB policy interest rates. These surprises may be tied to the large number of policy meetings, particular characteristics of the EONIA money market, and the unique circumstances of the ECB. An added factor may be the absence of a consistent policy on communicating the current stance-if any-of the ECB''s policy bias on the future direction of interest rates.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the greater {{use in the}} past decade of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> in the conduct of monetary policy by the central banks, or their equivalent, in six of the main East Asian developing economies.

A common theme {{in the case of the}} successful economies has been one of employing <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> that have yields based on actual market demand and supply. In those cases where the yields have been unrealistic due to not being based on market conditions, the open market operations have generally not been successful.

Based on the experience of these economies, it is suggested that a viable market in treasury bills issued by the national government [...] not the central bank [...] be developed for the central bank's use in its monetary policy operations. The advantages of a well-developed open market operation over other traditional monetary policy instruments are cited near the end of the paper.
