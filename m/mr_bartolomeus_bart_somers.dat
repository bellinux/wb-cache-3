5000|$|In June, 2016, the European Committee of the Regions adopted <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers</b> {{report on}} [...] "Combatting Radicalisation and Violent Extremism: Prevention {{mechanisms}} at {{local and regional}} level". His opinion won cross-party support for its calls for more effective policing, for more cooperation between local, regional, national and European authorities, and for an approach based on respect for core principles.|$|R
5000|$|Ideologically, Open VLD {{started as}} an {{economically}} liberal, somewhat Thatcherite party under its founder, Guy Verhofstadt. The VLD rapidly became more centrist {{and gave up}} much of its free market approach, partly {{under the influence of}} Verhofstadt's political scientist brother Dirk Verhofstadt. Party chairman <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers</b> called in November 2006 for a [...] "revolution" [...] within the party, saying that [...] "a liberal party," [...] like the VLD, [...] "can be only progressive and social." ...|$|R

25|$|That evening, the King {{received}} Jo Vandeurzen, the CD chairman, and Didier Reynders, {{the chairman}} of the MR. The next day the King received the chairpersons of the two other orange-blue parties, <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers</b> (Open Vld) and Joëlle Milquet (CDH), in order to attempt to defuse the tensions. The King did not receive the chairmen of the N-VA and the FDF; however, Bart De Wever (N-VA) reportedly did receive an exploratory phone call from the Royal Palace. During the weekend, there also were informal consultations between the formateur and all other parties involved in the coalition talks.|$|R
25|$|The King then {{appointed}} Yves Leterme as formateur on Sunday July 15 {{with the}} task of forming a new government coalition after Jean-Luc Dehaene was relieved from his task as mediator and negotiator. On his first day as formateur, Leterme met with outgoing Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (Open VLD), the new President of the Chamber of Representatives, Herman Van Rompuy (CD), and the new President of the Senate, Armand De Decker (MR). The following day, Tuesday July 17, Leterme received the presidents of the orange-blue parties: Jo Vandeurzen (CD), Bart De Wever (N-VA), Didier Reynders (MR), <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers</b> (Open VLD) and Joëlle Milquet (Humanist Democratic Centre).|$|R
5000|$|Bouckaert was {{a member}} of the board of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) party. In 2005 he created a stir when he {{publicly}} called for an [...] "evolution to the formation of a two-party system after the Anglo-Saxon model." [...] With [...] "two homogenous groups," [...] Bouckaert concluded, [...] "a left-wing bloc around the SP.ASP.A, ACV and Groen!, and a right wing bloc with the VLD, the right wing of the CD&V, the N-VA and the Vlaams Belang." [...] His opinions were against the party line, and an agreement within the VLD to not criticize the party line. A conflict ensued between Bouckaert and party chairman <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers,</b> which ended on 8 July 2005, when Bouckaert stepped down from the party board.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{creation}} of the ALDE group in the European Parliament, which occurred half-way during the third mandate of the Committee of the Regions (CoR), the members of the ELDR Group in the CoR rapidly entered into talks with the CoR members belonging to the EDP Party with a view to replicating a similar arrangement within the CoR. Under the presidency of Kent Johansson, Executive Member of the Swedish Region of Västra Götaland, the ELDR Group of the Committee of the Regions unanimously agreed in February 2005 to change its name to the ALDE Group and to accept the EDP members to the group. In doing so, the group adopted a new Mission Statement (see below). The current President of the Group is <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers,</b> Mayor of Mechelen and leader of the liberal group in the Flemish Parliament.|$|R
25|$|Following {{consultations}} {{with a number}} of ministers of State, King Albert received Herman Van Rompuy (CD), the outgoing President of the Chamber of Representatives, and charged him with an exploratory mission in order to find a solution to the political crisis. Van Rompuy was considered by Flemish and French-speaking parties and newspapers as a good choice. He met on August 30 with the presidents of several parties of the orange-blue coalition, in particular Jo Vandeurzen (CD), Bart De Wever (N-VA), <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers</b> (Open VLD) and Jöelle Milquet (CDH). On August 31, he met with presidents Didier Reynders (MR), Olivier Maingain, (FDF) and Jean-Michel Javaux (Ecolo). The content of the discussions is unknown as Van Rompuy wanted to communicate and negotiate discreetly. De Standaard noted that Van Rompuy did not talk with a member of the PS, which could mean he wanted to reach the required two-thirds majority for constitutional reform with the ecologists (Ecolo on the French-speaking side) and rather that the PS.|$|R
2500|$|On August 25, the King {{received}} Herman Van Rompuy (CD), President of the Chamber of Representatives and Armand De Decker (MR), President of the Senate, and on August 27 the Royal Palace {{announced that}} the King would receive several ministers of State to discuss the political crisis. It was suggested by De Standaard that the King would not appoint the duo Langendries and De Croo because they were already named {{too much in the}} media which caused several politicians, such as Hendrik Bogaert (CD) and Bart De Wever (N-VA), to object or criticize such a choice. The Open VLD also held a press conference in which <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers</b> called the remarks about De Croo [...] "inconvenient and unseen". He also said that the problem of the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) electoral district should be tackled before all other issues, something regarded by the VRT as a direct criticism of Leterme because he did not once mention this problem when he was formateur. Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel De Gucht, who is a negotiator for Open VLD in the coalition talks, described the government formation as [...] "surrealistic" [...] and added: [...] "Ceci n'est pas une formation".|$|R
5000|$|The 2006 Belgian {{municipal}} elections were lost by the VLD, also in Ostend, where Dedecker was a candidate. In Ostend, they lost {{out to the}} Socialist Party (SP.A), for which party president Johan Vande Lanotte was a candidate in the city. In {{the run-up to the}} elections, Vande Lanotte and Dedecker clashed severely, with Dedecker claiming that Vande Lanotte, as councilor and socialist party [...] "strong man," [...] made Ostend the [...] "Palermo of the North Sea." [...] The local VLD party in Ostend, led by Bart Tommelein, does want to pursue a city coalition with the Socialist though. Dedecker however stated, on election night, that the VLD with this result cannot be part of any coalition. Two days later, the national head of the VLD, <b>Bart</b> <b>Somers,</b> intervened, by stating that Dedecker will be removed from the VLD. Somers stated that {{in the last few days}} Dedecker has showed himself to be a [...] "inveterate trouble maker who keeps on creating damaging battles in his own party." [...] Dedecker responded that [...] "first they use me to attract votes in the local elections, only to put me on the street once the votes have been counted." [...] Bart Tommelein later on accused Dedecker of being [...] "the largest Calimero of Flemish politics." ...|$|R
