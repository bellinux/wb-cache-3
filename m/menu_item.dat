5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the <b>menu</b> <b>item</b> in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E
5|$|The TPG-led {{group of}} owners {{divested}} itself of Burger King in 2012 when the chain {{was sold to}} 3G Capital of Brazil. After 3G purchased Burger King, its new management team refocused on a broader menu strategy to lure a more diverse customer base. The first major change to the product base was a reformulation and name change of the company's chicken nuggets in January 2013. Along with other new products such as smoothies, wraps and chicken strips that broadly copied McDonald's menu once again, the chain reintroduced the Big King as a permanent <b>menu</b> <b>item</b> in November of the same year.|$|E

The sample {{was comprised of}} customers who had previously consumed these types of healthful items at a casual dining restaurant. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. Results revealed that customers 2 ̆ 7 health values had {{a positive effect on}} attitudes and behavioral intentions and that customers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward low-fat or low-calorie <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> positively influenced behavioral intentions. However, attitudes toward taste of healthful <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> exerted a greater impact on behavioral intentions to choose, recommend, and spread a positive word-of-mouth about those <b>menu</b> <b>items.</b> To meet customers’ desire, restaurants should continue to focus on great-tasting healthful foods...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that restaurant-based interventions {{have the potential}} to promote healthier purchasing and improve the nutrients consumed. This study adds to this body of research by reporting the results of a trial focused on promoting the sale of healthy child <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> in independently owned restaurants. Eight pair-matched restaurants that met the eligibility criteria were randomized to a menu-only versus a menu-plus intervention condition. Both of the conditions implemented new healthy child <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> and received support for implementation for eight weeks. The menu-plus condition also conducted a marketing campaign involving employee trainings and promotional materials. Process evaluation data captured intervention implementation. Sales of new and existing child <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> were tracked for 16 weeks. Results indicated that the interventions were implemented with moderate to high fidelity depending on the component. Sales of new healthy child <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> occurred immediately, but decreased during the post-intervention period in both conditions. Sales of existing child <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> demonstrated a time by condition effect with restaurants in the menu-plus condition observing significant decreases and menu-only restaurants observing significant increases in sales of existing child <b>menu</b> <b>items.</b> Additional efforts are needed to inform sustainable methods for improving access to healthy foods and beverages in restaurants...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{prevalence}} of sugar sweetened beverages and fried foods {{combined with a}} lack of healthy children’s menu options has contributed to the obesity epidemic among young Americans. Recent legislation in New York City and San Francisco instituted strict nutritional requirements on children’s <b>menu</b> <b>items.</b> We performed a cross-sectional study that focused on independently owned restaurants with printed children’s menus in Vermont. We investigated the nutritional content of children’s <b>menu</b> <b>items,</b> restaurant owner and manager perspectives on customer ordering habits, and barriers that restaurants would face if they made children’s <b>menu</b> <b>items</b> healthier.

5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat <b>menu</b> <b>item</b> such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent <b>menu</b> <b>item.</b> The Big King sandwich's recipe {{is exactly the same}} as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold in many of the company's international markets in several forms.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional <b>menu</b> <b>item</b> in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent <b>menu</b> <b>item</b> in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E
