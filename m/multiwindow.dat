Because of both the complex nature of the FMS and the pilot-FMS interface, a large portion of transition training is devoted to the FMS. The current study examined the impact of the primary pilot-FMS interface, the control display unit (CDU), on FMS training. Based on the hypothesis that the interface design could {{have a significant impact on}} training, an FMS simulation with two separate interfaces was developed. One interface was similar to a current-generation design, and the other was a <b>multiwindows</b> CDU based on graphical user interface techniques.

50|$|I wish we hadn't {{used all}} the keys on the keyboard. I {{think one of}} the {{interesting}} things is that vi is really a mode-based editor. I think as mode-based editors go, it's pretty good. One of the good things about EMACS, though, is its programmability and the modelessness. Those are two ideas which never occurred to me. I also wasn't very good at optimizing code when I wrote vi. I think the redisplay module of the editor is almost intractable. It does a really good job for what it does, but when you're writing programs as you're learning... That's why I stopped working on it.What actually happened was that I was in the process of adding <b>multiwindows</b> to vi when we installed our VAX, which would have been in December of '78. We didn't have any backups and the tape drive broke. I continued to work even without being able to do backups. And then the source code got scrunched and I didn't have a complete listing. I had almost rewritten all of the display code for windows, and that was when I gave up. After that, I went back to the previous version and just documented the code, finished the manual and closed it off. If that scrunch had not happened, vi would have multiple windows, and I might have put in some programmability—but I don't know.The fundamental problem with vi is that it doesn't have a mouse and therefore you've got all these commands. In some sense, its backwards from the kind of thing you'd get from a mouse-oriented thing. I think multiple levels of undo would be wonderful, too. But fundamentally, vi is still ed inside. You can't really fool it.It's like one of those pinatas—things that have candy inside but has layer after layer of paper mache on top. It doesn't really have a unified concept.

3000|$|For {{the whole}} space Gabor frames, single-window ones have been {{extensively}} {{studied in the}} past twenty years and more [4, 5, 7, 9, 15, 16]. <b>Multiwindow</b> frames were firstly studied by Zibulski and Zeevi [10] and Zeevi, Zibulski, and Porat [11]. By introduction of a Zak transform they developed a matrix (so-called Zibulski–Zeevi matrix) algebraic tool for <b>multiwindow</b> Gabor frames and applied it to image processing and computer vision. Since then, many researchers have studied <b>multiwindow</b> Gabor frames and related applications [2, 17 – 20]. It was also pointed out in [12] that the Zibulski–Zeevi matrix method is not very efficient for mixed Gabor frames.

For subspace Gabor frames, single-window ones have been considered by several papers [1, 13, 21 – 26]. In [24, 26], and [27], a Zak transform matrix different from the Zibulski–Zeevi matrix was introduced and used effectively to study Gabor systems on periodic subsets of the real line, whereas the Zibulski–Zeevi matrix method does not work well for such Gabor systems. A variation of this method was applied to Gabor systems on discrete periodic sets [28, 29]. In [30], a density result for Gabor frames on periodic subsets of R^d is obtained via the Haar measure of the group generated by lattices.

Two approaches are presented {{for the analysis}} of the <b>multiwindow</b> scheme: the signal domain approach and the Zak transform domain approach.

30|$|Theoretical {{aspects of}} time-frequency {{analysis}} have been intensively studied {{over the last}} two decades [1 – 27]. In parallel, their various applications have been exploited as well. Namely, for an efficient analysis of nonstationary signals, such are radar, sonar, biomedical, seismic, and multimedia signals, time-frequency representations are required. Time-frequency distributions are most commonly used for this purpose. Many of the researchers have made significant efforts in defining a distribution that is optimal for a wide class of frequency-modulated signals [8 – 11]. As a result, a number of time-frequency distributions have been proposed. However, the efficiency of each of them is more or less limited to a specific class of signals and, consequently, to a specific application. One of the goals of this paper is to highlight the most important features of some popular time-frequency distributions and to give an idea of how to choose the most appropriate distribution depending on the signal form. The linear, quadratic, higher-order, and <b>multiwindow</b> time-frequency distributions are considered. The short-time Fourier transform, as the most commonly used linear transform, is firstly discussed. Next, the Wigner distribution, as the best known quadratic distribution, is presented. Also, the Cohen class and some specific distributions belonging to this class are considered [1, 5 – 7]. It is shown that the quadratic distributions are optimal for a linear frequency-modulated signal. However, if the instantaneous frequency variation within the analysis window is faster, <b>multiwindow,</b> or higher order distributions should be used, [14 – 16, 19 – 27]. The Hermite functions-based <b>multiwindow</b> approach is also discussed. Finally, highly concentrated distributions with complex-lag argument are presented. To facilitate in better understanding of the presented theoretical considerations, numerous illustrative examples have been provided.|$|E
