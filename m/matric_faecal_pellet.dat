40|$|The re-use of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> in {{the water}} column before sinking to the {{seafloor}} is known as an important pathway in marine food webs. Especially planktonic copepods seems to be actively use their <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets.</b> Since benthic copepods (order Harpacticoida) live in the vicinity of their pellets, it remains unclear how important these pellets are for their feeding ecology. In the present study a laboratory experiment was conducted to analyse the importance of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> for the feeding ecology of the harpacticoid Paramphiascella fulvofasciata and its grazing pressure on two diatom species (Seminavis robusta, Navicula phyllepta). By quantifying the amount and volume of the produced faecel pellets in different treatments, it was tested to what extent the food source and the lack of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> would influence the production of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets.</b> We found that the grazing pressure of P. fulvofasciata depended on the diatom density since only a top-down effect could be found on the smaller Navicula cells during its initial exponential growth phase. The grazer had a negative effect on the diatom growth and controlled the cell density to about 4, 000 cells/cm 2. In {{spite of the fact that}} the addition of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> did not show a significant positive effect on the assimilation of diatoms, the removal of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> strongly promoted the pellet production. Especially when grazing on Navicula the harpacticoid P. fulvofasciata produced significantly more and smaller <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> when the pellets were removed. This outcome illustrates the need for <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> of this harpacticoid copepod when grazing on the diatom Navicula.

In contrast to the more southern regions, the PFr was characterised by the occurrence of relatively dense phyto-plankton blooms and high copepod concentrations. <b>Faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> were relatively abundant in the MIZ reaching up to > 105 µg <b>faecal</b> <b>pellet</b> carbon (FPC) m- 3, whereas the values in the more northern regions were about one to two orders of magnitude lower: about 6 µg FPC m- 3 in the southern ACC and less than 1 µm FPC m- 3 in the PFr.

The study area was divided into 25 -ha cells, from which approximately one-fifth were selected by random means for survey. Each cell was sampled by two parallel transects 100 m apart. Along each transect 25 regularly spaced 0. 001 -ha circular plots were searched for <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> within particular age ranges. Results were 4634 ± 19 % and 5071 ± 19 % pellets km- 2 per day respectively (Y ± SE). The two surveys displayed no significant variance in estimates of average density.

40|$|In recent years, the {{presence}} of crusts within near surface sediments found in deep water locations off {{the west coast of}} Angola has been of interest to hot-oil pipeline designers. The origin for these crusts is considered to be of biological origin, based on the observation of thousands of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> in natu-ral crust core samples. This paper presents the results of labora-tory tests undertaken on natural and faecal pellet-only samples. These tests investigate the role <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> play in modifying the gemechanical behaviour of clayey sediments. It is found that <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> are able to significantly alter both the strength and the average grain-size of natural sediments, and therefore, influ-ence the permeability and stiffness. Hot-oil pipelines self-embed into and subsequent shear on crusts containing <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets.</b> Being able to predict the time required for installed pipelines to consolidate the underlying sediment and thus, how soon after pipe-laying, the interface strength will develop is of great interest to pipeline designers. It is concluded from wet-sieving samples before and after oedometer tests, that the process of pipe lay-ing is unlikely to destroy pellets. They will therefore, be a major constituent of the sediment subject to soil-pipeline shearing be-haviour during axial pipe-walking and lateral buckling. Based on the presented results, a discussion highlighting the key impli-cations for pipeline design is therefore provided. ...|$|R
40|$|C {{fractionation}} {{effects in}} an experimental food chain {{were determined by}} performing a series of mesocosm experiments with the copepod Temora longicornis and using flagellates as food. The bulk copepods were enriched in 13 C by 1. 2 to 2. 3  and the CO 2 respired was enriched by 0. 8 , compared to the isotopic composition of the food. <b>Faecal</b> <b>pellets,</b> however, were strongly depleted in 13 C by 4. 3 to 11. 3 , in isotopic mass balance with the 13 C enrichment of the copepod body and of the respired carbon dioxide. Compound-specific carbon isotope analyses indicated that solvent extractable sterols and alkenones were isotopically light in carbon in both the copepod body and in the faecal matter. These lipids reflected the isotopic nature of the consumed food, indicating {{that they are not}} fractionated in the copepod. The residual fraction of the <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> (after extraction) showed the largest isotopic change, being depleted in 13 C by about 16  compared to the same fraction in the diet. Curie point pyrolysis analyses indicated that proteins were the major constituents of this residual material from both the copepods and their <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets.</b> When food sources of different isotopic composition were alternately supplied to the copepods, the <b>faecal</b> <b>pellet</b> residue showed a relatively slow turnover rate compared to the alkenones, which were completely egested by the copepods. A similarly slow turnover rate was observed in the residual material from copepods, suggesting that it must be proteins that are being fractionated by the copepod T. longicornis. The low d 13 C value of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> adds another variable to the stable carbon isotopic signature of particulate organic carbon in the pelagic environment...|$|R

Robbins and Russell (1978) and Hindell et al. (1985) suggested that trees in which P. cinereus roosted by day reliably predicted the trees they browsed.

40|$|We {{compare the}} nature of copepod outfluxes of nonliving matter, the factors {{controlling}} their rate (aid their Jaw, and finally their role, particularly their relative importance in the carbon and nitrogen cycle. Copepods release dissolved matter through excretion and respiration and particulate matter through production of <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets,</b> carcasses, moults, and (lead eggs. Excretion liberates several organic C, N, and P compounds and inorganic N and P compounds, with inorganic compounds constituting the larger part. The <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> of copepods are covered by a peritrophic membrane and have a highly variable size and content. There is less information on {{the nature of}} other copepod particulate products. The weight-specific rates of posthatch mortality, respiration, excretion, and <b>faecal</b> <b>pellet</b> production have similar C or N levels and are higher than those of moulting and egg mortality. In general, most important factors controlling these rates are temperature, body mass, food concentration, food quality, and faunistic composition. Physical and biological factors govern the vertical fate of copepod products by affecting their sedimentation speed and concentration gradient. The physical factors are sinking speed, advection, stratification, turbulent diffiusion, and molecular diffusion. They influence the sedimentation speed and degradation of the copepod products. The biological factors are production, biodegradation (by zooplankton, nekton, and microorganisms) and vertical migration of copepods (diel or seasonal). Physical degradation and biodegradation by zooplankton and nekton are faster than biodegradation by microorganisms. The most important copepod outfluxes are excretion and fecal pellet production. Excretion offers inorganic nutrients that can be directly used by. Excretion of primary producers. <b>Faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> have a more important role in the vertical transport of elements than the other particulate products. Most investigation has focused on carbon burial in the form of copepod <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets,</b> measured by sediment traps, and on the role of ammonia excretion in nutrient recycling. Full evaluation of the role of copepod products in the transport and recycling of elements and compounds requires a quantification of all copepod products and their different fates, particularly detritiphagy, remineralization, and integration as marine snow...|$|R

40|$|Abst rac t : During {{one season}} (from April to November 1989) <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> of the Noc-tule bat Nyctalus noctula were {{collected}} in three roosts in buildings in villages. At seven roosts in trees {{in the town of}} Zürich, Noctule bats were caught every two weeks from April to November and <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> are collected. The <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> are analysed both in terms of quality and quantity and compared from a regional and seasonal point of view. Nyctalus noctula preferably feeds on Trichoptera and Diptera (Chironomidae, Anisopodidae, Tipulidae). These insects fly in swarms so the Noctule bat can hunt and catch a lot of prey in very short time: this can be termed filter feeding. It is surprising, that the Noctule bat with its powerful and strong theeth hunts such soft and small in-sects. In spring and autumn, though, when larger insects, such as Coleoptera (e. g. Melolontha sp. in spring, Geotrupes sp, in autumn) are frequent and swarming insects (e. g. Trichoptera) are rare, the larger insects are also hunted by the Noctule bat, a fact that points to an opportunistic hunting strategy. BAND 32 - 3...|$|R
40|$|Aims: <b>Faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> from {{germ-free}} locusts {{were used}} as culture media to determine the ability of locust gut bacteria to synthesize phenolic components of the locust cohesion pheromone. Methods and Results: Inoculation of germ-free <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> with Pantoea agglomerans, a species commonly isolated from locusts, resulted in the release of large amounts of guaiacol and small amounts of phenol, {{both of which are}} components of the locust cohesion pheromone. Two other locust-derived species, Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, also produced guaiacol from germ-free <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets,</b> but the opportunistic locust pathogen, Serratia marcescens, did not. The most likely precursor for guaiacol is the plant-derived vanillic acid, which is present in large amounts in the faeces of both conventional and germ-free locusts. Conclusions: These observations are consistent with previous ones, that locust gut bacteria are responsible for the production of components of the locust cohesion pheromone. Significance and Impact of the Study: These findings illustrate how an insect can adapt to make use of a common bacterial metabolite produced by one or more of its indigenous gut bacterial species. This observation has implications for our appreciation of insect gut microbiota interactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Microfungi were {{recovered}} {{from all parts}} of a municipal water distribution system in sub-tropical Australia even though virtually no colony-forming units {{were recovered}} from the treated water as it left the treatment plant. A study was then undertaken to determine the potential sources of the microfungal population in the distribution system. Observation of frogs (Litoria caerulea) using the internal infrastructure of a reservoir as diurnal sleeping places, together with observation of visible microfungal growth on their <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets,</b> led to an investigation of the possible involvement of this animal. Old <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> were collected and sporulating fungal colonies growing on their surfaces were identified. Fresh <b>faecal</b> <b>pellets</b> were collected and analysed for microfungal content, and skin swabs were analysed for yeasts. It was found that the faeces and skin of L. caerulea carried large numbers of yeasts as well as spores of various filamentous fungal genera. While there are many possible sources of microfungal contamination of municipal drinking water supplies, this study has revealed that the Australian green tree frog L. caerulea is one of the important sources of filamentous microfungi and yeasts in water storage reservoir...|$|R
