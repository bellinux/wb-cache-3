In the early sixties Dunlop opted for the cheaper textile radial tyres rather than the steel belted radial tyres. The British car industry declined and the 1973 oil crisis compounded matters. Dunlop started losing markets. As its business declined it started selling off many of its companies, including that in India.|$|R

I believe it most appropriate to acknowledge at this conference, the remarkable scientific contributions and vision of Dr. Wilhelm C. Hueper who, for so many years, pioneered the study of occupational cancer and established the basis for the international concern on occupational and environmental cancer. Scientists {{all over the world are}} deeply indebted to him for his dedicated service to society. The problems and perspectives of the study of any industry relate to the attitude, interest, and sense of social responsibility of the management of that industry or plant; and to the degree of awareness and understanding of the workers who unfortunately have not been informed of the hazards to which they were exposed. Further, the problems relate to the degree of responsibiilty exercised by the government for the protection of the industrial population and to the support provided by the government for the necessary resources for the identification and control of industrial health problems. Past experience has taught us that, for the rubber industry as well as virtually all other industries, the absence of industrial medical surveillance systems and the absence of any environmental monitoring systems, the absence of any early warning detection system for current and delayed health effects among the workers, has created problems of recognition of health hazards, which have accumulated for decades.

50|$|Ground mica {{is used in}} the well-drilling {{industry}} as an additive to drilling fluids. The coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole. Well drilling muds accounted for 15% of dry-ground mica use in 2008. The plastics industry used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler, especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration. Mica is used in plastic automobile fascia and fenders as a reinforcing material, providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability, stiffness, and strength. Mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability, reduced warpage, and the best surface properties of any filled plastic composite. In 2008, consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2% of the market. The rubber industry used ground mica as an inert filler and mold release compound in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> molded <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> such as tires and roofing. The platy texture acts as an antiblocking, antisticking agent. Rubber mold lubricant accounted for 1.5% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008.

40|$|The {{object of}} the thesis {{was to examine the}} {{planning}} system of India and to assess the ways in which it affected the rubber industry between 1951 and 1979. The planning system has been biased towards heavy industry and transportation so that tyre manufacture had priority. The initial bias in favour of autarky resulted in neglect of possible trade development, but this was gradually relaxed. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> all <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> was controlled by a licensing system. Delays before passing a Land Reform Act in 1964 led. to a multiplication <b>of</b> very small <b>rubber</b> holdings planted with low-yielding stock. Although the output <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> increased considerably, attempts at subsidised replanting of smallholdings were less successful than they might have been largely owing to lack of foreign exchange to secure trained supervisory personnel and supplies of foreign planting material. Shortage of foreign exchange stemmed from the failure to develop trade. Rubber estates were not subdivided but their expansion was severely restricted leading to a sacrifice of economic viability since they managed to replant almost totally with high-yielding stock despite heavy taxation. Estates were more productive than smallholdings. Throughout the period, natural rubber was subject to minimum price control which benefited growers. Maximum price control existed until 1963 when it was virtually abandoned although 12 large manufacturers were said to influence prices. Tyre prices were controlled up to 1974. The prices <b>of</b> other <b>rubber</b> <b>manufactures</b> were not controlled so that the producers were able to recoup themselves for the high prices <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber.</b> However, priority in the acquisition of raw materials enabled the tyre industry,to expand at the expense <b>of</b> other <b>manufactures.</b> Indian planning has been flexible: licensing controls and import restrictions were relaxed in the 1970 s while exports <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>products</b> were encouraged by such measures as cash incentives and duty drawbacks...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of foreign outsourcing, focusing on CEE countries and especially on Turkey, on the level of employment for Spain. The rising economic integration has increased not only trade in final goods but also the flows of intermediate goods, as a result of the fragmentation of production by multinational firms and/or the search for new and cheaper providers. While some see this phenomenon as a threat to domestic employment, it also represents a chance to reduce costs, increase flexibility and open new markets, all of which can raise sales and employment. We study empirically this impact for Spain, a country that joined the EEC in 1986, becoming a low-cost location for many firms, and after twenty-years of development it is now experiencing a strong increase of outsourcing to Central and Eastern European countries with a specific analysis of the case of Turkey. The trade relationship between Turkey and Spain has been reinforced significantly in the last years and has concentrated in a few sectors, with important relative increase in imports from particular sectors as Agriculture, Textile, Leather goods, <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> footwear, <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> cork and wood, <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> articles of paper and cardboard, <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> and plastic <b>products...</b>|$|R

Thereafter, for each image binarization operation is applied. To highlight the contours of the surface damage of the sample is used Canny algorithm. The detected contours are converted into an array of pixels. However, a crack may be allocated to several contours. Therefore, an algorithm was developed by combining contours criterion of minimum distance between them.
