40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{approach}} for the generation of radially and azimuthally polarized light employing a fiber <b>mode</b> <b>filter.</b> The <b>mode</b> <b>filter</b> consists of a Fiber Bragg Grating written in a strongly guiding fiber with lifted modal degeneracy. These kinds of fibers guide radially and azimuthally polarized modes with non-degenerated, i. e. distinct, effective refractive indexes. The Fiber Bragg Grating reflects light only if the Bragg condition is fulfilled. In case of strongly guiding fibers the radially and azimuthally polarized modes are guided with different effective refractive indices and, consequently, the Bragg condition is fulfilled at different wavelengths. If the reflection bandwidth of the Fiber Bragg Grating is narrow enough, the radially and azimuthally polarized modes are spectrally separated. Thus, with such a <b>mode</b> <b>filter</b> {{it is possible to}} filter the radially or azimuthally polarized mode. This filter is suitable for its integration in a resonator for stable, compact and high polarization purity azimuthally and radially polarized all-fiber oscillators.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{selective}} <b>mode</b> <b>filter</b> inscribed with ultrashort pulses {{directly into a}} few mode large mode area (LMA) fiber. The <b>mode</b> <b>filter</b> consists of two refractive index modifications alongside the fiber core in the cladding. The refractive index modifications, which were of approximately the same order of magnitude as the refractive index difference between core and cladding have been inscribed by nonlinear absorption of femtosecond laser pulses (800 nm wavelength, 120 fs pulse duration). If light is guided in the core, it will interact with the inscribed modifications causing modes to be coupled out of the core. In order to characterize the <b>mode</b> <b>filter,</b> we used a femtosecond inscribed fiber Bragg grating (FBG), which acts as a wavelength and therefore mode selective element in the LMA fiber. Since each mode has different Bragg reflection wavelengths, an FBG in a multimode fiber will exhibit multiple Bragg reflection peaks. In our experiments, we first inscribed the FBG using the phase mask scanning technique. Then the <b>mode</b> <b>filter</b> was inscribed. The reflection spectrum of the FBG was measured in situ during the inscription process using a supercontinuum source.
