The importance of long-term relationships for a business has repeatedly pointed out by many researchers during the 1990 s, who advised that companies need to consider the lifetime value of their customers and to develop strategies for managing customer satisfaction and loyalty in relationships.

40|$|Recently, Korean {{people are}} {{consuming}} seaweeds almost 3. 5 times <b>more</b> now <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> ago. It {{is well known}} that seaweeds contain lots of soluble dietary fiber in addition to micronutrients such as β-carotene, iodine and some bioactive components. Seaweeds are considered to be effective for preventing chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, cancer or constipation. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of seamustard intake on body weight gain, blood glucose level and lipid profiles in rats fed diets with different energy nutrient composition. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (average initial weight 103. 7 g) were divided into groups for two experiments as follows; Control, M 2. 5 & M 5 groups (Exp. I) and M 5, M 10, HCM 5, HCM 10, HFM 5 & HFM 10 groups (Exp. II). The rats were fed diet and water ad libitum for 4 weeks. In general, {{there was no significant difference}} in blood glucose and triglyceride concentration among groups. In Exp. I, serum LDL-cholesterol level of rats fed diet with 5 % seamustard powder (M 5) was significantly lower than that of control group, while HDL-cholesterol level, TC/LDL ratio and weight of adrenal gland were higher. In Exp. II, food intake, body weight gain and EER of high fat diet with 10 % seamustard group (HFM 10) were the lowest among groups. Except gastrocnemius muscle, all organ weights of HFM 10 group were the lowest. Fecal cholesterol excretion and serum LDL-cholesterol concentration of HFM 10 group were the highest, while serum HDL-cholesterol level was the lowest among groups. Interestingly, HDL-cholesterol concentration was the highest in HCM 5 group among groups. From these results, it was suggested that seamustard intake might be more effective for body weight control, but not for improving blood lipid profiles in high fat diet than in high carbohydrate diet...|$|R
