40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study of the}} folding behavior of thin composite materials consisting of carbon fibers embedded in a silicone matrix. The soft matrix allows the fibers to <b>microbuckle</b> without breaking and this acts as a stress relief mechanism during folding, which allows the material to reach very high curvatures. The experiments show a highly non-linear moment vs. curvature relationship, as well as strain softening under cyclic loading. A finite element model has been created to study the micromechanics of the problem.

Both fiber misalignments and material nonlinearity were taken into account in this study. A fiber <b>microbuckling</b> model derived using micromechanics based on the nonlinear behavior of the matrix was extended to include the strain rate effect. The critical <b>microbuckling</b> stress was found to be the same as that in Rosen 2 ̆ 7 s bifurcation analysis except that elastic shear modulus was replaced by the tangent shear modulus of composites. The tangent shear modulus was rate dependent and described using an elastic/viscoplastic constitutive model.

S 2 / 8552 glass/epoxy unidirectional composites with small off-axis angles were tested to failure at various strain rates. For strain rates below 1 /sec, the compression tests were conducted on an MTS machine, while higher strain rate tests were carried out using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. Comparison with experimental data indicated that the dynamic <b>microbuckling</b> model was suitable for prediction of {{compressive strength}}s at different strain rates.

40|$|Multidirectional {{composite}} laminates {{have been}} increasingly used as primary load-bearing structures in many -applications such as aircraft frames, wings, and turbine or wind-mill blades, owing to their excellent weight-to-strength ratios, better environmental resistance, and much improved long-term durability. Such high [...] performance polymer matrix composites typically consist {{of dozens of}} unidirectional plies of ~ 0. 1 mm thick and aligned in different directions. However, because of the highly heterogeneous nature of such materials, they exhibit very complex progressive damage processes which are dominated by the nucleation, propagation, merging, bifurcation of many different systems of small cracks (intraply cracks, delaminations, <b>microbuckle</b> induced kinking, etc) before they eventually grow to a sufficiently large damage zone of structural criticality. In the past, this complex problem has been addressed by various continuum damage mechanics models, which are of phenomenological nature and merely consider the load-bearing loss of the damaged materials, but with no explicit representation of these crack systems. More recently, the need to address such subcritical cracks has been increasingly appreciated because their evolution represents {{a significant portion of}} the structural life and they can facilitate many unexpected early structure failure upon changing of loading or environmental conditions. However, up to date there still lack effective analytical or numerical methods that can faithful predict the evolution of such cracking systems, let along to quantify their effects on structural criticality. The difficulties arise from multiple fronts: (i) a lack of adequate understanding of the damage process zones associated with different types of small cracks; (ii) the in situ critical stress or strain conditions responsible for crack nucleation and propagation; (iii) numerical or analytical platforms that can account for the arbitrary nucleation and propagation of multiple cracks in a way that is consistent to the material failure/damaging descriptions. In this presentation, I shall first review the much improved understandings of how such composite materials fail at subply (microscopic) level under in situ loading, which was enabled only recently by the microscopic computer tomography, X-ray technology. The improved understanding thus allows us to construct realistic material failure descriptions based on the in situ stresses–displacement relations (as appose to the classic global laminar stress–strain relations). I shall then introduce a newly developed numerical platform named augmented finite element method (A-FEM), which can explicitly embed microscopic material failure descriptions (as cohesive failure models) in any structural models. Thus, the formation and propagation of nonlinearly coupled multiple cracks can take place at any locations dictated by the in situ local stresses. We shall demonstrate with several complex laminate systems that the numerical performance of the A-FEM based platform is very effective in dealing with such problems with very high fidelity. More critically, the method can effectively link the evolution of the complex damage processes with structural performance, which represents a big step towards the quantification of subcritical crack growth to final structural criticality...|$|R

Although FRP compos-ites characteristically possess excellent ultimate and fatigue strength when loaded in ten-sion in the fiber direction, compressive properties are typically not as good. This behavior {{is due to the fact}} that while tensile properties are fiber dominated, compressive properties are dependent upon other factors such as matrix modulus and strength, fiber/matrix inter-facial bond strength, and fiber misalignment. An analytical model of fiber <b>microbuckling</b> within a polymer matrix has been developed for the purpose of investigating the micro-mechanical relationships between compressive strength and fiber <b>microbuckling</b> deforma-tion, fiber volume fraction, matrix nonlinearity, interfacial bond strength, and initial fiber curvature. The results for this study provide insight into the micromechamcs governing the uniaxial compressive behavior of FRP composite materials.

The experimental observations and the detailed literature review suggest at least four factors that affected the determination of the strain levels at which fiber <b>microbuckling</b> initiates and thus, partially control the composite's compression strength. The dependent variables studied are the compressive strength of a reduced gage section compression specimen and the compression strength of a compression specimen with two semi-circular edge notches (no opposite free edges) centered along the gage section.

40|$|Most space {{applications}} require deployable structures due to {{the limiting}} size of current launch vehicles. Specifically, payloads in nanosatellites such as CubeSats require very high compaction ratios {{due to the}} very limited space available in this typo of platform. Strain-energy-storing deployable structures can be suitable for these applications, but the curvature to which these structures can be folded {{is limited to the}} elastic range. Thanks to fiber <b>microbuckling,</b> high-strain composite materials can be folded into much higher curvatures without showing significant damage, which makes them suitable for very high compaction deployable structure applications. However, in applications that require carrying loads in compression, fiber <b>microbuckling</b> also dominates the strength of the material. A good understanding of the strength in compression of high-strain composites is then needed to determine how suitable they are for this type of application. The goal of this thesis is to investigate, experimentally and numerically, the <b>microbuckling</b> in compression of high-strain composites. Particularly, the behavior in compression of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced silicone rods (CFRS) is studied. Experimental testing of the compression failure of CFRS rods showed a higher strength in compression than the strength estimated by analytical models, which is unusual in standard polymer composites. This effect, first discovered in the present research, was attributed to the variation in random carbon fiber angles respect to the nominal direction. This is an important effect, as it implies that <b>microbuckling</b> strength might be increased by controlling the fiber angles. With a higher <b>microbuckling</b> strength, high-strain materials could carry loads in compression without reaching <b>microbuckling</b> and therefore be suitable for several space applications. A finite element model was developed to predict the homogenized stiffness of the CFRS, and the homogenization results were used in another finite element model that simulated a homogenized rod under axial compression. A statistical representation of the fiber angles was implemented in the model. The presence of fiber angles increased the longitudinal shear stiffness of the material, resulting in a higher strength in compression. The simulations showed a large increase of the strength in compression for lower values of the standard deviation of the fiber angle, and a slight decrease of strength in compression for lower values of the mean fiber angle. The strength observed in the experiments was achieved with the minimum local angle standard deviation observed in the CFRS rods, whereas the shear stiffness measured in torsion tests was achieved with the overall fiber angle distribution observed in the CFRS rods. High strain composites exhibit good bending capabilities, but they tend to be soft out-of-plane. To achieve a higher out-of-plane stiffness, the concept of dual-matrix composites is introduced. Dual-matrix composites are foldable composites which are soft in the crease regions and stiff elsewhere. Previous attempts to fabricate continuous dual-matrix fiber composite shells had limited performance due to excessive resin flow and matrix mixing. An alternative method, presented in this thesis uses UV-cure silicone and fiberglass to avoid these problems. Preliminary experiments on the effect of folding on the out-of-plane stiffness are presented. An application to a conical log-periodic antenna for CubeSats is proposed, using origami-inspired stowing schemes, that allow a conical dual-matrix composite shell to reach very high compaction ratios. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ceramic {{coatings}} {{have been}} widely used in cutting tools and various machine parts. Even though high strengths have been obtained in most ceramic coatings, it has also been shown that ceramic coatings undergo extensive plastic deformation during scratch and wear tests. Therefore, it is essential to understand the plastic flow and related friction and wear behaviour. Reciprocating multipass wear tests have been carried out on chemical vapor deposition (CVD) TiC coatings. Obvious plastic flow was observed on the rough surface of CVD TiC ceramic coatings in the first sliding, due to the extremely high contact pressure developed on the contact asperities. However, shake down may be quickly reached after several subsequent traverses. In further repeated traverses, the plastic-elastic flow accumulates residual strain energy to the point where cracking, <b>microbuckling,</b> and microflaking may occur along the elastic-plastic interfaces behind the indenter. The new rough surface will appear after the detachment of the heavily strained plate-like wear debris.

This decreased the amount of side support for the fibres and reduced the strain level at which fibre microbuclding occurred. Finally, recent theoretical models were employed to predict the compressive stress-strain response and strength of unidirectional laminates. It was found that although the theoretical models do not exactly predict the compressive strength of the laminate, they are sufficiently accurate for the cases examined...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{in-plane}} longitudinal {{compressive strength}} of continuous fiber-reinforced composites is {{significantly less than}} their tensile strength, a phenomenon that is still not well understood. Dow and Rosen attempted in 1965 to explain this phenomenon through a fiber <b>microbuckling</b> model, in which each fiber was modeled as a beam-on-an-elastic-foundation. The model, however, grossly overestimates the compressive strength; researchers have since focused on introducing factors that reduce the predicted compressive strength to fit experimen-tally observed values. These include initial fiber waviness, fiber and matrix properties, the interfacial strength, and interphase properties. While empirical results have demonstrated the influences {{of some of these}} factors, an analytical model that can accurately predict the strength while taking into account the underlying failure mechanism is still lacking. The present study treats the compressive strength prediction of continuous fiber-reinforced composites using a different approach. Here, the matrix surrounding the fiber is not assumed to be homogeneous, but is divided into a discrete interphase region adjacent to the fiber and bulk matrix phase beyond the interphase. The three-phase model is shown to provide a more accurate prediction of the compressive strength of typical high-performance composites, such as glass and carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy. The present model’s prediction agrees well with the trends shown in the experimental database available in the literature.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of compressive failure in multi-directional composite laminates is modelled by the tunnelling of a microbuckle within the load-bearing axial plies, with concomitant delamination of the neighbouring o-axis plies. The microbuckle tunnels at its tip in a crack-like mode III manner, and the steady state tunnelling stress is estimated by calculating the energy dierence between the upstream unbuckled {{state and the}} downstream buckled state. The downstream state is analysed in detail using a plane strain analysis of a microbuckle with delaminations from its tips. In the downstream 2 D problem, <b>microbuckling</b> of the axial plies {{is represented by the}} generation of an inclined mode II crack, with an associated <b>microbuckling</b> tip toughness and a constant sliding stress across its flanks. The delaminations at the interface between the axial and adjacent o-axis plies are idealised as traction-free mixed-mode interfacial cracks. Predictions of the steady-state tunnelling stress are obtained for an isotropic solid by solving an integral equation and by the finite element method; finite element techniques are then used to solve the tunnelling problem for an orthotropic solid and for a cross-ply laminate. For each case, the tunnelling stress and the delamination crack length are obtained as functions of the ratio of delamination to microbuckle toughness, and of the inclination of the microbuckle band. The tunnelling stress provides a useful lower bound for the compressive strength of a thic...|$|E
