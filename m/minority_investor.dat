40|$|Blockholder {{ownership}} {{may increase}} firm value because of incentive alignment or lower {{it because of}} expropriation of <b>minority</b> <b>investors.</b> Dividend policy provides a way {{to distinguish between the}} two effects since large owners may prefer low dividends if they derive private benefits from controlling firms, while <b>minority</b> <b>investors</b> may prefer high dividends that benefit all shareholders. I examine the relationship between blockholder ownership, dividend policy and firm value in a panel of the largest EU and US/UK companies 1998 - 1998. I find a negative effect of blockholder ownership on firm value in continental Europe, which is particularly strong for firms with high reinvestment rates and high equity-asset ratios. No similar effect is found in the US/UK. Moreover, in continental Europe blockholder ownership has a negative effect on dividend payout ratios. The findings indicate that concentrated ownership leads to a preference for retained earnings, which lowers the exchange value of the firm to <b>minority</b> <b>investors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although private {{contracting}} is {{an alternative}} to legal protection of <b>minority</b> <b>investors</b> little is know about the incentive for controlling owners to provide minority protection. This paper analyses controlling owners incentive to provide non-controlling owners with better protection against self-dealing. Theoretically we analyse the benefits and costs for controlling shareholders to extend tag-along rights to <b>minority</b> <b>investors.</b> Empirically we test the impli-cations of the model using data on equity offerings in Brazil. Consistent with the theoretical predictions {{we find that the}} probability of minority protection is increasing in the controlling owners cash flow stake and in the stake of the firm being offered and it is decreasing in the size of existing minority owners and in the degree of disproportional ownership structure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the influence of controlling shareholder identity over earnings informativeness and to contribute empirically on the advance on {{the understanding of the}} agency conflict between controlling shareholders and <b>minority</b> <b>investors</b> through the lens of value relevance. The research sample considered 104 shares of non-financial firms negotiated on BM&FBovespa from 2011 to 2016. The methodology was conducted through panel data regression analysis. As results, this paper concludes with the following findings: i) the higher the control/vote power of controlling shareholder (ownership concentration) and the lower the stock liquidity, the less informative are the earnings and the greater is the probability of entrenchment and wealth expropriation by controlling shareholders; ii) larger firms and highly leveraged firms have more informative earnings; iii) the stock prices reflect the controlling shareholder identity; iv) Firms controlled by financial institutions, nonfinancial institutions and the government {{are much more likely to}} expropriate <b>minority</b> <b>investors</b> wealth and have less informative earnings; v) family firms are positively priced by the market...|$|R
40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We {{investigate}} how ownership structure, board characteristics, and regional differences {{in law enforcement}} and stock market development affect the conflict of interest between majority and <b>minority</b> <b>investors</b> in Chinese listed firms. For this purpose, we study related-party transactions as well as labor redundancy, and classify firms as either state- or private-controlled. Research Findings/Insights: We find that related-party transactions grow more extensive as the wedge between the controlling shareholder’s control rights and cash flow rights increases. Related-party transactions also rise with voting rights held {{by the government in}} state-controlled firms. Next, the state as controlling shareholder exacerbates labor redundancy. The control rights of the second to tenth largest investors can offset expropriation. Regarding board characteristics, we find that a larger fraction of directors affiliated with the dominant owner enlarges related-party transactions, while large boards also increase labor redundancy in state-controlled firms. We find only weak evidence that higher-quality institutions help to restrain expropriation of <b>minority</b> <b>investors.</b> Theoretical/Academic Implications: In Chinese listed firms, a major conflict of interest arises between majority and <b>minority</b> <b>investors.</b> Also, the state may exercise its control rights to achieve imperative social and political objectives, to the detriment of external investors. Yet, as the stock market valuation and financial performance of state-controlled firms rise with the fraction of shares held by the state, future research should better delineate the conditions under which state ownership is either detrimental or beneficial to firms. Next, the results indicate that governance mechanisms suggested by conventional agency theory are deficient in Chinese listed firms. Future research could therefore establish more clearly when internal and external governance mechanisms are likely to work, thereby also taking into account the identity of the controlling shareholder. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors should be aware that expropriation in Chinese listed firms has specific implications when the state is the controlling owner. Also, at this stage of development, independent directors and external governance mechanisms can hardly protect the best interests of <b>minority</b> <b>investors.</b> Rather, expropriation is counterbalanced when voting rights are concentrated in the hands of other large block holders. Policy makers should work on ownership restructuring, board independence, and institutional quality to better protect minority rights in Chinese listed firms. status: publishe...|$|R
