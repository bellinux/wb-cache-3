25|$|In most <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> {{the shell}} {{is longer than}} it is wide, being {{wedge-shaped}} or asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat nacreous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mussels</b> are {{abundant}} in the low and mid intertidal zone in temperate seas globally. Other species of marine mussel live in tropical intertidal areas, {{but not in the}} same huge numbers as in temperate zones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mussels</b> {{are usually}} found {{clumping}} together on wave-washed rocks, each {{attached to the}} rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against {{the force of the}} waves. At low tide mussels {{in the middle of a}} clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.|$|E
50|$|Mytilaster lineatus is {{a species}} of <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> {{distributed}} in European waters. It is common in Greece, Russia and Ukraine (Mediterranean and Black Seas). It is referred as an introduced species in the Caspian Sea.|$|R
25|$|Freshwater mussels {{are used}} as host animals for the {{cultivation}} of freshwater pearls. Some species of <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> including the Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus), are also cultivated {{as a source of}} food.|$|R
40|$|Mytilus californianus (Mollusca: Bivalvia), the California <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> {{occurs in}} {{intertidal}} populations so derise {{that they are}} referred to as "Mussel beds. " The mussel beds range in physical complexity from structurally simple, essentially mono-layered assemblages, to structurally complex, multi-layered assemblages. The internal environment within the bed varies accordingly. The mussel bed provides either directly or indirectly, habitat, food and shelter for a large community of associated invertebrates. This study examines the relationship between physical complexity of the mussel bed habitat and composition of the associated community...|$|R
25|$|Certain {{species of}} <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> prefer salt marshes or quiet bays, while others thrive in {{pounding}} surf, completely covering wave-washed rocks. Some species have colonized abyssal depths near hydrothermal vents. The South African white mussel exceptionally doesn't bind itself to rocks but burrows into sandy beaches extending two tubes above the sand surface for ingestion {{of food and}} water and exhausting wastes.|$|E
25|$|Both {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} mussels are gonochoristic, with separate {{male and female}} individuals. In <b>marine</b> <b>mussels,</b> fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, {{it is capable of}} moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.|$|E
25|$|In <b>marine</b> <b>mussels,</b> {{the foot}} is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is {{continuous}} with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate {{allowing it to}} remain sessile in areas of high flow. The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as dog whelks, that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.|$|E
40|$|Adhesion {{represents}} a key joining technology and nature {{has been developing}} adhesives for millions of years. These biological adhesives {{can be found in}} all natural habitats, where they perform extraordinary bonding, partly under extreme conditions. For example, the blue <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus edulis is able to adhere to a number of surfaces in sea water: e. g. glass, plastic, metal, wood, and even PTFE. The transfer of these bonding properties to technical and medical adhesives {{represents a}} major challenge, but also could lead to enormous benefits for industrial technology or medical treatment. Although the composition of protein based adhesives, as the ones of <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> are well known currently, the exact principles of the initial interactions with surfaces remains unclear. For the development of new bioinspired adhesives a potential way is the assessment of the adsorption properties of some mussel inspired peptides towards titanium and silica. For evaluating the influence of the essential amino acid DOPA, derivatives of the mussel peptide Mefp- 1 were synthesised by solid phase peptide synthesis. The effect of sequence length and oxidation state was investigated using the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique. This method was supplemented with XPS-analytics. Additionally, the tensile strengths of peptide glued tooth fragments were determined. Furthermore the eligibility of the peptide to perform e. g. with adhesional properties, after it was bioconjugated or immobilised on a surface, were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{advanced}} aids for {{patching up}} people following {{an accident or}} surgery are being developed on a daily basis. Screws, pins, artificial joints, biosoluble sutures, they all form part of the surgeons toolkit. Even simple gluing has become possible. Current types of adhesive are suitable only for external use. Financed by the Dutch science foundation stw, physical chemists Dr. Mieke van der Leeden and Ir. Sander Haemers at the Physical Chemistry Department and the Adhesive Institute of Delft University of Technology, are currently developing a synthetic medical adhesive that {{can also be used}} internally. The idea for the adhesive was provided by the blue <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> Mytilus edulis...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequencies}} of micronuclei induced by ZnCl 2 and detected on the gill tissue of the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus galloprovincialis with different staining techniques (acridine orange, gallocyanin chromallum, Feulgen, Giemsa) were compared. At {{least in the}} used system, the Feulgen and gallocyanin chromallum methods gave a frequency of micronuclei significantly lower than that obtained with the acridine orange and Giemsa techniques. No {{significant difference between the}} frequencies obtained with acridine orange and Giemsa was shown. So, though the acridine orange is surely the method which provides the more reliable data, in environmental screening works the Giemsa technique may be more suitable for its simplicity...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mussels</b> are {{eaten by}} humans, starfish, seabirds, and by {{numerous}} species of predatory marine gastropods {{in the family}} Muricidae, such as the dog whelk, Nucella lapillus.

2500|$|Virtually all metalloenzymes feature metals {{that are}} chelated, usually to {{peptides}} or cofactors and prosthetic groups. [...] Such chelating agents include the porphyrin rings in hemoglobin and chlorophyll. [...] Many microbial species produce water-soluble pigments {{that serve as}} chelating agents, termed siderophores. For example, [...] species of Pseudomonas are known to secrete pyochelin and pyoverdine that bind iron. Enterobactin, produced by E. coli, is the strongest chelating agent known. The <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> use metal chelation esp. Fe3+ chelation with the Dopa residues in mussel foot protein-1 to improve {{the strength of the}} threads that it uses to secure itself to surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Copper uptake and {{accumulation}} by the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus edulis {{were studied}} at different Cu concentrations in chemically defined artificial seawater {{in the presence}} and absence of fulvic acids. Both short-term uptake of Cu by excised mussel gills and Cu accumulation in whole mussels after 24 ?h of exposure decreased {{in the presence of}} fulvic acids compared with their absence at similar dissolved Cu concentrations. Calculations of Cu speciation based on previous measurements of labile Cu by anodic stripping voltammetry demonstrated that Cu uptake and accumulation depended on the concentration of labile Cu, in agreement with the free ion activity model. No evidence of a significant uptake of Cuâ€“fulvic acid complexes was observed...|$|R

The amino acid sequence of this human glutaredoxin (hErGrx) was assembled from tryptic and chymotryptic peptides whose sequences were deduced from collision-induced-dissociation (CID) mass spectra. An adhesive protein, mefp- 3, isolated from the foot of the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> M edulis, presented unique challenges to the determination of the amino acid sequence due to its unusual composition. The complete amino acid sequence of mefp- 3 was finally determined by the application of mass spectrometry to this problem.

40|$|Study of {{the genetic}} basis of gene {{expression}} variation is central to attempts to understand the causes of evolution-ary change. Although there are many transcriptomics studies estimating genetic variance and heritability in model organisms such as humans {{there is a lack}} of equiv-alent proteomics studies. In the present study, the herita-bility underlying egg protein expression was estimated in the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus. We believe this to be the first such measurement of genetic variation for gene expres-sion in eggs of any organism. The study of eggs is impor-tant in evolutionary theory and life history analysis be-cause maternal effects might have profound effects on the rate of evolution of offspring traits. Evidence is pre-sented that the egg proteome varies significantly between individual females and that heritability of protein expres...|$|R

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{was thought}} to be {{inherited}} maternally in animals, although paternal leakage has been reported in mice and Drosophila. Recently, direct evidence of extensive paternal inheritance of mtDNA has been found in the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus. We give evidence that whereas female mussels are homoplasmic for a genome that is transmitted to eggs, male mussels are heteroplasmic for this genome and for a second genome that is transmitted preferentially to sperm. The results provide support for the existence of separate male and female routes of mtDNA inheritance in mussels. The two genomes show a base sequence divergence exceeding 20 % at three protein coding genes, consistent with long term maintenance of the heteroplasmic state. We propose that the two genomes differ in fitness in males and females, possibly as a result of interaction with nuclear genes...|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{strategy to}} improve adhesiveness of biomaterials in wet conditions takes {{inspiration from the}} adhesive features of <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> which reside in the chemical reactivity of catechols. In this work, a catechol-bearing molecule (dopamine) was chemically grafted onto alginate to develop a polysaccharide-based membrane with improved adhesive properties. The dopamine-modified alginates were characterized by NMR, UV spectroscopy and in vitro biocompatibility. Mechanical tests and in vitro adhesion studies pointed out {{the effects of the}} grafted dopamine within the membranes. The release of HA from these resorbable membranes was shown to stimulate fibroblasts activities (in vitro). Finally, a preliminary in vivo test was performed to evaluate the adhesiveness of the membrane on porcine intestine (serosa). Overall, this functionalized membrane was shown to be biocompatible and to possess considerable adhesive properties owing to the presence of dopamine residues grafted on the alginate backbone...|$|R
40|$|The kinetochore-containing {{micronuclei}} induced in CHO cells by clastogenic and aneuploidogenic substances, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or colchicine, were {{distinguished by}} means of a technique based on the use of human CREST antikinetochore antibodies. Both substances induced their expected effects. However, 48 hours after the end of treatment, colchicine and MMC induced a significant increase of CREST- and CREST+ micronuclei, respectively, suggesting an induction of clastogenicity by colchicine and of aneuploidy by MMC. These results were confirmed by the characterisation of the micronuclei induced by the same substances in gill cells of the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> Mytilus, treated in vivo. A cytofluorimetric analysis on the isolated gill of this animal showed that the cell cycle remained unaltered until almost 24 hours after excision. This suggests the possibility of using the isolated gill of Mytilus as a new biological system for laboratory experiments...|$|R
