25|$|Very {{soon after}} the {{accident}} at Moorgate, London Underground changed the operating instructions so that the protecting signal at terminal platforms was held at danger until trains approaching were travelling slowly, or {{had been brought to}} a stop. However, this caused delays and operating problems. In July 1978, approval was given for Moorgate protection, Moorgate Control or TETS (Trains Entering Terminal Stations) to be introduced at all dead-end termini on <b>manually</b> <b>driven</b> lines on the Underground system.|$|E
25|$|Examples of licit {{informal}} economy include street vending, household enterprises, product assembly and packaging, making garlands and embroideries, domestic work, shoe polishing or repair, driving tuk-tuk or manual rickshaws, construction workers or <b>manually</b> <b>driven</b> logistics, and handicrafts production. In some slums, people sort and recycle trash {{of different kinds}} (from household garbage to electronics) for a living – selling either the odd usable goods or stripping broken goods for parts or raw materials. Typically these licit informal economies require the poor to regularly pay a bribe to local police and government officials.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{seating for}} up to four guests in the front cab of the train with the pilot who <b>manually</b> <b>drives</b> each train.

25|$|Under {{automatic}} operation, the on-train computer instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be <b>manually</b> <b>driven</b> at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians. If the whole TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track circuit system. The signals and track circuits only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn case {{of motor}} impairments, {{steering}} a wheelchair {{can become a}} hazardous task. Typically, along corridors, joystick jerks induced by uncontrolled motions are source of wall collisions. This paper describes a vision based assistance solution for safe indoor semi-autonomous navigation purposes. To this aim, the control process {{is based on a}} visual servoing process designed for wall avoidance purposes. As the patient <b>manually</b> <b>drives</b> the wheelchair, a virtual guide is defined to progressively activate an automatic trajectory cor- rection. The proposed solution does not require any knowledge of the environment. Experiments have been conducted over corridors that present different configurations and illumination conditions. Results demonstrate the ability of the system to smoothly and adaptively assist people during their motions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMotor or visual {{impairments}} may prevent a user from steering a wheelchair effectively in indoor environments. In such cases, joystick jerks arising from uncontrolled motions {{may lead to}} collisions with obstacles. We here propose a perceptive shared control system that progressively corrects the trajectory as a user <b>manually</b> <b>drives</b> the wheelchair, {{by means of a}} sensor-based shared control law capable of smoothly avoiding obstacles. This control law is based on a low complex optimization framework validated through simulations and extensive clinical trials. The provided model uses distance information. Therefore, for low-cost considerations, we use ultrasonic sensors to measure the distances around the wheelchair. The solution therefore provides an efficient assistive tool that does not alter the quality of experience perceived by the user, while ensuring his security in hazardous situations...|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} was {{designed}} to allow humans to <b>manually</b> <b>drive</b> an, usually automatic, two wheeled hovercraft.

At the end two where usertested using a simulation (also developed during this thesis) of the said hovercraft set against obstacles similar to those expected to be encountered on its real environment. The two layouts are just slightly apart in performance but numerous issues were found {{that can be used to}} redesign a better control layout.

40|$|International audienceDriving a power {{wheelchair}} is {{a difficult}} and complex visual-cognitive task. As a result, some people with visual and/or cognitive disabilities cannot access {{the benefits of a}} power wheelchair because their impairments prevent them from driving safely. In order to improve their access to mobility, we have previously designed a semi-autonomous assistive wheelchair system which progressively corrects the trajectory as the user <b>manually</b> <b>drives</b> the wheelchair and smoothly avoids obstacles. Developing and testing such systems for wheelchair driving assistance requires a significant amount of material resources and clinician time. With Virtual Reality technology, prototypes can be developed and tested in a risk-free and highly flexible Virtual Environment before equipping and testing a physical prototype. Additionally, users can " virtually " test and train more easily during the development process. In this paper, we introduce a power wheelchair driving simulator allowing the user to navigate with a standard wheelchair in an immersive 3 D Virtual Environment. The simulation framework is designed to be flexible so that we can use different control inputs. In order to validate the framework, we first performed tests on the simulator with able-bodied participants during which the user's Quality of Experience (QoE) was assessed through a set of questionnaires. Results show that the simulator is a promising tool for future works as it generates a good sense of presence and requires rather low cognitive effort from users...|$|R

In this paper we present an example of such automation through a iDiff operator that in a single step returns summarized reasons for drops or increases observed at an aggregated level. We formulate this as a problem of summarizing the difference between two multidimensional arrays of real numbers. We develop a general framework for such summarization and propose a specific formulation for the case of OLAP aggregates. We develop an information theoretic formulation for expressing the reasons that is compact and easy to interpret. We design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that requires only one pass of the data and uses {{a small amount of}} memory independent of the data size. This allows easy integration with existing OLAP products. Our prototype has been tested on the Microsoft OLAP server, DB 2 /UDB and Oracle 8 i. Experiments using the OLAP benchmark demonstrate (1) scalability of our algorithm as the size and dimensionality of the cube increases and (2) feasibility of getting interactive answers with modest hardware resources...|$|R
