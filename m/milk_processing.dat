5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a backseat because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore.

25|$|Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT), {{is a type}} of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> {{where all}} {{bacteria}} are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as the package is not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 1–3 seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just pasteurised. The milk will now keep for up for 6 months if unopened. UHT milk {{does not need to be}} refrigerated until the package is opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. But in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.|$|E

According to him, all of the cheese is monitored, processed, and prepared by hand, but simply {{on a larger scale}} than most artisanal cheesemakers. Unlike most artisan cheeses, Beecher's is made largely with pasteurized milk. Dammeier believes that many people feel raw milk cheeses taste better due to renowned French cheeses, which were historically made of raw milk because the farms were unable to afford pasteurization. [...] "I've probably tasted 150 different cheeses this year, and I'm convinced that raw milk doesn't create more flavor," [...] he said, adding that his cheeses have a more consistent taste from not using raw milk. Nevertheless, Beecher's offers a raw milk version of their Flagship cheese. The cheeses they produce use no artificial ingredients or preservatives. Beecher's typically manufactures up to nine different varieties of cheeses each year, including a combination of their staple brands and various seasonal varieties.|$|E

The first buildings were the [...] (1902), [...] the Model School (1903), and the residence for the Principal (1903), next to the Central Road (today, Ponce de Leon Avenue). Over the years, {{the development of the}} University occurred somewhat spontaneously. In 1908 the architectural firm of Clark, Howe and Homer designed a new façade for the Model School in the California Mission Style. In 1909 a <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> building was constructed in an agricultural area, east of the academic center. Arts and Crafts’ Workshop buildings, a Library and a Gymnasium were projected, as well as the grand stand and the fence (all demolished). In 1912 began the construction for the Memorial Hall (Baldorioty building) and in 1918 buildings for the Law School and the School of Pharmacy were in the works. In 1924 the Chicago [...] firm of urbanists Bennett, Parsons and Frost were contacted to [...] It wasn’t until 1935, with the establishment of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) and the large sum of federal funds that it invested for public works in Puerto Rico, that the partial design and construction of the so-called Plan Parson began. Under the supervision of architect Rafael Carmoega, a group of local architects designed what is known as “el Cuadrángulo” (the Quadrangle). However, from the 1940s onward a new architectural paradigm, which discarded historical vocabularies and incorporated attitudes learned from Germany and from the studio of Frank Lloyd Wright, stemmed from German émigré Henry Klumb. For 20 years Klumb was sole architect for the University of Puerto Rico, designing buildings for the campuses at Río Piedras and Mayagüez until in 1966. At that time chancellor Jaime Benítez assigned the design of the General Studies building to the architectural firm of Toro & Ferrer. Other buildings for the University have been designed by architects Antonio Marqués Carrión (sport facilities, 1971); José Firpi (student residence Torre Norte, 1971); the firm of Reed, Torres, Beauchamp & Marvel (new Education Faculty Building, 1974 and the first expansion to the Faculty of Natural Sciences, 1978); the firm of García & Landray (second expansion the Faculty of Natural Sciences, 1989); GDO Arquitectos (School of Architecture, 2001) and Toro Ferrer (new General Studies building, 2007).|$|E
