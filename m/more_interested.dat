5|$|Although Kennan had {{not been}} {{considered}} for a job by Kennedy's advisers, the president himself offered Kennan the choice of ambassadorship in either Poland or Yugoslavia. Kennan was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in Yugoslavia, so he accepted Kennedy's offer and began his job in Yugoslavia during May 1961.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{was exposed}} to Gestalt {{psychology}} through Gardner Murphy, then a young faculty member at Columbia. He became much <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in Gestalt psychology after meeting and working closely with his adviser at Columbia, Max Wertheimer, {{one of the founders}} of Gestalt psychology. Asch later became close friend with Wertheimer.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, he drew {{inspiration}} from nature, making studies of insects, landscapes, and plants such as lichens, all of which he used as details in his artworks. He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in their mathematical structure.|$|E

5|$|In particular, he forms a close {{friendship}} with archaeologist James Moon (Kenneth Branagh), another veteran, who like Birkin has been emotionally scarred by the war. Moon is {{employed in the}} village under the same bequest, working to uncover a mysterious lost grave, but is <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in discovering the remains of an earlier Saxon church building in the field next to the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|The rumours were correct. In 1845, the MacLean laird {{sold the}} island to the Marquess of Salisbury, who {{converted}} Rùm into an estate for country sports. The Marquis first built a pier at Kinloch, and adjacent limekiln, to help with this process, re-introducing deer, both Red and Fallow. He then passed the land to his son, Viscount Cranbourne, who was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in fishing.|$|E

5|$|When Nasr died in 1098, Usama's father, Majd Al-Deen Abi Salamah Murshed (1068- 1137) {{became the}} emir of Shaizar and the {{surrounding}} cities. However he soon gave up his position to Usama's Uncle (Iz Al-Deen Abi Al-Asaker Sultan Mrdad), Sultan, since Murshid was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in studying religion, writing the Quraan and hunting than matters of politics.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, {{both of whom}} {{he heard}} on the radio and playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan and his friends were <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E

5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|Hesketh enjoyed {{looking after}} the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but {{struggled}} to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord. He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and {{was concerned about the}} fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, Rey Bucanero {{announced}} that he had left Los Guerreros and joined La Peste Negra because Los Guerreros were <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in teaming with Olímpico than him. On December 3 at Sin Piedad 2010 Bucanero defeated Los Invasores leader Mr. Águila in a Lucha de Apuesta match, forcing Mr. Águila to have his orange mohawk shaved off. On January 29, 2011, Bucanero made an appearance for American promotion Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), during the WrestleReunion 5 weekend, in a match, where he was defeated by Mr. Águila.|$|E

5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|John Chrysostom, deacon at Antioch from 381, {{was made}} priest in 386. As a special distinction, his bishop, Flavian, {{decided that he}} should preach in the city's {{principal}} church. Chrysostom's contribution to the literature on Philip and Christianity is a homily on Babylas, a martyr-bishop who died in 253, during the Decian persecution. The treatise was composed about 382, when John was a deacon, and forms part of Chrysostom's corpus of panegyrics. Chrysostom's Babylas confronts an emperor; and, since Chrysostom is <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the bishop than his opponent, the emperor goes unnamed. He has since been identified with Philip.|$|E
5|$|Junior Johnson, {{owner of}} one of the top NASCAR teams, {{approached}} Kulwicki {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 season to try to get him to replace Terry Labonte in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Kulwicki declined, stating that he was <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in running his own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top10 points in a season. In 29races, he had thirteen top10 finishes and onepole position.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Federation, non-Malays were {{generally}} uninvolved in Malayan politics and nationalism, both essentially Malay in nature; being <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> {{in the politics}} of their respective homelands, non-Malays never significantly backed the Malayan Union openly but their silence was a support to it. The AMCJA, though mostly non-Malay, did not represent a large section of the non-Malay communities in Malaya. The lack of interest in or loyalty to Malaya amongst the non-Malays seemed to justify ketuanan Melayu — Malay self-rule.|$|E
5|$|Republican leaders {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian pemuda. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.|$|E
5|$|Russia, Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are {{all members}} of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an {{alternative}} military alliance.
