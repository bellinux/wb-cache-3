On her first Hamburg trip, she carried American comedic actress Florence Shirley and her husband, headed for a European vacation. Cecil Arden, a <b>mezzo-soprano</b> with the Metropolitan Opera, and botanist Otto Warburg sailed on the same trip.|$|E

5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and <b>mezzo-soprano</b> voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, {{and he seems}} to have {{preferred}} his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and <b>mezzo-soprano</b> for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns was {{a pioneer}} in {{recorded}} music. In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the <b>mezzo-soprano</b> Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila, and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Mozart's Requiem was sung {{at the funeral}}; the soloists {{were the}} soprano Jeanne-Anaïs Castellan, the <b>mezzo-soprano</b> Pauline Viardot, the tenor Alexis Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No.4 in E minor and No.6 in B minor were also played. The organist at the funeral was Louis Lefébure-Wély. The funeral {{procession}} to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal <b>mezzo-soprano</b> feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertory}} system {{ensured that}} the comic patter character who performed {{the role of the}} sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the <b>mezzo-soprano</b> soubrette.|$|E
50|$|Conn {{used the}} surplus stock of <b>mezzo-sopranos</b> to teach {{instrument}} repair in Conn's Elkhart workshops. Typically, a Conn instructor would deliberately damage the <b>mezzo-sopranos</b> (e.g. dropping them onto a concrete floor) {{and the students}} would then be tasked with repairing them. The repeated wear and tear of these actions eventually destroyed the saxophones.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the hero}} roles in the operas of Handel and Monteverdi, {{originally}} sung by male castrati, can be successfully sung today by coloratura <b>mezzo-sopranos.</b> Rossini demanded similar qualities for his comic heroines, and Vivaldi wrote roles frequently for this voice as well. Coloratura <b>mezzo-sopranos</b> also often sing lyric-mezzo-soprano roles or soubrette roles.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} recordings of the different versions, especially of the Berlioz adaptation featuring a female Orfeo. The British contralto Kathleen Ferrier and American <b>mezzo-soprano</b> Marilyn Horne were especially notable interpreters. In recent years, recordings and stage productions of the Vienna version of the opera have featured countertenors {{in the role of}} Orpheus. Countertenors Derek Lee Ragin, Jochen Kowalski, René Jacobs, James Bowman, and Michael Chance have recorded Orfeo ed Euridice. The role of Orfeo has also been performed and recorded by tenors and even baritones such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who has made three recordings of the role. Until recent times, most recordings of all versions were cut or altered in some way.|$|E
