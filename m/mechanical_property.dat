5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E

This {{is analogous to}} the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½ħ, or [...] "spin-½". In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{related to}} {{hardness}} is another <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> toughness, {{which is a}} material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 7.5–10 MPa·m1/2. This value is good compared to other ceramic materials, but poor compared to most engineering materials such as engineering alloys, which typically exhibit toughnesses over 100 MPa·m1/2. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting. [...] "Impact toughness" [...] {{is one of the}} main indexes to measure the quality of synthetic industrial diamonds.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the heavily}} scaled {{skin of the}} Longnose gar, some of the {{mechanical}} properties differ from [...] model of describing how eel skin adds movement. The scale row resists longitudinal forces, which unlike eel skin, makes the skin stiffer in the longitudinal direction, providing myomeres with leverage and anchorage for pulling tendons. At low curvatures, {{it appears that the}} dermis is slack on both the concave and convex sides of the body. When the dermis is placed in tension, and resistance to bending is developed, which is referred to as flexural stiffness of the fish skin. The flexural stiffness {{is a result of the}} two dimensional stiffness of fish with heavily scaled skin, such as the longnose gar. This <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> of fish skin is important to the way a fish swims, because this <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> passively stiffens the body, which would otherwise would have been done muscularly. The flexural stiffness of fish skin act in a manner similar to the mechanism by which eel skin acts as an external tendon, however in the case of fish skin, the flexural stiffness acts as a mechanism to decelerate body movement rather than to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
2500|$|According to quantum mechanics, {{electromagnetic}} waves {{can also be}} viewed as streams of particles called photons. [...] When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> of photons called their spin. [...] A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a right hand sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel. Circularly polarized {{electromagnetic waves}} are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand. [...] Linearly polarized waves consist of equal numbers of right and left hand spinning photons, with their phase synchronized so they superpose to give oscillation in a plane.|$|E

Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important <b>mechanical</b> <b>property</b> because they are brittle.

In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal sintering and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability, [...] rather than high strength.|$|E
