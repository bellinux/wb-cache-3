5000|$|In the 1980s, a {{class of}} mass storage device called the {{magneto-optical}} drive became commercially available which used essentially the same technique for writing data to a disk. One advantage of magneto-optic recording over purely magnetic storage {{at that time was}} that the bit size was defined {{by the size of the}} focused laser spot rather than the magnetic field. In 1988, a 5.25-inch <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disk</b> could hold 650 megabytes of data with a roadmap to several gigabytes; a single 5.25" [...] magnetic disk had a capacity of around 100 megabytes.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedComputerized data processing applications have grown {{over the past}} thirty years to a point where they have now become a pervasive influence in our society. As the range of applications has grown, a continuing concern has been the cost and access time of data storage. A wide range of technologies have been investigated to address this problem. The purpose of this thesis is to examine high-volume, on-line storage media of current and emerging technologies and software techniques for supporting these on-line, high capacity storage media. In the first part, we analyze such media as vertical magnetic recording, thin film media, optical data <b>disks,</b> <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disks,</b> bubble and Bernoulli-effect disks. Then, comparisons and evaluations of products and product categories are illustrated. In the second part, we review the modern software technologies for on-line database storage and access.

40|$|A {{multipurpose}} catheter, for magnetocardiographically (MCG) guided intracardiac electrophysiological {{study of}} cardiac arrhythmias (USA Patent N. 5, 056, 517 and EUR Patent N. 0428812), is described. Methods: The catheter's tip features five non-polarizable amagnetic electrodes, arranged {{in such a}} way that two orthogonal or parallel current dipoles can be generated in the patients heart. Alternatively a magnetic dipole can be generated as well. This catheter can be localized by MCG mapping and inverse solution, with a three-dimensional (3 D) accuracy of 10 mm, without the use of fluoroscopy. On the basis of MCG 3 D localization, the catheter is placed, as close as possible to the arrhythmogenic zone. Fine adjustments, until the 3 D co-ordinates of catheter’s tip will fit those generated by the spontaneous arrhythmia, are driven by MCG mapping. The four tip electrodes are used to record simultaneously four monophasic action potentials (MAPs) with a spatial resolution of 4 mm 2. Alternatively 2 MAP under local pacing can be recorded.

40|$|Low mass flying {{heads for}} {{magneto-optic}} recording would yield fast access times. A design concept {{for such a}} head was proposed and computer modeling of its flying characteristics were conducted. Calculations indicated that the head (slider) will follow low frequency undulations the disk (resulting from disk run-out and disk warp) to within one depth of focus of the read/write beam. Thus the illuminating laser spot would be kept in focus {{in the presence of}} low frequency asperities, without the aid of extraneous focusing gear. However, the major advantage of <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disk</b> storage is disk removability. Therefore, the presence of high frequency asperities such as dust particles is quite possible. An active slider which has adjustable flying characteristics was designed in order to meet this high frequency focusing demand without the assistance of conventional electro-magnetic focusing gear. Sliders were micro-machined from silicon, and were actuated both using plate type piezoelectric actuators and bimorph style actuators. Preliminary testing of the devices were conducted to ascertain the feasibility of this design. Acknowledgments I wish to thank my advisor Prof. David N. Lambeth for his support and direction and fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of individually addressable laser diode arrays for multitrack magneto-optic recorders for space stations is discussed. Three multi-element channeled substrate planar (CSP) arrays with output power greater than 30 mW with linear light vs current characteristics and stable single mode spectra were delivered to NASA. These devices {{have been used}} to demonstrate {{for the first time the}} simultaneous recording of eight data tracks on a 14 -inch <b>magneto-optic</b> erasable <b>disk.</b> The yield of these devices is low, mainly due to non-uniformities inherent to the LPE growth that was used to fabricate them. The authors have recently developed the inverted CSP, based on the much more uniform MOCVD growth techniques, and have made low threshold quantum well arrays requiring about three times less current than the CSP to deliver 30 mW CW in a single spatial mode. The inverted CSP is very promising for use in space flight recorder applications...|$|R
40|$|Magneto-optic {{materials}} have attracted large interests {{for more than}} two decades, and <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disks</b> made from rare-earth transition metal alloy films have been commercially available since the late 19802 ̆ 7 s. Transition metal/ferromagnetic multilayer structures were developed in the late 19802 ̆ 7 s and are considered future magneto-optic media for blue lasers. However, even though theoretical calculations for dielectric tensors have been performed to study the physical origins of magneto-optical phenomena in the multilayer structures, very little work has been done to study the dielectric properties of individual layers. ^ In this dissertation, comprehensive dielectric property studies are performed for magnetic multilayer structures, including magnetron sputter deposited Pt/Co, Au/Co, Pd/Co/, Cu/Co, and Pt/Fe. The full dielectric tensor for magnetic layers and interfacial layers in these structures were determined. The most extensive work was done for Pt/Co structures. Also, the full dielectric tensor for the Heusler compound material NiMnSb was determined, and further studied using a phenomenological Lorentz oscillator model. The results were compared to previously published theoretical predictions, and origins of the Kerr response for these materials were discussed. ^ Two steps were needed to determine the full dielectric tensor. First, the uniaxial dielectric functions (diagonal parts of the dielectric tensors) were determined by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, for the magnetic multilayer structures and for the NiMnSb thin film structures. Second, the off-diagonal part of the dielectric tensors for all materials were determined by ex situ spectroscopic magneto-optic analysis. ^ As well as the individual layer optical constants, the individual layer thicknesses on a nanometer scale are very important parameters for magneto-optic studies of multilayer structures. In the work of this dissertation, techniques using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry have been developed to determine these two parameters simultaneously. ^ Reviews of the experimental and theoretical development of magneto-optic multilayer structures and in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry are given in this dissertation. The theoretical basics of ellipsometry, regression analysis, and magneto-optic analysis of dielectric tensors are also reviewed. ^ The experimental results and analysis are summarized in Chapter 3. The detailed experimental results and analysis are presented as Appendices, using the associated referenced articles published during the period of this dissertation work. ...|$|R
40|$|A further {{development}} of a multipurpose catheter, designed to be biomagnetically localizable for magnetocardiographically (MCG) guided intracardiac electrophysiological recordings and ablation of cardiac arrhythmias (USA Patent N. 5, 056, 517 and EUR Patent N. 0428812), is described. Methods: The 7 F (French) catheter's tip features five non-polarizable amagnetic electrodes, arranged {{in such a way}} that, differently connected to external power sources, two orthogonal or parallel current dipoles can be generated in the patients heart. Alternatively a magnetic dipole can be induced as well. This assembly can be localized by MCG mapping and inverse solution, with a three-dimensional (3 D) accuracy of 10 mm, without the use of fluoroscopy. On the basis of preoperative MCG 3 D localization, the catheter can be driven, under fluoroscopic control, {{as close as possible to}} the arrhythmogenic zone. MCG mapping is then performed under pacing, with fine adjustments of the catheter, until the 3 D co-ordinates of its moving tip will fit those generated by the spontaneous arrhythmia. Once reached the area of onset of the arrhythmia the same electrodes are used to record simultaneously four monophasic action potentials (MAP) with a spatial resolution of 4 mm 2. Alternatively two electrodes can be used for local pacing and two for simultaneous MAP recordings. MAP signals are differentially amplified, low-pass filtered at 1 Kh and digitized at the sampling frequency of 4 KHz. All digitized waveforms are simultaneously displayed on the PC monitor and written on hard disk or <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disk.</b> MAP duration at 50...|$|E
40|$|A {{low cost}} byte error rate testing system for 90 mm {{magneto-optic}} (MO) disks had been developed. In {{order to achieve}} low cost and to perform the testing under realistic operating conditions, commercial <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disk</b> drives were used instead of high-priced, specialized disk tester. An IBM compatible 486 -DX 33 PC {{was used as the}} controller. The design goal of the testing system is to find the best cost/performance system configuration. A model was developed to predict the testing system performance based on the DMA data rate, SCSI bus data rate, MO drive data rate, access time, processor speed, and the number of sectors, N, involved in each readlwrite operation. Three configurations were studied: (1) only one MO drive; (2) two MO drives are connected to PC through separate SCSI host adaptor; and (3) two MO drives connected to PC through one SCSI host adaptor in daisy-chain manner. The testing time of a disk varies from 40 mm. to 24 mm. when N is varied from 20 to 109. These testing times include the 10 mm. of formatting time which is independent of N. The average access time of the MO disk was found to depend on the number of sectors involved in each read/write operation. Also, the measured access time is always lower than the specified 40 msec. These two phenomena {{can be explained by the}} smaller distance that the optical head needed to travel during the byte error rate testing. Based on the measured access time, a refined model was used to predict the optimal costlperformance configuration. A system with 6 or 7 MO disk drives connected to a PC was found to have the best cost/performance ratio. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} the influence of ultrasonic carotid plaque morphology on the incidence of ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms (IHS). Design:Cross-sectional study. Materials:A consecutive series of 80 patients (96 plaques) with more than 50 % ICA stenosis was studied. Methods:B mode ultrasonic images were captured and transferred to a computer on <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>disk</b> and standardised using linear scaling so that adventitia would have a grey scale median (GSM) value of 185 – 195 and blood 0 – 5. The GSM and the percentage of echolucent pixels (PEP) in plaques were determined to measure echodensity. Homogeneity, entropy, and contrast were also determined to measure spatial distribution (heterogeneity) of grey shades in each plaque. Each measurement was correlated to presence or absence of IHS. Results:Twenty-five plaques were associated with IHS and 71 plaques were asymptomatic. In symptomatic plaques the mean of GSM was 23 and the mean of PEP was 70 %, compared to 38 and 55 % respectively in asymptomatic plaques (p= 0. 02; Wilcoxon test). Sixty per cent of symptomatic plaques were associated with a homogeneity, entropy, and contrast values of > 0. 2, < 2. 95, < 150 respectively as compared to 40 % in asymptomatic plaques. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the GSM and the PEP were the most significant variables (p= 0. 001) that are related to presence or absence of IHS. Conclusion:This study indicates that computer aided analysis of ultrasonic B mode features of carotid plaques could identify a potentially high-risk subgroup (patients with IHS). A GSM less than 40 or PEP greater than 50 % is a good predictor of IHS related to carotid plaques. The fact that these measurements are operator independent and performed after image standardisation should encourage their use in multicentre clinical trials where different operators and equipment are used...|$|E
