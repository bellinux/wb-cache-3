40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2008 renewed interest around the finance-nexus inequality, when some, like Rajan (2010), pointed at growing inequality as the <b>main</b> <b>determinant</b> {{of the credit}} bubble. Various, intertwined influences underlie the two-way relationship between inequality and finance. The literature finds evidence of a positive causal relationship from inequality to credit, but cofounding factors are also certainly at play.

30|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{examined}} O 2 and CO 2 exchange during vv-ECMO for respiratory failure [5]. Circuit blood flow was the <b>main</b> <b>determinant</b> of arterial oxygenation, while the sweep gas flow through the oxygenator was the <b>main</b> <b>determinant</b> of CO 2 elimination. While clinical studies are important in exploring vv-ECMO physiology, mathematical modelling is an essential tool to extend understanding of physiological systems [6]. It enables study of dynamic scenarios that cannot be examined in clinical studies due to ethical considerations, the inability to isolate the effects of changing a single parameter due to reflex responses and the logistics of clinical studies in {{a limited number of}} patients.|$|R

We use university courses data from the Sample Questionnaire of the 2010 Census. Our main conclusion is that while education may be important to explain total inequality, {{there is no evidence that}} mass education is a major factor explaining the differences between the rich and the rest of the population. Not even elite education can be assumed to be a <b>main</b> <b>determinant</b> of the current levels of affluence. Consequently, an important part of total inequality cannot be reduced by educational policies...|$|R
