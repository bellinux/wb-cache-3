50|$|As {{resistance}} to disruption across stimulus contexts {{is analogous to}} the inertial mass of a moving object, behavioral <b>momentum</b> <b>theory</b> also suggests that preference in concurrent-chains procedures for one stimulus context over another {{is analogous to the}} gravitational attraction of two bodies (see Nevin & Grace, 2000). In concurrent-chains procedures, responding on the concurrently available initial links provides access to one of two mutually exclusive stimulus contexts called terminal links. As with multiple schedules, independent schedules of reinforcement can function in each terminal-link context. The relative allocation of responding across the two initial links indicates the extent to which an organism prefers one terminal-link context over the other. Moreover, behavioral <b>momentum</b> <b>theory</b> posits that preference provides a measure of the relative conditioned-reinforcing value of the two terminal-link contexts, as described by the contextual-choice model (Grace, 1994).|$|E
5000|$|A {{development}} came in {{the form}} of Froude's blade element <b>momentum</b> <b>theory</b> (1878), later refined by Glauert (1926).

In blade element <b>momentum</b> <b>theory,</b> angular momentum is included in the model, meaning that the wake (the air after interaction with the rotor) has angular momentum. That is, the air begins to rotate about the z-axis immediately upon interaction with the rotor (see diagram below). Angular momentum must be taken into account since the rotor, which is the device that extracts the energy from the wind, is rotating as a result of the interaction with the wind.|$|E

For {{the description of the}} near-critical-scattering pattern, the advantages and limits of various models and theories are compared and discussed: geometrical optics, physical optics approximation, the Lorenz-Mie and the complex angular <b>momentum</b> <b>theories.</b> Numerical investigations show that the statistical properties of a cloud of bubbles: mean refractive index, mean and standard deviation of the size distribution, have a strong influence on the global angular position, the angular spreading and the amplitude contrast of the near-critical-scattering pattern respectively. This behaviour allows developing a simple method to inverse the scattering pattern. Preliminary experimental results confirm the great potentialities of the proposed technique...|$|R

50|$|The {{analysis}} {{is focused on}} comparing the maximum power extraction modes and nothing else. Accordingly, several idealizations are made to simplify the analysis, further considerations are required to apply this analysis to real turbines. For example, in this comparison the effects of axial <b>momentum</b> <b>theory</b> are ignored. Axial <b>momentum</b> <b>theory</b> demonstrates how the wind turbine imparts an influence on the wind which in-turn decelerates the flow and limits the maximum power. For more details see Betz's law. Since this effect {{is the same for}} both lift and drag-based machines it can be ignored for comparison purposes. The topology of the machine can introduce additional losses, for example trailing vorticity in horizontal axis machines degrade the performance at the tip. Typically these losses are minor and can be ignored in this analysis (for example tip loss effects can be reduced with using high aspect-ratio blades).|$|E
5000|$|Blade element theory (BET) is a {{mathematical}} process originally designed by William Froude (1878), David W. Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki {{to determine the}} behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces {{on each of these}} small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with the <b>momentum</b> <b>theory</b> to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk (for further details see Blade Element <b>Momentum</b> <b>Theory).</b> At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed: ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, several {{theories}} were developed.

50|$|The {{subscripts}} {{indicate the}} different stimulus contexts. Thus, Equation 2 states that relative {{resistance to change}} is a power function of the relative rate of reinforcement across stimulus contexts, with the a parameter indicating sensitivity to relative reinforcement rate. Consistent with behavioral <b>momentum</b> <b>theory,</b> resistance to disruption often {{has been found to}} be greater in stimulus contexts that signal higher rates or magnitudes of reinforcement (see Nevin, 1992, for a review). Studies that add response-independent (i.e., free) reinforcement to one stimulus context strongly support the theory that changes in response strength are determined by stimulus-reinforcer relations and are independent of response-reinforcer relations. For instance, Nevin, Tota, Torquato, and Shull (1990) had pigeons pecking lighted disks on separate variable-interval 60-s schedules of intermittent food reinforcement across two components of a multiple schedule. Additional free reinforcers were presented every 15 or 30 s on average when the disk was red, but not when the disk was green. Thus, the response-reinforcer relation was degraded when the disk was red because each reinforcer was not immediately preceded by a response. Consistent with the matching law, response rates were lower in the red context than in the green context. However, the stimulus-reinforcer relation was enhanced in the red context because the overall rate of food presentation was greater. Consistent with behavioral <b>momentum</b> <b>theory,</b> resistance to presession feeding (satiation) and discontinuing reinforcement in both contexts (extinction) was greater in the red context. Similar results have been found when reinforcers are added to a context by reinforcing an alternative response.|$|E
