Fine had been suspected of smoking marijuana in his dorm, but wasn't charged even though he appeared to be high. Mayben had been cited for speeding and possession of marijuana that he said belonged to Fine. Most seriously, Rivera, Alvin, Crosby and Chandler were suspected of stealing another student's check card and using it to buy several items. The last incident was forwarded to the Broome County district attorney; the investigation is still pending as of October 2010.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the Great Depression and {{austerity}} measures put in place at that time, ŽNR pressed for relief programs that provided assistance to the unemployed, rather than the <b>mass</b> <b>dismissal</b> of women workers. The women also worked for assistance programs for the disabled, illegitimate children and orphans, a juvenile court system, protections for women prisoners, and a comprehensive reform of unemployment schemes, specifically {{for the establishment of a}} women's unemployment fund. When the Nazi occupation began in 1938, women lost ground. Implementation of programs outlawing all political parties except the state-sponsored party, which women could not join, effectively silenced the ŽNR's ability to engage politically. State-sponsored paternalism ensured that the women's choices were curtailed and President Emil Hácha took over the appointment of the women who were to serve on the ŽNR board, some of whom were not members of the organization. The intent was to subvert the concerns of women from women's issues and point them toward state-approved activities which would benefit the state. in 1942, the organization was outlawed.|$|E

40|$|The {{fact that}} 8. 5 million British women {{obtained}} {{the right to}} vote {{at the end of the}} First World War has often been attributed to women’s war work and presented as a kind of reward for services rendered to the nation. Such an opinion, however, is difficult to maintain. While some people may have changed their view of the value of women when confronted with their participation in the war effort, prejudice certainly did not disappear as quickly as both the press and politicians would have liked people to believe – mainly for propaganda purposes. Besides, many elements contradict the idea of the vote as a reward: the <b>mass</b> <b>dismissal</b> of women workers at the end of the war and the volte-face of the press in the following years, the age restriction imposed by the Representation of the People Act that left most women war-workers out of the electorate because they were under 30, or again the reluctance of the government to include women in an electoral reform made necessary to allow soldiers to vote. For one should not forget that the electoral reform of 1918 was never meant for women and that women’s suffrage was, in fact, the only measure in the whole bill not to be approved unanimously...|$|E
40|$|This Note {{analyzes}} the major substantive distinctions between WARN and the Directive and recommends that the United States supplement its legislation {{to raise it}} {{to the level of}} its European counterpart. Part I discusses the history leading to the adoption of the Directive, as well as the structure and scope of its various articles, and reviews the case law interpreting the Directive. Part II describes the economic background that prompted the passage of WARN. It then details the relevant sections of WARN and illustrates how U. S. courts have interpreted these sections. Part III compares the effectiveness of the two pieces of legislation within their respective societies. This Note concludes that WARN, unlike the Directive, inadequately protects employees from unannounced <b>mass</b> <b>dismissals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using firm-level and {{individual}} panel data from 2008 - 2009, the paper looks at how Hungarian firms combined employment reduction with "softer" measures like short-work and wage cuts, {{in response to}} the crisis. The data suggest that the wage distribution remained practically unchanged while hours reductions did not extend beyond the scope of a government-supported job retention scheme (requiring that the subsidized workers are reclassified as part-timers). In the private sector, the burden of adjustment fell entirely on employment. Variations in the changes of employment are studied using firm-level longitudinal data and controlling for the changes in the composition of the workforce. The dominance of adjustment on the extensive margin is explained, among others, by the lack of institutions encouraging soft adjustment, minimum wage regulations, and the fact that firms brought hiring to a halt rather than engaging in <b>mass</b> <b>dismissals...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{referendum}} {{was called}} in April 1975 after the renegotiation was formally concluded. Since Prime Minister Harold Wilson's cabinet was split between supporters and opponents of the Common Market, and since members of each side held their views strongly, he made the decision, unprecedented outside coalition government, to suspend the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility. Cabinet members {{would be allowed to}} publicly campaign against each other. In total, seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EC membership. Wilson's solution was that ministers speaking from the despatch box would reflect government policy, i.e. support for EC membership, but that they would be allowed to speak freely otherwise. This compromise avoided <b>mass</b> <b>dismissals</b> of Cabinet ministers, with only Eric Heffer among all government ministers being obliged to resign, because of his speaking against EC membership in the House of Commons.|$|R

No sooner are there apparent signs of an economic upswing than these are counteracted by reports of enterprises relocating production operations to cheaper sites abroad, or of <b>mass</b> <b>dismissals</b> of staff. Germany's Federal Ministry for Education, Science and Technology (BMBF) recognised {{at an early stage}} that, in the face of fundamental changes in the industrial environment, purely externaladjustments are not sufficient in order to maintain or increase thecompetitiveness of German business enterprises in turbulent international markets.

40|$|During {{the last}} {{economic}} crisis {{the level of}} employment in Germany has not only decreased, but even increased in comparison to many European countries. This unexpected development on the labour market has to be assigned to the companies’ adjustment strategies that have been implemented {{with the introduction of}} internal and external flexibility in the arrays of employment and working time. This approach was based on retaining the present personnel on one hand and on reduction of working time on the other. In particular quick and pertinent decisions on the application of the instruments of internal flexibility allowed avoiding <b>mass</b> <b>dismissals.</b> As a consequence a rapid increase of unemployment could be prevented. Especially, the decision on the introduction of short-time work and the use of individual flextime wage records contributed mainly to this positive development. In this case, success has indeed many fathers because it has been the result not only of the intervening politics of the state, but also the cooperation of employers with the workers councils. From today’s point of view it is difficult to judge so far whether the cooperation was intended in this kind of way, but nevertheless this new model of successful cooperation is an important starting point in the development of effective instruments of countercyclical labour market politics. The elaboration presented in this article tends to the confirmation of the thesis, that one of these instruments in Germany are the individual flextime wage records...|$|R

The Fascist regime led by Benito Mussolini, fearing a credit crunch with subsequent <b>mass</b> <b>dismissals</b> and a wave of social unrest, started to take over the banks' stakes in large industrial companies (such as steel, weapons and chemicals). At the same time, Mussolini tried to inject capital into failing businesses. Although initially conceived as a temporary measure, IRI continued to operate throughout the period of the Fascist regime and well beyond. Although IRI was not intended to carry out real nationalizations, it became the de facto owner and operator {{of a large number of}} major banks and companies. By January 1934, the IRI reported that it controlled “48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy,” and a few months later acquired the capital of the banks themselves, prompting Mussolini to declare on May 26, 1934 to Italy’s Chamber of Deputies that “Three-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state.” [...] By 1939 the IRI and other government agencies “controlled over four-fifths of Italy’s shipping and shipbuilding, three-quarters of its pig iron production and almost half that of steel.” [...] Political Historian Martin Blinkhorn noted that “This level of state intervention greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin’s Russia.” ...|$|R

50|$|Political {{concerns}} {{were at least}} an important as socio-economic ones in the plan's consideration. The dictatorship installed in 1966 had been repressive of dissent from its earliest days, ordering <b>mass</b> detentions and <b>dismissals</b> of university faculty and intervention against left-wing trade unions. These policies led to spiraling labor and student unrest, and by 1969, riots such as the Rosariazo and the Cordobazo. These incidents bolstered Taquini's call for decentralizing the strained system, and his plan gained support from State Intelligence, whose reports confirmed that crowded campuses and the long distances from home endured by most university students were contributing to tensions.|$|R
