40|$|A cw-pumped and mode-locked {{solid state}} laser emits an endless pulse {{sequence}} with pulse duration of about 50 - 100 ps and pulse intervals of about 10 ns. A pulse sequence of 300 ns is formed by the optional use of Q-switching. The largest pulse of this pulse sequence reaches a peak power of 2 MW. Power densities {{in the range of}} 1010 [...] 1012 W/cm 2 are available by suitable focusing. Such a laser system has been first used for precision machining. Because of the high power density non-linear effects allow the machining of transparent materials. The temporal and spatial formation of a laser induced plasma in the case of surface and sub-surface focusing has been investigated by a special high speed framing microscope. It consists of four electronic high speed cameras coupled with a long distance microscope via image splitter. The sub-surface focusing regime has been applied to anti-counterfeiting or decorative 2 d and 3 d-marking. The surface focusing regime (micro laser plasma sputtering) has been applied to pixel based <b>micro</b> <b>marking</b> of glass surfaces, creating of special scattering surfaces and non-slip finishing of glass flooring.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between tooth of living species and nutrition {{is so important}} for anthropologic researches that, it {{is among the most}} considered issues in almost all the researches that have been made about these topics. Tooth, as being {{one of the most significant}} materials that give information about diet, environmental relationships and cultural structure, has been a constant research topic. It has been proved with the researches that, the food stuffs, which living species consumed, have a fundamental role on tooth wear. The recently recognized <b>micro</b> <b>marks</b> on occlusal are also evaluated carefully as well as the macro wears, which are defined as the apparent wears on tooth enamel. These <b>micro</b> <b>marks</b> have several characteristics about the ingredients, hardness, size and chewing force of the nutrients. In this regard, the tooth samples of Agora of Smyrna, Kyzikos, Minnetp I nar I and Güllüdere skeletons that lived in Anatolia — also constituted the sample of this research — have been investigated and the diet of these societies has been examined depending upon the <b>micro</b> <b>marks</b> on the teeth of these societies’ people. Firstly, the diet of these societies has been investigated by examining micro tooth wears. Then, the relationship of these societies has been studied. By examining micro tooth wears of these societies, it has been discussed that whether the factors of age, sex, and facet are effective or not on <b>micro</b> wear <b>marks.</b> As a result of this study, it has been observed that societies that lived in different areas have different diets; and <b>micro</b> <b>marks</b> on teeth are significant indicators of living spaces, subsistence economies and life styles of the societies. </div...|$|R

40|$|Determining age is an {{important}} step when assessing growth, mortality, and yield of cultivated and wild populations, but studies linking shell growth marks in the pearl oyster Pteria sterna with the age of individuals are lacking. Thirty juveniles (20. 0 ± 1. 2 mm shell height), collected from a winter spat fall, were marked with the fluorochrome calcein and kept in the field in culture containers. After day 16, the juveniles were cleaned and their shells cut along the sagittal axis to determine periodicity of micro growth bands formed in the inner shell layers and to estimate age. During this trial, fluorescent calcein marking succeeded in individuals larger than 20 mm shell height; these formed an average of 15 micro growth bands over the 16 days, representing 1 band per day. The marker created a wide fluorescent band containing three <b>micro</b> growth <b>marks,</b> suggesting that calcein was incorporated into the shell over the first three days. The use of calcein was found to be an accurate method for validating the micro growth band frequency of formation in P. sterna juveniles, which in turn can help to estimate age...|$|R
40|$|Developing countries, where malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} diseases, still rely on traditional medicine as a source for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, six selected plants (Acalypha fruticosa, Azadirachta indica, Cissus rotundifolia, Echium rauwalfii, Dendrosicyos socotrana and Boswellia elongata) commonly used in Yemen by traditional healers for the treatment of malaria as well as other diseases, were collected from different localities of Yemen, dried and extracted with methanol and water successfully. The antiplasmodial activity of the extracts was evaluated against fresh clinical isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. The selectivity parameters to evaluate the efficacy of these medicinal plants were measured by in vitro <b>micro</b> test (<b>Mark</b> III) according to World Health Organization (WHO) 1996 & WHO 2001 protocols of antimalarial drug tests. Among the investigated 12 extracts, three were found to have significant antiplasmodial activity with IC 50 values less than 4 µg/ml, namely the water extracts of A. fruticosa, A. indica and D. socotrana. Six extracts showed moderate activity with IC 50 values ranging from 10 to 30 µg/ml and three appeared to be inactive with IC 50 values more than 30 µg/ml. In addition, preliminary phytochemical screening of the methanolic and aqueous extracts indicated the presence of saponins, tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, polysaccharides and peptides...|$|R
40|$|The {{light weight}} {{property}} {{as well as}} high corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy has increased their demand especially in automobile industries. Aluminium alloy {{as a matter of}} fact has a low melting point and high ductility that severely adhere to the cutting tool surface and cause deterioration of chip evacuation. This problem often resulting in tools breakage. In this paper, in order to impart functions of anti-adhesion, we propose a technique by controlling the grinding <b>marks</b> <b>micro</b> texture on the tool surface by using the blast polishing treatment without any coating technologies. The results show that the tool which underwent polishing treatment reduces the cutting force as well as the aluminium adherence during the initial cutting process, and become worst as the process cutting continues. These results indicate that grinding mark texture improves the anti-adhesion by reducing the contact area during cutting and provide storage for the lubricant. In addition, too much polishing on the tool surface may remove these textures and resultantly worsen the tool performance...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2), a [*]∼[*]  600  kyr episode {{close to}} the Cenomanian–Turonian {{boundary}} (ca.   94  Ma), is characterized by relatively widespread marine anoxia and ranks amongst the warmest intervals of the Phanerozoic. The early stages of OAE 2 are, however, marked by an episode of widespread transient cooling and bottom water oxygenation: the Plenus Cold Event. This cold spell {{has been linked to}} a decline in atmospheric p CO 2, resulting from enhanced global organic carbon burial. To investigate the response of phytoplankton to this marked and rapid climate shift we examined the biogeographical response of dinoflagellates to the Plenus Cold Event. Our study is based on a newly generated geochemical and palynological data set from a high-latitude Northern Hemisphere site, Pratts Landing (western Alberta, Canada). We combine these data with a semi-quantitative global compilation of the stratigraphic distribution of dinoflagellate cyst taxa. The data show that dinoflagellate cysts grouped in the Cyclonephelium compactum–membraniphorum morphological plexus migrated from high to mid-latitudes during the Plenus Cold Event, making it the sole widely found (<b>micro)</b> fossil to <b>mark</b> this cold spell. In addition to earlier reports from regional metazoan migrations during the Plenus Cold Event, our findings illustrate the effect of rapid climate change on the global biogeographical dispersion of phytoplankton...|$|R
40|$|Background: Patient {{involvement}} {{in health care}} decision making {{is part of a}} wider trend towards a more bottomup approach to service planning and provision, and patient experience is increasingly conceptualized as a core dimension of health care quality. The aim of this multi-level study is two-fold: 1) to describe and analyze how governmental organizations expect acute hospitals to incorporate patient involvement and patient experiences into their quality improvement (QI) efforts and 2) to analyze how patient involvement and patient experiences are used by hospitals to try {{to improve the quality of}} care they provide. Methods: This multi-level case study combines analysis of national policy documents and regulations at the macro level with semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation of key meetings and shadowing of staff at the meso and micro levels in two purposively sampled Norwegian hospitals. Fieldwork at the meso and micro levels was undertaken over a 12 -month period (2011 – 2012). Results: Governmental documents and regulations at the macro level demonstrated wide-ranging expectations for the integration of patient involvement and patient experiences in QI work in hospitals. The expectations span from systematic collection of patients’ and family members’ experiences for the purpose of improving service quality through establishing patient-oriented arenas for ongoing collaboration with staff to the support of individual {{involvement in}} decision making. However, the extent of involvement of patients and application of patient experiences in QI work was limited at both hospitals. Even though patient involvement was gaining prominence at the meso level − and to a lesser extent at the micro level − relevant tools for measuring and using patient experiences in QI work were lacking, and available measures of patient experience were not being used meaningfully or systematically. Conclusions: The relative lack of expertise in Norwegian hospitals of adapting and implementing tools and methods for improving patient involvement and patient experiences at the meso and <b>micro</b> levels <b>mark</b> a need for health care policymakers and hospital leaders to learn from experiences of other industries and countries that have successfully integrated user experiences into QI work. Hospital managers need to design and implement wider strategies to help their staff members recognize and value the contribution that patient involvement and patient experiences can make to the improvement of healthcare quality. </p...|$|R
40|$|In chapter 1 a short {{account of}} raining and {{recovery}} of diamonds is given. Different properties of diamonds are also mentioned briefly. The various theories of crystal growth {{are described in}} short in chapter 2. Chapter 3 deals briefly with the cutting and shaping ofdiamonds. A diamond, when suitably divided may be shaped as desired. Cleaving and sawing which are two different methods for dividing large stones, are described. The shaping of a diamond is achieved in two ways: a) bruting, and b) grinding and polishing. These are also given briefly. All the experimental techniques employed {{during the course of}} the present work are given in chapter 4. It has been emphasized that before making any observations, the specimens should be thoroughly cleaned. This, undoubtedly, was achieved by ultrasonics. Different methods were tried for making a suitable replica for use in an electron microscope. The technique which was suitable of all is given in detail. Chapter 5 deals with the etching and dissolution. In addition to a cursory survey of the etching and recent developments in general, the existing information on the etching of diamond surfaces is also surveyed. It has been argued once again, in chapter 6, that trigons are due to the growth. For the first time, a systematic study of the etching of synthetic diamond surfaces has been reported in chapter 7 and theresult is compared with the etching of natural micro diamond surfaces. <b>Micro</b> percussion <b>marks</b> found on sawn, polished and cleaved diamond surfaces are described in chapter 8. Their presence is attributed to the occurrence of micro cleavages in a direction parallel to the dodecahedron planes. It is shown in chapter 9 that there is a high degree of resemblance between the etch patterns on matched cleavage faces. On a few cleavage surfaces triangular features were observed, and a possible explanation is given for their occurrence. The etch patterns on different polished dodecahedron sections, given in chapter 10, reveal a sectional history of the growth of the diamond. It has been argued that diamonds have a laminated structure. Evidence has been found which shows that diamonds, most likely, grow around a core. It is also shown that many diamonds are, in fact, very inhomogeneous. Calculations of the density of defects were made on different diamond surfaces andthey were in agreement. The density of defects, on one surface, in type I material was in excess of 4. 6 x 10 5 per mm. 2 and in type II material it was less than 8 x 10 3 per mm. 2. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{elements of}} what is known today as Outcome-Based Education are clearly embodied in numerous familiar models of learning, assessment, and credentialing in the non-education world that, in some cases, are many centuries old. In virtually all of these models, successful outcome performance is the clear/fixed/pre-determined/known/constant factor in the equation, and time is the flexible/variable/adaptable factor. In formal education, however, exactly the opposite pattern exists: time is the clear/fixed/pre-determined/known/ constant factor, and learning successes the flexible/variable/adaptable factor. This makes “authentic” OBE implementation extremely difficult for modern education systems to implement because they are fundamentally Time-Based – defined, organized, and driven by the calendar, schedule, and clock – not Outcome-Based as some profess. South Africa is no exception to this rule – which made its enthusiastic embracing of OBE in 1997 problematic from the start. In explaining the core fundamentals of the OBE concept and how those fundamentals evolved(particularly in North America) prior to 1997, this paper makes clear that South Africa’s Curriculum 2005 initiative missed the OBE mark on almost every essential count: 1) not having a clear, compelling, and operational framework of “Exit Outcomes” on which to ground the reform and the curricular changes which drove it; 2) making no reference, either in theory or practice, to OBE’s Four Operating Principles – which enable modern day educators to get as close to “real “implementation as the Time-Based paradigm of education allows; 3) missing the mark significantly on understanding and implementing what Outcomes are – culminating demonstrations of learning– the multiple forms they take, and the multiple ways in which they can be designed and assessed; 4) bogging down in <b>micro</b> content, assessments, <b>marking,</b> and record-keeping – which advanced BE implementers warn strongly against; 5) lacking the future-focused grounding of OBE designs that are legitimately called “transformational;” and 6) falling into the familiar pattern of calling its “CBO” thinking and practices “OBE. ”The latter relates to an almost universal constellation of practices that make educational systems virtually unchangeable from an OBE perspective: Curriculum Based Outcomes, Content Bound Objectives, Calendar Based Opportunities, Cellular Based Organization, Contest Biased Orientations, Convenience Based Operations, and Convention Bound Obsolescence. Unfortunately, Curriculum 2005 and its key advocates appeared to take these seven CBO’s as givens, which made their continuous reference to OBE incongruous at best. Consequently, the paper argues that, had South Africa’s key educational policy makers in 1997, and since, taken the time to understand the six key points above, they {{would have been able to}} make a more constructive choice about the educational reforms they sought to bring about. First, recognizing these major disparities between their Curriculum 2005 strategies and the fundamentals of genuine OBE, they could have chosen to bring C 2005 more strongly into alignment with OBE and modified their initial course of action considerably. Or, recognizing these major disparities, they could have chosen to drop the OBE label altogether and thereby reduced or avoided a lot of the confusion generated by implying that Curriculum 2005 required significant changes in familiar practice. For example, by maintaining the very “non-OBE” Matric and annual examination systems that had always been in place, the government kept everyone locked into traditional/conventional modes of thinking about learning, curriculum, achievement, assessment, and qualifications. Conclusion: South Africa should stop referring to OBE in any form. OBE never existed in 1997, and has only faded farther from the scene as C 2005 was replaced by the Revised National Curriculum Statement. The real challenge facing educators is how to implement educational practices that are sound and make significant differences in the lives of ALL South African learners. </p...|$|R
