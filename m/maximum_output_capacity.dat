40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of most of}} power plants is to inject power {{as much as possible}} into the grid from the power plants. However, the transmission system may restrain the output capability of the power plant, especially, if the power plant is located in an area of non-expandable transmission system. In this situation, any disturbance in the nearby transmission system may force the plant to generate lower than its rated value, which disables it from selling the remaining available generated power to the costumers and also increases the cost of energy not supplied. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> <b>capacity</b> of the power plant, by which the avoidable cost of energy not supplied, is not burdened on the plant. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on a three machine test system and also on the actual large Mashhad power plant in Iran...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} macroscopic characteristics of traffic flow on on-ramp merging segments. The methodology {{of the new}} U. S. Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) {{was used as a}} framework for the analysis. Following the HCM 2010 method, density was used as the measure of level of service (LOS). This research was intended to calculate the capacity and optimum density on on-ramp merging segments with Finnish traffic flow. Measured data has been gathered in 2013 from six on-ramp merging areas in Helsinki Metropolitan Area. Traffic flow data was collected from six recording cameras on each site located before and after the merging of vehicles. The data used in this research excludes disturbances such as accidents, roadwork, and bad weather. The HCM model’s parameters were estimated by the measured data. The measured data was used to estimate average speed, traffic volume, and traffic density. The examination was then completed in two parts. The first part consisted of analysis of empirical macroscopic dataset. The second examination consisted of estimating capacity and optimum density from this dataset following the HCM 2010 procedure. The six on-ramp merge locations were analyzed to estimate the maximum flow i. e. capacity and optimum density, after which unstable flow occurred. In most of the locations higher upstream flows were identified as the major cause of speed drop and congestion. Overall analysis of the data, led {{to the conclusion that the}} 31 vehicle per km per lane could be suggested as the optimum density value. The data suggested that a <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> <b>capacity</b> of 4, 400 pcph be adopted for four-lane single-lane on-ramp merge areas in Finnish traffic conditions. This value represented the average of the all six sites for which 2 -hour data was used...|$|E

The selective SAPC is proposed to improve power quality and energy efficiency in power networks by means of the cancelation or reduction of the non-efficient powers (Q 1 +, SU 1, SeN). The non-efficient powers can be reduced in six possible sequences according to the priority of compensation. When SAPC <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> current <b>capacity</b> is exceeded, the proposed algorithm limits the SAPC output compensating currents and the non-efficient currents can only be partially reduced in the power network. The reduction of the non-efficient powers depends on the selected compensation sequence. Experimental results for several compensation sequences demonstrate the appropriate operation of the selective SAPC using the proposed scaling algorithm...|$|R

The La/Ce ratio was found to vary from 0. 51 to 18. 73. The <b>capacity</b> <b>output</b> varied between 179 and 266 mAh g− 1. The {{results show that the}} La/Ce ratio has a strong influence on the performance, with the best performance realized with samples having an La/Ce ratio of around 12. La enhancement facilitates easy activation due to refinement in grain size and interstitial dimensions. Also, an orderly influence on crystalline structure could be seen. The study demonstrates that the rare earth content is an essential factor in determining the <b>maximum</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>output</b> because of its influence on crystal orientation as well as an increase in the radius of the interstitials, lattice constants and cell volumes...|$|R
40|$|Developments of {{numerical}} {{models and}} advances in computational capacity have created {{many opportunities for}} industrial companies. In order {{to take advantage of}} these opportunities without facilitating the research directly, partnerships are created with universities to collaboratively solve these issues. Since researchers who are experts in numerical modeling are not typically employed by industry, communication of the often complex results is sometimes difficult. After a long term partnership, it also is very difficult for even the researchers to conceptualize all the comprehensive details of the past research. Virtual reality is being used as a medium to explain the numerical models in a more intuitive visual format with varying levels of detail. Virtual reality is also being used to summarize many different numerical models into simple packages, making it easy to understand the relationship between them. ^ A power company has observed exhaust flow restrictions in a coal fired power generation station preventing the plant from reaching its <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> <b>capacity.</b> One possible problem area identified by operators is located in the duct sections that join multiple boilers exhaust systems. The physical location and inhospitable environment inside this duct make it nearly impossible to directly observe flow problems. The second chapter of this work presents the numerical modeling results and analysis of the flow pattern found inside the current exhaust joining sections. Different permutations of the base case have been investigated as possible solutions to the problem. The results for each case show pressure drops, mass flow rates, and a uniformity analysis. Visual analysis techniques are employed to aide in the universal understanding of the results. ^ The blast furnace is one of the critical components used in the iron and steel making industry. The blast furnace uses structural components, chemical reactions, and mechanical processing to convert the raw material iron oxide into liquefied iron. The extreme temperatures and dangerous internal conditions make direct observation of phenomenon and mechanisms impossible. Many specific numerical models have been created to describe the different phenomenon in detail. The discontinuity of the individual numerical models combined with their inherent complexity make it difficult for non-experts to understand. The fourth chapter of this work describes a virtual reality blast furnace that is created using combinations of numeric and geometric modeling data. The virtual reality blast furnace is designed to bring complex research together promoting universal understanding. The virtual reality model is ultimately intended {{to be used as a}} training tool for people involved aspects of the steel making industry, while providing insight for future research. ...|$|E

30|$|However, to {{the best}} of our knowledge, most {{existing}} works about TAS in the underlay CR systems only focus on the performance analysis with perfect CSI of the SU-PU link (e.g., See [8 – 11]). The imperfect CSI of the interference link is rarely investigated. Only in [16], the effect of the imperfect CSI between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver of cognitive systems with arbitrary TAS was analyzed. However, the aforementioned work [16] focused on the achievement of the closed-expression of the capacity performance and the performance analysis for the SER performance was not involved. Besides, expect for the primary interference constraint, the SU’s peak transmit power constraint is also an important parameter as all the RF power amplifiers have the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> power <b>capacity</b> [17] in the practical application. It will be shown later in our results that the neglection of the SU’s maximum transmit power constraint will induce an obvious performance measurement error especially when the peak interference power constraint of the PU is in a large region or the interference channel from the secondary transmitter to the primary receiver is in a deep fading. In this article, a CR system employing TAS scheme at the secondary transmitter is considered. The performance of this system is analyzed for a more realistic scenario: (1) because of channel estimation errors and/or feedback delay, the channel between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver is assumed to be imperfect, and (2) both the maximum transmit power limit at SU and the interference constraint at PU are taken into consideration. In this article, based on the derivation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the SU’s signal to noise ratio (SNR), the exact closed-form expressions of the average SER and capacity are obtained and validated by simulations. We can observe from the simulation results that the overestimated capacity performance caused by unlimited transmit power of SU can be corrected by our work with more reasonable performance.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{amplification}} {{options for}} patients with mixed hearing loss. Devices tested include percutaneous and transcutaneous bone conductors (BCDs) and middle ear implants with their actuator directly coupled to the cochlea. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. METHOD AND PARTICIPANTS: <b>Maximum</b> <b>output</b> was studied with simulators. As simulators are lacking for the middle ear implants (the Vibrant Soundbridge [VSB] and the Cochlear's Direct Acoustic Cochlear Stimulator [Codacs]), the <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> had to be measured in patients (4 and 5 patients, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> averaged at 0. 5, 1, and 2 kHz was the main outcome measure, which was expressed in dB HL, using appropriate transformation tables. RESULTS: The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> was the highest for the Codacs device and was above the patients' uncomfortable loudness levels. The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> of the VSB varied between 65 and 85 dB HL, and that of percutaneous BCD varied between 68 and 80 dB HL {{depending on the type}} of device. The transcutaneous BCD, the Sophono device, had the lowest output. CONCLUSION: Only with the Codacs device can the complete dynamic range be used. The <b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> of the VSB is lower and variable owing to the coupling to the cochlea. For patients with a sensorineural hearing loss component up to 50 dB HL, a percutaneous BCD forms a good treatment option that is completely independent of the middle ear status.
