5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above, in this early reference, no <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial {{whipping}} contained, nor that Malleolus, contained within the sack, was transported to the river in a cart driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|Jesus' {{childhood}} home is {{identified in the}} gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee, where {{he lived with his}} family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of him thereafter. His other family members—his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned in the gospels and other sources.|$|E
5|$|King Louis XIV {{danced in}} Isaac de Benserade's Ballet royal de Flore in February 1669 at the Tuileries, {{possibly}} in the Salle des Ballets {{located on the}} first floor of the pavilion. It has been suggested that this is when the name Pavillon de Flore came into use, although the earliest known written <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> in 1726. Pavillon de Flore is the name used today, although other names have been used in between.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>mention</b> <b>was</b> {{important}} in the process to be made an actual knight of the Military William Order, the Honorable <b>Mentions</b> <b>were</b> registered in the chapter of the Military William Order.|$|R
50|$|The Gregory <b>mentioned</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} Pope Gregory I (d. 604). The David <b>mentioned</b> <b>is</b> Saint David, who {{was also}} responsible for the earlier Synod of Brefi and the Synod of Victory (over Pelagianism) which {{was held in the}} other Caerleon.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, worth <b>mentioning</b> <b>is</b> {{that already}} by 1563, an {{hereditary}} mill (gristmill) <b>was</b> <b>mentioned</b> in the community.|$|R
5|$|The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' {{applies to}} animals and all life forms. This precept isn't {{found in the}} oldest verses of Vedas, but {{increasingly}} becomes {{one of the central}} ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of Ahimsa to non-human life.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} {{continues}} the Human exploration of interstellar space by {{the crew of}} Enterprise, and further <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of the Temporal Cold War. The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further. The season ends with a cliffhanger that sets up the Xindi story arc, set in the Delphic Expanse, of the third season.|$|E
5|$|UB-43 sank no ships {{over the}} next eight weeks. Author Paul Halpern reports that the {{majority}} of the German U-boats in the Mediterranean fleet were undergoing repairs and refits at Pola and Cattaro during January. Although no specific <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of repairs done on UB-43, the U-boat's inactivity in this period may be for that reason.|$|E
30|$|No special <b>mentioning</b> <b>is</b> deemed necessary.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{alternate}} future of [...] "Five Years Gone", Molly <b>is</b> <b>mentioned</b> to <b>be</b> under Mr. Bennet's care. She {{may have been}} killed by Sylar since the other people Bennet <b>mentioned</b> <b>were,</b> though the actual facts are inconclusive.|$|R

5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/1 was a {{chemical}} detection vehicle. Before {{the outbreak of}} World War II only ninety were intended to be delivered in 194042 to equip the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen), but the 3 May 1940 production plan mentions {{that was to be}} produced at a rate of thirty per month until a total of 400 have been built and thereafter at ten per month. The last <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> a report that MWC was to complete ten vehicles by 15 January 1943. Production may have continued after that, but definitely not after 1943.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>mentioned</b> <b>is</b> {{from year}} 1349.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{also worth}} <b>mentioning</b> <b>is</b> his {{monetary}} theory.|$|R

5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. <b>Mention</b> <b>is</b> also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|Potsherds {{with early}} Tamil writing from the 2nd century BCE {{have been found}} from the north in Poonagari, Kilinochchi District to the south in Tissamaharama. They bore several inscriptions, {{including}} a clan name—vela, a name related to velir from ancient Tamil country. Epigraphic evidence shows people identifying themselves as Damelas or Damedas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) in Anuradhapura, {{the capital city of}} Rajarata the middle kingdom, and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as the 2nd century BCE. Excavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins, produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry local Tamil personal names written in early Tamil characters, which suggest that local Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka by the late classical period. Other ancient inscriptions from the period reference a Tamil merchant, the Tamil householder residing in Ilubharata and a Tamil sailor named Karava. Two of the five ancient inscriptions referring to the Damedas (Tamils) are in Periya Pullyakulam in the Vavuniya District, one is in Seruvavila in Trincomalee District, one is in Kuduvil in Ampara District and one is in Anuradhapura. <b>Mention</b> <b>is</b> made in literary sources of Tamil rulers bringing horses to the island in water craft in the second century BCE, most likely arriving at Kudiramalai. Historical records establish that Tamil kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island's affairs from about the 2nd century BCE. Kudiramalai, Kandarodai and Vallipuram served as great northern Tamil capitals and emporiums of trade with these kingdoms and the Romans from the 6th–2nd centuries BCE. The archaeological discoveries in these towns and the Manimekhalai, a historical poem, detail how Nāka-Tivu of Nāka-Nadu on the Jaffna Peninsula was a lucrative international market for pearl and conch trading for the Tamil fishermen.|$|E
5|$|The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit {{extensively}} {{as their}} language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions {{tended to be}} in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration {{and the fact that}} majority of the records from this phase were brahmadeya grants (grants to Brahmin temples). In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith. Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore that deserves <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war. This is in Hale Kannada (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends, the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend Bhadr, a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the pagoda (weighing 52 grains), the fanam weighting one tenth or one half of the pagoda and the quarter fanams.|$|E

25|$|Among films {{dealing with}} past abuses, one German-Argentine co-production that also deserves <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> Jeanine Meerapfel's The Girlfriend (1988), where Norwegian leading lady Liv Ullmann is cast beside locals Federico Luppi, Cipe Lincovski, Victor Laplace and Lito Cruz.|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 13, II, of the novel, <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made {{of popular}} British comedy actress Joyce Grenfell. In 1957, Grenfell had {{appeared}} in Blue Murder at St Trinian's, a comedy set in a girls' school with a plot that includes a jewel thief and a foreign prince.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the small}} and mid-sized {{municipalities}} around Basel have museums of local history and culture that are not presented in the following. <b>Mention</b> <b>is</b> given to institutions whose scope extends beyond the local level and which are generally {{open to the public}} several days a week.|$|E
25|$|Frequent <b>mention</b> <b>is</b> made of his {{patent leather}} shoes, damage to which is {{frequently}} {{a source of}} misery for him, but comical for the reader.
