40|$|OBJECTIVE: Controlled {{mechanical}} ventilation leads to diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction and atrophy. Since proteolysis is enhanced in the diaphragm during controlled {{mechanical ventilation}}, we examined whether {{the administration of}} a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, would have a protective effect against ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled experiment. SETTINGS: Basic science animal laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetized rats were submitted for 24 hrs to controlled mechanical ventilation while receiving 0. 05 mg/kg bortezomib or saline. Control rats were acutely anesthetized. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 24 hrs, diaphragm force production was significantly lower in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of saline compared to control animals (- 36 %, p<. 001). Importantly, administration of bortezomib improved the diaphragmatic force compared to <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of saline (+ 15 %, p<. 01), but force {{did not return to}} control levels. Compared to control animals, diaphragm cross-sectional area of the type IIx/b fibers was significantly decreased by 28 % in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of saline (p<. 01) and by 16 % in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of bortezomib (p<. 05). Diaphragmatic calpain activity was significantly increased in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of saline (+ 52 %, p<. 05) and in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of bortezomib (+ 36 %, p<. 05). Caspase- 3 activity was increased after controlled mechanical ventilation with saline by 55 % (p<. 05), while it remained similar to control animals in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of bortezomib. Diaphragm 20 S proteasome activity was slightly increased in both ventilated groups, and the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was significantly and similarly enhanced in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of saline and <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> animals receiving an injection of bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the administration of bortezomib partially protects the diaphragm from controlled mechanical ventilation-induced diaphragm contractile dysfunction without preventing atrophy. The fact that calpain activity was still increased after bortezomib treatment may explain the persistence of atrophy. Part of bortezomib effects might have been due to its ability to inhibit caspase- 3 in this model...|$|R

40|$|Humans produce exhaled breath {{particles}} (EBPs) during various breath activities, such {{as normal}} breathing, coughing, talking, and sneezing. Airborne transmission risk exists when EBPs have attached pathogens. Until recently, few investigations had evaluated {{the size and}} concentration distributions of EBPs from <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients with different ventilation mode settings. This study thus broke new ground by not only evaluating the size concentration distributions of EBPs in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients, but also investigating the relationship between EBP level and positive expiratory end airway pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, and pneumonia. This investigation recruited <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients, with and without pneumonia, aged 20 years old and above, from the respiratory intensive care unit of a medical center. Concentration distributions of EBPs from <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients were analyzed with an optical particle analyzer. This study finds that EBP concentrations from <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients during normal breathing were in the range 0. 47 - 2, 554. 04 particles/breath (0. 001 - 4. 644 particles/mL). EBP concentrations {{did not differ significantly}} between the volume control and pressure control modes of the ventilation settings in the <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients. The patient EBPs were sized below 5 µm, and 80 % of them ranged from 0. 3 to 1. 0 µm. The EBPs concentrations in patients with high PEEP (> 5 cmH₂O) clearly exceeded those in patients with low PEEP (≤ 5 cmH₂O). Additionally, a significant negative association existed between pneumonia duration and EBPs concentration. However, tidal volume was not related to EBPs concentration...|$|R

The reported incidence is 1 - 3 % and more than half occur in <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients. Eighty three <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> patients were reported with malpositioned nasogastric tubes and 66 % of them developed serious thoracic complications. Pneumothoraces accounted for 80 % of thoracic complications that were evenly distributed between tubes with and without stylet. Repeated misplacements appear to increase the risk. Non-radiological confirmation of the position of the tube has suboptimal performance. Protocols to place feeding tubes and new technology are promising candidates.

40|$|Aim: To {{obtain the}} first datas of the <b>mechanically</b> <b>ventilated</b> {{patients}} in our newly opened pediatric {{intensive care unit}} (PICU) for determining the future strategies to improve our PICU’s medical quality.
