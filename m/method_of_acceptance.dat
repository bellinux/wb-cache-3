Of these {{four types of}} institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers. The modern Japanese higher education system has undergone numerous changes since the Meiji period and was largely modeled after Western countries such as Germany, France, Britain, and the United States to create a unique Japanese model to serve its national needs. The Japanese higher education system differs from higher {{education in}} most other countries in many significant ways. Key differences include the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> which relies almost entirely {{on one or two}} tests, as opposed to GPAs (Grade Point Average) or other methods of assessment used in Western countries.

40|$|Telemedicine is {{emerging}} as an effective tool that can potentially enhance the ability to provide quality health care in hospitals, professional offices, and homes. Applications have demonstrated success {{in a wide range}} of disciplines and are particularly important for rural communities in hopes of advancing health care practices to these areas that may not have the same advantages, resources, or specialists. Research into this exciting field has led to challenges rather unique to telemedicine. The demands for appropriate research methods and tools for each application have become more complex because of the variety of fields involved and issues specific to telemedicine. Telemedicine research commonly encompasses various sites and review boards, which introduces more challenges. Adding to the complexity of telemedicine research are the ethical and legal issues associated with the use of technology, enrolling participants, transmitting data, confidentiality, and licensing.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} <b>of</b> modeling user <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> research related software using multi-criteria de-cision analysis (MCDA) <b>methods.</b> Evaluation <b>of</b> user <b>acceptance</b> is crucial because {{success or failure of}} any technology depends on the acceptance by the users of the technology. Although various models are available to address user acceptance factors, none discuss the formal methodology to assign importance to the factors. In this paper, we study the use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, which we believe may be able to address this limitation. A case study is conducted to achieve two objectives. Firstly, to model our proposed evaluation framework <b>of</b> user <b>acceptance</b> using MCDA methods. Secondly, to compare various MCDA methods used to rank the factors. The results demonstrate that except for the FAHP (αλ) method, all other methods produced similar ranking of the global user acceptance factors. In terms of ranking of the sub-factors, all methods produced the same results except for the ‘average’ method. We conclude that MCDA methods can successfully be used in this context. I...|$|R

40|$|Susan BartonSustainable landscapes are {{increasingly}} recognized for their potential to restore ecological benefits to {{urban and suburban}} landscapes. Greater adoption of sustainable landscapes requires public <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> sustainable landscaping paradigms and practices. Sustainable landscaping practices have been implemented on the University of Delaware's Laird Campus, but the landscape management has been met with some reluctance from the university community. Environmental interpretation, recognized as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> cultivating public <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> sustainable landscape management, {{has been added to}} the sustainable landscape sites on campus to increase positive perception. This research examines student perception of the sustainable landscape on Laird Campus and the impact of interpretation on student perception of the landscape. Students living on Laird Campus were surveyed before and after an interpretive campaign designed to describe the benefits of sustainable landscaping. The results of this study found that the majority of students perceive the landscape to be attractive, sustainable, well maintained, and functional, providing encouragement for the use of sustainable landscaping practices on university campuses. Reduced mowing, as it is implemented on Laird Campus, was identified as the sustainable practice least likely to be considered acceptable by students. Sustainable landscaping interpretation improved student awareness and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> sustainable landscaping practices. Changes in students' awareness and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> sustainable landscaping practices increased with greater levels of engagement with the interpretation campaign. In contrast to students’ increased awareness and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> sustainable landscaping practices, students' perception of the landscape's appearance did not significantly improve after the interpretation campaign, suggesting the need for future interpretation campaigns to directly address aesthetic issues in addition to interpretation of environmental benefits.

A paradoxical effect is found: The more an individual Is able to accept unpleasant or disappointing aspects of life, the more one is able to enjoy and change life. This study was a qualitative investigation of the experience which individuals define as acceptance and {{the process by which}} they come to the experience <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Utilizing various concepts <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> from differing fields of study, a definition was developed distinguishing it from models of coping or resignation. Connections of this definition to the First Step of Alcoholics Anonymous origins were recognized. In-depth interviews with ten respondents were conducted using a story illustrating the concept <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> as defined by the interviewer, and several follow-up questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed, using commonly accepted <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> qualitative inquiry.
