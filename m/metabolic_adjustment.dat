40|$|Succinic acid {{has been}} favored by {{researchers}} {{due to its}} industrial multiuses. However, the production of succinic acid is far below cell theoretical maximum. The goal {{of this research is}} to identify the optimal set of gene knockouts for obtaining high production of succinic acid in microorganisms. Gene knockout is a widely used genetic engineering technique. Hence, a hybrid of Harmony Search (HS) and Minimization of <b>Metabolic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (MOMA) is proposed. The dataset applied is a core Escherichia coli metabolic network model. Harmony Search is a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by musicians’ improvisation process. Minimization of <b>Metabolic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> is used to calculate fitness closest to the wild-type, after mutant gene knockout. The result obtained from the proposed hybrid technique are knockout genes list and production rate after the deletion.

40|$|We {{construct}} and analyze a discrete fitness landscape called <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment</b> landscape, from sub-networks covered by different productive flux distributions of a metabolic net-work. The topological structure of this landscape, i. e., the lo-cal minima and saddle points, can be compactly {{represented as a}} hierarchical structure called barrier tree. The switching from one local optimal flux pattern to another one is accom-panied by adjustment costs, since genes have to be turned on or off. This phenomenon gives raise to saddle points in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment</b> landscape. Our approach allows calcu-lating the minimal cost pathway that connects any two local minima in the landscape. Furthermore, our method yields a detailed ordering which reactions have to be (de-) activated to switch from one flux distribution to another one with minimal adjustment costs. Such a mechanistic hypothesis can guide experimental verification. We apply our approaches to a net-work describing the central carbon metabolism of E. coli...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{accumulated}} on {{the regulation}} of iron (Fe) homeostasis, its intracellular trafficking and transport across various cellular compartments and organs in plants; storage proteins, transporters and transcription factors involved in Fe metabolism have been analysed in detail in recent years. However, the key sensor(s) of cellular plant Fe status triggering the long-distance shoot-root signalling and leading to the root Fe-deficiency responses is (are) still unknown. Local Fe sensing is also a major task for roots, for adjusting the internal Fe requirements to external Fe availability: how such sensing is achieved and how it leads to <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustments</b> in case of nutrient shortage, is mostly unknown. Two proteins belonging to the 2 ′-OG dependent dioxygenases family accumulate several folds in Fe-deficient Arabidopsis roots. Such proteins require Fe(II) as enzymatic cofactor; one of their subgroups, the HIF-P 4 H (Hypoxia Inducible Factor- Prolyl 4 -Hydroxylase), is an effective oxygen sensor in animal cells.

40|$|Predicting the {{metabolic}} state of an organism after a gene knockout is a challenging task, because the regulatory system governs {{a series of}} transient metabolic changes that converge to a steady-state condition. Regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM) is a constraint-based algorithm for predicting {{the metabolic}} steady state after gene knockouts. It aims to minimize the number of significant flux changes (hence on/off) {{with respect to the}} wild type. ROOM is shown to accurately predict steady-state metabolic fluxes that maintain flux linearity, in agreement with experimental flux measurements, and to correctly identify short alternative pathways used for rerouting metabolic flux in response to gene knockouts. ROOM's growth rate and flux predictions are compared with previously suggested algorithms, minimization of <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and flux balance analysis (FBA). We find that minimization of <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment</b> provides accurate predictions for the initial transient growth rates observed during the early postperturbation state, whereas ROOM and FBA more successfully predict final higher steady-state growth rates. Although FBA explicitly maximizes the growth rate, ROOM does not, and only implicitly favors flux distributions having high growth rates. This indicates that, even though the cell has not evolved to cope with specific mutations, regulatory mechanisms aiming to minimize flux changes after genetic perturbations may indeed work to this effect. Further work is needed to identify metrics that characterize the complete trajectory from the initial to the final metabolic steady states after genetic perturbations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Vanillin {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{flavouring}} agents, originally obtained from cured seed pods of the vanilla orchid Vanilla planifolia. Currently vanillin is mostly produced via chemical synthesis. A de novo synthetic pathway for heterologous vanillin production from glucose has recently been implemented in baker's yeast, Saccharamyces cerevisiae. In this study we aimed at engineering this vanillin cell factory towards improved productivity and thereby at developing an attractive alternative to chemical synthesis. Results Expression of a glycosyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana in the vanillin producing S. cerevisiae strain served to decrease product toxicity. An in silico metabolic engineering strategy of this vanillin glucoside producing strain was designed using a set of stoichiometric modelling tools applied to the yeast genome-scale metabolic network. Two targets (PDC 1 and GDH 1) were selected for experimental verification resulting in four engineered strains. Three of the mutants showed up to 1. 5 fold higher vanillin β-D-glucoside yield in batch mode, while continuous culture of the Δpdc 1 mutant showed a 2 -fold productivity improvement. This mutant presented a 5 -fold improvement in free vanillin production compared to the previous work on de novo vanillin biosynthesis in baker's yeast. Conclusion Use of constraints corresponding to different physiological states was found to greatly influence the target predictions given minimization of <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment</b> (MOMA) as biological objective function. In vivo verification of the targets, selected based on their predicted <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment,</b> successfully led to overproducing strains. Overall, we propose and demonstrate a framework for in silico design and target selection for improving microbial cell factories. </p...|$|E

Single-strand DNA breaks are the most potent activators of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); prolonged action of PARP culminates in intracellular oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and ATP depletion. The integrity of cellular components and the myocardial energy metabolism can be preserved by using PARP inhibitors under conditions of ischemia and reperfusion. Oxidative stress is capable of activating the phosphoinositol- 3 -kinase–Akt/protein kinase B signalling pathway, which is further enhanced if treated with PARP inhibitors.

40|$|Many birds exhibit {{seasonal}} phenotypic {{flexibility in}} {{basal metabolic rate}} (BMR) and summit metabolism (Msum), but very little information is available for species from subtropical latitudes or for conspecific populations from sites that vary in climate. We measured body mass (Mb), BMR, and Msum in summer and winter in two populations of the southern red bishop Euplectes orix, a passerine that is widespread in southern Africa. One population occurs at a comparatively warmer coastal site (mean daily minimum air temperature [Ta] inmidwinter, 8. 3 C) and the other at a colder inland site (mean daily minimum Ta in midwinter, 2. 8 C). Bishops from both populations significantly increased Mb in winter. However, seasonal <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustments</b> differed considerably between the populations. The inland population significantly increased BMR by approximately 58 %, mass-specific BMR by approximately 31 %, and Msum by approximately 15 % in winter, although massspecific Msum did not change significantly. In contrast, the coastal population showed no significant seasonal change in BMR and significant winter reductions in mass-specific BMR (∼ 15 %), Msum (∼ 8 %), and mass-specific Msum (∼ 15 %). The interpopulation differences in the magnitude and direction of seasonal mass-specific BMR changes are qualitatively consistent with global patterns, although the increase shown by the inland population is larger than expected. Our data reveal that avian seasonal <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustments</b> can vary greatly within subtropical species depending on the climatic conditions experienced by the birds, and our findings reiterate the need to better understand metabolic flexibility in species that inhabit lower latitudes.

This review highlights {{the latest developments in}} this area, explains the interface between these in silico tools and the experimental implementation tools of metabolic engineers, and provides a way forward so that in silico predictions can better mimic reality and more experimental methods can be considered in simulation studies. The several methodologies for solving genome-scale models (eg, flux balance analysis [FBA], parsimonious FBA, flux variability analysis, and minimization of <b>metabolic</b> <b>adjustment)</b> all have unique advantages and applications. There are two basic approaches to designing metabolic engineering strategies in silico, and both have demonstrated success in the literature. The first involves: 1) making a genetic manipulation in a model; 2) testing for improved performance through simulation; and 3) iterating the process. The second approach has been used in more recently designed in silico tools and involves: 1) comparing metabolic flux profiles of a wild-type and ideally engineered state and 2) designing engineering strategies based on the differences in these flux profiles. Improvements in genome-scale modeling are anticipated in areas such as the inclusion of all relevant cellular machinery, the ability to understand and anticipate the results of combinatorial enrichment experiments, and constructing dynamic and flexible biomass equations that can respond to environmental and genetic manipulations.

Exposure of hepatocytes to either heat shock (HS;+ 15 C) or sodium arsenite (50 µM) did not affect cell viability, but resulted in significantly higher hsp 70 levels over a 24 h recovery period. Hsp 70 accumulation had no significant impact on unstimulated glucose release, but completely abolished cortisol-induced glucose release in trout hepatocytes.
