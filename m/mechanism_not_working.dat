40|$|Mixed {{states of}} a quantum system, {{represented}} by density operators, can be decomposed as a statistical mixture of pure {{states in a}} number of ways where each decomposition can be viewed as a different preparation recipe. However the fact that the density matrix contains full information about the ensemble makes it impossible to estimate the preparation basis for the quantum system. Here we present a measurement scheme to (seemingly) improve the performance of unsharp measurements. We argue that in some situations this scheme is capable of providing statistics from a single copy of the quantum system, thus making it possible to perform state tomography from a single copy. One of the by-products of the scheme is a way to distinguish between different preparation methods used to prepare the state of the quantum system. However, our numerical simulations disagree with our intuitive predictions. We show that a counterintuitive property of a biased classical random walk is responsible for the proposed <b>mechanism</b> <b>not</b> <b>working...</b>|$|E

In this thesis we look at the effects of different ‘safety net’ mechanisms, whereby the term ‘safety net’ is considered in a broader sense. The thesis does not only look at formal safety net programmes that are implemented by the government but also explores the effects of an informal social protection arrangement, i. e. the family, which acts as an important ‘safety net’ in contexts where formal protection <b>mechanisms</b> are <b>not</b> <b>working</b> or still fully absent...|$|R

Despite the huge increase of reforestation areas in Brazil since the 1970 s, what put up Brazil as the sixth large country with reforested areas, a scarcity of roundwood from reforested areas is happing in that country during {{the first decade of}} the 21 st century. Federal government implemented three programs to foster the reforestation in Brazil during the 1960 s, 1970 s and 1980 s. However, nothing was implemented during the 1990 s, when demand of roundwood increased, but not its production. This paper analyzes those programs, using a traditional cost-benefit approach. The results of that evaluation are used to suggest new federal government policies to foster the enlargement of reforestation in segments where price <b>mechanism</b> has <b>not</b> <b>working</b> well. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bone {{material}} is {{built in a}} complex multiscale arrangement of mineralized collagen fibrils containing wa-ter, proteoglycans and some noncollagenous proteins. This organization is not static as bone is constantly remodeled and thus able to repair damaged tissue and adapt to the loading situation. In preventing fractures, the most important me-chanical property is toughness, which {{is the ability to}} absorb impact energywithout reaching complete failure. There is no simple explanation for the origin of the toughness of bone material, and this property depends in a complex way on the internal architecture of the material on all scales from nanometers to millimeters. Hence, fragility may have dif-ferent mechanical origins, depending on which toughening <b>mechanism</b> is <b>not</b> <b>working</b> properly. This article reviews the toughening mechanisms described for bone material and attempts to put them in a clinical context, with the hope that future analysis of bone fragility may be guided by this col-lection of possible mechanistic origins...|$|R

This paper also investigates challenges for implementation of affordable housing investment which require stakeholder partnership arrangement. In conclusion, the research suggests many forms of collaborative or partnership arrangements among stakeholders are required to attract more affordable housing investment...|$|R

40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) offset {{mechanism}} {{which is}} a part of the Kyoto Protocol. It allows developed countries to reduce GHGs in developing countries. Since the marginal cost of GHG reduction is lower in developing countries, this mechanism contributes to effective GHG reduction for developed countries. At the same time, according to the Kyoto Protocol, it should assist sustainable development in developing countries. However, many argue that this potential win-win <b>mechanism</b> is <b>not</b> <b>working</b> effectively, and will need some improvement after Kyoto expires. Given GHG emissions from developed countries will surpass those from developing countries around 2015, it is important for CDM not only to retain an offset scheme, but to also assist in decarbonization of developing countries. In this project, current CDM projects which have already been registered or rejected by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as of January 4 th, 2010 are examined by using linear and logistical regression models to detect significant factors with respect to successful registration, project duration, project scale and project efficiency. Each analysis is conducted for all CDM projects and for Japanese CDM projects. The results from the models show CDM projects with particular characteristics (sector, host countries, validator) are less risky in terms of investment. This means research and development for CDM schemes are beneficial for improvement of GHG reduction in developing countries. However, it is still difficult to assess how much each CDM project contributes to the sustainable development of a given host country...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} static spherically symmetric solutions of nonlinear massive gravities. We first identify, in an ansatz {{appropriate to}} the study of those solutions, the analog of the decoupling limit (DL) that has been used in the Goldstone picture description. We show that the system of equations left over in the DL has regular solutions featuring a Vainshtein-like recovery of solutions of General Relativity (GR). Hence, the singularities found to arise integrating the full nonlinear system of equations are not present in the DL, despite the fact those singularities are usually thought to be due to a negative energy mode also seen in this limit. Moreover, we show that the scaling conjectured by Vainshtein at small radius is only a limiting case in an infinite family of non singular solutions each showing a Vainshtein recovery of GR solutions below the Vainshtein radius but a different common scaling at small distances. This new scaling is shown to be associated with a zero mode of the nonlinearities left over in the DL. We also show that, in the DL, this scaling allows for a recovery of GR solutions even for potentials where the original Vainshtein <b>mechanism</b> is <b>not</b> <b>working.</b> Our results imply either that the DL misses some important features of nonlinear massive gravities or that important features of the solutions of the full nonlinear theory have been overlooked. They could also have interesting outcomes for the DGP model and related proposals.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper is undertaken in response to the debate on capital flight from Russia. This debate usually involves discussion of its determinants but misses the question of its ultimate effects on the economy. Lack of understanding of the economic nature of capital flight and of its institutional context leads to numerous calls for a policy response, such as stricter capital controls, which are not grounded in any theory or empirical studies, {{but at the same time}} are not opposed on theoretical grounds, with only ideological or technical arguments employed at the very best. The purpose of the paper is to examine capital flight from Russia within the institutional environment in which it occurs and to establish whether this capital flight has detrimental effect on the economy. New Institutional Economics approach is adopted to argue that in Russia’s case capital flight might be considered not just a consequence, as some researchers have argued earlier, but also an optimal solution to the institutional deficiencies with its economic role being neutral. To support the validity of this claim modified Granger non-causality test is used to determine whether capital flight dynamics have a causal effect on that of the interest rate differential and vice versa, that is to test whether price <b>mechanism</b> is <b>not</b> <b>working.</b> Rethinking the nature and the economic impact of capital flight allows postulating that within the existing institutional context the observed capital flight is a normal economic process which per se does not require any policy response and restricting capital flight by imposing capital controls cannot be an element of a pro-growth policy, as it would instead lead to boom-burst sort of growth. ...|$|R

GAO found that the Defense Department (DOD) has developed guidance to help the armed services achieve system interoperability as well as develop oversight controls, directives, and policies and to achieve interoperability. DOD has also worked to develop joint capabilities through exercises and advanced concept technology demonstrations. The individual services have undertaken various efforts to improve their own capability to attack time-critical targets. Although these efforts are helping DOD to improve the sensor-to-shooter process, much {{more needs to be}} done to significantly reduce the time it takes to strike time-critical targets.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 40) During recent years, {{much attention}} has been directed towards the high {{costs associated with the}} delivery of health care services. Additionally, the over-utilization of such services has become of major concern to all providers as well as consumers. As the federal government became increasingly involved in the delivery of health care benefits and services, as well as the costs associated with them, it became acutely aware of a need to curb the continuous inflation of the prices that it had to pay. It also had in its power the ability to do something about it. In 1965 the federal government passed the first legislation giving health care benefits to certain segments of the population. With these benefits also came mechanisms aimed at controlling utilization to curb costs. However, as time progressed, it was felt that these <b>mechanisms</b> were <b>not</b> <b>working</b> as well as were originally expected. Therefore, in 1972, Congress once again attempted to put a curb on the costs of health care for which it was paying and passed the Social Security Act of 1972, better known as Public Law 92 - 603. This study was designed to determine if the passage of Public Law 92 - 603 has had a positive effect on the number of in-patient admissions and length of stay in health care institutions. The area of the study was a 225 bed general acute district hospital located in the desert of Southern California. Although {{the findings of this study}} may not be applicable to all segments of the health care industry, the results showed that this legislation did not have a significant impact on the number of admissions and the average lengths of stay for Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease patients over 65 years of age...|$|R

30|$|The latitude-height {{structure}} of the 8 -h ES amplitude above 100 km fits quite well with the TDT behaviour observed in SABER temperatures from 2002 to 2009 (Pancheva et al. 2013, their Figures seven and eight). A three-peak structure is evident throughout the year in SABER temperatures, which is also seen in ES during equinox and can be at least guessed for solstice conditions. In contrast, at altitudes below 100 km, the results do not match well, especially the dominating ES OF maximum at low southern latitudes below 90 km during MAM and JJA is not found in TDT behaviour. However, the careful inspection of this feature has assured that the 8 -h signal is not a mathematical artefact (see ‘Observations of terdiurnal signatures in sporadic E layers’ section). Additionally, the structure is present in every year and does not originate from a single large event. Considering the results reported by Moudden and Forbes (2013), who found larger TDT amplitudes in SABER temperatures from 2002 to 2011 near the equator, a link between TDT and 8 -h ES at very low southern latitudes might be possible, because the magnetic field lines reveal dip angles up to 60 °. However, this assumption cannot be validated, because wind shear <b>mechanism</b> is <b>not</b> efficiently <b>working</b> directly at the equator and at very low northern latitudes, where a similar pattern would be expected.|$|R

We aimed to investigate employment status and work-related difficulties of family caregivers of terminal cancer patients, comparing with the general population. Methods: Using structured questionnaires, we assessed family caregivers of 481 cancer patients determined by physicians to be terminally ill, from 11 university hospitals and the National Cancer Center in Korea. Results: Among 381 family caregivers of terminal cancer patients (response rate, 87. 6 %), 169 (43. 9 %) were <b>not</b> <b>working</b> before cancer diagnosis, but currently 233 (63. 7 %) were <b>not</b> <b>working.</b> Compared with the general population (36. 5 %), the percentage of <b>not</b> <b>working</b> among the family caregivers was higher (OR= 2. 39; 95 %CI = 1. 73 - 3. 29).

Tests showed that diffusional exchange of small molecules in the axoplasm surrounding the dialysis tube occurred with a half-time of 2 – 5 min, and that protein does not cross {{the wall of the}} dialysis tube. The composition of the dialysis medium was (mM) : K isethionate 151, K aspartate 151, taurine 275, MgCI 2 4 – 10, NaCl 80, KCN 2, EDTA 0. 1, ATP 5 – 10, and phosphoarginine 0 – 10. The following measurements were made: resting Na influx 57 pmole/cm 2 sec (n = 8); resting potassium efflux 59 pmole/ cm 2 sec (n = 4); stimulated Na efflux 3. 1 pmole/cm 2 imp (n = 9); stimulated K efflux 2. 9 pmole/cm 2 imp (n = 3); resting Na efflux 48 pmole/cm 2 sec (n = 18); Q 10 Na efflux 2. 2 (n = 5). Removal of ATP and phosphoarginine from the dialysis medium (n = 4) or external application of strophanthidin (n = 1) reversibly reduced Na efflux to 10 – 13 pmole/cm 2 sec.
