The surface roughness value of steel after being grinded will ranged in 0. 1 to 1. 6 µm Ra. This paper points to the precision hard turning of the hardened mold steel, seeking the cutting conditions that can be received in the surface roughness value below 0. 1 µm Ra, in order to replace the grinding processes. The precision dry turning test were conducted with ceramic cutting tools. The nose radius of the cutting tool was 1. 2 mm and the depth of cut was fixed at 0. 05 mm. Through a series of turning test, it can be found that, when cutting speed was at 80 to 200 m / min, and feed rate at 0. 005 to 0. 009 <b>mm</b> / <b>rev,</b> the surface roughness value would be all below 0. 1 µm Ra.

One kind of the cutting method which usually used is lathe process, where the process is {{maintained}} toward work substance of cylindrical shape. This observation is aimed to determine the effect or response graphic of independent variable which determined (spindle rotation speed, feed motion, cutting depth and material hardness level) toward dependent variable (cutting force and surface coarseness) of dynamometer designed and built by Machine Technique of UNDIP. The Dynamometer is a set of measurement tool which used to estimate of cutting force by principle to change its tension to be cutting force. The Dynamometer which working is using principle of electric. Commonly, the resistance change which used to measure the tension of motion measurement (LVDT pick-ups, moving plate capacitance pick-ups). To gain the response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable in this observation is using two testing method, both testing with simple method and testing with Taguchi method. The estimation of simple testing method resulted response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable, that is cutting force which the greatest value gained at level : spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (1. 5 mm), feed motion by level 3 (0. 009 mm/rev) and the specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). By measuring with Taguchi method, the greatest value of cutting force yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6).

A mutation in genes of either the MMS 2 or the REV 3 branch does not result in extreme sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents; however, deletion of both subpathways of PRR results in a synergistic phenotype. Nevertheless, the double mutant is not as sensitive to DNA-damaging agents as a rad 6 or rad 18 mutant defective in the entire PRR pathway, suggesting the presence of an additional subpathway within PRR. A synthetic lethal screen was employed {{in the presence of a}} sublethal dose of a DNA-damaging agent to identify novel genes involved in PRR, which resulted in the isolation of RAD 9 as a candidate PRR gene. Epistatic analysis showed that rad 9 is synergistic to both <b>mms</b> 2 and <b>rev</b> 3 with respect to killing by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and the triple mutant is nearly as sensitive as the rad 18 single mutant.

Moreover, deletion of RAD 9 reduces damage-induced mutagenesis and the mms 2 spontaneous and induced mutagenesis is partially dependent on the RAD 9 gene. We further demonstrated that the observed synergistic interactions apply to any two members between different branches of PRR and G 1 /S and G 2 /M checkpoint genes.

In order to measure spatial variation of echinoderm larval bundances, oblique tows were taken with 64 and 202 μm mesh nets at seven different sites within the shelf, at the shelf-edge, and at a nearby oceanic stations during August 2007. Overall, Echinoidea (sea urchin) exhibited the highest abundance with a total of 11 921 larvae, representing 52. 5 % of the total collection. Ophiuroidea (brittle star) ranked second in abundance with 45. 6 % of the total larvae. Holothuroidea (sea cucumber) and Asteroidea larvae (sea star) accounted for less than 2 % of the total echinoderm larval collection. Early larval stages (2 - 8 day old) of Diadema antillarum represented 20 % of the total Echinoidea larvae. There was no marked seasonal trend of echinoderm larval abundance; Echinoidea and Ophiuroidea larvae were present in all monthly samples indicating that reproduction occurs year-round. Peak abundances of later-stage Echinoidea larvae were observed during January, July and October and of later-stage Ophiuroidea larvae during June, August and October. The observed peaks of later-stage larval abundances may be indicative of higher recruitment activity during these months. There was a significant difference of echinoderm larval abundance between spatial stations, with higher abundances collected at the shelf-edge.

40|$|DNA is {{susceptible}} to both exogenous and endogenous damaging agents. Damage is constantly reversed by {{a wide range of}} DNA repair pathways. Lesions which escape such repair may cause nucleotide mis-pairing and stalled replication, resulting in mutagenesis and cell death, respectively if left unresolved. Stalled replication is particularly dangerous because replication fork collapse can lead to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and chromosome rearrangement, a hallmark of cancer. DNA damage tolerance (DDT) is defined as a mechanism that allows DNA synthesis to occur in the presence of replication-blocking lesions. DDT, also known as post-replication repair (PRR) in yeast, has been well characterized in the lower eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae to consist of error-free and error-prone (mutagenic) pathways. Mono-ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by the Rad 6 -Rad 18 complex promotes mutagenesis by recruiting low fidelity translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases, while continual Lys 63 -linked poly-ubiquitination of PCNA by the Mms 2 -Ubc 13 -Rad 5 complex promotes error-free lesion bypass. Since most of the genes involved in DNA metabolism are conserved within eukaryotes, from yeast to human, I tested the hypothesis that mammalian cells also possess two-pathway DDT in response to DNA damage. Namely, the error-free pathway is dependent on the Ubc 13 -Mms 2 complex, while the error-prone pathway utilizes the TLS polymerases, such as Rev 3. By utilizing cultured mammalain cells and producing antibodies against human Ubc 13, <b>Mms</b> 2 and <b>Rev</b> 3, I was able to show that all three proteins associate with PCNA in S-phase cells, and that this association is enhanced following DNA damage. Ubc 13 -Mms 2 association with PCNA was enhanced in response to DSBs. Furthermore, suppression of Ubc 13 or Mms 2 using interfering RNA technology resulted in increased spontaneous DSBs. In response to UV exposure, Rev 3 co-localized with PCNA and two other TLS polymerases, Rev 1 and Pol-ƒØ, at the damage site. UV-induced Rev 3 nuclear focus formation was dependent on Rev 1 but independent of Pol-£b. Surprisingly, over-expression of Pol-£b was sufficient to induce spontaneous Rev 3 nuclear foci. It was further demonstrated that Rev 1 and Pol-ƒØ were independently recruited to the damage site and did not require Rev 3. These observations support and extend the polymerase switch model which regulates the activity of the replicative and TLS polymerases. Finally, simultaneous suppression of Rev 3 along with Ubc 13 or Mms 2 resulted in a synergistic sensitivity to UV, whereas simultaneous suppression of Ubc 13 and Pol-ƒØ resulted in an additive effect. These results are consistent with those in yeast cells, implying a comparable mammalian two-pathway DDT model. Additional interesting observations were made. Firstly, Ubc 13 interacts with Uev 1 A, a close homolog of Mms 2, which is involved in the NF-£eB signaling pathway independent of DNA damage. Secondly, Rev 3 appears to be excluded from the nucleus in a fraction of low passage normal non-S-phase cells, whereas in tumor derived cell lines, Rev 3 is consistently enriched in the nucleus independent of cell cycle stage. Finally, Rev 3 is elevated during mitosis and associates with condensed chromosomes, suggesting a possible novel role in mitosis. Consistent with this notion, chronic ablation of Rev 3 resulted in cell death with inappropriate chromosome segregations. The above preliminary observations require further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Cement-based {{materials}} {{are the most}} widely used man-made materials in the world. The durability of cement-based materials has been a major concern due to the premature failure and serviceability issues of many reinforced concrete structures. Durability of cement-based materials is to a large content dependent on their resistance to the ingress of aggressive species, such as chloride, sulfates and carbon dioxide, which is governed by different mechanisms including permeation, absorption, diffusion, or their combinations. Therefore, the primary factors governing the durability of reinforced concrete structures are the transport properties in cement-based materials, e. g. permeability and diffusivity, which depend on the evolution of their underlying microstructures over a wide range of length scales, concentration of aggressive species and environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity and their variations. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a multiscale modelling scheme to estimate the transport properties in cement-based materials capturing the structural information at each scale and taking into account the influences of w/c ratio, time, chloride binding, degree of water saturation, chloride concentration, interfacial transition zone (ITZ), and aggregate content and shape. To achieve this objective, based on the homogeneous multiscale method, the hybrid lattice Boltzmann-finite element method is proposed and developed in this thesis, which combines the advantages of both lattice Boltzmann method and finite element method. Lattice Boltzmann method is used as micro-scale solver for predicting the transport properties in cement paste and ITZ. Finite element method is selected as meso-scale solver to estimate the transport properties in mortar and concrete. The upscaling between the micro-scale and meso-scale simulations is accomplished by using the volume averaging technique. The representative elementary volume (REV) of cement-based materials at a lower scale is determined with a numerical-statistical approach. Transport properties in the REV of cement-based materials at a lower scale are considered as input to predict the transport properties in cement-based materials at a higher scale. The developed multiscale lattice Boltzmann-finite element modelling framework enables to acquire a meso-scale solution, i. e. transport properties, while still capturing the micro-scale information. The methodology for multiscale modelling of transport properties in cement-based materials is presented in Part II of this thesis, made up of Chapters 3, 4 and 5. In Chapter 3, an overview of the implementation of multiscale modelling scheme is given. Chapter 4 describes the details of the micro-scale solver: lattice Boltzmann method, consisting of the PermLBS (the abbreviation of “Permeability Lattice Boltzmann Simulation”) module, SCMPLBS (the abbreviation of “modified Shan-Chen Multi-Phase Lattice Boltzmann Simulation”) module and DiffLBS (the abbreviation of “Diffusivity Lattice Boltzmann Simulation”) module. A series of benchmark tests are performed to validate each module. Chapter 5 presents the procedure to obtain the 3 D structures of cement paste, ITZ, mortar and concrete. At micro-scale, the microstructures of cement paste are obtained through the cement hydration and microstructure formation model, HYMOSTRUC 3 D model, as well as the X-ray computed microtomography (?CT) scan. Cement paste is regarded as a heterogeneous material composed of capillary pores, hydration product and unhydrated cement grain. At meso-scale, both mortar and concrete are modelled as three-phase composite materials consisting of matrix, aggregate and ITZ. For the mesostructure of mortar, the aggregate is sand, and the matrix is bulk paste, while for the mesostructure of concrete, the aggregate is coarse aggregate (e. g. crushed stones, river gravels), and the matrix is mortar. The microstructure of ITZ is extracted from the “ribbon paste”. The microstructural evolution of the ITZ is simulated with the HYMOSTRUC 3 D model taking into account the wall effect. The results of multiscale modelling of transport properties in cement-based {{materials are}} shown in Part III of this thesis consisting of Chapters 6 and 7. Chapter 6 presents the micro-scale study, that is, transport properties in cement paste. The REV size of cement paste for transport properties is found to be 100 × 100 × 100 ?m 3. The water permeability, moisture and chloride diffusivity in cement paste are simulated using the PermLBS module, SCMPLBS module, and DiffLBS, respectively. The effects of w/c ratio, time, chloride binding, degree of water saturation, and chloride concentration on the chloride diffusivity in cement paste have been studied in a quantitative manner. The simulation results are verified with the experimental data from literature. The predictions by the micro-scale solver agree quite well with the experimental data. Chapter 7 focus on the meso-scale study, that is, transport properties in mortar and concrete. The diameter of the used sands ranges from 0. 125 to 4 <b>mm.</b> The <b>REV</b> size of mortar for transport properties is found to be 8 × 8 × 8 mm 3. Chloride diffusivities in mortar and concrete are estimated using the meso-scale solver. The effects of ITZ, aggregate content and shape on the chloride diffusivity in mortar are quantitatively investigated. The simulation results of chloride diffusivities in cement-based materials at meso-scale show a good agreement with the experimental data from literature. Chloride-induced corrosion of steel rebars in the concrete is considered {{to be one of the}} major causes of deterioration in reinforced concrete structures. In order to demonstrate the potential applications of the developed multiscale modelling scheme to predict the service life of reinforced concrete structures, a case study is presented in Chapter 7. It is shown that the estimated transport properties in cement-based materials by the developed multiscale modelling scheme can be directly used as input for the service life prediction of reinforced concrete structures.
