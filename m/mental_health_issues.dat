5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression.

However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To identify the evidence base related to discharge planning {{in the context}} of acute and community mental healthcare service provision to ascertain the need for future research. Background Discharge planning is an important activity when preparing consumers to transition from hospital to home. The efficiency of discharge planning for consumers living with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> can influence both the number of future readmissions to acute-care facilities and their quality of life at home. Design An integrative review of the peer-reviewed literature. Method This review uses specific search terms and a 21 -year time frame to search two key nursing databases CINAHL (Cinahl Information Systems, Glendale, CA, USA) and PSYCHINFO (American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA) for research reports investigating the substantive area of enquiry. Hand searches of reference lists and author searches were also conducted. Nineteen peer-reviewed journal articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Results Research findings about discharge planning for people living with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> identify the importance of communication between health professionals, consumers and their families to maximise the effectiveness of this process. The complexity of consumer's healthcare needs influences the discharge planning process and impacts on aftercare compliance and readmission rates. There is a limited amount of research findings relating to differences between health professionals and families' perceptions of the level of information required for effective discharge planning, and the appropriate level of involvement of individuals living with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> in their own discharge planning. Results from this integrative review will inform future research related to this topic. Conclusion Discharge planning for consumers living with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> involves many stakeholders who have different expectations regarding the type of information required and the necessary level of involvement of people living with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> in this process. Relevance to clinical practice Comprehensive discharge planning can result in reduced readmissions to both acute and community <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services. Understanding the impact of effective communication on the outcomes of discharge planning is an important step in promoting successess...|$|R

5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> over their lifetime.

In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of stoicism, self efficacy and perceived stigma in predicting help seeking by rural residents for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems. A cross section of rural residents completed self report questionnaires assessing current levels of symptomatology, disability, perceived stigma, self efficacy, stoicism, and attitudes towards and experience of seeking help for psychological problems. Over a quarter of respondents had sought help from a general practitioner or <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> professional for psychological problems or a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue.</b> More women than men reported having sought such help. Lifetime help seeking for a psychological problem or <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> was positively associated {{with higher levels of}} distress and lower levels of stoicism and, to a lesser extent, lower levels of self efficacy.

5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E

5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>issues.</b> Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E
