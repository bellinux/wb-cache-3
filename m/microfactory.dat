40|$|In the {{precision}} engineering industry, {{research and development}} is undertaken towards the development of <b>microfactories,</b> miniaturized environments for fabrication and assembly of small components. Micro handling and micromanipulation, especially in biology, but also in other fields, often require dedicated devices and special environments (pressure, humidity and temperature controlled) as well. It would be a logical step to miniaturize micromanipulation and micro handling devices {{to a certain extent}} in a similar manner as tools and environments, with the same advantages as <b>microfactories</b> have for manufacturing: lower energy consumption, better control of the operation environment and smaller space required for an entire laboratory. This paper presents several miniature positioning and manipulation devices based on piezoelectric transducers, which can serve to build a “Microfactory” for application in Microbiology for either telemanipulation or semi- and fully autonomous manipulation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{increase}} {{greater than}} ever in the developments of microproducts leads us to consider the design of an automatic, flexible, reconfigurable and upgradeable <b>microfactory.</b> Thus defined, the <b>microfactory</b> {{has the ability to}} implement an infrastructure of automated manufacture in small or average batches, and will be able to prove the feasibility of automated production in greater quantity. Two main difficulties have been identified. First, the operator in charge of the production setting has accessibility problem in the microworld. Second, the permanent adaptation of the production system to the variations of the intrinsic parameters of the microworld. Consequently, such a concept of <b>microfactory</b> must assist the operator by the capitalization of last experiments and the restitution of acquired know-how. Taking into account the importance and diversity of information, our approach consists in defining all this technical information system. Our method went on a modeling of the <b>microfactory</b> under UML, using the “use-cases” and “classes” diagrams.

40|$|Demands {{of various}} {{miniature}} mechanical parts and {{products such as}} for watches, cameras, medical devices, miniature die-sets, and so on, are increasing more and more. Contrarily, manufacturing systems for those parts and products are becoming larger and more complicated. The research group including the authors developed the first prototype of a <b>microfactory</b> which consisted of miniature machine tools and manipulators, in 2000, as a countermeasure for the situation. We insisted that {{the advantage of the}} <b>microfactory</b> would be its capability to reduce environmental impact and costs of manufacturing, especially for diverse-types-and-small-quantity production. Since the smallness of the each machine enables factory layout change, the <b>microfactory</b> can control the increase of the costs when the designs of products have been modified. By replacing conventional manufacturing systems by microfactories, electrical power and initial cost of the machines can be also reduced. On the other hand, machines of the <b>microfactory</b> should be designed small and simple, to ensure the abovementioned advantages. It means that those machines cannot have extra power, throughput, process capability, and so on. So, in the <b>microfactory,</b> many design issues such as machine design, system design and process design should be solved concurrently. And for the purpose, quantitative evaluation method for machines, systems and processes of the microfactories are required first. However, the effect of the <b>microfactory</b> in reducing environmental impact and costs has not been examined quantitatively. If it is possible to show how <b>microfactory</b> can contribute to enhance the efficiency of the production systems, application area of the <b>microfactory</b> will greatly expand. So, as the first step of the quantitative evaluation of system design, this paper proposes a simple efficiency index based on the overall throughput, machine cost, labor cost, electricity cost, environmental impact measured by electrical power and material consumption. The proposed efficiency index is expressed by the equation, Ef=F/SQRT(C*E), where Ef is the efficiency index, F is the functionality of the system, C is the overall cost and E is the overall environmental impact. In the paper F is simply expressed by the throughput of the system. C is the sum of the labor cost, the machine cost and the electricity cost, and E is sum of equivalent CO 2 exhaust of power consumption and materials for the machines. Using the abovementioned <b>microfactory</b> as an example, the paper tries to examine whether the proposed index is useful in evaluating and improving the system configuration. The calculation results indicate that there are some configurations that are more efficient than the others. The calculation also shows that efficiencies of miniature systems like the <b>microfactory</b> are not very less than those of conventional mass production systems, when the required throughput is not very high. The result leads us to conclude that the proposed efficiency index is useful in evaluating the system design. It also insists that microfactory-like systems are hopeful for future manufacturing systems in which high functionality, low cost and low environmental impact are required. Pages: 47 - 5...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Our group {{demonstrated}} experimentally {{that the}} swimming paths of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) {{could be controlled}} through special microelectronic circuits and software algorithms. These results {{may lead to the}} development of a new type of <b>microfactories</b> where manipulation at the micrometer-scale could be performed by many MTB operating under the influences of special control rules. As such, a special integrated microelectronic circuit designed specifically to embed MTB and to control their swimming directions, has been developed. The orientation of the MTB are controlled by inducing a torque on a chain of small particles named magnetosomes, acting as a compass embedded in each bacterium. Such torque is achieved by circulating a small electrical current through selected conductors in the microcircuit in order to use the motility of the bacteria to push micro-objects towards desired locations. The microcircuit containing both the bacteria and the micro-objects being manipulated are placed under an optical microscope to provide information that are processed and fed back to the microcircuit to activate specific conductors in order to achieve optimal coordination and control of the MTB. Our initial proof-of-concept where MTB are pushing microbeads under computer control suggests that the use of biological components such as bacteria could play a major role and influence the development of future <b>microfactories</b> dedicated to specific ranges of applications...|$|R

40|$|The <b>microfactory</b> {{seems to}} be one of the most {{promising}} approaches for reducing the assembly cost of hybrid microproducts. The <b>microfactory</b> is a miniaturized assembly system with a reduced consumption of space and energy compared to conventional assembly systems. The assembly <b>microfactory</b> includes the same devices of a traditional assembly system: handling, joining, monitoring devices andalso proper strategies to assure a correct assembly. The assembly <b>microfactory</b> here presented consists of various prototypes and commercial handling devices integratedin the same assembly environment. The complete system is able to automatically perform different assembly tasks. As a benchtest for evaluating the <b>microfactory</b> performance, a product made of several microcomponents of different materials and shapes has been designed. The operations necessary for its correct assembly are: pick and place of parts with various shapes, peg-in-hole of microcylinders with small clearance, alignment and positioning of microparts. The main goal of the developed <b>microfactory</b> is to demonstrate the reliability and the feasibility of the tested devices in complex microhandling tasks and their capability to be simply integrated in a microassembly environment.

This device is a push-pull actuator: two pieces of MSMA material act in an opposite way. The magnetic fields are created by coils and concentrated by ferromagnetic circuits. In order to move {{the central part of}} the actuator, a current pulse in the first coil is generated. The hysteretic behaviour of the material permits to keep a stable position when no current is applied. A current pulse in the second coil permits to displace the central part in the opposite direction. The stable position depends on the magnitude and the time duration of the current pulses and an infinity of stable positions can be reached. The use of current pulses permits also a reduction of the coil heating (Joule effect losses) and a reduction of the magnetic circuit size. The performances and characteristics of MSMA are between these of classical SMA and these of piezo-electric materials.
