5|$|The {{following}} two seasons once again saw Humphreys as an ever-present in the Hartlepool team under new manager Neale Cooper. In the 2003–04 season, Hartlepool once again made the play-offs, only {{to go out}} after conceding two last minute goals to Bristol City, a memory which Humphreys described as <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> than Cheltenham. Due to the injuries of Michael Barron, Humphreys began regularly captaining the team.|$|E
5|$|While copper IUDs may {{increase}} menstrual bleeding {{and result in}} <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%). A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the common}} {{presentation}} of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms may start {{soon after the}} movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain. It {{may or may not}} worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> than the first.|$|E

5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body, but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E

25|$|Paraneoplastic SPS {{tends to}} affect the neck and arms more than other variations.

25|$|These spiders are {{attractive}} but are normally very defensive and {{have one of}} the worst bites of all tarantula species, having been known to have a bite <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> than that of a rattlesnake.

60|$|It is not {{agreeable}} to {{set down}} the details of such a disgraceful scene as we witnessed during the next four and twenty hours, and <b>more</b> than <b>painful</b> to describe how the mutiny was finally checked.

2500|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of full-thickness rotator cuff tear, the best combination appears to include once <b>more</b> the <b>painful</b> arc and weakness in external rotation, and in addition, the drop arm sign. This test {{is also known as}} Codman's test. The arm is raised to the side [...] to 90° by the examiner. [...] The patient then attempts to look to lower the arm back to neutral, palm down. If the arm drops suddenly or pain is experienced, the test is considered positive.|$|R
25|$|The late 1900s saw <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> {{times for}} Derbyshire as Derbyshire {{finished}} second-bottom of the table.

25|$|There {{is little}} {{difference}} in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 9 weeks gestation. Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol or surgical abortion.|$|E
25|$|Household debt {{expanded}} rapidly. The European Commission, OECD, {{and others}} advised the Portuguese Government to exercise more fiscal restraint. Portugal's public deficit exceeded 3% of GNP in 2001, the EU's self-imposed limit, {{and left the}} country open to either EU sanctions or tighter financial supervision. The overall rate of growth slowed in late 2001 and into 2002, making fiscal austerity that much <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> to implement.|$|E
50|$|Nebraska scored {{first on}} a field goal, but scoring {{production}} fizzled as Oklahoma led 7-3 at the half. The Cornhuskers took advantage of a Sooner fumble in the 3rd quarter to go up 10-7, but Nebraska soon committed its own turnover to help Oklahoma get back up front, and it didn't stop there. Two <b>more</b> subsequent, <b>painful</b> Cornhusker turnovers sealed the game as Oklahoma converted each for points and handed Nebraska their first loss {{of the year and}} forced them to share the Big 8 title.|$|R
50|$|Infants {{feel pain}} but {{they lack the}} {{language}} needed to report it, so communicate distress by crying. A non-verbal pain assessment should be conducted involving the parents, who will notice changes in the infant not obvious {{to the health care}} provider.

5000|$|In his 1962 pamphlet, Revisionism and Brainwashing, Barnes {{claimed that}} there was a [...] "lack of any serious {{opposition}} or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct".

He claimed that in order to justify the [...] "horrors and evils of the Second World War", the Allies made the Nazis the [...] "scapegoat" [...] for their own misdeeds.|$|R
25|$|Type II, {{formerly}} known as causalgia, has evidence of obvious nerve damage. Type II CRPS tends to feature the <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> and difficult-to-control symptoms of CRPS; The Type II disease scores 47 out of 50 on the McGill pain scale (however there is seemingly little or no data pertaining to Type I specifically here). Despite there being evidence of nerve injury, {{the cause of the}} mechanisms of CRPS Type II are as unknown as the mechanisms of Type I.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of laparoscopic surgery are less pain, faster recovery, and smaller wounds to heal. A study {{has shown that}} patients are 70% more active {{in the first three}} days post-surgery compared to open surgery. The reason open surgery is <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> is that larger incisions are required, and the ovary needs to be pulled out of the body, which stretches and tears tissue in the abdomen (it is not uncommon for patients to react under anaesthesia by breathing faster at this point).|$|E
25|$|Like {{the other}} post-Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} to capitalism <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> than expected. The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) took office and between 1992 and 1994 the Berov Government carried through the privatisation of land and industry through the issue of shares in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as uncompetitive industries failed and the backward state of Bulgaria's industry and infrastructure were revealed. The Socialists portrayed themselves as the defender of the poor against {{the excesses of the}} free market.|$|E
50|$|Erotic {{electrostimulation}} {{involves the}} application of electrical stimulation to the nerves of the body, with particular emphasis on the genitals. Electrostimulation {{has been associated with}} BDSM activities, and erotic electrostimulation is an evolution of that practice. Erotic electrostimulation is the use of electrostimulation in an erotic or sexual manner versus the <b>more</b> sadistic or <b>painful</b> electric shocks in BDSM.|$|R
50|$|SEPS was {{superseded}} in 2001 by a {{minimally invasive}} technique using pin hole surgery, called TRansLuminal Occlusion of Perforators (TRLOP) which by 2009 had {{shown to be}} as effective as SEPS in a 5-year study. As TRLOP can be performed under local anaesthetic and under ultrasound guidance, the advantages over the <b>more</b> invasive and <b>painful</b> SEPS were clear.|$|R

25|$|Two weeks later, Stella and Eben see the deputy, Billy (Manu Bennett), {{signaling}} {{them with}} a flashlight and {{bring him back to}} the station, after finding out he killed his family to save them from a <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> death. The trio find the others have made for the utilidor, a power and sewage treatment station that still has power, and head over there but are separated after Stella saves Gail Robbins (Rachel Maitland-Smith), a young girl whose family was slaughtered by a vampire named Zurial (John Rawls) who was stalking her. Eben and Billy make it to the utilidor but are attacked by Arvin (Andrew Stehlin), who bites Billy; Billy knocks Arvin into the heavy-duty shredder, and in doing so, painfully grinds his own hand to a stump by accident, before being killed by Eben because he is starting to turn.|$|E
25|$|Dermatitis {{symptoms}} {{vary with}} all {{different forms of}} the condition. They range from skin rashes to bumpy rashes or including blisters. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, {{the area of the}} skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum. Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> than itchy.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1991, Francis {{was traded}} to the Pittsburgh Penguins, along with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings, in {{exchange}} for John Cullen, Zarley Zalapski and Jeff Parker. Francis {{was one of the most}} popular players on the team, and held nearly every significant offensive record in the franchise's history, both in the WHA and NHL. The trade was condemned by Whalers fans, most of whom were not willing to believe The Hockey News assessment that the Whalers had actually received the better end of the bargain. Less than two weeks after the trade, Parker suffered a career-ending knee injury. The Francis trade was made all the <b>more</b> <b>painful</b> when Francis and Samuelsson promptly helped lead the Penguins to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles. Coincidentally, Eddie Johnston, the Hartford general manager who had orchestrated the Francis trade, would follow him to Pittsburgh as the Penguins' head coach two years later.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{trademarks}} {{was the use}} of {{two different}} bouncers. One was delivered at a slower pace and was often dealt with quite easily by the batsman. However, this was a ploy by Roberts to lull the batsman into a false sense of security. Roberts would then deliver the second bouncer, pitching in a similar spot to the first, but delivered at far greater pace. The batsman would attempt to play this delivery in the same fashion as the first slower bouncer only to be surprised by the extra pace and bounce of the ball. Many batsmen were dismissed, and many <b>more</b> struck <b>painful</b> blows, by Roberts using this ploy.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the tensions that I have wrestled with between my fundamental-ist Christian socialization and my lived experience since acquiring a spinal cord injury. First, being a model disciple and an evangelist of my community’s religious beliefs did not exempt me from being placed in an aberrant status.
