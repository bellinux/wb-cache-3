5000|$|The Katoomba Scenic Railway is {{the steepest}} {{funicular}} railway {{in the world}} according to the Guinness World Records, and originally part of the Katoomba mining tramways constructed between 1878 and 1900. The cable railway line descends 415 metres through sandstone cliffs, via a rock tunnel with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of 52 <b>degrees.</b> Also, at this location is the Scenic Skyway, a glass-bottom aerial cable car that traverses an arm of the Jamison Valley, and the Scenic Cableway, the steepest aerial cable car in Australia.|$|R
500|$|The Bjorøy Tunnel is a subsea tunnel {{which runs}} below the Vatlestraumen strait between {{the island of}} Bjorøy and the {{mainland}} of Bergen. It carries two lanes of Hordaland County Road 207. It is the only fixed link for the islands of Bjorøy and Tyssøy (Tyssøy is connected to Bjorøy by a bridge). The tunnel is [...] long and reaches [...] below mean sea level. The <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> is 10 <b>degrees</b> (about 18% grade). It is one of few tunnels in Norway without mobile telephone coverage, although there are emergency telephones that connect to the operation center of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, and the tunnel will receive coverage with the future Norwegian Public Safety Radio.|$|R
40|$|Our {{investigation}} is centred on the continental {{slope of the}} Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent basin. Type of sediments, sedimentary stratigraphy, and physical and geotechnical characterization of the sediments have been integrated. Four different types of sediments have been defined: diamictons, silty and muddy turbidites, muddy, silty and muddy matrix embedded clast contourites. There is a close correspondence between the physical properties (density, magnetic susceptibility and p-wave velocity) and the texture and/or fabric as laminations and strati. cation. From a quantitative point of view, only a few statistical correlations between textural and physical properties have been found. Within the geotechnical properties, only water content is most influenced by texture. This slope, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> observed (20 <b>degrees),</b> is stable, according to the stability under gravitational loading concepts, and the maximum stable slope that would range from 22 degrees to 29 degrees. Nevertheless, different instability features have been observed. Volcanic activity, bottom currents, glacial loading-unloading or earthquakes {{can be considered as}} potential mechanisms to induce instability in this area...|$|R

A sample of at least 16 trees per crop type (i.e. silvicultural regime, age, species etc.) within each plot also had height measured.
