The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} nine {{seasons with}} Cleveland, Doby was traded on October 25, 1955, to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby. Chicago {{was looking for}} a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team. [...] "The search is over for a long ball hitter. We've certainly needed a consistent one—and we've been eying Doby for some time", said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey.

He'll <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose." [...] After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22, 1956, Doby and the White Sox swept New York, {{the first time since the}} 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four-game series. The White Sox won eight straight games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, and had done so with the help of Doby's six home runs during the eight-game stretch. [...] "You know, when we dealt for Doby, we weren't worried about Larry. We knew he'd come through", Comiskey said. Doby finished the season with a [...]268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85–69 record.|$|E

50|$|Ogbomosho natives {{have long}} been known as avid travelers.

50|$|Sornette has {{developed}} simple recipes {{that he has}} shared with students, which he claims help ensure better performance and long-term potential development.

The seven principles are: (1) sleep, (2) love and sex, (3) deep breathing and daily exercises, (4) water and chewing, (5) fruits, unrefined products, food combination, vitamin D and no meat, (6) power foods, (7) play, intrinsic motivation, positive psychology and will. He has derived these simple laws from an integration of evolutionary thinking, personal experimentation, and evidence from experiments reported in the scientific literature. He has shared them in this essay, {{with the hope that}} professionals and the broader public may also find some use for it, as he has seen already the positive impacts on some of his students.|$|E
50|$|Joseph S. Podolski {{served as}} Chief Executive Officer {{and as a}} {{director}} since 1992. He joined Zonagen in 1989 as Vice President of Operations. Previously, Podolski spent twelve years in various engineering, product development and manufacturing positions at G.D. Searle, a subsidiary of Monsanto Company. Before joining Monsanto, Podolski held positions in manufacturing, engineering, quality control and development of fine chemicals, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and hospital products with Abbott Laboratories, Dearborn Chemical Company and Baxter Pharmaceuticals. Joseph S. Podolski, the man who led Zonagen through two decades, {{decided it was time}} for a name change. In 2006, Zonagen changed its name to Repros Therapeutics, started to develop other pharmaceutical products for the reproductive system, and began work on its fourth lead drug, Proellex. Proellex is a very similar drug to asoprisnil. Asoprisnil was developed by Germany-based Schering AG to treat endometriosis. Development was discontinued because the drug was causing thickening of the endometrium. Repros claimed that its time on the drug/off the drug approach will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> safety versus asoprisnil. Currently, products under clinical trial are Proellex and Androxal. None have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as of mid-2010.
