I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E

He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> got on together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. I enjoyed the evening thoroughly.|$|E

25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

500|$|Recognizing Dylan's {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{progress}} of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: [...] "Grossman {{came up to me and}} said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> got a thing going here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.|$|E

[...] They met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend the artist Brett-Livingstone Strong. Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, until it was time for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, [...] "You and <b>me,</b> <b>we</b> could get into a lot of trouble.

During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as the [...] and , from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B. Hailston said that the Harriers were able to provide 24-hour support for ground forces, and noted that [...] "The airplane... became the envy of pilots even from my background... there's {{an awful lot of}} things on the Harrier that I've found the Hornet pilots asking <b>me</b> ... <b>We</b> couldn't have asked for a better record".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000.

New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying [...] "It's such a powerful statement {{because of the way}} the movie is put together, I tell everybody, Democrat or Republican, they've got to go see this movie." [...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress. Bingaman disputed this saying, [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>we</b> were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh had {{welcomed the}} {{accession}} in 1958 of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963. However, he became increasingly {{concerned by the}} decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Paul VI until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by {{the replacement of the}} universal Latin Mass with the vernacular. In a Spectator article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as [...] "sharp-edged reasonableness". He wrote to Nancy Mitford that [...] "the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to <b>me....</b> <b>We</b> write letters to the paper. A fat lot of good that does." ...|$|E

500|$|By October, the Foundation's {{financial}} affairs {{had reached}} a crisis point. According to his public relations assistant, Barbara Klowden, Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to [...] "political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power." [...] He began an affair with the twenty-year-old Klowden, much to the annoyance of Northrup, who was clearly aware of the liaison. Klowden recalled that Northrup [...] "was very hostile to <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> were talking about guns and {{she said to me}} that I was the type to use a Saturday night special" [...] (a very cheap [...] "junk gun"). One evening he arranged a double-date with his wife and Klowden, who was accompanied by Hollister, an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation. The dinner party backfired drastically; Northrup began an affair with Hollister, a handsome 22-year-old who was college-educated and a noted sportsman.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{announcement}} made {{prior to the}} start of the season was the return of the Romulans to Star Trek.
