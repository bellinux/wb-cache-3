40|$|Current {{generation}} geospatial applications primarily rely {{on location}} representations that were {{developed for the}} manipulation and display of planar maps of portions of the earth’s surface. The next generation of digital earth applications will require fundamentally new technological approaches to location representation. Improvements in {{the efficiency of the}} representation of vector location can result in substantial performance increases. We examine the advantages and limitations of the most common current approach: as tuples of fixed-width floating point representations of real numbers, and identify a list of desirable design features for an optimal replacement system. These include the use of explicitly discrete integer indexes, the use of an optimal quantification scheme, and the ability to represent point locations at <b>multiple</b> <b>precisions,</b> including the capability to exactly represent key point locations, and the ability to encode multi-precision quantizations. We describe a class of planar systems that meet these criteria, which we call Central Place Indexing (CPI) systems.

40|$|AbstractAntenna arrays {{are used}} in many digital signal {{processing}} applications due {{to their ability to}} locate signal sources. Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a key task of array signal processing. Although various algorithms have been developed for DOA estimation, their high complexity prevents their use in real-time applications. In this paper, we design and develop an efficient parallel implementation of DOA on DSP which is the most widely used processor in embedded system. Due to the potential parallelism in MUSIC algorithm, it is selected for 2 -D DOA estimation. Two computational cores in MUSIC are identified and parallelized. Vectorization of <b>multiple</b> single <b>precision</b> floating point operations is proposed to make good use of the 128 -bit vectors on DSP C 6678.
