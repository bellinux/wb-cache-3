50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> under the C brake while the other ran the control panel brake in the house. One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second inverted loop. The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C brake was pulled to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C block train was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|E

5000|$|Control in Real Racing 2 {{is similar}} to that of its predecessor. The player is given five {{different}} control methods from which to choose: Method A features accelerometer steering (tilting the physical device to the left to turn left and to the right to turn right), auto accelerate and manual brake; Method B features accelerometer steering, manual accelerate and manual brake; Method C features a virtual on-screen steering wheel to steer, auto accelerate and <b>manual</b> <b>brake,</b> Method D features a virtual steering wheel to steer, manual accelerate and manual brake; Method E features touch to steer (where the play touches the left side of the touchscreen to turn left, and the right side to turn right), auto accelerate and <b>manual</b> <b>brake.</b> Within each of these options, the player can modify the amount of brake assist and steering assist, as well as selecting to turn on or off [...] "anti-skid". In Methods A and B, the accelerometer sensitivity can also be modified.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and <b>releases</b> the <b>brakes</b> to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|R
5000|$|The pilots {{received}} several computer-generated wind shear and glide slope deviation warnings, and observed severe airspeed fluctuations, {{during the last}} mile before touchdown. The auto brakes were set at only the number two level and then were turned off moments after touchdown, when the Captain elected to use <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> and thrust reversal. The speedbrakes were extended momentarily, but then retracted. This caused the plane to [...] "float," [...] making the brakes ineffective until the speed brakes were extended again.|$|R
50|$|Landing {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} as it lands at the destination. This is the <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> weight minus the trip fuel burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and reserve fuel.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum-operated hidden {{headlamps}} were added, which retracted upwards in {{event of}} failure. An automatic parking <b>brake</b> <b>release,</b> two-way power seats, power front disc brakes (rear drum), an indicator light for the headlight doors, and adjustable head restraints were all standard features.|$|R
50|$|Capable of {{achieving}} {{speeds up to}} 42 km/h, the 1,085m Alpine Coaster track slides over bumps, twists through corkscrews and zigzags through the trees of the Niagara Escarpment covering 475 vertical metres. The carts are capable of holding two people at a time, and riders can use a <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> to control their speed as they descend the track. The resort has since added a mini-Putt course, a high ropes climbing facility and a zipline facility {{to be completed in}} the fall of 2013.|$|R
40|$|Six {{months prior}} to {{shipment}} of the Broadband X-ray Telescope to the Kennedy Space Center for flight aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, a major system failure occurred. During modal survey testing of the telescope's gimbal pointing system, the roll axis <b>brake</b> unexpectedly <b>released.</b> Low level vibration and static preloads present during the modal survey were within the expected flight environment. <b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> during shuttle liftoff or ascent was an unacceptable risk to mission success; thus, a Brake Lock Mechanism (BLM) was developed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{brake system}} {{plays a key}} role in the vehicle safety system. The drivers usually cannot depress the brake pedal {{immediately}} in emergencies. A new vehicle brake-assist mechanism using the transmission principle of the clutch is designed to solve this problem. This mechanism can automatically assist drivers to handle the emergency when they failed to brake in time. Thus, the danger can be avoided initiatively. Through experiment, the reliability and effectiveness of the actuator is proved. Compared to <b>manual</b> <b>brake,</b> the designed mechanism can be more exact and rapid...|$|R
5000|$|Yo La Tengo {{covered the}} song on their 1990 album, Fakebook. It was also covered by The Mavericks, whose version peaked at number 42 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1999.

50|$|The landing continued, but <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> did not {{commence}} {{until the}} aircraft was over 1,600 metres down the runway. Then the plane proceeded to hydroplane and skid {{its way down}} the runway, departing substantially from runway centreline. Company standard operating procedure mandated that idle reverse thrust {{should be used for}} landings and that flaps should be set at 25 degrees, not the maximum of 30 degrees. The combination of flaps 25, no auto-braking, no reverse thrust, a high and fast approach, a late touch down, poor Cockpit Resource Management, and the standing water on the runway led to a runway overshoot.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} aircraft takeoff performance from <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> to air-phase height that requires fewer tests than conventionally required {{is evaluated with}} data for the XB- 70 airplane. The method defines the effects of pilot technique on takeoff performance quantitatively, including the decrease in acceleration from drag due to lift. For a given takeoff weight and throttle setting, a single takeoff provides enough data to establish a standardizing relationship for the distance from <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> to any point where velocity is appropriate to rotation. The lower rotation rates penalized takeoff performance in terms of ground roll distance; the lowest observed rotation rate required a ground roll distance that was 19 percent longer than the highest. Rotations at the minimum rate also resulted in lift-off velocities that were approximately 5 knots lower than the highest rotation rate at any given lift-off distance...|$|R
40|$|The braking {{performance}} of a nine-place, light, twin-engine airplane was evaluated on comparative grooved and ungrooved surfaces of the landing research runway at NASA Wallops Station. The test airplane was equipped with <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> on the main wheels of the tricycle landing gear, and its weight varied from 33. 4 to 35. 6 kN (7500 to 8000 Ib). The test results indicate that pavement grooving significantly improves aircraft braking and directional control on wet runways. Measurements and observations of airplane tire treads made during this test program showed no indication of unusual wear and/or damage attributable to grooved surfaces. Comparative braking data obtained with a jet fighter and a civil and a military jet transport are also presented. Includes bibliographical references (p. 13 - 14).

50|$|As {{the medical}} {{director}} of the Marion Nursing Home for some three decades, he became aware of the problem of wheelchair-related falls among semi-ambulatory patients who did not or could not remember to use <b>manual</b> <b>brakes</b> on their wheelchairs. Some patients in wheelchairs, particularly the elderly, have a tendency to fall and injure themselves when trying to stand because they fail to engage the manual locks. Dugas hence attempted {{to find a way to}} save these patients from potentially debilitating injuries. He began his experimentation with locking systems and procured his first patent (#5,203,433) on April 20, 1993. The wheelchair locks/brakes are made of stainless steel, and worked well but were heavy and had a tendency to require maintenance.|$|R
50|$|On 25 November 1941, {{seven men}} {{were killed and}} 53 were injured when a trolley {{transporting}} miners down a sharply sloping shaft ran out of control. The incident happened at the 'Gorky' drift mine, with ninety men and boys taking the spake, an open-sided trolley fitted with cross planks for seating and a central overhead handrail as a holding point, down to the workings 525 yards below. The surface engineman suffered a temporary blackout and the <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> was disengaged, causing the spake to quickly build up speed. Most of the injuries and fatalities were to miners who leapt from the spake and were thrown back under the trolley due to the narrowness of the drift shaft.|$|R

500|$|The enquiry report {{submitted}} by the Civil Aviation Ministry said that Glušica slept for over 90 minutes during the flight. The Air India Express IX 812 [...] carrying 166 people from Dubai including the crew, crashed while negotiating a tricky landing at Mangalore city's [...] "table-top" [...] airport overlooking a ravine. The American National Transportation Safety Board says {{it was the first}} instance of snoring recorded on a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot [...] "deployed détente reverse thrust and applied maximum <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> at touchdown", the aircraft could have been stopped within the paved overrun area of the runway. The captain had exacerbated the long landing by attempting a go-around following deployment of the thrust reversers.|$|R
