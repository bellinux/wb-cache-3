50|$|The MLR {{was first}} {{described}} by Shik and colleagues in 1966 when they observed that electrical stimulation {{of a region}} of the midbrain in decerebrate cats produced walking and running behavior on a treadmill. Twenty-eight years later, Masdeu and colleagues described {{the presence of a}} MLR in humans.

Anatomically, as the name suggests, the MLR is located in the mesencephalon (or midbrain), ventral to the inferior colliculus and near the cuneiform nucleus. Although identifying the exact anatomical substrates of the MLR has been subject to considerable debate, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), lateral cuneiform nucleus, and midbrain extrapyramidal area are thought to form the neuroanatomical basis of the MLR. Nuclei within the MLR receive inputs from the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia and neural centers within the limbic system. Projections from the MLR descend via the medullary and pontine reticulospinal tracts to act on spinal motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors.|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} of measured energy savings from energy conservation retrofits {{is an important}} step in the verification of the success of a retrofit (Claridge et al. 1992). Several methods for calculating the savings from energy conservation retrofits to HVAC systems in the LoanSTAR program have been proposed, including linear and change-point linear empirical models and calibrated simulation models. Simple least squares linear regression is easiest to use and understand, but is incapable of describing non-linear temperature dependencies of a building's energy use. Change-point linear models are more complex than the simple linear regression and cover a broader range of buildings. However, there are some buildings for which change-point linear models do not fit the data adequately. This paper presents a first look at an hourly bin method for calculating energy savings from energy conservation retrofits to HVAC systems based on hourly whole-building electricity, sub-metered <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>center</b> use and thermal energy measurements.

The team had {{the makings of a}} real contender, but the backcourt was debilitated by injuries to Marhsall and King, plus promising Si Green and Johnny McCarthy had been lost to mandatory military service. The team's first-year promise took a tragic turn in mid-March. In the final game of the regular season, played on March 12, Stokes suffered an injury when his head hit the hardwood floor in a game versus the Minneapolis Lakers. Despite being knocked unconscious, Stokes would play in the playoffs against the Detroit Pistons. On the flight home after losing to the Pistons, Stokes suddenly fell ill and {{was rushed to the hospital}} upon landing. As the Pistons swept the Royals, Stokes lapsed into a coma. It was revealed that Stokes suffered encephalopathy, a traumatic brain injury that damaged his <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>center.</b> The injury would leave Maurice Stokes as a quadriplegic without the ability to speak.

40|$|Dopamine (DA) is {{required}} for motor function in vertebrate animals including humans. The striatum, a key <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>center,</b> receives a dense DA innervation and express high levels of DA D 1 receptors (D 1 Rs) and D 2 receptors (D 2 Rs). Other brain areas involved in motor function such as the globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the motor cortex (MC) also receive DA innervation and express DA receptors. Thus, the relative contribution of the striatal and extrastriatal DA systems to the motor function {{has been an important}} question critical for understanding the functional operation of the <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> circuits and also for therapeutic targeting. We have now experimentally addressed this question in the transcription factor Pitx 3 null mutant (Pitx 3 Null) mice that have an autogenic and parkinsonian-like striatal DA denervation and hence supersensitive motor response to DA stimulation. Using DA agonist unilateral microinjection-induced rotation as a reliable readout of motor stimulation, our results show that L-dopa microinjection into the dorsal striatum (DS) induced 5 – 10 times more rotations than that induced by L-dopa microinjection into GPe and SNr, while L-dopa microinjection into the primary MC induced the least number of rotations. Furthermore, our results show that separate microinjection of the D 1 R-like agonist SKF 81297 and the D 2 R-like agonist ropinirole into the DS each induced only modest numbers of rotation, whereas concurrent injection of the two agonists triggered more rotations than the sum of the rotations induced by each of these two agonists separately, indicating D 1 R–D 2 R synergy. These results suggest that the striatum, not GPe, SNr or MC, is the primary site for D 1 Rs and D 2 Rs to synergistically stimulate motor function in L-dopa treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our results also predict that non-selective, broad spectrum DA agonists activating both D 1 Rs and D 2 Rs are more efficacious anti-PD drugs than the current D 2 R agonists...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several years, {{researchers}} at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, under the sponsorship of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have been investigating the ability of motor-operated valves (MOVs) used in Nuclear Power Plants to close or open when subjected to design basis flow and pressure loads. Part of this research addresses the response of a dcpowered motor-operated gate valve to assess whether it will achieve flow isolation and to evaluate whether it will slow down excessively under design-basis conditions and thus fail to achieve the required stroke time. As part of this research, we have developed {{a model of a}} dc motor operating under load and a model of actuator efficiency under load based on a first principle evaluation of the equipment. These models include the effect that reduced voltage at the <b>Motor</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> and elevated containment temperatures have on the performance of a dc powered MOV. The model also accounts for motor torque and speed changes that result from the heatup of the motor during the stroke.

40|$|Injury to {{the spinal}} cord (SCI) can produce a {{constellation}} of problems including chronic pain, autonomic dysreflexia, and motor dysfunction. Neuroplasticity {{in the form of}} fiber sprouting or the lack thereof is an important phenomenon that can contribute to the deleterious effects of SCI. Aberrant sprouting of primary afferent fibers and synaptogenesis within incorrect dorsal horn laminae leads to the development and maintenance of chronic pain as well as autonomic dysreflexia. At the same time, interruption of connections between supraspinal <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>centers</b> and spinal cord output cells, due to lack of successful regenerative sprouting of injured descending fiber tracts, contributes to motor deficits. Similarities in the molecular control of axonal growth of motor and sensory fibers have made the development of cogent therapies difficult. In this study, we discuss recent findings related to the degradation of inhibitory barriers and promotion of sprouting of motor fibers as a strategy for the restoration of motor function and note that this may induce primary afferent fiber sprouting that can contribute to chronic pain. We highlight the importance of careful attentiveness to off-target molecular- and circuit-level modulation of nociceptive processing while moving forward with the development of therapies that will restore motor function after SCI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Cerebral palsy (CP) is a {{group of}} nonprogressive {{disorders}} of movement and posture caused by abnormal development of, or damage to, <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>centers</b> of the brain. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs 1800795, in the promoter region of the interleukin- 6 (IL 6) gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CP by mediating IL- 6 protein levels in amniotic fluid and cord plasma and within brain lesions. This SNP has been associated with other neurological, vascular, and malignant processes as well, often as part of a haplotype block. 				 				 					 						Methods 					To refine the regional genetic association with CP, we sequenced (Sanger) the IL 6 gene and part of the promoter region in 250 infants with CP and 305 controls. 				 				 					 						Results 					We identified a haplotype of 7 SNPs that includes rs 1800795. In a recessive model of inheritance, the variant haplotype conferred greater risk (OR&# 8201;=&# 8201; 4. 3, CI&# 8201;=&# 8201;[2. 0 - 10. 1], p&# 8201;=&# 8201; 0. 00007) than did the lone variant at rs 1800795 (OR&# 8201;=&# 8201; 2. 5, CI&# 8201;=&# 8201;[1. 4 - 4. 6], p&# 8201;=&# 8201; 0. 002).

Conclusions 					The risk haplotype identified in this study overlaps with previously identified haplotypes that include additional promoter SNPs.

40|$|Backgroung and aim: Neck pain is one {{of three}} common {{complains}} of neuromuscular system. There are three subsystem to maintain stability of spine: passive subsystem, active (muscles) subsystem and control subsystem. Detection of postural muscle response during postural perturbation like fast arm movement can be utilized to analyse of postural control. Wearing cervical collars is a way to prevent or cure cervical pain. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of soft cervical collar on movement response and duration of activity and recruitment pattern of cervical muscles. Materials and methods: Twenty healthy young women participated in this study. They flex right shoulder in response to sound stimulus with and without wearing soft cervical collar. Surface Electromyography (EMG) used to assess postural muscle activity in following muscles: Deltoid, Trapezius, Cervical Erector spinae and Sternocleidomastoid. The effect of soft cervical collar on reaction time, onset and duration of activity of cervical muscles was calculated. Results: Wearing soft cervical collar increased reaction time of arm flexion (P< 0. 05) and decreased duration of activity of cervical extensor, trapezius and erector spinae (P< 0. 05). During shoulder flexion with additional load, onset activity of trapezius muscle was significantly earlier than other neck muscles but cervical erector spinae and sternocleidomastoid exhibit coactivation pattern in response to perturbation. Conclusion: During fast arm movement that leads to postural perturbation, soft cervical collar alleviates the response and reduce activity of muscles.

40|$|The Design Team {{continued}} to conference this quarter. Their primary task during this timeframe was to finalize the dryer design {{based on information}} learned from the NDIC Pilot work and detailed design discussions at Barr offices in August. Heyl-Patterson was tasked with incorporating all comments and drafting drawings. They submitted a preliminary proposal which spawned detailed discussions about tube bundle, air locks, and fire suppression systems. The type of fire protection specified dictated the final structural arrangement. Three meetings were spent discussing the pro's and con's of suppression vs. ventilation systems. In the end, the dryer and bucket elevator will have suppression systems and the remaining equipment will be explosion vented. This is in agreement with GRE's current insurer, FM Global. Three inlet airlocks were reduced to two and four outlets were reduced to three. The inlet plenum was subdivided for greater flexibility and sparging air added in the outlet plenum.

Dry & Wet coal conveyors are not completed. The exhaust chimney was installed. An Open House and ribbon cutting took place on August 9 th. GRE project manager gave a presentation of the technology. Joe Strakey, NETL, also spoke. The Open House was attended by Governor Hoevon and Senator Conrad who also spoke about Clean Coal and helped kick-off Blue Flint ethanol and a potential Liquefaction plant. The deign team met the following day to discuss test plan and progress update. Headwaters Energy Incorporated also attended the Open House. A meeting was conducted with them to begin planning for the marketing and finalize our memorandum of understanding. Headwaters still plans to contact all US lignite plants and all bituminous plants who have switched to PRB. Major pieces of equipment received this quarter included the Dryer, Exhaust Fan, additional duct work, and control cabinets...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{designed}} to test the validity of several recent claims concerning {{the nature of the}} visuomotor mechanisms involved in the control of human prehension. The first goal of this research was to test the theory that the reaching and grasping components of a prehensile act are generated through two independent visuomotor channels: one which extracts object location information to control the reaching limb, and another which computes intrinsic object characteristics to determine appropriate hand shaping and guide object recognition (Jeannerod, 1984; Jeannerod 2 ̆ 6 Decety, 1990). This proposal received little support. Thus, {{it was found that the}} control mechanisms underlying transport of the limb and grip formation were affected by similar task constraints (including the size and location of the target object, the availability of visual feedback, and changes in the distal requirements of the task), and that bilateral parietal lesions interfered with these control mechanisms without compromising object recognition ability. These findings suggested that a single visuomotor channel was involved in the control of prehension.;It was also found that onset of hand closure did not coincide with the appearance of any particular kinematic marker in the reaching component. This argued against Jeannerod 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) proposal that coordination between the reach and the grasp is achieved by a center which generates synchronized bursts of activity in two separate visuomotor channels. Moreover, both maximum grip aperture and the timing of the hand 2 ̆ 7 s closure and descent onto the target object were found to be affected by the availability of visual feedback, a finding which suggests that grip formation is not controlled by a feedback-independent, central motor program (cf. Jeannerod, 1984). Finally, evidence was presented to suggest that visuomotor programs undergo rapid decay, but that some information about objects and their locations can nonetheless be stored briefly, although this might involve the activation of two distinct working memory systems.;Taken together, the results are consistent with the notion of a hierarchically-organized <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> <b>center,</b> located in the posterior parietal lobe, which is responsible for optimizing performance under a variety of conditions through the coordination of different effector systems and the anticipation of operating constraints...|$|R
