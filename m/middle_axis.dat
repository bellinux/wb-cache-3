2500|$|A {{number of}} solar panels {{may also be}} mounted {{vertically}} above {{each other in a}} tower, if the zenith distance of the Sun is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the <b>middle</b> <b>axis</b> of a rectangular solar panel. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the [...] "ladder" [...] may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star, meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (building-integrated photovoltaics).|$|E

40|$|The main {{method to}} improve the {{resolution}} of optical system {{is to increase the}} aperture of the optical system, and it is a common method to use the sparse-aperture mirrors to obtain a large aperture primary mirror. The primary mirror of optical system is deployed when it is launched into the orbit, and the deviation between deployed position and design position determines the quality of the optical system. So it is necessary to analyze the position accuracy of segmented mirrors. Sparse-aperture optical system is modeled by optical software Zemax, and by adjusting six degrees of freedom of segmented mirrors can get curves between position error and image quality. The results show that different positions of segmented mirrors can produce different wave-front when they have same position error. Moving along the Z axis, the inner mirrors influence most while the outer ones influence smallest; tilt along the X <b>axis,</b> <b>middle</b> ones have maximum wave-front aberration while the outer ones produce minimum wave-front aberration. When tilt along Y <b>axis,</b> <b>middle</b> segmented mirrors have the smallest wave-front aberration and outer ones have maximum. Two methods are used to distribute the wave-front aberration onto each segmented mirror. One is that according to the relationship curves, distribute the position error to each segmented mirror alone. Another is that each one has same position errors. The final result shows that the former method has a more relax position error when generates the same wave-front aberration. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH</p...|$|R

40|$|Fundamental {{insight into}} the unique {{fluorescence}} and nucleobase-mimicking properties of the fluorescent nucleobase analogues of the tC family is not only vital in explaining the behaviour of these probes in nucleic acid environments, but will also be profitable {{in the development of}} new and improved fluorescent base analogues. Here, temperature-dependent fluorescence quantum yield measurements are used to successfully separate and quantify the temperature-dependent and temperature-independent non-radiative excited-state decay processes of the three nucleobase analogues tC, tC(O) and tC(nitro); all of which are derivatives of a phenothiazine or phenoxazine tricyclic framework. These results strongly suggest that the non-radiative decay process dominating the fast deactivation of tCnitro is an internal conversion of a different origin than the decay pathways of tC and tC(O). tCnitro is reported to be fluorescent only in less dipolar solvents at room temperature, which is explained by an increase in excited-state dipole moment along the main non-radiative decay pathway, a suggestion that applies in the photophysical discussion of large polycyclic nitroaromatics in general. New {{insight into the}} ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces of the isolated tC bases is obtained by means of high level DFT and TDDFT calculations. The S- 0 potential energy surfaces of tC and tCnitro possess two global minima corresponding to geometries folded along the <b>middle</b> sulfur-nitrogen <b>axis</b> separated by an energy barrier of 0. 05 eV as calculated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 + G(2 d, p) level. The ground-state potential energy surface of tC(O) is also predicted to be shallow along the bending coordinate but with an equilibrium geometry corresponding to the planar conformation of the tricyclic framework, which may explain some of the dissimilar properties of tC and tC(O) in various confined (biological) environments. The S- 1 equilibrium geometries of all three base analogues are predicted to be planar. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} tC bases positioned in double-stranded DNA scenarios...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} data on marital endogamy {{by means}} of log-linear modelling {{in an attempt to}} specify changes in the British class structure between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries. The evidence on intermarriage was collected in Rochdale and involves five decennial periods over the hundred year span. A seven class model was used to categorize the data and a succession of log-linear models fitted. The hypotheses examined were taken from the sociological literature. Almost all postulated certain forms of structural transformation in class structures like Britain during this hundred year period. However, the model fitted did not require the inclusion of a term which incorporated changes in class structuration over time and these hypotheses were rejected. Nevertheless, the fitted model did indicate the persistence of a class structure over the period. Examination of the odds ratios and scaled residuals associated with the model fitting suggested that the main lines of class cleavage occurred between the bourgeoisie and the unskilled manual working class and the remainder of the class categories. Conventional dichotomies associated with notions of a <b>middle</b> class/working class <b>axis</b> of class cleavage or a nonmanual/manual axis were not relevant to an explanation of the data presented and this was presented as a problem requiring further research...|$|R
