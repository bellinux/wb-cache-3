5|$|Like most arboviruses, dengue {{virus is}} <b>maintained</b> <b>in</b> nature in cycles that involve {{preferred}} blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The viruses are <b>maintained</b> <b>in</b> {{the forests of}} Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female Aedes mosquitoes—of species other than A. aegypti—to their offspring and to lower primates. In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated A. aegypti. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by A. aegypti and other species of Aedes such as A. albopictus. Both these species had expanding ranges {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.|$|E
5|$|Scheduling {{was left}} up to each team. There were wide variations, both in {{the overall number of}} games played and in the number played against other Association members. Thus, no {{official}} standings were <b>maintained.</b> <b>In</b> addition, football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated with the league. For instance, the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL, not the APFA.|$|E

5|$|The British Army's Brigade of Gurkhas, a {{group of}} units {{composed}} of Nepalese soldiers—although originally including British officers—has {{been a part of}} the Army since 1815.

5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in the 11th century a motte and bailey castle was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} side of the city, but the Norman rulers continued to use the older burh walls, despite the city having expanded beyond these defences in the north and south-east. During the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war a new city wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They were <b>maintained</b> <b>in</b> good condition into the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be <b>maintained.</b> <b>In</b> November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{maintained}} military forces since federation {{as a nation}} in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had <b>maintained.</b> <b>In</b> 1911, the Government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are <b>maintained</b> <b>in</b> operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{commercial}} traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was <b>maintained</b> <b>in</b> good order, and the canal {{was used for}} the transport of potable water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for Somerset County Council to start the restoration of the canal as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when the canal was reopened throughout. Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the canal still transports drinking water for the people of Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|During early Summer 1902, Charles Martel was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron, along with three other battleships and three armored cruisers. The ship did not participate in the annual fleet maneuvers in JulyAugust of the following year. She remained in the Reserve Squadron, which was renamed the Second Squadron in 1906; by that time, she was in the Second Division of the Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Germinet. The ship was <b>maintained</b> <b>in</b> a state of en disponibilité armée, a state of reduced readiness with a minimal crew. Charles Martel was in full commission for three months of the year, and in reserve with a reduced crew for the remainder. She remained in this status for the duration of 1907.|$|E
