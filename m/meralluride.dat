The stop flow technique {{was employed to}} investigate the effects of meraliuride upon sodium, chloride and potassium transport niechanisins in distal segments of the dog nephron. Sodium re-absorption in the distal nephron was inhibited by <b>meralluride.</b> This effect is enhanced with increasing plasma sodium concentrations. It is not an artifact of increased plasma or free flow urine sodium concentrations. Chloride reabsorption was also inhibited by <b>meralluride.</b> However, no inhibition {{was seen in the}} presence of the impermeant sulfate anion. It is concluded that <b>meralluride</b> primarily inhibits sodium reabsorption, resulting in an indirect effect upon chloride reabsorption. In control experiments, meraliuride depressed potassium clearance but did not inhibit potassium secretion during stop flow. However, in dogs chronically loaded with potassium and in dogs given acetazoleamide, <b>meralluride</b> did in-hibit potassium secretion during stop flow. In dogs depleted of potassium, the drug tended to stimulate potassium secretion during stop flow. This latter effect may be due to an in...|$|E

The {{activity of the}} organic mercurials and ethacrynic acid was markedly inhibited by human and dog urine. Antiurease activity could not be detected in the urine of a human and a dog given <b>meralluride</b> by injection. Urine from patients receiving penicillamine also failed to inhibit urease activity. Ascorbic acid inhibited, whereas dehydroascorbic acid enhanced, {{the activity of the}} mercurials, but neither agent altered the inhibitory effect of urine. The lethal effect of <b>meralluride</b> against Proteus occurred at the same concentration at which urease activity was inhibited, but penicillamine inhibited the enzymatic activity without affecting viability of the organism. The data suggest that these sulfhydryl-reactive compounds will not be useful against Proteus infections of the urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|Mitotic {{apparatus}} {{isolated from}} sea urchin eggs {{has been treated}} with <b>meralluride</b> sodium under conditions otherwise resembling those of its isolation. The treatment causes a selective morphological disappearance of microtubules while extracting a major protein fraction, probably consisting of two closely related proteins, which constitutes about 10 % of mitotic apparatus protein. Extraction of other cell particulates under similar conditions yields much less of this protein. The extracted protein closely resembles outer doublet microtubule protein from sea urchin sperm tail in properties considered typical of microtubule proteins: precipitation by calcium ion and vinblastine, electrophoretic mobility in both acid and basic polyacrylamide gels, sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, and, according to a preliminary determination, amino acid composition. An antiserum against a preparation of sperm tail outer doublet microtubules cross-reacts with the extract from mitotic apparatus. On {{the basis of these}} findings it appears that microtubule protein is selectively extracted from isolated mitotic apparatus by treatment with <b>meralluride,</b> and is a typical microtubule protein...|$|E
40|$|Separation of the urinary {{excretory}} {{products of}} the organomercurial diuretic, <b>meralluride</b> (Mercu-hydrin) has been possible using adsorption chromatography. Practically all of the mercury is ex-creted in a form closely resembling the administered <b>meralluride.</b> Most of the excretion occurs within the first 6 hours in both cardiac patients and normal subjects. The amount of mercury ex-creted as degradation products is insufficient to produce diuresis. Therefore, it is concluded that the diuretic action of <b>meralluride</b> depends on the specific organic mercurial molecule. ONE concept for the diuretic action oforganomercurial compounds is that they release inorganic mercury in the body. The inorganic mercury is thought to inhibit the renal tubular enzymes which are responsible for sodium and chloride reabsorption. Although inorganic mercury compounds, such as bi-chloride of mercury, do produce diuresis, they are less potent than organomercurial diuretics. The fact that all organomercurial compounds do not have diuretic action suggests that a specific organomercurial configuration is neces-sary. Furthermore, differences in the potencies of the various organomercurials indicate that their diuretic potency {{is not related to}} their capacity to release inorganic mercury but, instead, is inherent in the organomercurial molecule. Kessler and Pitts 1 have shown that the mercury in the organomercurials is rapidly cleared from the blood and eliminated, whereas the nondiuretic organomercurials are slowly excreted. More direct evidence was presented by Weiner and Miiller 2 when they failed to demonstrate, by polarography, inorganic mer-cury in the urine during mercurial diuresis. These investigators found that mersalyl (Salyrgan) was mainly excreted as a mersalyl cysteine complex. They calculated that less than 12. 5 per cent of the injected mercury was excreted in a significantly altered form. In the current investigation merallurid...|$|E
40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{study of}} the cortical and medullary zones of kidneys of rats injected intraperitoneally with <b>meralluride</b> (a mercurial diuretic) shows that constant structural changes occur in the proximal tubules, but that the distal tubules remain unaltered. In {{the cells of the}} proximal tubule vacuolation and loss of contrast of the apical pole occur due to intracytoplasmic oedema, appearances which may extend as far as the basal pole. The brush border shows separation of the villi {{at the level of the}} implantation base. Mitochondrial swelling occurs with vacuolation of the matrix and disappearance of the cristae. The changes at the level of the glomerulus are variable and consist of clearing of the mitochondrial matrix of the podocytes, enlargement of the vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum and the occurrence of intracytoplasmic osmiophilic masses...|$|E
40|$|Four renal homotransplants {{were carried}} out between cadaver donors and four recipients, {{all of whom were}} in {{terminal}} chronic renal failure. Immune suppression was attempted with azathioprine (Imuran), actinomycin C and prednisone; no radiation was used, nor were the recipient's kidneys, spleen or thymus removed. One patient died with disseminated histoplasmosis at two weeks; another with irreversible homograft rejection at 30 days; a third patient died of septicemia after 9 ½ weeks with stable renal function. The fourth patient, whose transplant had been ischemic for 190 minutes and had not functioned for 2 ½ weeks thereafter, eventually achieved good function which remained unchanged to 7 ½ months. Changes in urinary enzyme excretion and in the I 131 renogram and <b>meralluride</b> scan were of value in assessing homograft rejection...|$|E
40|$|In some {{preliminary}} polarographic experiments {{carried out in}} this laboratory with Dr. R. F. Pitts in 1948, {{it was found that}} the diuretics mersalyl (Salyrgan) and <b>meralluride</b> (Mercupurin) could readily be determined in inorganic electro lytes or in urine. In addition it was observed that the excretion products had different half-wave potentials than the injected diuretics which consequently must have been altered in some way in the body. It W 82 of interest to know whether this polarographically determinable excre tion product represented all of the excreted mercury or if, in addition, some mercury was excreted which did not yield a polarographic wave. For this pur pose a suitable non-polarographic method for the analysis of mercury was de veloped (Weiner and MUller, 1955) after we failed to get satisfactory recoveries with several known procedures. In the mean time important contributions to the polarography of mercury compounds had been made by Stricks and Kolthoff (1953) who investigated the mercury salts of sulfhydryl compounds (Hg(SR) 2...|$|E
40|$|When {{malignant}} cells, {{animal and}} human, were exposed in vitro to solutions of heavy metals oi other selected compounds, {{three types of}} cell blebs were produced: (1) acentric blebs, arising {{from one side of}} the cell, e. g., by chlormerodrin, <b>meralluride</b> sodium, mercuric chloride; (2) symmetrical blebs; which completely enveloped the cell, e. g., by strong silver protein, auric chloride, p-chloromercuribenzoate; (']) scallop blebs, numerous small spherical elevations which completely covered the cell, e. g., by N-ethyl-maleimide, trivalent arsenicals, iodoacetamide. As indicated by vital stains and morphologic appearance, the blebs arose in healthy cells. They also can be made to appear in vivo in ascites tumor cells by intraperitoneal administration of a blebbing agent. All the bleb-producing chemicals have the property of reacting with protein-sulfhydryl groups by alkylation, oxidation or mercaptide formation. The three bleb types have been induced in 8 mouse and 2 rat ascites tumor cells; in 4 human and 1 mouse malignant cell lines; and in 3 normal cell lines grown in tissue culture. In contrast, cells from normal solid tissues of liver, lung, spleen, kidney, testis and brain from mouse, rat and rabbit failed to produce blebs. A possible interpretation for these observations is presented...|$|E
40|$|The renal tubular site {{at which}} organomercurials exert their primary effect on salt {{absorption}} {{has been the}} subject of considerable dispute for many years. The fact that these drugs produced a con-sistent reduction in Tmglucose and TmPAH in man suggested that these agents exerted an influence within the proximal tubule (1, 2). The absence of such changes in the dog, despite comparable diuretic activity, emphasized the hazards of such conclusions (3). Other experimental studies in-dicating that distal tubular functions such as the production of ammonia and titratable acid were not influenced by the administration of mercurials, were also used to imply a primary proximal tu-bular effect (4). Potassium secretion, however, which represents a late distal operation was shown to be depressed by the mercurial agents (5, 6). In hydrated man, it was demonstrated that <b>meralluride</b> produced a prompt increase in the rate of excretion of "nonsolute obligated " wa-ter implying a proximal tubular effect on salt and water absorption (7, 8). On the other hand, other observers reported that the administration of organomercurials to hydrated man and dog did not change the rate of free water clearance (9, 10). Recently, utilizing the stop flow technique, several investigators have concluded that, in the dog, the major site of action of the organic mer-curials is confined to the proximal tubule (11, 12). Alternatively, some investigators concluded that the distal tubule represented the site of mer-curial action because the magnitude of the diure-sis approximated the quantity of salt and water normally absorbed within the distal tubule (13). Others, who observed that the rate of excretion o...|$|E
