40|$|Climatological {{seasonal}} variations of moisture transport and the interannual variations {{associated with the}} annular modes in the Arctic and Antarctic regions are investigated using 15 -year ECMWF reanalysis data. Over the Arctic, there are strong moisture inflows from the Atlantic and Pacific in all seasons. Over the Antarctic, a strong <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> exists around the Antarctic Peninsula in all seasons and another strong inflow exists over the Bellingshausen Sea and the Amundsen Sea in austral autumn and winter. Transient moisture flux is dominant over stationary flux and transient flux variation mainly controls the seasonal variation of precipitation minus evaporation(P-E) in both regions. The {{seasonal variations}} of P-E show a summer maximum in the Arctic and a winter maximum in the Antarctic. It is mainly governed by the seasonal variation of precipitable water variation in the Arctic and transient eddy activity in the Antarctic. The zonal mean poleward and eastward moisture fluxes in high latitudes are positively correlated with annular modes in both regions. Positive polarity of the Arctic Oscillation is associated with enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> from the Atlantic, while positive polarity of the Antarctic Oscillation is associated with enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> west of the Antarctic Peninsula...|$|E

40|$|Extra{{tropical}} {{and tropical}} influences on Tibetan Plateau severe and extreme dry and wet summer months are investigated focussing on the large-scale circulation and using {{results of the}} coupled climate model ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM. A pre-industrial control run and scenario runs for the 4 th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are considered. Tibetan Plateau precipitation in months of wetness and drought is related to atmospheric circulation anomalies in the North-Atlantic/European sector and to sea surface temperature anomalies in the Tropics. Drought on the Tibetan Plateau {{is associated with a}} pronounced wave train bridging Eurasia from the North Atlantic to Asia. Increased transient eddy activity in the North Atlantic storm track has a more south-west to north-east orientation. This supports a high pressure anomaly over the eastern North Atlantic and Scandinavia which excites a cross Eurasian wave train reducing the <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> to the Tibetan Plateau from the Arabian Sea. A concurrent warming in the tropical Indian Ocean increases the low level monsoonal westerlies deviating the moisture transport from the Bay of Bengal towards the Indochinese Peninsula and the Philippines. Wetness on the Tibetan Plateau is dominated by a cooling in the tropical oceans, whereas atmospheric flow is predominantly zonal in the extratropics of North America and Europe. Thus, <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> can reach the Tibetan Plateau via the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the mid-latitude westerlies. Future scenarios show little change of atmospheric flow composites for wetness and dryness; the Tibetan Plateau droughts increase by 10 % for an A 1 B-scenario, while extreme wet summer months are reduced by approximately 1 %. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|E

The high shear causes horizontal vorticity which is tilted within the updraft to become vertical vorticity, and the mass of clouds spins as it gains altitude up to the cap, which can be up to the 55000 ft - 70000 ft above ground for the largest storms, and trailing anvil. The capped, moisture laden air is cooled enough to precipitate as it is rotated toward the cooler region, represented by the turbulent air of the mammatus clouds where the warm air is spilling over top of the cooler, invading air. The cap is formed where shear winds block further uplift for a time, until a relative weakness allows a breakthrough of the cap (an overshooting top); Cooler air to the right in the image may or may not form a shelf cloud, but the precipitation zone will occur where the heat engine of the uplift intermingles with the invading, colder air. As the cooler but drier air circulates into the warm, <b>moisture</b> laden <b>inflow,</b> the cloud base will frequently form a wall, and the cloud base often experiences a lowering, which, in extreme cases, are where tornadoes are formed.|$|R

There is a mean annual inflow of moisture to the atmospheric volume over Greenland through its southeast and southwest sectors, and outflow to the northeast.

By assimilating water vapour profiles of a differential absorption lidar (DIAL) into the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), the <b>inflow</b> <b>moisture</b> in the analysis fields is adjusted and humidity is reduced in a broad region around the flight track. The initial reduction of moisture in the WCB inflow affects the latent heat release along the WCB, as well as the potential vorticity (PV) production at lower levels. This change led to a substantially lower outflow height of the forecasted WCB. Further, the height of the tropopause was reduced up to 20 hPa, which caused a change in the jet stream wind speeds of up to 15 % downstream.

40|$|In Nara City and its vicinities, {{there are}} several Azekuras. The Azekura is an old wooden {{treasure}} house for preserving valuable things of the temple. The Azekura of Shosoin is {{the most famous of}} Azekuras and is keeping many rare treasures in the world during the past about 1200 years in an excellent state of preservation. The Azekura has no pillar and special walls built up by piling long woods (Azeki) with triangle cross-section, and its floor is sufficiently separated away from the ground surface to get good ventilation of air under the floor. Some indoor-meteorological observations and investigations were carried out about the effects of characteristic structures of Azekura on the preservation of valuable treasures, and following results were obtained. 1. Annual variations of air temperature and humidity in Azekura are similar to the respective variations in open air, but daily variations of them are very different between in Azekura and in the open air. The amplitudes of daily variations in Azekura are reduced to about 11 % in air temperature and about 10 % in humidity, compared with the respective amplitudes of daily variations in the open air. Annual mean values of air temperature and humidity in Azekura are about 14 ℃ and 75 % respectively. The climatic feature of Nara basin seems to serve for safekeeping of the treasures in Azekura and then, above annual mean values may be regarded as a standard condition for good preservation of the treasures. 2. The clearances among the woods (Azeki) of walls {{do not seem to be}} changed by the expansion or contraction of each wood caused by the change of open air conditions and then, the flux of air into Azekura through the clearances of them will not be influenced by weather. 3. The amplitude of humidity variation is largely reduced in wooden cases (Karabitsu) put in Azekura. This reduction will be closely related to the hygroscopic property of wooden materials, which contribute to the preservation of valuable treasures in wooden cases. 4.

40|$|The {{stress-strain}} behaviour of a soil {{is crucial}} to the recognition of the mechanism of slope failure. Triaxial tests, composed of isotropically consolidated drained (ICD) and undrained compression (ICU) tests and anisotropically consolidated constant deviatoric stress path (CQD) tests, were carried out with the aim of investigating the stress-strain behaviour of loosely compacted volcanic-derived soils. The fact that the critical states are the same for ICU, ICD and CQD tests may show that the critical state is independent of the above three stress paths. The critical state line, as defined in critical state soil mechanics, is obtained from the e-log p' and q-p' plots {{based on the results of}} the above tests. The initial state of the consolidated specimens at initiation of failure may be classified as dilative or contractive in the light of the locations of the soil state relative to the critical state line. For contractional soils, the increased pore water pressure generated by rainfall infiltration leads to a contractive failure in a drained manner, giving rise to high excess pore water pressure. The excess pore water pressure caused by contraction cannot be dissipated instantly, resulting in a decrease in the shear resistance of the soil. The failure process is rapid. The failed soil mass is prone to flow after failure under the action of gravity due to its high <b>moisture</b> content and <b>inflow</b> of surface runoff and rainwater. For dilational soils, the increased pore water pressure resulting from infiltration leads to dilation, which reduces pore water pressure and thus increases the shear resistance of the soil. However, continued rainfall infiltration may be able to equilibrate the reduction in pore water pressure caused by dilation and, therefore, the dilation or displacement can continue. In Hong Kong, volcanic-derived soil is characterized by high permeability. Both the high permeability of volcanic-derived soil and a shallow failure surface make it possible for the reduction in pore pressure to equilibrate relatively quickly. Therefore, the failure is also rapid, at least for poorly compacted fill slopes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSea surface {{temperature}} (SST) {{is the key}} variable when addressing Sahelian rainfall variability, in turn playing {{a crucial role in}} predictability. In this way, the multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic has been shown to strongly influence the West African Monsoon. On the one hand, interhemispheric SST gradients determine the location of the rain belt within West Africa. On the other hand, the anthropogenic-related warming component in the Mediterranean Sea has been linked to the recovery trend of rainfall in the Sahel after the severe drought experienced from the early 1970 s to the 1990 s. Moreover, at interannual timescales, the teleconnections from several oceanic regions well-known for impacting the Sahel seems to be non-stationary on time. In this context, beyond the tropical ocean basins, the Mediterranean is playing an outstanding role. The impact of a warm Mediterranean on the Sahel is explained in terms of enhanced low-level moisture transport across the Sahara to the south, feeding converge in the Sahel with the associated increase in rainfall. Starting from an observational analysis, we conduct a set of sensitivity experiments to show how the teleconnection between the Mediteranean and the Sahel is enhanced under a warming scenario in the North Atlantic. In this framework we propose a mechanism by which a warm North Atlantic SST background in turn causes a strengthening of the Saharan heat low due to the combination of low-level <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> from both the subtropical North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Under these conditions, rainfall in the Sahel is increased from the improved flux convergence...|$|E

Vegetation cover and composition impose important influences on the regional climate in Africa. Climate-driven changes in vegetation structure {{and the distribution of}} forests versus savannah and grassland may feed back to climate via shifts in the surface energy balance, hydrological cycle and resultant effects on surface pressure and larger-scale atmospheric circulation. We used a regional Earth system model incorporating interactive vegetation–atmosphere coupling to investigate the potential role of vegetation-mediated biophysical feedbacks on climate dynamics in Africa in an RCP 8. 5 -based future climate scenario. The model was applied at high resolution (0. 44 [*]×[*] 0. 44 °) for the CORDEX-Africa domain with boundary conditions from the CanESM 2 general circulation model. We found that increased tree cover and leaf-area index (LAI) associated with a CO 2 and climate-driven increase in net primary productivity, particularly over subtropical savannah areas, not only imposed important local effect on the regional climate by altering surface energy fluxes but also resulted in remote effects over central Africa by modulating the land–ocean temperature contrast, Atlantic Walker circulation and <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> feeding the central African tropical rainforest region with precipitation. The vegetation-mediated feedbacks were in general negative with respect to temperature, dampening the warming trend simulated in the absence of feedbacks, and positive with respect to precipitation, enhancing rainfall reduction over the rainforest areas.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the impacts of}} urbanization on moist convection, we explore how an idealized circular urban island affects the diurnal cycle and spatial distribution of rainfall over urban and surrounding rural areas at the diurnal equilibrium state using large-eddy simulations (LES) performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Compared to the control case where the whole domain is covered by grassland, {{the existence of an}} urban island significantly enhances the rainfall rate over the urban area as the stronger surface heating creates convergence zones and stronger vertical motions over the urban area. A suite of experiments is then conducted to investigate the effects of soil moisture of the surrounding rural land and the urban size on precipitation. Results show that as the rural soil moisture increases, both urban and rural precipitation rates increase almost linearly. This increase is not attributed to the urban heat island (UHI) effect but rather a stronger moisture deficit effect in the urban area creating a stronger <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow.</b> When the urban area becomes larger but the initial available water remains the same in the domain, the UHI effect and moisture deficit effect increase but the total water supply decreases. As a result, the urban rainfall rate increases first and then decreases as the urban size increases. This suggests that there is an ‘optimal’ scale at which the urban rainfall rate is maximized, at least in our modeling framework. Our simulations further suggest that this optimal scale occurs when the urban fraction lies between 1 % and 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Water vapor budget (WVB) {{analysis}} {{is a powerful}} tool for studying processes leading to precipitation (P), since the linkages among atmospheric dynamics, water vapor fields, surface conditions, and P are constrained by the moisture continuity equation. This paper compares WVB calculations over the US Midwest (MW), the US Southern Great Plains (SGP), and the eastern Mediterranean Sea (EM) during their seasons of maximum P. Despite the inter-regional differences in time of year, size of region, and surface characteristics, the WVBs over these regions have common features. First, the change in precipitable water (dPW) is highly correlated with the moisture flux divergence (MFD) and not evaporation (E), implying that atmospheric humidity is affected more by the large-scale atmospheric circulation than land-atmosphere interactions. Second, P is positively correlated with <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> (IF/ A). However, a pronounced difference exists between the North American and the Mediterranean study regions with respect to the processes associated with increased P. For the MW and the SGP, increased P is associated with moisture flux convergence (−MFD) due to increased IF/ A. In contrast, increased P over the EM is not associated with −MFD, since both the outflow (OF/ A) and IF/ A increase at similar rates. Recycling ratio (R) estimates were calculated for each region using an equation previously developed. The moisture recycling methodology involves the externally advected versus locally evaporated contributions to P being expressed in terms of a "bulk" formulation in which IF/ A and OF/ A are defined at the boundaries of the study area. Due to its scale dependence, R cannot be directly compared among the different regions, and a normalization procedure was developed for this comparative study. Its results suggest the normalized R ranges between 12 - 25 % for the study regions, with the value for the oceanic EM being somewhat larger than over the continental MW and SGP...|$|E

The present study examined the detailed rainfall features around the Japan Islands brought by Ty 0423 and the atmospheric processes based on the operational observation data by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), comparing with those in association with Ty 0418 around 7 September 2004. During the stage when Ty 0423 was approaching or landing on {{the western part of}} the Japan Islands, the areal mean precipitation from Kyushu to Kanto District attained much larger than that for Ty 0418, with wider extension of the area with the large amount of precipitation. It is interesting that, although the intense rainfall was observed only at the upstream side of the mountain range from Kyushu to Honshu District for Ty 0418 except for the area near its center, strong rainfall with 10 ~ 30 mm/h persisted in wider regions from the western to the eastern part of the Japan Islands, resulting in the considerably large total rainfall for Ty 0423. As for the case for Ty 0423, the surface front with stable frontal surface was located just to the east of the Ty 0423 center just before its landing at the Japan Islands. Thus, the huge <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> mainly in the eastern region from the typhoon center seems to be redistributed widely over the Japan Islands area associated with the large-scale convergence around the stable frontal surface. In late October, the colder air associated with the high pressure system in the eastern Siberia can cover the northern part of the Japan Sea area as the seasonal march. Such basic field might be favorable for sustaining the synoptic-scale front just around the southern coast of the Japan Islands, even when the strong southerly wind invades associated with the typhoon approach there...|$|E

In this paper, we examine the transport of carbonaceous aerosols, including black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), into the monsoon anticyclone using of ECHAM 6 -HAM, a global aerosol climate model. Further, we investigate impacts of enhanced (doubled) carbonaceous aerosol emissions on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), underneath monsoon circulation and precipitation from sensitivity simulations. The model simulation shows that boundary layer aerosols are transported into the monsoon anticyclone by the strong monsoon convection from the Bay of Bengal, southern slopes of the Himalayas and the South China Sea. Doubling of emissions of both BC and OC aerosols over Southeast Asia (10 ° S– 50 ° N, 65 – 155 ° E) shows that lofted aerosols produce significant warming (0. 6 – 1  K) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) near 400 – 200  hPa and instability in the middle/upper troposphere. These aerosols enhance radiative heating rates (0. 02 – 0. 03  K day − 1) near the tropopause. The enhanced carbonaceous aerosols alter aerosol radiative forcing (RF) at the surface by − 4. 74  ±  1. 42  W m − 2, {{at the top of}} the atmosphere (TOA) by + 0. 37  ±  0. 26  W m − 2 and in the atmosphere by + 5. 11  ±  0. 83  W m − 2 over the TP and Indo-Gangetic Plain region (15 – 35 ° N, 80 – 110 ° E).

Photocatalysis is performed here within a mixed flow reactor involving two fibrous media. The first one is a media coated with TiO 2, SiO 2 and zeolite and the second one is a mixture of TiO 2, SiO 2 and activated carbon (AC). A three-level full factorial design of experiments is performed with TiO 2 – zeolite media. It permits us to determine the impact of two main parameters on adsorption and photocatalysis phenomena; <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> (from 0 to 15 g. m - 3) and pollutant concentration (from 50 to 150 mg/m 3). Adsorption capacity ranges between 4 to 37 mg EH/g of media. It decreases while humidity increases due to competitive adsorption of water and pollutants on photocatalyst sites. Moreover the EH conversion rate increases when inlet concentration decreases. An optimal relative humidity can be deduced to reach an optimal conversion rate for a fixed inlet concentration. Conversion rate values of 24, 39 and 25 % are observed at respective humidity values of 0, 7. 5 and 15 g. m - 3 for a 100 mg/m - 3 inlet concentration. The designs of the experiment are descriptive and predictive for adsorption capacity and degradation rates. With TiO 2 – AC media, experiments are carried out at 15 g. m - 3 of humidity and 100 mg/m 3 of EH inlet concentration. As expected, a high-grade adsorbent media leads to a higher adsorption capacity compared with TiO 2 – zeolite media (130 instead of 4 mg EH/g of media). Nevertheless, even if adsorption capacity is higher, conversion rate decreases (23 % instead of 46 %). Thus, in our experimental conditions, a very high content of adsorbent in the photocatalyst media does not improve the global degradation efficiency probably {{due to the lack of}} desorption of pollutants from AC...|$|E

A key element of this programme was the organization of an international field campaign in June 2011 over the Saharan heat low region, which will include both ground-based and airborne detachments. The Special Observing Period component of FENNEC-France included the implementation of the SAFIRE Falcon 20 to conduct research on the atmospheric boundary layer and the dust cycle of the Sahara, the installation of a remote sensing station in southern Spain, equipped with a backscatter lidar and a sunphotometer, to study the transport of desert dust to Europe, as well as a couple of GPS stations installed in southern Morocco to investigate the <b>moisture</b> <b>inflow</b> from the Atlantic Ocean into the Sahara. For the first time, the ALADIN and AROME models (5 and 24 km grid spacing, respectively) have been implemented operationally to provide forecasts of dust events over the Sahara and parts of the Sahel in June 2011 to assist in planning for airborne operations. This effort was complemented by the forecasts made with the Meso-NH model (5 and 20 km resolution). During the SOP period, the ground-based, airborne and space-borne observations have documented the evolution of dynamic properties of thermodynamic and the atmospheric boundary layer Saharan Africa (Mauritania and Mali) during the installation phase of the Saharan heat low west of the continent as well as the increase in aerosol loading associated with the phase shift of the heat low from east to west. During this period, episodes of intense uplift of desert aerosols associated with various dynamic phenomena (fronts, "Mediterannean surges", "Atlantic inflow" of low-level jets, etc [...] .) have also been documented as well as the export of dust over the Atlantic Ocean. An overview of implementation plan and of the first observational and modelling results acquired during the time of the SOP will be presented...|$|E
