Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse.

The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different temporal and spatial distribution and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic potentiation, promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E
2500|$|Sugar {{addiction}} {{has been}} examined in laboratory rats and it develops {{in the same}} way that drug addiction develops. Eating sugary foods causes the brain to release natural chemicals called opioids and dopamine in the limbic system. Tasty food can activate opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area and thereby stimulate cells that release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The brain recognizes the intense pleasure derived from the dopamine and opioids release and learns to crave more sugar. Dependence is created through these natural rewards, the sugary treats, and the opioid and dopamine released into the synapses of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system.</b> The hippocampus, the insula and the caudate activate when rats crave sugar, which are the same areas that become active when drug addicts crave the drug. Sugar is good because its provides energy but when the body becomes dependent on the sugar intake and the nervous system goes through a change somatic signs of withdrawal begin to appear like chattering teeth, forepaw tremors and head shakes when sugar is not ingested. [...] Morphine tolerance, a measure of addiction, was observed in rats and their tolerance on Morphine was attributed to environmental cues and the systemic effects of the drug. Morphine tolerance does not depend merely on the frequency of pharmacological stimulation, but rather on both the number of pairings of a drug-predictive cue with the systemic effects of the drug. Rats became significantly more tolerant to morphine when they had been exposed to a paired administration than those rats that were not administered morphine along with a drug-predictive cue.|$|E

In addition to controlling satiety, leptin suppresses the reward value of food, which {{is controlled by the}} <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine (DA) <b>system.</b> Previous results from leptin-deficient ob/ob animals suggest that chronic leptin deficiency decreases DA content in the <b>mesolimbic</b> DA <b>system,</b> thereby decreasing the response to amphetamine (AMPH).

40|$|SummaryThe lateral {{hypothalamic}} area (LHA) acts {{in concert}} with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and other components of the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine (DA) <b>system</b> to control motivation, including the incentive to feed.

We show that leptin directly regulates a population of leptin receptor (LepRb) -expressing inhibitory neurons in the LHA and that leptin action via these LHA LepRb neurons decreases feeding and body weight. Furthermore, these LHA LepRb neurons innervate the VTA, and leptin action on these neurons restores VTA expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in DA production along with mesolimbic DA content in leptin-deficient animals.

40|$|The {{development}} of successful pharmacotherapeutics {{for the treatment}} of alcoholism is predicated upon understanding the biological action of alcohol. A limitation of the alcohol research field has been examining the effects of alcohol only and ignoring the multiple biological active metabolites of alcohol. The concept that alcohol is a ‘pro-drug’ is not new. Alcohol is readily metabolized to acetaldehyde within the brain. Acetaldehyde is a highly reactive compound that forms a number of condensation products, including salsolinol and iso-salsolinol (acetaldehyde and dopamine). Recent experiments have established that numerous metabolites of ethanol do have direct CNS action, and could, in part or whole, mediate the reinforcing actions of alcohol within the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system.</b> The <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system</b> originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projects to forebrain regions that include the nucleus accumbens (Acb) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and is thought to be the neurocircuitry governing the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. Within this neurocircuitry there is convincing evidence that; 1) biologically active metabolites of alcohol can directly or indirectly increase the activity of VTA dopamine neurons, 2) alcohol and alcohol metabolites are reinforcing within the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system,</b> 3) inhibiting the alcohol metabolic pathway inhibits the biological consequences of alcohol exposure, 4) alcohol consumption can be reduced by inhibiting/attenuating the alcohol metabolic pathway in the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system,</b> 5) alcohol metabolites can alter neurochemical levels within the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system,</b> and 6) alcohol interacts with alcohol metabolites to enhance the actions of both compounds.

40|$|Rationale: Auditory {{filtering}} disturbances, {{as measured}} in the sensory gating and prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigms, {{have been linked to}} aberrant auditory information processing and sensory overload in schizophrenic patients. In both paradigms, the response to the second stimulus (S 2) is attenuated by an inhibitory effect of the first stimulus (S 1). Dopamine (DA) agonists have been found to reduce gating of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and PPI in healthy human subjects and in rats. These effects have been linked to DA hyperactivity in the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system.</b> A non-invasive approach in studying the role of the DA system in PPI and AEP gating is to compare rat genotypes that are marked by distinct DA systems. Objectives: Several questions were asked in the present study. Are PPI and AEP gating disturbed in (a) rats that are marked by a relatively high DA reactivity of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system,</b> namely apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) and WAG/Rij rats or in (b) rats that are marked by a relatively high DA activity of the nigrostriatal system, namely apomorphine-unsusceptible (APO-UNSUS) and ACI rats? Moreover, is the particular DA balance (c) between the nigrostriatal and <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system</b> related to deficits in PPI and AEP gating? Methods: For this purpose, the above-mentioned four rat genotypes (APO-SUS, APO-UNSUS, ACI and WAG/Rij) that vary in DA balance between both systems, were compared in the AEP gating paradigm. PPI was only {{measured in the}} ACI and WAG/Rij rats, since it has already been shown in a previous study that APO-SUS rats show diminished PPI as compared to rats of the APO-UNSUS genotype. Results: AEP gating of the vertex N 50 was significantly reduced in WAG/Rij rats as compared to the remaining three rat genotypes (APO-SUS, APO-UNSUS and ACI). No PPI deficits were found in the ACI and WAG/Rij rats, although ACI rats had a significantly higher basal startle amplitude. Conclusions: The PPI deficit in APO-SUS and not in the other genotypes, suggests that especially a relatively high DA reactivity of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system,</b> together with a relatively low activity of the nigrostriatal system, contributes to this deficit. In contrast, the N 50 gating deficit in WAG/Rij rats and not in the other genotypes suggests that a relatively high DA activity of the nigrostriatal system together with a relatively high DA reactivity of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system</b> is necessary for the presence of a N 50 gating deficit. On the basis of these results we have concluded that both auditory filtering processes are differently regulated by DA in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} underlying ethanol-induced {{activation of}} the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system</b> are not fully understood, but increased extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) {{has been shown to}} involve nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Basal activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is under the influence of GABAergic neurotransmission, and the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the involvement of nAChRs in mediating acute ethanol effects on GABAergic activity in subregions of the brain reward system. Multi-electrode in vivo recordings were made in the VTA and nAc of awake and behaving C 57 BL 6 /J mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline or ethanol (2. 0  g/kg), combined with, or without, pre-injection of the non-competitive nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (1. 0  mg/kg). Ethanol significantly decreased the activity of quinpirole-insensitive slow-spiking and fast-spiking units in both the VTA and the nAc as compared to saline injection. Pre-treatment with mecamylamine inhibited the rate-inhibiting properties of ethanol in the VTA, but not in the nAc. The data presented here show that ethanol depresses the activity of quinpirole-insensitive, putative GABAergic neurons, in the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system</b> of mice, and that nAChRs contribute to this modulation. This finding, taken together with previous microdialysis studies, supports an involvement of GABAergic neurons and nAChRs in ethanol's interaction with the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopamine <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|Activity of the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopaminergic <b>system</b> was {{investigated}} in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol administration by single-cell extracellular recordings from dopaminergic neurons of the ventrotegmental area, coupled with antidromic identification from the nucleus accumbens, and by microdialysis-technique experiments in the nucleus accumbens. Spontaneous firing rates, spikes per burst, and absolute burst firing but not the number of spontaneously active neurons were found drastically reduced; whereas absolute and relative refractory periods increased in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol treatment as compared with chronic saline-treated controls. Consistently, dopamine outflow in the nucleus accumbens and its acid metabolites were reduced after abruptly stopping chronic ethanol administration. All these changes, as well as ethanol-withdrawal behavioral signs, were reversed by ethanol administration. This reversal suggests that the abrupt cessation of chronic ethanol administration plays a causal role in the reduction of mesolimbic dopaminergic activity seen in the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome. Results indicate that during the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome the <b>mesolimbic</b> dopaminergic <b>system</b> is tonically reduced in activity, as indexed by electrophysiological and biochemical criteria.

40|$|Dopaminergic {{neurotransmission}} {{has been}} shown to participate in the control of absence epilepsy. This type of epilepsy, a generalized non-convulsive form, is associated with bursts of bilateral synchronous spike wave discharges (SWDs) recorded in the EEG. In a previous study, it was suggested that two features of the apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) rat genotype, a relatively low dopaminergic reactivity of the nigrostriatal system and relatively high dopaminergic reactivity of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system,</b> contribute to the high incidence of SWDs. Indeed, apomorphine-unsusceptible (APO-UNSUS) rats, characterized by opposite dopaminergic features, show considerably less SWDs than APO-SUS rats. The first goal {{of the present study was}} to assess the baseline SWD incidence in four rat genotypes (WAG/Rij, ACI, APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS) in order to replicate previous findings. It was expected that both the APO-SUS and WAG/Rij rats would show a considerably higher SWD incidence in comparison to the APO-UNSUS and ACI rats. For this purpose, rats were registered for a 19 hour period. Assuming that haloperidol decreases dopaminergic transmission in the nigrostriatal system via inhibition of the dopamine receptors and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system</b> via inhibition of the noradrenergic receptors, it was postulated that haloperidol would enhance the difference in dopaminergic reactivity between both systems in favor of the accumbens. Therefore, the second purpose in the present study was to investigate whether haloperidol (2 mg/kg, IP) could further potentiate SWD incidence when injected in the APO-SUS rats, already characterized by a relatively low dopaminergic reactivity of the nigrostriatal system and relatively high dopaminergic reactivity of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system,</b> in comparison to the APO-UNSUS rat genotype. Finally, the third aim was to study if another epileptic rat genotype, the WAG/Rij, would show similar increases in SWD incidence following an injection with haloperidol as expected for the APO-SUS. First, previous findings were replicated: the value of the hourly number of SWDs decreased in the following order: APO-SUS>WAG/Rij>APO-UNSUS and ACI. Secondly, earlier data were extended by the fact that the APO-SUS responded to a systemic injection of haloperidol with an increase in SWD number and duration, in contrast to the APO-UNSUS rats. The hypothesis that the SWD incidence would be mostly affected by haloperidol in the APO-SUS rats, was confirmed by these findings. It is suggested that haloperidol increases the SWD incidence in APO-SUS rats by enhancing the difference between the dopaminergic reactivity in the nigrostriatal and <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, further research is required to provide evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the relative dominance of the dopaminergic <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>system</b> is smaller in WAG/Rij than in APO-SUS...|$|E

The question {{in the present study was}} to what extent certain dopaminergic properties are pathognomonic for epileptic rats. Therefore, behavioral responses were assessed in order to investigate the dopaminergic properties in the four rat genotypes. Apomorphine-induced gnawing data imply that the dopamine activity of the nigrostriatal system in the WAG/Rij rats is higher than in APO-SUS but lower than in the ACI and APO-UNSUS rats.

All saline pretreated rats had significant increases in DA levels compared to baseline levels and there were no difference in the age of pretreatment. Rats pretreated with cocaine as adults also had significant increases in DA levels after sucrose. Interestingly, sucrose intake significantly enhanced DA levels in cocaine pretreated adolescent rats. The results from this experiment clearly show that in rats pretreated with cocaine during adolescence there is an enhance response of the DAergic system in response to a naturally reinforcing substance therefore; cocaine exposure during adolescence results in persistent long term changes in the mesolimbic pathway. Future studies need to ascertain the underlying mechanisms and their role in the process of addiction...|$|E

40|$|SummaryLeptin acts on leptin {{receptor}} (LepRb) -expressing neurons {{throughout the}} brain, but the roles for many populations of LepRb neurons in modulating energy balance and behavior remain unclear. We {{found that the}} majority of LepRb neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contain neurotensin (Nts). To investigate the physiologic role for leptin action via these LepRbNts neurons, we generated mice null for LepRb specifically in Nts neurons (Nts-LepRbKO mice). Nts-LepRbKO mice demonstrate early-onset obesity, modestly increased feeding, and decreased locomotor activity. Furthermore, consistent with the connection of LepRbNts neurons with local orexin (OX) neurons and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), Nts-LepRbKO mice exhibit altered regulation of OX neurons and the <b>mesolimbic</b> DA <b>system.</b> Thus, LHA LepRbNts neurons mediate physiologic leptin action on OX neurons and the <b>mesolimbic</b> DA <b>system,</b> and contribute importantly to the control of energy balance...|$|R
