50|$|Processing {{contaminants}} {{are generated}} during {{the processing of}} foods (e.g., heating, fermentation). They are absent in the raw materials, and are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. The presence of these contaminants in processed foods cannot be entirely avoided. Technological processes can be adjusted and/or optimized, however, {{in order to reduce}} the levels of formation of processing contaminants. Examples are: nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heterocyclic amines, histamine, acrylamide, furan, benzene, trans fat, 3-MCPD, semicarbazide, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and ethyl carbamate. There is also the possibility of metal chips from the processing equipment contaminating food. These can be identified using <b>metal</b> <b>detection</b> <b>equipment.</b> In many conveyor lines, the line will be stopped, or when weighing the product with a Check weigher, the item can be rejected for being over- or underweight or because small pieces of metal are detected within it.|$|R
40|$|Issue: One of {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} of recovered wood waste supplies is ferrous metal. One can find ferrous metal within crates, pallets, construction and demolition debris as nails, screws, staples and other hardware. Larger pieces such as scrap metal can also be found within the wood waste supply. Other sources of metal contaminant include damaged parts from the processing equipment (for example, sections of chain, bolts, and tools). Metal contaminants create problems for processing equipment. For example, chippers are sensitive to even the smallest pieces of metal. Even the sturdiest hog can receive serious damage from a piece of metal. Most importantly, to safeguard against damage to the equipment, detect ferrous metals at the in-feed of certain critical pieces of process equipment, like sizereduction equipment. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends wood waste processors install a <b>metal</b> <b>detection</b> system upstream of sensitive or critical process <b>equipment.</b> Generally, <b>metal</b> <b>detection</b> <b>equipment</b> is installed in a conveyor system. The basic equipment consists of a section of metal free conveyor trough, usually fiberglass, that contains a metal detecting coil. The detector is activated by the presence of magnetic or non-magnetic metal in the material flow. Any metal passing over the coil produces an electronic signal that activates an alarm system. The alarm usually sets off a warnin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a new type}} metal detector measurement system based on linear Hall-effect elements. This system adopts a low voltage DC power supply, which drives a U type (or C type) core coil to generate a magnetic field space. Two linear Hall-effect elements are placed {{at the center of}} core coil measurement section. With the differential operational testing method, the sensing signal is collected and displayed with SCM system. In the paper, we analyze the feasibility of the measurement system in theory. Further a practical measurement device is designed and produced to verify the theoretical analysis. Experiments data shows that, within a sensing gap between 0. 5 mm and 3 mm, this new Hall-effect element <b>metal</b> <b>detection</b> <b>equipment</b> could effectively resolute nondestructive metal and the damage metal with small cracks, especially sensitive to the longitudinal crack. As a conclusion, this metal detector has several advantages such as simple structure, small volume, low cost, no radiation, so that it would be convenient for production, carrying and application. The new type metal detector measurement system proposed in this paper has important significance for industrial and manufacturing production testing and maintenance of equipment...|$|R
40|$|Guns {{and knives}} have imposed a {{significant}} threat to public safety. Based on the electromagnetic {{characteristics of the}} materials of guns and knivesâ€™, techniques concerning Electromagnetics (EM) e. g. walk-through <b>metal</b> <b>detection</b> <b>equipment</b> and X-ray and THz screening system {{have been used in}} an effort to detect and characterise them. Different EM frequencies for metallic object detection have demonstrated different merits. This paper reports the ongoing investigation of RF measurement for metallic object detection using pulse modulation excitation which consists of multiple frequency harmonics with the centre frequency varying within 1 - 12 GHz. The frequency response and resonance frequency behaviour of object position, object shape, rotation and multiple objects have been tested and analysed. A system utilising the pulse-modulated RF mode and sweep-frequency mode has been set up to implement sensing of metal items at a standoff distance more than 1 meter. Through a series of experimental investigations, it can be found that the positions of the metal items have significant effect on the spectrum profiles of received RF signals. Such effect presents a modulation pattern in frequency domain, in consequence of which new features have been investigated in order to implement detection and characterisation of metallic objects...|$|R
50|$|About {{the time}} of the disaster, the {{technicians}} at Deutsche Bahn's maintenance facility in Munich used only standard flashlights for visual inspection of the tyres, instead of <b>metal</b> fatigue <b>detection</b> <b>equipment.</b> Previously, advanced testing machines had been used; however, as the equipment generated many false positive error messages, it was considered unreliable and its use was discontinued. During the week prior to the Eschede disaster, three separate automated checks indicated that a wheel was defective. Investigators discovered, from a maintenance report generated by the train's on-board computer, that two months prior to the Eschede disaster, conductors and other train staff filed eight separate complaints about the noises and vibrations generated from the bogie with the defective wheel; the company did not replace the wheel. Deutsche Bahn said that its inspections were proper at the time and that the engineers could not have predicted the wheel fracture.|$|R
