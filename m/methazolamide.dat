40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors <b>methazolamide</b> and acetazolamide (3 mg kg− 1, i. v.) on the steady-state hypoxic ventilatory response in 10 anaesthetized cats. In five additional animals, we studied the effect of 3 and 33 mg kg− 1 <b>methazolamide.</b> The steady-state hypoxic ventilatory response was described by the exponential function: where V̇I is the inspired ventilation, G is hypoxic sensitivity, D is the shape factor and A is hyperoxic ventilation. In the first group of 10 animals, <b>methazolamide</b> did not change parameters G and D, while A increased from 0. 86 ± 0. 33 to 1. 30 ± 0. 40 l min− 1 (mean ± s. d., P = 0. 003). However, the subsequent administration of acetazolamide reduced G by 44 % (control, 1. 93 ± 1. 32; acetazolamide, 1. 09 ± 0. 92 l min− 1, P = 0. 003), while A did not show a further change.

This {{study was designed to}} compare the effects of <b>methazolamide,</b> another CAI and structurally similar to acetazolamide, concerning its efficacy on HAPE. Therefore, 6 female beagle dogs went through four experiments. Adjacent to a control group without any medicamentous intervention, one group with administration of acetazolamide i. v. (2 mg/kg/h), one group with administration of <b>methazolamide</b> i. v. (1 mg/kg/h) and a fourth group with a higher dose of <b>methazolamide</b> i. v. (3 mg/kg/h) was examined over 3 hours. The intervention groups were divided in a first hour of normoxic breathing, followed by two hours of breathing a gas mixture capable to down the arterial pO 2 to a level of 36 - 39 mmHg. Due to the conscious spontaneously breathing, all systemic humoral and neural regulatory mechanisms remained intact. A number of ventilatory and gas-exchange measurements in conjunction with the pulmonary vascular and systemic hemodynamic data were made. In addition, a number of humoral and renal measurements were made because CA inhibitors cause diuresis and mild extracellular volume depletion, which evoke changes in circulating salt and waterregulating hormones, angiotensin II, which is known to have vasoactive effects in the pulmonary circulation. In the control group, a rise in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was shown as physiologic reaction to a hypoxic stimulus. Acetazolamide in the dose of 2 mg/kg/h was capable to reduce the rise in mPAP, consistent with earlier results of the laboratory. <b>Methazolamide</b> has a weaker or rather slower effect on the reduction of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction than acetazolamide, in both dosages.

This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of <b>methazolamide,</b> an anti-carbonic anhydrase drug, for treating patients with AS. Methods: Two patients, called as S and L, were diagnosed with active AS based on BASDAI and BASFI assessments, radiographic data and other clinical indices. They took <b>methazolamide</b> tablets at a dose of 25 mg twice every day. Results : Patient S's BASDAI score fell from 5. 4 to 4. 4, while patient L's BASDAI fell from 2. 4 to 2. Patient S's BASFI score change from 2. 7 to 2. 9, while patient L's BASFI score fell from 1. 2 to 0. 2. The ESR values of patient S were considerably reduced, while the ESR value of patient L remained unchanged and in the normal range. The calcium concentration of patient S decreased from 3. 05 mmol/L to 2. 39 mmol/L.

Differentiation between effects in the pars recta and in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TALH) was achieved by comparing responses to the diuretics when using a standard perfusate, designed to mimic native late proximal tubular fluid, and a low-sodium perfusate, designed to block net sodium reabsorption in the pars recta. With the standard perfusate, <b>methazolamide</b> caused decreases in sodium reabsorption (J(Na)) and water reabsorption (J(V)); with the low-sodium perfusate, a modest effect on J(Na) persisted, suggesting that carbonic anhydrase inhibition reduces sodium reabsorption in both the pars recta and the TALH. The effects of chlorothiazide were very similar to those of <b>methazolamide</b> with both the standard and low-sodium perfusates, suggesting that chlorothiazide also inhibits sodium reabsorption in the pars recta and TALH, perhaps through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. With the standard perfusate, both frusemide and bumetanide produced the expected large decreases in J(Na), but J(V) was also lowered. With the low-sodium perfusate, the inhibitory effects of the loop diuretics, particularly those of frusemide, were substantially reduced, while net potassium secretion was found. These observations indicate that a significant component of the effect of frusemide (and possibly of bumetanide) on overall sodium reabsorption is located in the pars recta, and that loop diuretics induce potassium secretion in the TAL...|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that Long-Evans rats can be operantly trained to discriminate inspired CO 2 concentrations as low as 0. 5 %. This ability has been proposed {{to be due to}} the presence of CO 2 -sensitive olfactory receptors that contain the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). The objectives of the present study were as follows: 1) to determine whether Zucker rats could be operantly conditioned to discriminate low concentrations of CO 2 from control air and 2) to determine the rats ’ CO 2 detection thresholds before and after nasal perfusion of mammalian Ringers or <b>methazolamide,</b> a CA inhibitor. Rats were operantly trained to discriminate between 25 % CO 2 and control air (0 % CO 2) and were then subjected to various CO 2 concentrations (0. 5 – 12. 5 %) to determine their CO 2 detection thresholds. The average (±standard error of mean) baseline CO 2 detection threshold of 7 Zucker rats was 0. 48 ± 0. 07 % CO 2, whereas the average CO 2 detection thresholds after nasal perfusion of either mammalian Ringers or 10 ÿ 2 M <b>methazolamide</b> were 1. 41 ± 0. 30 % and 5. 92 ± 0. 70 % CO 2, respectively. The average CO 2 detection threshold after <b>methazolamide</b> was significantly greater (P < 0. 0001) than the baseline detection threshold. These findings demonstrate that like Long–Evans rats, Zucker rats can be trained to discriminate low concentrations of CO 2 and that inhibition of nasal CA reduces the ability of the rats to detect low concentrations (3. 5 % and below) but not higher concentrations of CO 2 (12. 5 %).

Ther. 163 : 431 - 438, 1968. The anticonvulsant actions of CO 2 and inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase show the following similarities: 1) they are antagonized by reserpine in both rats and mice; 2) action is restored {{by the administration}} of dl-dopa to reserpine-treated mice, indicating involvement of catecholamines; and 3) in rats, the antagonistic action of reserpine is surmountable by both agents.

Treatment with <b>methazolamide</b> followed by CO 2 pro-duces a greater anticonvulsant effect in mice and possibly also in rats than would be expected {{on the basis of}} a similar joint action. This phenomenon most probably is due to the enhancement of the anticonvulsant effect of <b>methazolamide</b> by the acidosis produced by equilibration with CO 2.

Using amperometric recordings, we measured catecholamine (CAT) secretion from cells inAMslices of neonatal and adult rats perfused with solutions bubbled with different concentrations of CO 2. The secretory activity augmented from 1. 74 _ 0. 19 pC/min at 5 % CO 2 to 6. 36 _ 0. 77 pC/min at 10 % CO 2. This response to CO 2 was dose dependent and appeared without changes in extracellular pH, although it was paralleled by a drop in intracellular pH. Responsiveness to hypercapnia was higher in neonatal than in adult slices. The secretory response to hypercapnia required extracellular Ca 2 _ influx. Both the CO 2 -induced internal pH drop and increase in CAT secretion were markedly diminished by <b>methazolamide</b> (2 _M), a membrane-permeant carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor. Wedetected the presence of twoCAisoforms (CAI and CAII) in neonatalAMslices by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR. The expression of these enzymes decreased in adultAMtogether with the disappearance of responsiveness to CO 2. In patch-clamped chromaffin cells, hypercapnia elicited a depolarizing receptor potential, which led to action potential firing, extracellular Ca 2 _ influx, and CAT secretion.

40|$|Purpose: Bicarbonate {{transport}} {{plays a role}} in {{aqueous humor}} (AH) secretion. The authors examined bicarbonate transport mechanisms and carbonic anhydrase (CA) in porcine nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (NPE). Methods: Cytoplasmic pH (pHi) was measured in cultured porcine NPE loaded with BCECF. Anion exchanger (AE), sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC), and CA were examined by RT-PCR and immunolocalization. AH secretion was measured in the intact porcine eye using a fluorescein dilution technique. Results: Anion exchanger AE 2, CAII, and CAIV were abundant in the NPE layer. In cultured NPE superfused with a CO 2 / HCO 3 - -free HEPES buffer, exposure to a CO 2 /HCO 3 - -containing buffer caused rapid acidification followed by a gradual increase in pHi. Subsequent removal of CO 2 /HCO 3 - with HEPES buffer caused rapid alkalinization followed by a gradual decrease in pHi. The rate of gradual alkalinization after the addition of HCO 3 - /CO 2 was inhibited by sodium-free conditions, DIDS, and the CA inhibitors acetazolamide and <b>methazolamide</b> but not by the Na-H exchange inhibitor dimethylamiloride or low-chloride buffer. The phase of gradual acidification after removal of HCO 3 - /CO 2 was inhibited by DIDS, acetazolamide, <b>methazolamide,</b> and low-chloride buffer. DIDS reduced baseline pHi. In the intact eye, DIDS and acetazolamide reduced AH secretion by 25 % and 44 %, respectively. Conclusions: The results suggest the NPE uses a Na+ -HCO- 3 cotransporter to import bicarbonate and a Cl -/HCO 3 - exchanger to export bicarbonate. CA influences the rate of bicarbonate transport. AE 2, CAII, and CAIV are enriched in the NPE layer of the ciliary body, and their coordinated function may contribute to AH secretion by effecting bicarbonate transport into the eye.

In an isolated-perfused rat lung model, alveolar fluid reabsorption significantly decreased during high CO 2 exposure, which was not prevented by carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Thus, we provide evidence that CAII is expressed in rat alveolar epithelial cells and does not regulate lung alveolar fluid reabsorption during hypercapnia...|$|E
40|$|E 7070 [N-(3 -chloro- 7 -indolyl) - 1, 4 -benzenedisulfonamide] is an anticancer drug {{candidate}} under clinical {{development for the}} treatment of several types of cancers. We prove here that this compound also acts as a potent carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor. Similarly to the clinically used drugs acetazolamide, <b>methazolamide</b> and topiramate, E 7070 showed inhibition constants in the range of 15 - 31 nM against isozymes I, II and IX, being slightly less effective as a CA IV inhibitor (Ki of 65 nM). The X-ray crystal structure of the adduct of hCA II with E 7070 revealed unprecedented interactions between the inhibitor and the active site, with three different conformations of the chloroindole fragment of the inhibitor interacting with different amino acid residues/water molecules of the enzyme. A superimposition of these conformations with those of other sulfonamide/sulfamate CA inhibitors indicated that similar regions of the hCA II active site could be involved in the interaction with inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{of a newly}} cloned coral carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4. 2. 1. 1) has been investigated {{with a series of}} sulfonamides, including some clinically used derivatives (acetazolamide, <b>methazolamide,</b> ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, benzolamide, and sulpiride, or indisulam, a compound in clinical development as antitumor drug), as well as the sulfamate antiepileptic topiramate. Some simple amino-/hydrazine-/hydroxy-substituted aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides have also been included in the study. All types of activity have been detected, with low potency inhibitors (KIs in the range of 163 – 770 nM), or with medium potency inhibitors (KIs in the range of 75. 1 – 105 nM), whereas ethoxzolamide, several clinically used sulfonamides and heterocyclic compounds showed stronger potency, with KIs in the range of 16 – 48. 2 nM. These inhibitors may be useful to better understand the physiological role of the Stylophora pistillata CA (STPCA) in corals and its involvement in biomineralisation in this era of global warming...|$|E
40|$|Periplasmic α-carbonic anhydrase of Helicobacter pylori (HpαCA), an oncogenic {{bacterium}} in {{the human}} stomach, is essential for its acclimation to low pH. It catalyses the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate using Zn(II) as the cofactor. In H. pylori, Neisseria spp., Brucella suis and Streptococcus pneumoniae this enzyme is the target for sulfonamide antibacterial agents. We present structural analysis correlated with inhibition data, on the complexes of HpαCA with two pharmacological inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrases, acetazolamide and <b>methazolamide.</b> This analysis reveals that two sulfonamide oxygen atoms of the inhibitors are positioned proximal to the putative location of the oxygens of the CO 2 substrate in the Michaelis complex, whilst the zinc-coordinating sulfonamide nitrogen occupies {{the position of the}} catalytic water molecule. The structures are consistent with acetazolamide acting as site-directed, nanomolar inhibitors of the enzyme by mimicking its reaction transition state. Additionally, inhibitor binding provides insights into the channel for substrate entry and product exit. This analysis has implications for the structure-based design of inhibitors of bacterial carbonic anhydrases...|$|E
40|$|Acetazolamide is {{a useful}} {{prophylactic}} for acute mountain sickness causing marked reduction in headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, etc. Improvements correlate with increased arterial oxygen concentrations, reduction in proteinuria and peripheral oedema and other objective measures of acute mountain sickness. Evidence that Acetazolamide is beneficial for pulmonary oedema or cerebral oedema is scanty because of the lower frequency of these severe forms of mountain sickness. Dexamethasone, used prophylactically, also reduces the symptoms of acute mountain sickness partly due to its euphoric effect. Use of Acetazolamide {{as a treatment for}} established acute mountain sickness has been investigated. Large doses of Acetazolamide increase arterial oxygen levels over a few hours and this leads to a reduction of symptoms but data is limited and faster acting carbonic anhydrides inhibitors such as <b>Methazolamide</b> may be preferable in an emergency situation. There is no comparison of the effectiveness of Acetazolamide with other drugs used for treating acute mountain sickness such as steroids and calcium channel blocking drugs. Also, there is no data on drug combinations which could have additive effects and thereby be more beneficial than individual drugs...|$|E
40|$|Acetazolamide, <b>methazolamide,</b> and {{spironolactone}} taken prophylactically generally {{produce a}} reduction in the occurrence of symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), but are not a panacea. Such prophylactic use may indirectly improve exercise performance due to the alleviation of A M S symptoms. Dexamethasone, phenytoin, and furosemide effectiveness remains uncertain, and more controlled studies are indicated. Antacids apparently provide no relief from AMS. Valium is contraindicated at altitude because it produces mind altering effects at a time when preservation of mental competence is critical. A report claiming the usefulness of nifedipine in treating High A ltitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) during a mountain climb warrants further investigation. Partial alleviation of the presumably synergestic cold-air and exercise-induced asthma can be achieved in many so afflicted by premedication with cromolyn sodium or its combination with terbutaline sulphate. Attempts to use thyroid hormone or triiodothyronine for the stimulation of heat production and peripheral vasodilators for increasing skin and other peripheral temperatures in order to prevent cold injury to tissue have thus far yielded inconclusive results...|$|E
40|$|Carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors are {{effective}} in channelopathies possibly by opening the Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannels. However, the in vivo effects of these drugs in KC-deficient rats, the animal model of familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis(hypokalaemic-PP), are currently unknown. Measures of insulin-responses, serum electrolytes levels and patch-clamp experiments were therefore performed inKC-deficient rats treated in vivo with dichlorphenamide (DCP), ethoxzolamide (ETX), hydrochlorthiazide (HCT), <b>methazolamide</b> (MTZ), bendroflumethiazide (BFT) and acetazolamide (ACTZ). Ten days treatments ofKC-deficient rats with DCP, BFT, ETX and ACTZ (5. 6 mg/kg per day) restored the serum [KC] to control values and prevented the insulin-induced paralysis. In ex vivo experiments, the carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors enhanced the activity of Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannels with the order of efficacy: ACTZOBFTOETXODCP. In contrast, HCT and MTZ failed to stimulate the Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannels and to prevent the hypokalaemia and paralysis. At the concentration of 1 mg/kg per day, all these drugs failed to ameliorate the hypokalaemic-PP symptoms. The activation of Ca 2 C-activated-KCchannel {{in addition to the}} mild diuretic effect explained the efficacy of ACTZ and DCP in KC-deficient rats and in familial hypokalaemic-PP...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous adverse drug {{reactions}} (cADRs) include mild maculopapular exanthems (MPE), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), {{toxic epidermal necrolysis}} (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia {{and systemic}} symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). We used HLA high-resolution genotyping and genome wide association analysis (GWAS) to identify the genetic markers for cADRs induced by common culprit drugs in Han Chinese population. To further understand the immunopathogenesis of cADRs, and {{with the goal of}} developing treatment strategies, we compared the expression of cytoxic cytokines between the patients with cADRs and normal controls. Our data suggested that the carbamazepine induced SJS/TEN, allopurinol induced CADRs, <b>methazolamide</b> induced SJS/TEN and SASP induced DRESS were respectively strongly associated with HLA-B* 15 : 02, HLA-B* 58 : 01, HLA-B* 59 : 01 and HLA-B* 13 : 01. In addition, increased expression of cytotoxic cytokines in sera and tissues of cADRs patients were found, compared with healthy controls. Our findings may shed light on prediction and prevention of cADRs, provide clues to pathogenesis, and guide treatment strategies of these reactions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) {{study on}} {{a pool of}} 18 bio-active sulfonamide compounds which includes five acetazolamide derivatives, eight sulfanilamide derivatives and five clinically used sulfonamides molecules as drugs namely acetazolamide, <b>methazolamide,</b> dichlorophenamide, ethoxolamide and dorzolamide. For all the compounds, initial geometry optimizations were carried out with a molecular mechanics (MM) method using the MM+ force fields. The lowest energy conformations of the compounds obtained by the MM method were further optimized by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method by employing Becke’s three-parameter hybrid functional (B 3 LYP) and 6 - 31 G (d) basis set. Molecular descriptors, dipole moment, electronegativity, total energy at 0 K, entropy at 298 K, HOMO and LUMO energies obtained from DFT calculations provide valuable information and have {{a significant role in}} the assessment of carbonic anhydrase (CA-II) inhibitory activity of the compounds. By using the multiple linear regression technique several QSAR models have been drown up with the help these calculated descriptors and carbonic anhydrase (CA-II) inhibitory data of the molecules. Among the obtained QSAR models presented in the study, statistically the mos...|$|E
