These solutions are obtained by developing large legacy codes and then executing them using parallel processing systems as they require large scale computations. The parallel processing computers generally demand huge bandwidth as they consist of large number of networked processing elements.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The {{objective}} of this project was to begin work on combining two modeling approaches in order to advance the state-of-the-art in simulating and predicting explosive volcanic eruption dynamics and their effects. The authors began applying the CFDLIB family of codes for the near field (high temperature, velocity, and particle concentration) region of an explosive eruption. The authors also applied the RAMS <b>meteorological</b> <b>code</b> to model the far-field dynamics of eruption clouds and ash fallout. Initial test runs were conducted in preparation for full-scale simulations that would eventually couple the two models for the most comprehensive volcano simulation tool to date. Eventual applications include aviation hazards, risk assessment, and extension to atmospheric collateral effects of conventional and nuclear weapons...|$|E
40|$|Aiming to {{overcome}} some of well-known limitations of existing models {{when applied to}} analyse the impact of green infrastructures in urban areas, we propose the ARPS-VUC model, a new urbanized version of the APRS model, applicable from neighbourhood to city scales. It results from {{the integration of the}} Vegetated Urban Canopy (VUC) model in the ARPS <b>meteorological</b> <b>code.</b> The novelty is the integration of an intermediate multilayer canopy modelling approach, where meteorological fields are solved within and above the canopy, and the canopy elements (building and high vegetation) are represented through a drag force approach. The ARPS-VUC model is also able to account for buildings’ green roofs and/or walls. This work presents the first use of ARPS-VUC model to evaluate the impact of vegetation on the local microclimate of an idealized homogeneous urban canopy. To that purpose, we defined different canopy configurations, with different types of vegetation devices (small and high vegetation, green facades and roofs). Complete diurnal cycles were simulated for meteorological conditions corresponding to a sunny summer day and results obtained for each configuration were compared. Generally, the results show that vegetation cooling effects change in amplitude and during the day according to the type of vegetation device. When analysed individually, trees induce a larger air cooling, especially in the bottom part of the canopy, than small vegetation (ground level and/or building wall/roof surfaces), due to the tree shading effect along the daytime period. On the other hand, green buildings impact is also visible after midday and at night. The main cooling impact is observed when high vegetation is associated with vegetation on buildings. These first results are in agreement with recent studies and show that greening urban areas can be, in fact, an efficient way to regulate air temperature, particularly at the pedestrian level for both day and night. They further demonstrate the potentiality of our model to evaluate the impact of vegetation on local microclimate...|$|E

The profile of user applications {{is similar to that of}} the Massively Parallel Processor (MPP) working group.

5000|$|BUFR {{was created}} in 1988 {{with the goal of}} {{replacing}} the WMO's dozens of character-based, position-driven <b>meteorological</b> <b>codes,</b> such as SYNOP (surface observations), TEMP (upper air soundings) and CLIMAT (monthly climatological data). BUFR was designed to be portable, compact, and universal. Any kind of data can be represented, along with its specific spatial/temporal context and any other associated metadata. In the WMO terminology, BUFR belongs to the category of table-driven code forms, where the meaning of data elements is determined by referring to a set of tables that are kept and maintained separately from the message itself.|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{temperature}} and position were {{collected during the}} night from an instrumented van on routes through Salt Lake City and the rural outskirts. The measurements were taken {{as part of the}} Department of Energy Chemical and Biological National Security Program URBAN 2 Field Experiment conducted in October 2000 (Shinn et al., 2000 and Allwine et al., 2001 a). The instrumented van was driven over three primary routes, two including downtown, residential, and ''rural'' areas and a third that went by a line of permanently fixed temperature probes (Allwine et al., 2001 b) for cross-checking purposes. Each route took from 45 to 60 minutes to complete. Based on four nights of data, initial analyses indicate that there was a temperature difference of 2 - 5 C between the urban core and nearby ''rural'' areas. Analyses also suggest that there were significant fine scale temperature differences over distances of tens of meters within the city and in the nearby rural areas. The temperature measurements that were collected are intended to supplement the meteorological measurements taken during the URBAN 2000 Field Experiment, to assess the importance of the urban heat island phenomenon in Salt Lake City, and to test the urban canopy parameterizations that have been developed for regional scale <b>meteorological</b> <b>codes</b> as part of the DOE CBNP program...|$|R
40|$|Computation-intensive legacy {{codes for}} {{numerical}} models stand {{to benefit from}} application of parallel computing. However, parallelization of legacy codes poses special challenges. These codes are very large and complex. Manual parallelization {{has proven to be}} extremely time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, while a large number of parallelization tools exist, they cannot handle these complex legacy codes. Development of automatic parallelization tools for legacy codes remains a research area of considerable interest;This thesis describes a new approach to automatic parallelization of legacy codes. Our approach focuses on special classes of codes as opposed to parallelization of arbitrary codes. The advantage is that we are able to use high-level knowledge of the special class to manage the complexity of the parallelization problem. This approach provides a pragmatic solution for parallelization: it requires the user to specify the high-level knowledge, but automates tasks which are time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone for the user;Using this new approach, we have developed parAgent [...] a parallelizing tool which facilitates quick development of efficient parallel codes for legacy Fortran- 77 codes based on the explicit time-marching finite difference model. parAgent has been used on several well-known and widely-used Mesoscale <b>Meteorological</b> <b>codes.</b> It took only a few weeks to parallelize each of these legacy codes. Qualitatively, the performance of parallelization {{have been found to be}} on par with manual parallelization;This new approach can be applied to a variety of problem domains. The key benefits are: substantial reuse of existing software and considerable saving of time and effort for developing efficient parallel code. Although the new approach and parAgent have been developed with parallelization as the main objective, the information provided by the tool can be used for various purposes. For example, the information about the underlying numerical method and the exchange of data is valuable to the application scientist...|$|R

The statistical analysis of wind speed will contribute to this evaluation. Data of wind speed from 2004 to 2013, corresponding to the <b>meteorological</b> station Caraguatatuba (<b>code</b> 32521) Sinda/INPE system were used. Weibull distributions for the four seasons were analyzed, and their shape and scale parameters for the wind speed data, from which an extrapolation of the vertical profile of the wind to height of 100 m was performed.

5000|$|Due to the WMO-led {{development}} of the new digital BUFR and CREX coding formats and their implementation to <b>meteorological</b> reporting, CLIMAT <b>coding</b> will continually be transformed in these new formats or even be replaced in the future. Notwithstanding, CLIMAT-based reporting will still play {{an essential role in}} obtaining climate information in the upcoming decades, as many national meteorological services will not change to the BUFR format rapidly and climate relevant variables should be monitored uninterruptedly to obtain useful records. The CLIMAT SHIP code is only very seldom used since different, more specific codes for reporting data from fixed ocean locations, such as buoys, exist.The monthly climatological upper-air data included in CLIMAT TEMP (SHIP) can basically also be derived from daily reports, due to improvements in collection and exchange of the daily TEMP messages and improved real-time quality control, and therefore discontinuing these messages is currently discussed., ...|$|R
40|$|Since 2006, {{half of the}} world's {{population}} lives in cities. In the age of climate change, designing for quality environmental living conditions and sustainability is a topical concern.   However, on the one hand, designers and city planners operate with their three dimensional city morphological data such as building shapes and volumes, forms and their spacings, and functional attributes and definition signatures.  On the other hand, urban climatologists operate with their numbers and equations, quantities and signals, and normals and anomalies.  Traditionally the two camps do not meet. It {{is a challenge to}} develop design tools that they can work together.  Map based information system based on computational geographic information system (GIS) that is properly structured and represented offers a common language, so to speak, for the two professional groups to work together. Urban climatic map is a spatial and graphical tool with information embedded in defined layers that are collated so that planners and urban climatologists can dialogue over design issues. With various planning and <b>meteorological</b> data <b>coded</b> in defined grid resolutions onto the GIS map system, data can be synergized and collated for various understandings.  This papers explains the formulation of Hong Kong's GIS based Urban Climatic Map {{as an example of how}} the map works in practice. Using the map, zonal and district based planning decisions can be made by planners and urban climatologists that lead to new designs and policy changes. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} detailed description of the <b>meteorological</b> and chemical <b>code</b> of Malte ? a model to predict new aerosol formation in the lower troposphere. The aerosol dynamics are achieved by the new developed UHMA (University of Helsinki Multicomponent Aerosol Model) code with kinetic limited nucleation as responsible mechanism to form new clusters. First results indicate that the model is able to predict the on- and offset of new particle formation as well as the total aerosol number concentrations that were in good agreement with the observations. Further, comparison of predicted and measured H 2 SO 4 concentrations showed a satisfactory agreement. The simulation results indicated that at a certain transitional particle diameter (2 ? 7 nm), organic molecules can begin to contribute significantly to the growth rate compared to sulphuric acid. At even larger particle sizes, organic molecules can dominate the growth rate on days with significant monoterpene concentrations. The intraday vertical evolution of newly formed clusters and particles in two different size ranges resulted in two maxima at the ground. These particles grow around noon to the detectable size range and agree well with measured vertical profiles...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} surface and top of the {{atmosphere}} solar radiative forcing by long-range transport of Saharan dust. The calculations of radiative forcing are based on measurements collected in the Puerto Rico Dust Experiment (PRIDE) carried out during July, 2000. The purpose of the experiment was the characterization of the Saharan dust plume, which frequently reaches the Caribbean region during the summer. The experiment involved the use of three approaches to study the plume: space and ground based remote sensing, airborne and ground based in-situ measurements and aerosol dispersion modeling. The diversity of measuring platforms provides an excellent opportunity for determination of the direct effect of dust on the clear sky radiative forcing. Specifically, comparisons of heating rates, surface and TOA fluxes derived from the Navy global aerosol dispersion model NAAPS (NRL Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System) and actual measurements of fluxes from ground and space based platforms are shown. In addition, the direct effect of dust on the clear sky radiative forcing is modeled. The extent and time of evolution of the radiative properties of the plume are computed with the aerosol concentrations modeled by NAAPS. Standard aerosol parameterizations, as well as in-situ composition and size distributions measured during PRIDE, are utilized to compute the aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor. Radiative transfer computations are done with an in-house modified spectral radiative transfer code (Fu-Liou). The code includes gas absorption and cloud particles (ice and liquid phase) and it allows the input of <b>meteorological</b> data. The <b>code</b> was modified to include modules for the aerosols contribution to the calculated fluxes. This comparison study helps to narrow the current uncertainty in the dust direct radiative forcing, as recently reported in the 2001 IPCC assessment...|$|R
40|$|The MUST {{wind tunnel}} data set {{served as a}} {{validation}} case for obstacle-resolving micro-scale models in the COST Action 732 “Quality Assurance and Improvement of Micro-Scale <b>Meteorological</b> Models”. The <b>code</b> used for the numerical simulation is code CHENSI, simulations carried out showed {{a certain degree of}} agreement between the experimental results and those of the numerical simulation, they highlight the need for proceeding to an experimental campaign but with more measurements and the need for having a good control of determining factors in the exploitation of its results. The aim is to explain the experimental data obtained by atmospheric wind on the physical model. The site company of Mock Urban Setting Test (MUST) was selected to be simulated by the code CEN CHENSI developed by the team of Dynamique of l’atmosphere Habitee of LME/ECN. The code was based on (K- ε) model of (Launder and Spalding). For the integration of the PDE (Potential Dimensional equations) constitute the mathematical model, the finite volume method of (Ferziger and Peric) was used within the decade disposition of unknowns MAC of (Harlow and Welck) for the discretisation of PDE terms.
