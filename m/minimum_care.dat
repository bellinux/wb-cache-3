50|$|Augusta {{township}} {{is home to}} {{many small}} cemeteries, {{many of which were}} erected in the 19th century; some are still currently in use. There are also many old, family burial grounds and tiny abandoned cemeteries in the township as well as known native burial grounds. Due to the age of some of the tombstones in the area, they cannot properly be transcribed. Early cemetery records obtained by the Grenville Historical Society have only given moderate insight into the area's first cemeteries that are unmarked, or completely destroyed/illegible. It is strongly believed that the township is home to many more family burial plots, which were never recorded, and the whereabouts remain unknown. The Ontario Cemeteries Act requires all of the known cemeteries and burial ground in Augusta to receive <b>minimum</b> <b>care,</b> if not already being attended to by any person or organization. As a result of strict funding in regards to Cemetery Boards and care, most of the responsibility of preserving centuries-old burial grounds falls directly onto local volunteers. So far, volunteers have succeeded in transcribing every legible stone in the township. In addition to the pioneer and family burial grounds, there are many denominational cemeteries within the communities of Augusta which have been mentioned in the previous sections.|$|E

At the government health centres a majority, however, did not receive the full set of even basic antenatal care components. The research also pointed that despite attending the government health centre for four or moreANC visits many women used the ANC services provided by the private doctors as well.

30|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{increased}} attention has been directed toward palliative care provision by humanitarian health professionals. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care as “an approach that improves {{the quality of life}} of patients (adults and children) and their families who are facing problems associated with life-threatening illness. It prevents and relieves suffering through the early identification, correct assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, whether physical, psychosocial or spiritual” (WHO 2018). Commentators have argued for the importance of palliative care provision in situations of war, disaster, and epidemic (Marston et al. 2015; Smith and Aloudat 2017), with Powell et al. arguing that it should be considered “an integral component of relief strategies” (2017 : 1498). Some NGOs have established policies to support their field teams in providing care for patients who are not expected to survive, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross’s triage guidelines which identify <b>minimum</b> <b>care</b> standards for these patients (Giannou and Baldan 2009). Broader efforts that cross the humanitarian field are also underway, including an initiative to introduce a new chapter in the Sphere Handbook: Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response addressing “relief of suffering and end-of-life care.” 1 Evidence-based standards for supportive care in Ebola Treatment Centers have also been developed and include recommendations for pain control and addressing psychological distress (Lamontagne et al. 2018).|$|E

Objectives The objectives were to compare the quality and safety of care provided by ECPs with non-ECP (eg, paramedic, nurse practitioner) care across three different types of emergency care settings: static services (emergency department, walk-in-centre, minor injury unit); ambulance/care home services (mobile); primary care out of hours services. Methods A retrospective patient case note review was conducted to compare the quality and safety of care provided by ECPs and non-ECPs across matched sites in three types of emergency care settings.

40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that children’s subjective interpretations of events may {{differ significantly from}} those of adults; yet children’s and young people’s voices and children’s knowledge regarding hospital care remain relatively unexplored. Objective: To develop insight into children’s subjective interpretations and knowledge of being hospital in-patients. Design: Critical ethnography. Setting: A nephro-urology ward in a tertiary referral children’s hospital {{in the north of}} England. Participants: A purposive sample was employed of 15 children over 2 phases: six (9 – 15 years) at home in a reconnaissance first phase, and nine (5 – 14 years) in hospital in phase 2. Methods: A raft of child-friendly, age-appropriate strategies was used to engage children in phase 1. Phase 2 involved over 100 h of field-work with hospitalised children over 6 months, with observation, interview, play and craft activities as prominent methods. Data were analysed using constant comparative methods. Results: The study ward was a place in which children struggled to find a space for their competence to be recognised and their voice heard. Children’s voice became manifest in what they said but also through the non-verbal mechanisms of resisting, turning away and being silent. While all the children shared the experience of being in trouble, recognition of their competence was fluid and contingent on their relationships with the nurses alongside other structural and material factors. The children worked hard to maintain their position as knowledgeable individuals. When they could not do so they relied on supportive adults, {{and in the absence of}} supportive adults they became marooned and received bare <b>minimum</b> <b>care.</b> Conclusion: The hospital ward was a place for children in which there was little space for children’s voices.

The disability level or need for care of each patient was established a priori. The extent to which an individual 2 ̆ 7 s variation in Medicaid utilization and costs was explained by patient need, presence or absence of the channeling project 2 ̆ 7 s placement decision or some other patient characteristic was examined by multiple regression analysis. Long-term and acute care Medicaid, Medicare, third party, self-pay and the grand total of all Medicaid claims were analyzed for project effects and explanatory relationships. ^ The main project effect was to increase personal care costs without reducing nursing home or acute care costs (Prospective Study). Expansion of clients appeared to occur in personal care (Prospective Study) and <b>minimum</b> <b>care</b> nursing home (Retrospective Study) for the project areas. Cost-shifting between Medicaid and Medicare in the project areas and two different patterns of utilization in the North and South projects tended to offset each other such that no differences in total costs between the project areas and demonstration areas occurred. The project was significant ((beta) =. 22, p 3 ̆c. 001) only for personal care costs. The explanatory power of this personal care regression model (R(2 ̆ 72) =. 36) was comparable to other reported health services utilization models.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} facing the social care sector. These include how to ensure a qualified workforce exists that meets registration requirements as well as supporting the ongoing development of that workforce. At a time when social care services are under pressure to continuously improve and change, there is an increased pressure on care staff to meet greater demands from service users. Given the labour-intensive nature of social care provision, the training of staff is {{a significant factor in}} the provision of a high-quality service. The spectrum of learning and development for care staff is considerable and this presents challenges for managers and organisations. This thesis considers modern day social care provision with its diversity and challenges for those managing the delivery of a constantly changing care service where regulation is paramount and inspection regimes can significantly dictate the business need. Social care managers appear to deal with the demands of providing a service whilst meeting the development needs of staff. Balancing service needs with the need for staff to gain qualifications is an issue. Managers endeavour to overcome the challenges of releasing staff for training and development by considering diverse ways of delivering and accessing learning. The aim of this thesis therefore, is to assess whether social care managers could reasonably adopt a staff development role in addition to their care and other managerial responsibilities. The thesis also examines the perception of the managers and staff concerning the implementation of Government policies and aims to discover what impact this may have on the workplace. In seeking to understand what care staff and managers think about the expectations placed upon them what they say is clearly an important source of data. The use of interviews to gather primary data from a sample of care staff from the independent sector together with a review of secondary data in respect of learning and development research undertaken contributes to a clearer understanding of learning and development strategies adopted by managers. What emerges is that managers do require additional support to implement the learning and development spectrum required by the national <b>minimum</b> <b>care</b> standards and shifting trends in social care responsibilities, however, there is no single solution to the form of assistance required. As a result of this, a number of avenues for future action and recommendations for additional social care research are proposed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Basic Antenatal Care (BANC) {{is a way}} of {{training}} or upgrading the knowledge and skills of all nurses, midwives and doctors involved in antenatal care at the primary health care level so that the <b>minimum</b> <b>care</b> can be provided effectively. This study was conducted to investigate the implementation of the BANC program by midwives in the Mdantsane clinics during February 2009. Methods: A descriptive study design was undertaken targeting midwives providing antenatal care to pregnant women, in 14 clinics of Mdantsane. Data was collected from 25 midwives in the clinics, and from 140 ANC cards of women attending ANC on the day of their visit to the clinic. Results: The majority of midwives providing BANC in Mdantsane clinics were not trained in BANC. There were 10 trained midwives and 15 not yet trained. A total of twenty five midwives were involved in the study. The number of visits according to the BANC schedule was well known by the midwives in the study. The content of the visits was well known for the first visit, but for subsequent visits, the participating midwives could not state exactly what they do on these visits. They perceived BANC as something beneficial for both midwives and pregnant women with 24 of the participating midwives rating BANC as advantageous. In completing an ANC card, the midwives scored between 48 percent and 100 percent. Under examination, they scored between 52 percent and 100 percent. Lastly on interpretation and decision making, they scored between 0 percent and 92 percent. This could have troubling consequences for the health status of the mother and baby. Weaknesses in providing antenatal care identified in the study included participating midwives failing to fill in the last normal menstrual period (LNMP) and the estimated date of delivery (EDD), which was a worrying observation. Plotting of the gestational age at first visit was also not carried out well as only 47 percent of the midwives in the study did this, meaning {{that there would be a}} miscalculation of the gestational age thereafter throughout the pregnancies. The body mass index (BMI) was not calculated as the maternal height and weight were not written on the ANC card. This should be completed in order to check the nutritional status of the pregnant woman to help supplement, if malnourished, and educate on diet, if overweight. Only 17 percent of the midwives in the study plotted the foetal presentation. Failure to plot foetal presentation could lead to complications during delivery because women with abnormal presentations could end up delivering in a clinic instead of the hospital. Conclusion: This study showed that even though midwives are implementing BANC among pregnant women, it is not being carried out correctly. Therefore the programme will not be as beneficial as it would be if put into practice correctly. This is highlighted by the lack of knowledge from the untrained midwives regarding the content of care on subsequent visits. Thus there is an urgent need for BANC training to be conducted and monitored at various sites...|$|E
40|$|Background, aims, {{and scope}} Increasing soil {{acidification}} {{is a growing}} concern in southern China. The traditional green manures applied in the fields mostly comprise legumes that tend to accelerate soil acidification. Moreover, acid deposition can act as a source of nitrogen. Hence, we looked for new plant species that would enhance nutrient concentrations when used as green manure and would reduce soil acidity or at least not worsen it. Materials and methods We studied the use of Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers. for ameliorating acid soil in a pot experiment with simulated acid rain (SAR) treatments (pH 5. 8 to 3. 0) in an open area in Guangzhou City. The pots were divided into two groups named A and B groups. On day 0, pots of A group were filled with soil and planted with Erigeron annuus seedlings. Pots of B group were only filled with soil as the control. On day 40, seedlings of E. annuus were harvested and buried in the corresponding pots. On day 54, two seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L. were sown in each pot in both groups. The growth and bean yield of P. vulgaris seedlings were then used to evaluate the effects of E. annuus on acid soil. Plant and/or soil samples were collected on days 0, 40, 54, and 150; corresponding parameters were measured. Results Results showed that E. annuus could maintain a good growth even on very acid soil. On day 40, the pH decreased significantly (P?<? 0. 0001) in the B group pots without E. annuus compared with the A group. On day 54, after E. annuus was buried as a manure, the soil pH of all A group treatments except the pH 4. 0 treatment showed a significant increase compared to day 40 (P?<? 0. 01). At the same time, the application of E. annuus as a manure produced a significant increase of soil K and P (P?<? 0. 001), Ca (P?<? 0. 05), and Mg (P?<? 0. 001) concentrations of all A group SAR treatments compared to their B group counterparts (except control pots for Ca). The soil exchangeable K and available P concentration doubled, and Ca and Mg increased by around 25 % {{in the presence of the}} E. annuus manure application. Discussion The higher soil pH in the A group than B group on the day 40 was due to a great absorption of NO 3 - by the roots of E. annuus. The soil pH increase after E. annuus was applied to the soil of A group was attributed to the release of high amount of K, the mineralization of organic N, and the oxidation of organic acid anions. Nutrient increase in the A group after E. annuus application was mostly the result of the nutrient release during the residue decomposition. The amelioration of the soil was effective as demonstrated by the enhanced growth and bean yield of P. vulgaris seedlings on the manured soil compared to the seedlings grown on a control that was not manured. Conclusions E. annuus could maintain a good growth in the acid lateritic field soil. Cultivating this plant and applying it to the soil with a rate of 1. 6 ton ha- 1 doubled the soil K and P concentrations and increased soil exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations by around 25 %. This species would be a good green manure candidate for growing in the acid soils of southern China. Application of E. annuus also has beneficial effects on crop growth through reduced Al toxicity and cation leaching. Recommendations and perspectives Since E. annuus would improve soil pH and nutrient concentrations with <b>minimum</b> <b>care,</b> it is recommended for treating acid soils with poor yield whenever a low-cost solution is required.
