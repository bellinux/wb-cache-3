40|$|The {{good news}} is that safety belt usage on {{municipal}} road systems (city streets) increased 1. 07 percent. This is encouraging since more than 45 percent of all motor vehicle crashes occur on city streets, and usage on the <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> <b>system</b> has consistently been the lowest of the road systems studied. In communities where usage is good, enforcement and public education must be maintained in order to improve usage further; in communities where usage is still low, enforcement and public education must both be increased. Usage on the primary system (U. S. or state highways) rose 1. 01 percent from the previous year. This is also welcome news because almost half of all fatalities (49 percent) occur on the primary road system. There was a decline in interstate belt use (- 1. 45 percent). Despite this decrease interstate usage is still traditionally the highest of all roadway categories presumably because the longer trips, higher travel speeds and large number of vehicles cause drivers to assume there is greater risk...|$|E
