25|$|The Copeland House was {{designed}} around 1873 {{by an unknown}} architect and cast in the Italianate style. Wright's 1909 remodel work included exterior and interior alterations.

The new low-pitched hip roof that Wright designed, along with the wrap-around porch and overhanging eaves are all elements found in the Copeland House {{which can be found}} on other Prairie style homes Wright designed. The remodeling work also replaced the original doors with doors, frame, sidelights and a transom window all of Wright's own design.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{activities}} that players {{can do in}} mayor mode include building civic buildings that need constant funding to work properly, such as schools, hospitals, parks, police stations, jails, and fire stations. These buildings now come in two or more sizes compared to the single, universal types {{that were used in}} previous games. Settlements also need public utilities such as electricity with more or less polluting and more or less expensive types of power stations, water pumps, water purification plants, and waste management services. Facilities that had previously provided citywide coverage, such as educational facilities and medical facilities, have now been modified to provide a more limited coverage, as it has been with police stations and fire stations in previous SimCity titles. Funding can now be adjusted for individual buildings rather than having to change the funding to all buildings, allowing users to specify how much money should be spent to supply a service in accordance to the local population. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>expenses</b> for public utility facilities will increase as they age. The maximum output of facilities also decreases as they get older.

2500|$|Until the {{military}} assumed control of relief efforts in September 1943, government aid seldom provided much {{help to the}} rural poor, directing most of its cash and grain supplies instead to the relatively wealthy landowners and urban bhadraloks. After an initial spate of humanitarian aid for the cyclone-stricken areas around Midnapore in October 1942, the government response was slow, and relief efforts were very limited until April 1943. The response was slowed both by a failure to grasp the nature {{and scope of the}} problem and by political factors brought on by a public propaganda campaign declaring [...] "sufficiency" [...] in Bengal's rice supply, denying that there had been any significant crop shortfall, and blaming rising prices on war profiteering and hoarding. In April, more cash and grain began to flow to the outlying areas, but relief efforts were misdirected. Famine relief came in three major forms: agricultural loans (for the purchase of paddy seed, plough cattle, and <b>maintenance</b> <b>expenses),</b> gratuitous relief, and test works. [...] Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land. Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices, but did not accomplish that aim, instead putting rural poor in direct competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices. As the depth and scope of the famine became unmistakable, the government began setting up gruel kitchens in August 1943; the gruel, which often provided barely a survival-level caloric intake, was sometimes unfit for consumptionmoldy or contaminated with dirt, sand, and gravel.|$|E
