5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each <b>mericarp</b> is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} a {{leathery}} capsule, broadly oval in shape. These contain five spaces that split open outwards {{from the base}} of the style when the fruit is ripe by April. Each space contains two shiny black seeds that are shaped like a slightly curved tear drop of 6×3mm, and are partly covered by a conspicuous scarlet aril, both of which starkly contrast with the horny white inside of the fruit (or <b>mericarp).</b> Aborted seeds are greyish. The embryo is green. Ixerba has fifty chromosomes (2n = 50).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish a relationship between <b>mericarps</b> color and internal morphology of parsley with the germination, using sorting by coloration and the X-ray test. The completely randomized design was used, with four replications per treatment. The treatments were constituted of four lots (A, B, C and D) and three <b>mericarps</b> colors (green, yellow and black) in 4 × 3 factorial experiment. The <b>mericarps</b> were exposed to X-ray test (60 s; 20 kV), being used the digital equipment Faxitron X-ray, model MX- 20 DC 12 and then, the irradiated <b>mericarps</b> were submitted to the germination test. The yellow <b>mericarps</b> showed higher germination and speed germination index. The green <b>mericarps</b> showed deformations and impaired formation of embryo, while black and yellow <b>mericarps</b> showed up without deformation and with a well-formed embryo. We concluded that there is a relationship between parsley seed germination and <b>mericarps</b> color. Poorly formed embryos and misshapened seed coats are related to green <b>mericarps...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit of}} Pachypodium bicolor is {{composed}} of 2 separate <b>mericarps,</b> sometimes only developing one. Mericaps are a carpel with one seed or one of a pair split apart at maturity. They form an angle from 10 - 60° at the base. Worth mentioning, there are occasion when the flowers and fruit in the same inflorescence. The <b>mericarps</b> are pale brown with longitudinal lines outside. Inside it is whitish inside and fusiform, tapering at each end; spindle-shaped, at 60 by 3 to 6 mm. The <b>mericarps</b> are acute, having a sharp point or tip, at the apex and are pubescent with short hairs. The fruit wall is approximately 0.5 mm thick.|$|R

50|$|Each plant {{produces}} easily distributable bristle-textured, rosy or white/green fruits {{that eventually}} turn brown when mature. The fruits are schizocarps and then mericarps when split into two. The schizocarpic fruits are dry, remain closed until maturity, and have two pollen-containing chambers. Each <b>mericarp</b> {{of the fruit}} is five-ribbed, making its dispersal highly effective and competitive towards native vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Fruits: Nutlets {{strongly}} reticulate (10-12 <b>mericarps,</b> usually without hair, {{with sharp}} angle between dorsal and lateral surfaces, 5-6 millimters in diameter.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on Eryngium aquaticum and Eryngium yuccifolium. They bore tunnels {{into the}} ovaries and {{developing}} <b>mericarps</b> of the ﬂowers of their host plant. The larvae are pink and white-striped.|$|R
50|$|Leaves are woolly and lobed, and the whitish-green flowers form {{in spring}} and summer. The fruit is 2 to 3 mm long, with 7 to 9 ribs on the <b>mericarp.</b> This plant was {{collected}} in Sydney, and first appeared in scientific literature in the year 1810 in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 10: 301, t. 22, fig. 1, authored by the English botanist, Edward Rudge.|$|E
50|$|Sida javensis is an annual, procumbent herb up to 70 cm (28 inches) tall, rooting at the nodes. Leaves are ovate or subcordate, up to 30cm (1.2 inches) long. Flowers are yellow, solitary, {{forming in}} the axils of the leaves. Fruit is spherical, about 3 mm in diameter. The species {{is closely related}} to S. cordata, differing by having fewer hairs along the stems, roots forming at the nodes, a glabrous {{filament}} tube, and 2 awns on the <b>mericarp.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{inflorescence}} of shiso, called hojiso (ear shiso), {{is typically}} used as garnish on a sashimi plate; the individual flowers can be stripped off the stem using the chopstick, adding its flavor to the soy sauce dip. The {{fruits of the}} shiso (shiso-no-mi), containing fine seed (<b>mericarp)</b> about 1 mm or less in diameter (about the size of mustard seed), can be preserved in salt and used as a spice or condiment. Young leaves and flower buds are used for pickling in Japan and Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|The fruits {{are tiny}} <b>mericarps</b> {{and are used}} in the {{production}} of absinthe and other alcoholic drinks. Seeds of a Persian spice plant known as Golpar (Heracleum persicum) are often labeled as [...] "angelica seeds".|$|R
2500|$|Coriander grows wild over a {{wide area}} of Western Asia and {{southern}} Europe, prompting the comment, [...] "It is hard to define exactly where this plant is wild and where it only recently established itself." [...] Fifteen desiccated <b>mericarps</b> {{were found in the}} Pre-Pottery Neolithic B level of the Nahal Hemar Cave in Israel, which may be the oldest archaeological find of coriander. About half a litre (a pint) of coriander <b>mericarps</b> was recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamen, and because this plant does not grow wild in Egypt, Zohary and Hopf interpret this find as proof that coriander was cultivated by the ancient Egyptians.|$|R
50|$|Nolana is {{the only}} genus in the Solanaceae which has a fruit {{composed}} of <b>mericarps,</b> although its flower and other vegetative morphology is similar to other plants in this family. It seems to be most closely related to Lycium and Grabowskia.|$|R
50|$|The fruits are schizocarps of two mericarps {{derived from}} mature fused carpels, often narrow-oblong with 4-5 mm {{in length and}} 1-1.5 mm in diameter. A single seed is formed with each <b>mericarp.</b> When mature, it is {{dispersed}} by wind. The cremocarp of the fruits is narrow-oblong and slightly flat. The oil tubes in the fruit, 3 or 4 vittae, form in wrinkles of ridges of the fruit, while 4 to 8 vittae {{can be found in}} commissure. The plant bears fruit from August to September.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mericarp</b> is {{a portion}} of the fruit that {{separates}} from the ovary to form a distinct locule unit which encloses the seed, usually-nut-like, as in Apiaceae in which the mericarps are joined by a stalk (carpophore). Thus a schizocarp of mericarps is a structure in which the carpels of a single ovary split to form mericarps. A schizocarp of nutlets is derived from a carpel that becomes lobed, and the lobes become nutlets that split apart. Examples include Boraginaceae and most Lamiaceae, where the styles are attached between the ovary lobes.|$|E

40|$|The fruit {{anatomy of}} all eight {{species of the}} genus Bupleurum L. {{mentioned}} {{in the most recent}} literature from northeastern China was studied for the first time. The eight species were divided into two groups based on the shape of the <b>mericarps</b> in transverse section. The first group (round <b>mericarps</b> without prominent ribs) includes B. longiradiatum and B. komarovianum, and the second group (angular <b>mericarps</b> with prominent ribs) includes B. angustissimum, B. bicaule, B. chinense, B. euphorbioides, B. scorzonerifolium and B. sibiricum. The second group can be further subdivided into group 2 a (large vittae, very small vascular bundles) — B. euphorbioides and B. sibiricum, and group 2 b (small vittae, large vascular bundles) — B. angustissimum, B. bicaule, B. chinense and B. scorzonerifolium. This result closely supports the traditional classification system which was based on gross morphology (plant height; leaf shape and size; involucre number, size and shape). The only exception is that B. komarovianum should not be close to the second group, but close to B. longiradiatum. Group 1 corresponds with Bupleurum sect. Longifolia and group 2 with sect. Eubupleura; group 2 a with ser. Ranunculoides and group 2 b with ser. Falcata. Fruit anatomical characters seem to have potential for evaluating infrageneric relationships in the genus Bupleurum...|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit of}} Pachypodium baronii {{is made up}} of 2 {{separate}} <b>mericarps,</b> the part of the ovary or carpel that has one or more enclosed seeds. Sometimes only one fruit develops with an angle of 45-180° at the base. Sometimes flowers and fruit are on the same inflorescence. The <b>mericarps</b> are pale reddish-green with longitudinal lines when fresh and when dried pale brown to pale greenish-brown to dark brown outside and whitish to very pale brown inside. The fruit measures 40 mm (1.58-inch) to 115 mm (4.53-inch) long by 10 mm (0.39-inch) to 20 mm wide by 7 mm (0.28-inch) to 10 mm (0.39-inch) high. When the fruit is fresh it is either straight or recurved, obtuse to acute at the apex. It is pubescent and has a wall 1 mm (inch) thick.|$|R
50|$|In Spring {{the plant}} {{produces}} clusters of 3-5 petiolated small, light blue hermaphrodite flowers with white or yellow star-shaped centers. The wheel-shaped corolla is fused and five-lobed {{and has a}} diameter of 7 - 15 mm. These plants bloom from March through May. The <b>mericarps</b> are hairy and navel-shaped, about 2 mm long.|$|R

50|$|It is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{growing to}} 80 cm tall, with hairy stems and foliage. The leaves are alternate, 2-8 cm long and 2-8 cm broad, palmately lobed with {{five to seven}} lobes; basal leaves on the lower stem are very shallowly lobed, those higher on the stems are deeply divided, with narrow, acuminate lobes. The flowers are produced in clusters in the leaf axils, each flower 3.2-5 cm diameter, with five bright pink petals with a truncated to notched apex; they have a distinctive musky odour. The fruit is a disc-shaped schizocarp 3-6 mm diameter, containing 10-16 seeds, the seeds individually enclosed in a <b>mericarp</b> covered in whitish hairs. It has a chromosome count of 2n=42.|$|E
50|$|Both {{domestic}} and wild carrot {{are from the}} same species, Daucus carota L. There are several subspecies of Daucus carota that have evolved to different climates and atmospheres. Two examples of these subspecies are specifically from the Netherlands. D. carota subsp. sativus has roots {{that can be a}} wide range of colors. It has a thicker root and sweeter taste. The whorl of barbs above the spine on the vallecular ridges of the <b>mericarp</b> of D. carota subsp. sativus mature very well. D. carota subsp. carota has white roots that do not vary in color and, unlike D. carota subsp. sativus, have a thin root, bitter taste and are not edible. The middle umbellet of D. carota subsp. carota is not well developed (unlike D. carota subsp. sativus) and the color of the flower can vary from red to deep purple.|$|E
50|$|Glabrous {{evergreen}} sub-shrubs. Stems rounded, smooth. Leaves in whorls of 3, {{with small}} linear stipules in between, or with petiole indistinct.

Fruit dry, of 2 <b>mericarps,</b> glabrous except on inner faces.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{speculation}} about the connection between silphium and the traditional heart shape (♥). Silver coins from Cyrene of the 6-5th century BCE bear a similar design, sometimes accompanied by a silphium plant and understood to represent its seed or fruit.

50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{yellowish}} and 1.5 mm across, with absent sepals, and the styles form a stylopodium. The fruits are 4-5 mm in size, oblong-ovoid, and are rarely compressed. The commissure is broad, the <b>mericarps</b> are prominent with slender ridges and lateral forming narrow wings; a carpophore is present. There are numerous vittae, with stout pedicels of 2-3 mm in size, and the stigmas are capitate.|$|R
