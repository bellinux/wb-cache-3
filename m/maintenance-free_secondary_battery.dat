40|$|Lithium-ion <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> are {{commonly}} used in electric vehicles, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), notebooks and electric cars. These lithium-ion <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> must charge and discharge rapidly, causing the interior temperature to rise quickly, raising a safety issue. Over-charging results in an unstable voltage and current, causing potential safety problems, such as thermal runaways and explosions. Thus, a micro flexible temperature sensor for the in in-situ monitoring of temperature inside a lithium-ion <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> must be developed.

50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are just}} as {{important}} as main batteries. Typically, these guns are half the size of the main batteries but equal in range. These guns are generally multipurpose guns, being used for ship-to-ship, anti aircraft, and general bombardment. In the series Blood & Chrome Galactica is shown fitted with 68 (34 port, 34 starboard) <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> for a total of 136 rifles (assuming they are 2-rifled batteries) on her dorsal side to compliment her main batteries. Because of their smaller caliber they can fire at a faster rate than their larger counterparts. For example, an Iowa class battleship's main 16-inch batteries fire at 2-6 rounds per minute per rifle or 18-54 rounds/minute. Whereas the smaller 5-inch <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> fire at 15-20 per minute/rifle (5 2-rifled batteries per side), or 150-200 5-inch rounds per minute, a difference of 2.5-5 times. The same can be assumed for the Galactica. If her main batteries fire 15-20 rounds/minute/rifle, then it can be assumed her <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> fire 40-80 rounds/min/rifle. Again simple math suggests that a full one minute barrage of the <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> can fire between 5,540-10,880 rounds per minute from the dorsal side alone.|$|R

Through this research, the following results were found: (1) A basic number of cycles should be defined.

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{are currently}} under development for NASA missions, earth sciences, aeronautics, the military, and commercial applications. The design of an all electric power and propulsion system for small UAVs {{was the focus}} of a detailed study. Currently, many of these small vehicles are powered by primary (nonrechargeable) lithium-based batteries. While this type of battery is capable of satisfying some of the mission needs, a <b>secondary</b> (rechargeable) <b>battery</b> power supply system that can provide the same functionality as the current system at the same or lower system mass and volume is desired. A study of commercially available <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> cell technologies that could provide the desired performance characteristics was performed. Due to the strict mass limitations and wide operating temperature requirements of small UAVs, the only viable cell chemistries were determined to be lithium-ion liquid electrolyte systems and lithium-ion gel polymer electrolyte systems. Two lithium-ion gel polymer cell designs were selected as candidates and were tested using potential load profiles for UAV applications. Because lithium primary batteries have a higher specific energy and energy density, for the same mass and volume allocation, the <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> resulted in shorter flight times than the primary batteries typically provide. When the batteries were operated at lower ambient temperatures (0 to - 20 C), flight times were even further reduced. Despite the reduced flight times demonstrated, for certain UAV applications, the <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> operated within the acceptable range of flight times at room temperature and above. The results of this testing indicate that a <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> power supply system can provide some benefits over the primary battery power supply system. A UAV can be operated for hundreds of flights using a <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> power supply system that provides the combined benefits of rechargeability and an inherently safer chemistry...|$|R
