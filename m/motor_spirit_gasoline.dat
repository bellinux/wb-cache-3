This paper examines the cost-push impact of a <b>motor</b> <b>spirit</b> price increment in Iran on different products prices indices and inflation. An Input-Output (I-O) table adjustment approach is applied. Iran input- output table for the year 2001 - 2002 is used as database. The empirical results of the model show how the cost-push impact of a 25 % increment in the <b>motor</b> <b>spirit</b> price leads to an increment in different products prices indices, but the maximum effect of this increment, which is on transportation services prices, does not exceed 0. 7492 %. In addition, the cost-push effect of this increase on the Production Prices Index (PPI) is estimated at 0. 2540 %. Input-Output, <b>Motor</b> <b>Spirit</b> Pricing, Price model, Iran. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} to study the effect of producing ethanol from molasses or sugarcane juice to blend with gasoline and produce E 10 fuel for the Fijian car fleet.

The continuous increase in the importation of <b>motor</b> <b>spirit</b> demands the biofuel policy to be reviewed to encourage (E 10) blending locally.
