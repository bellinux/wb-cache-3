30|$|Many {{clinical}} {{series of}} patients with PA have been reported, while its imaging features are less frequently described. Because of the potential severe prognosis of PA, radiologists {{should be aware of}} its imaging characteristics on both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), being able to recognise the main conditions that may <b>mimic</b> <b>PA,</b> from a clinical and radiological perspective.|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of focal, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic cancer (PAC) poses a diagnostic dilemma. Both conditions may present {{with the same}} symptoms and signs. The complexity of differential diagnosis is enhanced because PAC is frequently associated with secondary inflammatory changes and CP may develop into PAC. The {{aim of this study}} was tot analyze two sets of patients (group A and B) who were misdiagnosed to have either CP or PAC. The clinical and radiographical features of these patients were reviewed. Group A consisted of 22 patients (median age 54. 5 years) who were referred with PAC after a previous diagnosis of PC. Eleven patients had a history of CP of > 12 mths (mean 40. 2 mths) whereas in 11 patients, PAC became apparent within 12 mths (mean 4. 9 mths) after the diagnosis of CP was made. The etiology of CP was alcohol abuse in 9 patients, pancreas divisum in 3 patients and was undefined in the remaining 10 patients. Imaging studies showed features of CP (parenchymal calcifications, irregularities and stenoses of the pancreatic duct wall). Pseudocysts were present in 13 patients. A mass lesion was detected in 13 patients. At the time of diagnosis, 20 patients had unresectable tumors and 2 patients underwent a Whipple resection which proved non-radical. Group B consisted of 14 patients (median age 53 years) who underwent a Whipple resection for a presumed PAC that on histopathology of the lesion proved to be CP. These patients accounted for 6 % of all 220 patients who had undergone resection for PAC in the same period. Reassessment of clinical presentation and all imaging studies confirmed a high index of suspicion on PAC in these patients. CONCLUSION: In patients known with CP, misdiagnosis of PAC is a potential pitfall leading to delay of treatment. For any lesion suspicious of PAC an aggressive surgical approach is justified lest a potentially curable lesion is missed. As a consequence, there is at least a 5 % chance of resecting a lesion based on CP, <b>mimicking</b> <b>PA...</b>|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 76 - 92). Despite the increasing incidents of brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases, a definitive clinical therapy for these conditions {{has not been}} found yet. Nervous system injuries result in loss of neural cells, causing loss of function in the neural circuitry. As mature neurons do not divide, {{it is not possible}} to tolerate the loss of neurons by the production of new ones. In the central nervous system, even though neural stem cells are present, their number and regenerative capacity are very low. In addition, inhibitory molecules are released at the degeneration site which hinders reconnection of the remaining cells. As the damage is due to the loss of neurons, cell therapy is considered as a promising option. Neural stem cells are capable of differentiating into the three major cell types in the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. However, due to low rate of survival of the transplanted cells, there is still a need for a cell vehicle system to promote their survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. On the other hand, use of biological molecules such as growth factors or extracellular matrix proteins as vehicle systems should be minimized due to the immunological risks. Nanotechnological approaches serve as a great opportunity to mimic the native environment of the cells. Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are self-assembling molecules that provide precise control over their secondary structure and the amino acid sequence, which can mimic proteins and show hydrogel properties. In this thesis, self-assembling <b>PA</b> scaffolds that <b>mimic</b> laminin, heparan sulfate and cadherin, which are key players in nervous system regeneration, have been investigated as cell delivery vehicles. Neurospheres are great models for studying the behavior of neural stem cells within a heterogeneous 3 -dimensional cell population. Migration and differentiation behavior of neurospheres were investigated on laminin (LN), heparan sulfate (GAG), and cadherin-mimetic (HAV) PA nanofiber scaffolds. The results indicated that LN and GAG <b>mimicking</b> <b>PA</b> scaffolds cooperatively enhanced the migration of neurospheres, whereas cadherin mimetic PA scaffolds were individually sufficient to promote their migration. Also, a fine neural network was observed to be established on HAV-PA. These scaffolds hold high potential to be used as cell delivery vehicles. by İdil UyanM. S...|$|R
40|$|Endocytosis modulates EGFR {{function}} by compartmentalizing and attenuating or enhancing its ligand-induced signaling. Here we {{show that}} it can also control the cell surface versus intracellular distribution of empty/inactive EGFR. Our previous observation that PKA inhibitors induce EGFR internalization prompted us to test phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by phospholipase D (PLD) as an endogenous down-regulator of PKA activity, which activates rolipram-sensitive type 4 phos-phodiesterases (PDE 4) that degrade cAMP. We found that inhibition of PA hydrolysis by propranolol, {{in the absence of}} ligand, provokes internalization of inactive (neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated) EGFR, accompanied by a transient increase in PA levels and PDE 4 s activity. This EGFR internalization is <b>mimicked</b> by <b>PA</b> micelles and is strongly counteracted by PLD 2 silencing, rolipram or forskolin treatment, and PKA overexpression. Accelerated EGFR endocytosis seems to be mediated by clathrin-dependent and-independent pathways, leading to receptor accumulation in juxtanuclear recycling endosomes, also due to a decreased recycling. Internalized EGFR can remain intracellular without degradation for several hours or return rapidly to the cell surface upon discontinuation of the stimulus. This novel regulatorymechanism of EGFR, also novel function of signaling PA, can transmodulate receptor accessibility in response to heterologous stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Parvalbumin (PA) is an {{intracellular}} Ca 2 +-binding protein {{found in}} some muscle and nerves. Its ability to bind Ca 2 + and facilitate skeletal muscle relaxation is limited by its Mg 2 + off-rate. EDTA serves as an "artificial" PA in that it exhibited similar rate constants for Mg 2 + (3 s- 1) and Ca 2 + (0. 7 s- 1) dissociation at 10 degrees C. When introduced into frog skeletal muscle, EDTA increased the relaxation rate by approximately 2. 7 -fold, and with increasing tetanus duration, EDTA lost its ability to contribute to relaxation (and Ca 2 + sequestration) at its Mg 2 + off-rate. Intracellular EDTA recovered its ability to contribute to muscle relaxation and Ca 2 + sequestration at its Ca 2 + off-rate. Like PA, EDTA's contribution to muscle relaxation and Ca 2 + sequestration was more clearly observed when the SR Ca-ATPase was inhibited. Introduction of EDTA into rat soleus muscle, which has low [PA], increased the relaxation rate {{in a manner that}} was analogous {{to the way in which}} PA facilitates relaxation of frog skeletal muscle. Thus intracellular EDTA serves as an effective <b>mimic</b> of <b>PA,</b> and its use should aid in our understanding of PA's function in muscle and nerve...|$|R
40|$|Institute for Computing Systems ArchitectureMost Petri net (PN) based {{modelling}} formalisms {{represent the}} system modelled as a flat net. This may not clearly reflect {{the elements that}} participate {{in the system and}} the way they communicate or interact. It can also be difficult to determine the model's behaviour or prove some of its properties. Viewing the model as a set of components that interact is more appropriate, especially for models of parallel and distributed systems. In this thesis a compositional method for the construction and analysis of Well-formed nets (WNs) systems is presented. WNs allow a natural representation of complex distributed systems, maintaining the same expressive power as the unconstrained coloured net formalisms. The main motivation of this work has been to offer an appropriate method for the specification, design and analysis of parallel and distributed systems. The set of composition operations defined is based on the operators of Process Algebras (<b>PA).</b> <b>Mimicking</b> the <b>PA</b> operators allows us to benefit from the compositional nature of PA. The definition of the composition operations has taken into account the peculiarities and characteristics of the PN formalisms, such as synchronisation, state evolution and token flow. The models obtained by applying the compositional method proposed are termed compositional WN cWN) systems. To consolidate a framework for the compositional construction and analysis of cWNs, we study the construction of structural and state space information about a cWN using information about its sub-components. The matrix description of the model [...] -known as the incidence matrix [...] -is shown to be obtainable using the incidence matrices of its sub-components, together with the knowledge of the composition operations used. By studying the relation between the resulting incidence matrix and the incidence matrices of its sub-components, methods are proposed to obtain the semiflows of the cWN model, using the semiflows of its sub-components. New, higher-level semiflows are defined, based on the structured definition of colours and arc functions of WN models. We show how the state space of a higher-level component can be built from the state spaces of its sub-components. This leads to the definition of a grouping of markings, termed a composed marking. It is proved that state space analysis over composed markings allows the verification of state space properties of the complete system, such as reachability, absence of deadlock and liveness, using the reduced state space. The concepts and propositions introduced are illustrated throughout the dissertation by the use of a series of examples. The methods proposed are applied over a model of a flexible manufacturing system, as a way to consolidate the understanding of the methodology. As a step towards the definition of a methodology for the performance oriented compositional construction and analysis of Stochastic Well-formed net systems modelling parallel and distributed systems, we study the extension of the compositional operations and methods proposed to support the incorporation of time specifications of the system modelled...|$|R

Peripheral nerve regeneration is a tightly regulated process that entails the degeneration, proliferation, alignment and remyelination of Schwann cells. Tuning the bioactivity {{is important to}} support all of these processes and achieving successful regeneration. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are important molecules for controlling cell behavior and differentiation. Mimicking the natural ECM proteins is a promising approach for promoting regeneration in peripheral nerve injury. In this study, we investigated the biocompatibility and bioactivity of two natural ECM <b>mimicking</b> peptide amphiphile (<b>PA)</b> molecules, heparan sulfate-mimicking PA (HM-PA) and laminin-mimicking PA (LN-PA), and showed that they self-assemble into ECM-like nanofibrous networks. These bioactive nanofibers promote the viability, proliferation and spreading of Schwann cells, and {{that the combination of}} the two bioactive epitopes supports both early and late neuroregenerative responses of Schwann cells. We have also shown that these nanofibers support the attachment and neurite extension of dorsal root ganglion neurons, and promotes neurite alignment and assembly in DRG-Schwann cell co-cultures. by Canelif Yılmaz.
