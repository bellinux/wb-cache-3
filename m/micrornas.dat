Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for <b>microRNAs</b> the 3' untranslated region contains. <b>MicroRNAs</b> tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of <b>microRNAs</b> that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E

Although researchers have identified many <b>microRNA</b> genes, relatively few <b>microRNA</b> targets have been identified by experimental methods.

To investigate the role of <b>microRNA</b> in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), we performed genome-wide expression analyses of mRNA and <b>microRNA</b> in T cells from ITP patients and controls.

5|$|Several {{types of}} RNA can {{downregulate}} gene expression by being complementary to {{a part of}} an mRNA or a gene's DNA. <b>MicroRNAs</b> (miRNA; 21-22nt) are found in eukaryotes and act through RNA interference (RNAi), where an effector complex of miRNA and enzymes can cleave complementary mRNA, block the mRNA from being translated, or accelerate its degradation.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner.

This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by <b>microRNAs</b> complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated.

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>microRNA</b> has {{potentially}} uncovered {{a new level}} of complexity to be considered for every biological process.
