6000|$|... "They'll shape {{me in your}} arms, Janet, [...] "A dove, but and a swan; [...] "And, last, they'll shape me in your arms, [...] "A <b>mother-naked</b> man: [...] "Cast your green mantle over me-- [...] "I'll be mysell again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Only {{when all}} the world has testified, [...] May soul {{confound}} it, crying out in joy, [...] And laughing on its lonely precipice. [...] What's dearth and death and sickness to the soul [...] That knows no virtue but itself? Nor could it, [...] So trembling with delight and <b>mother-naked,</b> [...] Live unabashed if the arguing world stood by.|$|E
6000|$|Stevenson never wrote, to my knowledge, in [...] "The Saturday Review"; journalism never [...] "set his genius." [...] For {{one reason}} among many, his manner {{was by far}} too {{personal}} in those days of unsigned contributions. He needed money, he wished to be financially independent, but, in the Press, his independence could not be all that he desired. He did not wield the ready, punctual pen of him whom Lockhart most invidiously calls [...] "the bronzed and <b>mother-naked</b> gentleman of the Press." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{simplest}} costume," [...] observes our Professor, [...] "which I anywhere find {{alluded to}} in History, is that used as regimental, by Bolivar's Cavalry, {{in the late}} Colombian wars. A square Blanket, twelve feet in diagonal, is provided (some were wont {{to cut off the}} corners, and make it circular): in the centre a slit is effected eighteen inches long; through this the <b>mother-naked</b> Trooper introduces his head and neck; and so rides shielded from all weather, and in battle from many strokes (for he rolls it about his left arm); and not only dressed, but harnessed and draperied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] I replied, [...] "do {{you wish}} to insult me? After your father put you in my charge, too! If you two are going, I shall come also, if I have to do so <b>mother-naked.</b> But {{let me tell you}} once and for all in the most {{emphatic}} language I can command, that I consider you a brace of confounded lunatics, and that if the Pongo don't eat you, it will be more than you deserve. To think that at my age I should be dragged among a lot of cannibal savages without even a pistol, to fight some unknown brute with my bare hands! Well, we can only die once--that is, so far as we know at present." ...|$|E
60|$|It blew All {{night from}} the south; all night, Rahero contended and kept The prow to the cresting sea; and, silent {{as though she}} slept, The woman huddled and quaked. And now was the peep of day. High and long on their left the mountainous island lay; And over the peaks of Taiarapu arrows of {{sunlight}} struck. On shore the birds were beginning to sing: the ghostly ruck Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave; And here on the sea, the woman, waxing suddenly brave, Turned her swiftly about and looked {{in the face of}} the man. And sure he was none that she knew, none of her country or clan: A stranger, <b>mother-naked,</b> and marred with the marks of fire, But comely and great of stature, a man to obey and admire.|$|E

6000|$|CASHEL. Murder! I would I had. Yon cannibal [...] Hath forty {{thousand}} lives; and I have ta'en [...] But thousands thirty-nine. I tell thee, Lydia, [...] On the impenetrable sarcolobe [...] That holds his seedling brain these fists have pounded [...] By Shrewsb'ry clock an hour. This bruiséd grass [...] And cakéd mud adhering to my form [...] I have acquired in rolling on the sod [...] Clinched in his grip. This scanty reefer coat [...] For decency snatched up as fast I fled [...] When the police arrived, belongs to Mellish. [...] 'Tis all too short; hence my display of rib [...] And forearm <b>mother-naked.</b> Be not wroth [...] Because I seem to wink at you: by Heaven, [...] 'Twas Paradise that plugged {{me in the}} eye [...] Which I perforce keep closing. Pity me, [...] My training wasted and my blows unpaid, [...] Sans stakes, sans victory, sans everything [...] I had hoped to win. Oh, I could sit me down [...] And weep for bitterness.|$|E
6000|$|All naked {{as he was}} he cut the stag's throat in {{the usual}} manner, and gralloched him with all the skill of Bucklaw. This was very well, and very well {{it would be to}} add a {{description}} of the stag at bay; but as I never happened to see a stag at bay, I omit all that. Dick had achieved success, but his clothes were on one side of a roaring river in spate, and he and the dead stag were on the other. There was no chance of fording the stream, and there was then no bridge. He did not care to swim back, for the excitement was out of him. He was trembling with cold, and afraid of cramp. [...] "A <b>mother-naked</b> man," [...] in a wilderness, with a flood between him and his raiment, was in a pitiable position. It did not occur to him to flay the stag, and dress in the hide, and, indeed, he would have been frozen before he could have accomplished that task. So he reconnoitred.|$|E
6000|$|We then {{crossed the}} Wady Rábigh, {{another of the}} short broad valleys which {{distinguish}} this section of South Midian. The bed sides, especially the right, are heaps and mounds of snowy quartz, with glittering crowns of block and boulder: all prove to be veins in the grey granite, whose large coarse elements are decomposed by weather. The dark and rusty walls of the valley also discharge the white stone in shunts and shoots: here and there they might be mistaken for Goz ("sand-banks") heaped up by the wind, except that these are clad in thin vegetation, whereas the [...] "Maru'" [...] is mostly <b>mother-naked.</b> We halted here for rest and to examine these features: despite the Khamsín, the Great Gaster became querulous; hunger was now the chief complaint, and even the bon ordinaire had {{lost much of its}} attraction. A harmless snake was killed and bottled; its silver robe was beautifully banded with a line, pink as the circles of the [...] "cobra coral," [...] which ran along the whole length of the back. It proved to be a new species; and Dr. Gunther named it Zamenis elegantissimus.|$|E
60|$|I felt I {{was getting}} daunted, {{and began to}} be afraid I looked it, which would never do. Up I stood, made believe to stretch myself, came down the {{verandah}} stair, and strolled towards the river. There went a short buzz {{from one to the}} other, like what you hear in theatres when the curtain goes up; and some of the nearest gave back the matter of a pace. I saw a girl lay one hand on a young man and make a gesture upward with the other; {{at the same time she}} said something in the native with a gasping voice. Three little boys sat beside my path, where I must pass within three feet of them. Wrapped in their sheets, with their shaved heads and bits of top-knots, and queer faces, they looked like figures on a chimney-piece. A while they sat their ground, solemn as judges. I came up hand over fist, doing my five knots, like a man that meant business; and I thought I saw a sort of a wink and gulp in the three faces. Then one jumped up (he was the farthest off) and ran for his mammy. The other two, trying to follow suit, got foul, came to ground together bawling, wriggled right out of their sheets <b>mother-naked,</b> and in a moment there were all three of them scampering for their lives and singing out like pigs. The natives, who would never let a joke slip, even at a burial, laughed and let up, as short as a dog's bark.|$|E
60|$|Next morning {{men from}} the shore saw the Haliotis through a cloud, for {{it was as though}} the deck smoked. Her crew were chasing steam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the forward donkey-engine; and where oakum failed to plug a crack, they {{stripped}} off their loin-cloths for lapping, and swore, half-boiled and <b>mother-naked.</b> The donkey-engine worked - at a price - the price of constant attention and furious stoking- worked long enough to allow a wire-rope (it was made up of a funnel and a foremast-stay) to be led into the engine-room and made fast on the cylinder-cover of the forward engine. That rose easily enough, and was hauled through the skylight and on to the deck, many hands assisting the doubtful steam. Then came the tug of war, for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed piston-rod. They removed two of the piston junk-ring studs, screwed in two strong iron eye-bolts by way of handles, doubled the wire-rope, and set half a dozen men to smite with an extemporised battering-ram {{at the end of the}} piston-rod, where it peered through the piston, while the donkey-engine hauled upwards on the piston itself. After four hours of this furious work, the piston-rod suddenly slipped, and the piston rose with a jerk, knocking one or two men over into the engine-room. But when Mr. Wardrop declared that the piston had not split, they cheered, and thought nothing of their wounds; and the donkey-engine was hastily stopped; its boiler was nothing to tamper with.|$|E

6000|$|Evil sped {{the battle}} play On the Pope Calixtus' day; Mighty war-smiths, thanes and lords, In Senlac slept the sleep of swords. Harold Earl, shot over shield, Lay along the autumn weald; Slaughter such was never none Since the Ethelings England won. [...] Thither Lady Githa came, Weeping sore for grief and shame; How may she her first-born tell? Frenchmen stript {{him where he}} fell, Gashed and marred his comely face; Who can know him in his place? [...] Up and spake two brethren wise, 'Youngest hearts have keenest eyes; Bird which leaves its mother's nest, Moults its pinions, moults its crest. Let us call the Swan-neck here, She that was his leman dear; She shall know him in this stound; Foot of wolf, and scent of hound, Eye of hawk, and wing of dove, Carry woman to her love.' [...] Up and spake the Swan-neck high, 'Go! to all your thanes let cry How I loved him best of all, I whom men his leman call; Better knew his body fair Than the mother which him bare. When ye lived in wealth and glee Then ye scorned to look on me; God hath brought the proud ones low After me afoot to go.' [...] Rousing erne and sallow glede, Rousing gray wolf off his feed, Over franklin, earl, and thane, Heaps of <b>mother-naked</b> slain, Round the red field tracing slow, Stooped that Swan-neck white as snow; Never blushed nor turned away, Till she found him where he lay; Clipt him in her armes fair, Wrapt him in her yellow hair, Bore him from the battle-stead, Saw him laid in pall of lead, Took her to a minster high, For Earl Harold's soul to cry.|$|E
