A <b>minimum</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and a determinate skill set for its application are required. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of treatment with high-concentration-capsaicin-patches in clinical practice in a variety of refractory peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes in non-diabetic patients. Methods: Observational, prospective, single-center study of patients attended to in the Pain Unit of a tertiary hospital, ≥ 18 year-old non-responders to multimodal analgesia of both genders. The feasibility for the application of capsaicin patch in clinical practice was evaluated by means of the number of patients controlled per day when this one was applied and by means of the times used for patch application. Results: Between October 2010 and September 2011, 20 consecutive non-diabetic patients (7 males, 13 females) with different diagnoses of refractory peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes, with a median (range) age of 60 (33 – 88) years-old were treated with a single patch application. The median (range) number of patients monitored per day was not modified when the capsaicin patch was applied [27 (26 – 29) ] in comparison with it was not applied [28 (26 – 30) ]. The median (range) total time to determine and mark the painful area was 9 (6 – 15) minutes and of patch application was 60 (58 – 65) minutes. No important adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion: High-concentration-capsaicin-patch treatment was feasible in our unit for the treatment of a population with refractory peripheral neuropathic pain.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the work done}} by the authors to analyze the method of performance characterization of a 100 W scale vertical axis wind turbines using a controlled-velocity test apparatus. The design of the power transfer system containing a gearbox and generator requires test data to determine the peak and operating range of wind speed, corresponding to RPM and torque. Multiple methods of turbine testing were considered, including in situ, wind tunnel, and control-velocity. Controlled-velocity, a method where the turbine is moved through a fluid, was selected based on lack of test location wind speeds or access to a wind tunnel of sufficient size. The test apparatus {{is designed to be}} effective for VAWT turbines of a diameter range from 1. 45 to 4. 2 meters in a wind velocity range of 1 to 17 m/s. This covers a Reynolds number range between (2. 5 x 10 ^ 5 < Re < 4. 2 x 10 ^ 6). A change from previous control-velocity test apparatus is the use of a separate truck and trailer compared to a flatbed truck, which allows greater distance between the truck cab and the turbine, to decrease any flow interference of the cab. This previous work and testing has shown to be a valid test method in that the turbine is in similar turbulent conditions as near the ground and buildings which the turbine is designed for. The main advantage of this test apparatus is the ability to test turbines in a region with low average wind speeds and <b>minimum</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most {{commonly}} used malaria diagnostic tests, including microscopy and antigen-detecting rapid tests, cannot reliably detect low-density infections which are frequent in low transmission settings. Molecular {{methods such as}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensitive but remain too laborious for field deployment. In this study, the applicability of a malaria diagnosis kit based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mLAMP) was assessed in malaria endemic areas of Colombia with Plasmodium vivax predominance. First, a passive case detection (PCD) study on 278 febrile patients recruited in Tierralta (department of Cordoba) was conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of the mLAMP method. Second, an active case detection (ACD) study on 980 volunteers was conducted in 10 sentinel sites with different epidemiological profiles. Whole blood samples were processed for microscopic and mLAMP diagnosis. Additionally RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR were used as reference tests. In the PCD study, P. falciparum accounted for 23. 9 % and P. vivax for 76. 1 % of the infections and no cases of mixed-infections were identified. Microscopy sensitivity for P. falciparum and P. vivax were 100 % and 86. 1 %, respectively. mLAMP sensitivity for P. falciparum and P. vivax was 100 % and 91. 4 %, respectively. In the ACD study, mLAMP detected 65 times more cases than microscopy. A high proportion (98. 0 %) of the infections detected by mLAMP was from volunteers without symptoms. mLAMP sensitivity and specificity were comparable to RT-PCR.
