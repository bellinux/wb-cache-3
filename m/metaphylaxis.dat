40|$|ABSTRACT: Bovine {{respiratory}} diseases (BRD) affect production rates negatively {{because it}} compromise {{health and well-being}} of the affected animal. The hypothesis of this study was that the use of metaphylactic protocols based on the risk to develop BRD would reduce morbidity and pulmonary lesions. For this purpose, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of two metaphylactic protocols on the morbidity of feedlot cattle with a known sanitary history, occurrence of pulmonary lesions at slaughter, and the possible participation of Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) in the development of BRD. An experimental study was designed in which 3, 094 adult, male, cattle, were grouped according to the risk to develop BRD: a) group without <b>metaphylaxis</b> (n= 2, 104), low-risk animals; b) <b>metaphylaxis</b> group with oxytetracycline (n= 789), moderate-risk animals; c) <b>metaphylaxis</b> group with tildipirosin (n= 201), high-risk animals. All cattle were immunized against pathogens associated with BRD (BoHV- 1, BVDV, BRSV, PI 3). The morbidity for BRD was 8. 2 % (253 / 3, 094); cattle within the moderate-risk group for BRD had the lowest frequency (6. 1 %), followed by high-risk animals with tildipirosin <b>metaphylaxis</b> (6. 5 %) and low-risk without <b>metaphylaxis</b> (9. 1 %) (P= 0. 019). At the abattoir, 1. 2 % of lungs with lesions were found. There was a difference (P= 0. 036) in the frequency of pulmonary lesions between healthy animals (1. 1 %) and those diagnosed with BRD (2. 8 %). Two agents associated with BRD were identified by PCR assays in the lungs (n= 37) of cattle: M. haemolytica (16. 2 %) and H. somni (5. 4 %). In addition, concomitant infections involving these pathogens were identified in the lungs of two steers. These results demonstrate that the use of metaphylactic protocols, based on the risk to develop BRD, reduces morbidity and pulmonary lesions in affected cattle.

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to compare in two APP-problem herds the {{efficiency}} and profitability of a single-dose -injection of Tulathromycin with the usual feed medication of Amoxicillin resp. Tetracycline for <b>metaphylaxis</b> after weaning resp. starting fattening. The clinical trial was conducted from October 2007 to May 2008 in a farrow to wean herd (two series of 686 weaned piglets) and in an independent fattening herd (one series of 603 pigs), both with the repeated occurrence of acute Pleuropneumonia by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). After weaning resp. herd addition for fattening pigs were separated to different pens or stable rows for alternative <b>metaphylaxis</b> of Tulathromycin by a single i. m. -injection or of Amoxicillin-Trihydrat (weaned piglets) resp. of Tetracycline-HCL (fattening pigs) by oral feed medication of 7 days {{on the basis of}} preceding resistograms. With consideration for the farm owners only every 6 th or 10 th pig served as a non treated control (risk of losses). For space and feeding reasons (oral medications) these controls had to be housed in the same pens as the Tulathromycin medicated pigs. Objectives of this trial were kind and frequency of diseases and losses, growing performance (daily weight gain) and frequency of unsaleable pigs at delivery for fattening resp. slaughtering, as well as costs for drug treatments during the total growing period and for the growing delay. In addition, a sample of 280 weaned pigs was bleeded four times until delivery in order to control associations of C-Reactive-Proteine (CRP) and herd health resp. efficiency of <b>metaphylaxis.</b> Respiratory diseases and losses did not occur during their effective period. Afterwards the incidence of sporadically diseased pigs with different symptoms varied over time between 0 % an 19 % in weaned pigs resp. 1. 5 % and 6 % in fattening pigs without significant group differences. Losses in weaned pigs ranged from 0 to 5. 1 % and in fattening pigs significantly (p< 0. 05) from 1. 2 % resp. 1. 6 % (metaphylactic treatments) and 9. 3 % (untreated controls). At {{the end of the first}} weaner series, in the 7 th week, only the Amoxicillin-group was affected by an acute APP-infection with 93. 5 % of diseased pigs. CRP-serum values of the first weaner series with an acute APP-outbreak differed extremely between groups and dates, particularly between first and follow up dates. Consecutive studies should clarify, if high values, as observed in our study and in contrast to others, are associated with a powerful immunity resp. with an efficient <b>metaphylaxis</b> (Tulathromycingroup), and if low values indicate the onset of the incubation of an infectious disease (Amoxicillin-group). In the first series of weaned pigs daily weight gains were significantly higher in the Tulathromycin-treated group (p< 0, 05) than in the APP-diseased Amoxicillin-group (0, 433 kg vs. 0, 388 kg) but not in the control group. In the second series of weaners and in fattening pigs groups did not differ in the growing performance. Due to the APP-infection in the first series of weaners, the rate of unsaleable pigs at delivery was significantly higher (p< 0, 001) in the Amoxicillin-group (24, 9 %) as compared to the Tulathromycin-group (5, 9 %) and the untreated controls (10, 9 %). Costs for <b>metaphylaxis</b> and additional medications per pig over time (drugs and treatments by stock´s person), and daily costs per unsaleable pigs after delivery were in case of the APP-infection much lower with Tulathromycin than with Amoxicillin as a <b>metaphylaxis.</b> In the second series of weaners and in fattenting pigs, each without APP-infection, oral Amoxicillinresp. Tetracycline-metaphylaxis was less expensive in total than the Tulathromycinmetaphylaxis by single dose injection. This is mainly due to higher drug volumes and working expenditure for the i. m. application. Further studies under field conditions should prove if total costs of Tulathromycin-metaphylaxis in case of extremely exposed APP-fattening herds may adjust or even reverse these costs. The good health and growing performance of non treated controls which were housed commonly with the Tulathromycin treated pigs might be the result of the antimicrobial caused decrease in germ pressure and its consecutive lower risk of infection. With reservation of the specific herd situations in this field study we conclude that in extremely APP-exposed weaned piglets the parenteral <b>metaphylaxis</b> of Tulathromycin with a single i. m. injection might be more efficient and less expensive during the growing period than oral medication of Amoxicillin over 7 days...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, there has been {{relevant}} progress in both understanding and managing urolithiasis. Our knowledge of stone formation has changed; although the importance of urine biochemistry was questioned by several investigators years ago, the decisive role of cellular processes (induced by oxidative stress) and the renal papilla has only recently been generally accepted {{as the most important}} step in stone formation. For calcium oxalate urolithiasis, the formation of papillary calcifications plays a key role and is of prognostic relevance. Further research has to concentrate on these aspects of preventing urolithiasis. Stone prevention (<b>metaphylaxis)</b> is a major issue when considering the burden it places on healthcare systems. An effective <b>metaphylaxis</b> could lower the cost of stone therapy significantly. For uric acid urolithiasis, so far there is only preliminary information available showing that papillary plaques are not as important as they are in calcium oxalate urolithiasis.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this survey was to determine herd level risk factors for mortality, unwanted early slaughter, and metaphylactic application of antimicrobial group therapy in Swiss veal calves in 2013. A questionnaire regarding farm structure, farm management, mortality and antimicrobial use was sent to all farmers registered in a Swiss label program setting requirements for improved animal welfare and sustainability. Risk factors were determined by multivariable logistic regression. A total of 619 veal producers returned a useable questionnaire (response rate= 28. 5 %), of which 40. 9 % only fattened their own calves (group O), 56. 9 % their own calves and additional purchased calves (group O&P), and 2. 3 % only purchased calves for fattening (group P). A total number of 19, 077 calves entered the fattening units in 2013, of which 21. 7 %, 66. 7 %, and 11. 6 % belonged to groups O, O&P, and P, respectively. Mortality was 0 % in 322 herds (52. 0 %), between 0 % and 3 % in 47 herds (7. 6 %), and ≥ 3 % in 250 herds (40. 4 %). Significant risk factors for mortality were purchasing calves, herd size, higher incidence of BRD, and access to an outside pen. <b>Metaphylaxis</b> was used on 13. 4 % of the farms (7. 9 % only upon arrival, 4. 4 % only later in the fattening period, 1. 1 % upon arrival and later), in 3. 2 % of the herds of group O, 17. 9 % of those in group O&P, and 92. 9 % of those of group P. Application of <b>metaphylaxis</b> upon arrival was positively associated with purchase (OR= 8. 9) and herd size (OR= 1. 2 per 10 calves). <b>Metaphylaxis</b> later in the production cycle was positively associated with group size (OR= 2. 9) and risk of respiratory disease (OR= 1. 2 per 10 % higher risk) and negatively {{with the use of}} individual antimicrobial treatment (OR= 0. 3). In many countries, purchase and a large herd size are inherently connected to veal production. The Swiss situation with large commercial but also smaller herds with little or no purchase of calves made it possible to investigate the effect of these factors on mortality and antimicrobial drug use.

40|$|International audienceThe early {{curative}} uses of antimicrobial {{drugs such}} as fluoroquinolones {{before the onset of}} symptoms in veterinary medicine may be regarded as irrational antibiotic consumption. However, it should be stressed that in early curative antimicrobial treatment as in <b>metaphylaxis,</b> the bacterial burden at the infection site is often very low, and so the rapid eradication of the bacterial population could result. We investigated the impact of early versus later curative administrations of 1 or 40 mg/kg of marbofloxacin on the survival of mice, the eradication of the targeted pathogen and the selection of resistant bacteria in a mouse lung infection with Pasteurella multocida. In this model, for a given marbofloxacin dose, the clinical and bacteriological outcomes were better, and the selection of resistance less frequent, for the early rather than for the late treatment. Moreover, the early administration of 1 mg/kg led to better clinical and similar bacteriological (eradication and selection of resistance) outcomes than the late administration of 40 mg/kg marbofloxacin. Our results suggest that the optimal doses for the animals' cure could be lower when administered early during the time course of the infection than when administered after the disease outbreak. As the main argument against early treatments such as <b>metaphylaxis</b> is the possible enhancement of resistance at the gut level, further studies should assess if lower doses of antibiotic administered to all the animals of a herd could have less impact on the commensal digestive flora than higher doses only administered to animals showing clinical symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluate}} a compact portable system for immediate automated postoperative ex vivo analysis of urinary stone composition using Raman spectroscopy. Analysis of urinary stone composition provides essential {{information for the}} treatment and <b>metaphylaxis</b> of urolithiasis. Currently infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction are used for urinary stone analysis. However, these methods may require complex sample preparation and costly laboratory equipment. In contrast, Raman spectrometers could be a simple and quick strategy for immediate stone analysis. Materials and Methods: Pure samples of 9 stone components and 159 human urinary calculi were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy using a microscope coupled system at 2 excitation wavelengths. Signal-to-noise ratio, peak positions and the distinctness of the acquired Raman spectra were analyzed and compared. Background fluorescence was removed mathematically. Corrected Raman spectra were used as a reference library for aut omated classification of native human urinary stones (50). The results were then compared to standard infrared spectroscopy. Results: Signal-to-noise ratio was superior at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. An automated, computer based classifier was capable of matching spectra from patient samples with those of pure stone components. Consecutive analysis of 50 human stones demonstrated 100 % sensitivity and specificity compared to infrared spectroscopy (for components with more than 25 % of total composition). Conclusions: Our pilot study indicates that Raman spectroscopy is a valid and reliable technique for determining urinary stone composition.

High impact and cost of BRD necessitates development of preventative mechanisms to improve animal health, performance, and well-being and to augment the sustainability of beef production. Two potential mechanisms to prevent disease were investigated: through metaphylactic therapy (or the on-arrival mass medication of a group of high-risk cattle to control BRD) and through manipulation of dietary energy intake. A trial was conducted to determine the effects of on-arrival <b>metaphylaxis</b> in beef cattle for controlling BRD and the subsequent effects on health and performance. Male calves in a randomized complete block design (n= 198) received ceftiofur crystalline free acid (EXC), tilmicosin phosphate (MIC), or were not treated (CON). Significant differences were not observed in morbidity rates (P = 0. 14) between cattle on the MIC (46. 4 ? 4. 32 %) or EXC treatments (56. 5 ? 4. 32 %). Both the MIC and EXC treatments effectively reduced overall morbidity and delayed onset of clinical illness in newly received beef cattle. Furthermore, this reduction in overall morbidity was achieved with minimal increase in total antimicrobial usage. While overall performance outcomes were not different, animal health was improved with <b>metaphylaxis.</b> A second trial was conducted to determine the effects of limit-feeding growing steers on immune function. Thirty-two steers were fed the same ration at one of three intake levels (low, medium, or high DMI). All steers were vaccinated on study d- 0 with a five-way modified live vaccine, which acted as an immunological challenge to measure immune function.

The incidence of urolithiasis is increasing throughout the world, and existing <b>metaphylaxis</b> is not widely effective. This results in an increasing need for active stone removal. SWL was and is a well established treatment modality for urolithiasis in the upper urinary tract. For most stone situations there will remain a reasonable choice between SWL versus endoscopic procedures, and it is unlikely that endoscopic procedures will displace SWL completely in general practice. In conclusion, SWL will continue to play an established, if slightly reduced, role in stone treatment in the future...|$|E

Conventional management of calves at high risk for BRD often includes mass treatment with antimicrobials at arrival followed by visual observation for individual clinical cases. These methods have proven effective; however, control program efficacy is influenced by the accuracy of visual observation. A remote early disease identification (REDI) system has been described that monitors cattle behavior to identify potential BRD cases. The objective of this research was to compare health and performance outcomes using either traditional BRD control (visual observation and <b>metaphylaxis)</b> or REDI during a 60 -d postarrival phase in high-risk beef calves. The randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in 8 replicates at 3 different facilities over a 19 -mo period. In each replicate, a single load of calves was randomly allocated to receive either conventional management (CONV; total n = 8) or REDI (total n = 8) as the method for BRD control. Cattle were monitored with each diagnostic method for the first 30 d on feed and performance variables were collected until approximately 60 d after arrival. Statistical differences (P 0. 10) in risk of BRD treatment and REDI calves were not administered antimicrobials at arrival; therefore, REDI calves had a lower (P < 0. 01) average number of doses of antimicrobials/calf (0. 75 +/- 0. 1 doses) compared with CONV calves (1. 67 +/- 0. 1 doses).

40|$|Abstract Urolithiasis {{is one of}} the commonest afflictions of the urinary tract. Stones are {{of various}} {{chemical}} compositions, some share some common etiology; but most are specific to the structure and composition of stone. In view of highly recurrent nature of this condition, it is logical to have strategies for prevention. However, due to multiple factors most patients receive no or fragmented information on prevention. The current controversy is to the extent of metabolic workup in adult first time stone former. This requires longitudinal studies to show benefit in prevention strategies. Patients at high risk can have recurrence in weeks to years, depending upon the composition and attending risk factor. They should be targeted with concentric and tailored prevention protocols. The major urological guidelines (EAU and AUA) recommend basic stone workup for all patients. However, indication for detailed workup are less well documented, so one potential solution is to tailor <b>metaphylaxis</b> strategies for individual patient...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) constitutes {{one of the}} key health issues and most costly problems occurring in cattle in the U. S and all part of the world. Increased morbidity and mortality, decreased weight gains, decreased feed utilization, decrease carcass quality and increased prophylaxis and therapy lead to enormous economic losses. This is a disease complex that involves multiple microbial pathogens (viruses and bacteria), environmental and host predisposing risk factors. Increasing beef and dairy production in all part of the world will benefit from improved prevention and control of BRD. The use of management strategies, such as preconditioning programs, has a significant potential to decrease BRD cases and overall negative impact. Other programs, such as <b>metaphylaxis,</b> are useful in situations where calves entering a feedlot are at “high risk” for developing BRD. The cattle health industry should continue to identify means of BRD control though the development and use of new technologies with the aim of enhancing resistance, reducing risk factors and decreasing pathogen exposure...|$|E
40|$|Urolithiasis is a {{very common}} affliction of mankind. In western {{countries}} incidence is increasing steadily. An increasing proportion of patients are presenting with ureteral stones, of which renal colic most often is the first complaint and the most common reason for an emergency visit to a urologist. Proper imaging strategy {{is of paramount importance}} in the diagnosis of acute flank pain and in the subsequent therapy planning once a ureteral stone is diagnosed. Renal colic during pregnancy poses specific problems, both in imaging and therapy. Apart from the adequate treatment of renal colic, modern therapy of those ureteral calculi that will not pass spontaneously will consist of a judicious combination of ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy), endourology, and laparoscopy. Open surgery should only be reserved for limited and very specific indications. Although {{beyond the scope of this}} article, <b>metaphylaxis</b> should take an important role in the follow-up of stone patients in general...|$|E
40|$|The classic "infection stone" {{struvite}} {{is formed}} as a result of metabolic activity of urease-positive bacteria from alkaline urine with pH-values above 7. 5. Due to improved infection diagnostics and antibiotic therapy, the occurrence of infection-related urinary stones in the western industrialized world decreases, despite the generally increasing prevalence rates of urolithiasis in these societies. Struvite is often associated with other mineral phases. These accessory mineral phases could indicate other, non-infection-related causes of urinary stone formation. Thus, mineral analysis is always recommended. Struvite stones as well as struvite encrustations on urinary tract implants are characterized by rapid growth. The rapid growth-related embedding of urease-positive bacteria in the crystalline material makes the urinary stone a persistent source of recurrent urinary tract infections. According to the German Society of Urology guidelines on urolithiasis, a patient with the diagnosis "infection stone" should be assigned to the "high-risk" patient group. Complete stone and debris removal, as well as a special <b>metaphylaxis</b> strategy are required to initiate successful stone therap...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDavid G. RenterSalmonella and Campylobacter are {{two leading}} causes of human {{foodborne}} disease. Cattle can asymptomatically shed these organisms in their feces. Fluoroquinolones are antimicrobials used to treat both humans and animals. With concerns over antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial use in livestock has become scrutinized. Data on prevalence and susceptibility of Salmonella and Campylobacter in feedlot cattle, particularly those exposed to fluoroquinolones, are sparse. The purpose of the research described in this dissertation {{was to determine the}} prevalence and quinolone susceptibility of Salmonella and Campylobacter isolated from feedlot cattle and to determine whether these outcomes were associated with fluoroquinolone use. First, an observational study was performed at five commercial feedlots that used enrofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) as first-line treatment for bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Fecal samples were collected from cattle pens with various levels of BRD and exposure to enrofloxacin. Salmonella and Campylobacter prevalence and susceptibility to quinolones, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, were evaluated. Prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter was highly variable among and within feedlots. All but one Salmonella isolate was susceptible to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, whereas 49 % (126 / 256) of the Campylobacter isolates were resistant to both antimicrobials. However, the number of enrofloxacin treatments was not associated with the prevalence or susceptibilities of either organism. A second, experimental study assessed prevalence and quinolone susceptibilities of Salmonella and Campylobacter in feces of feedlot cattle administered enrofloxacin for the control of BRD (<b>metaphylaxis).</b> Cattle with no history of fluoroquinolone exposure were randomly assigned to either an enrofloxacin treated pen or a non-treated, control pen. Cattle feces were repeatedly collected and cultured for Salmonella and Campylobacter, with isolates tested for susceptibilities to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Overall, Salmonella and Campylobacter prevalence estimates were relatively low and decreased over time. Resistance prevalence was negligible for Salmonella, but was high for Campylobacter. However, {{there was no evidence that}} enrofloxacin <b>metaphylaxis</b> impacted the prevalence of Salmonella or Campylobacter, nor did it significantly affect their susceptibility to human quinolones. In conclusion, enrofloxacin use in feedlot cattle does not appear to have a significant impact on the prevalence or resistance of Salmonella and Campylobacter...|$|E

This process has to occur within urinary transit time (UT) through the kidney before crystals are washed out by diuresis. To get more information, we studied by spectrophotometry {{the formation and}} AGN of Ca oxalate (Ca Ox) crystals which were directly produced in urine of 30 stone patients and 30 controls by an oxalate (Ox) titration. Some tests were also performed after removing urinary macromolecules (UMs) by ultrafiltration. To induce rapid crystallization, high Ox additions (0. 5 – 0. 8 [*]mM) were necessary. The most important finding was retardation of crystal AGN by UM. In urine of 63 % of controls but only 33 % of patients, no AGN was observed during an observation of 60 minutes (P < 0. 05). Also growth and sedimentation rate of crystals were significantly reduced by UM.

40|$|ABSTRACTAntimicrobial <b>metaphylaxis</b> is an {{important}} tool used {{for the prevention of}} bovine respiratory disease complex, an economically important disease that typically affects newly weaned beef calves that are marketed and transported a distance from their origin. An experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} administering 2 different metaphylactic products [tulathromycin (TULA) and gamithromycin (GAMI) ] on differences on core body temperature, health, and performance on 284 highly stressed stocker calves. Calves were procured and delivered (transient time = 13. 5 h average) from a southeastern United States order buyer in 3 truckload lots during a 6 -d period in October 2011. The core body temperatures in nonmorbid calves in the TULA calves were greater compared with the GAMI calves the first 2 h after administration and at multiple time points on d 4 through 6 of the experiment (P < 0. 05). Calves receiving TULA experienced less morbidity (P < 0. 01) and less chronicity (P < 0. 05) when compared with GAMI calves. Calves in the TULA group had greater ADG (P < 0. 001) from arrival to d 45 compared with calves injected with GAMI. This experiment indicated that metaphylactic products may affect core body temperature differently, which may be {{an important}} consideration when managing the health of high-risk calves. Moreover, both health and performance differences may exist among calves administered different metaphylactic products. Therefore, product selection {{is an important}} decision when managing high-risk calves...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{treatment}} of cystoid macular edema (CME) with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors {{has been known}} for over a decade. Initial observations were based on experimental data which suggested that acetazolamide can increase fluid absorption across the retinal pigment epithelium. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) have also been shown to have other direct effects both on retinal and retinal pigment epithelial cell function by inducing an acidification of the subretinal space, a decrease of the standing potential as well as an increase in retinal adhesiveness. It is thought that acidification of the subretinal space is finally responsible for the increase in fluid resorption from the retina through the RPE into the choroid. Several clinical studies have suggested that patients with cystoid macular edema due to retinitis pigmentosa and uveitis may react more favorably to CAI treatment than other etiologies such as diabetic maculopathy or macular edema after retinal vein occlusion. The present working hypothesis is that diffuse leakage from the RPE responds more readily to CAI treatment than leakage from retinal vessels. This {{may be due to the}} modulation of membrane- bound CA IV in the RPE which may have lost its polarised distribution in the presence of macular edema. A normal clinical starting dose of CAI is 500 mg/day which should be continued for at least one month to see an effect. This dose may be reduced by the patients over the course of therapy. <b>Metaphylaxis</b> to the drug may occur with a rebound of the edema despite continuation of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Raman {{spectroscopy}} allows immediate {{analysis of}} stone composition. In vivo stone analysis during endoscopic treatment may offer advantages concerning surgical strategy and <b>metaphylaxis.</b> Urinary stone components were evaluated utilizing an experimental setup of a Raman system coupled to commercial laser fibers. Methods Samples of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and human urinary stones with known Raman spectra {{were analyzed using}} an experimental Raman system coupled to common commercial lithotripsy laser fibers (200 and 940 µm). Two different excitation lasers were used at wavelengths of 532 and 785 nm. Numerical aperture of the fibers, proportion of reflected light reaching the CCD chip, and integration times were calculated. Mathematical signal correction was performed. Results Both the laser beam profile {{and the quality of}} light reflected by the specimens were impaired significantly when used with commercial fibers. Acquired spectra could no longer be assigned to a specific stone composition. Subsequent measurements revealed a strong intrinsic fluorescence of the fibers and poor light acquisition properties leading to a significant decrease in the Raman signal in comparison with a free-beam setup. This was true for both investigated fiber diameters and both wavelengths. Microscopic examination showed highly irregular fiber tip surfaces (both new and used fibers). Conclusions Our results propose that laser excitation and light acquisition properties of commercial lithotripsy fibers impair detectable Raman signals significantly in a fiber-coupled setting. This study provides essential physical and technological information for the development of an advanced fiber-coupled system able to be used for immediate stone analysis during endoscopic stone therapy...|$|E
