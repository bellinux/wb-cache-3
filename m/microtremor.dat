A practical use of the technique has been designed and also examined at two experimental sites in an urban area, Morioka city in northen Honshu, Japan. The technique involves the measurement of the dispersion of both surface waves in <b>microtremors</b> by using a specially-designed circular seismic array consisting of more than three tri-axial seismometers that are equally spaced on acircle and one at the circular center. In determination of phase velocities of Love- and Rayleigh-waves, the newly-modified spatial auto-correlation method has been used. The method can provide not only the dispersion of Rayleigh waves, but also that of Love waves. The dispersion of Love waves is directly convertible to the S-wave velocity structure.

5000|$|Fixation or visual {{fixation}} is the maintaining of {{the visual}} gaze on a single location. An animal can exhibit visual fixation if they possess a fovea in the anatomy of their eye. The fovea is typically located {{at the center of}} the retina and is the point of clearest vision. The species in which fixational eye movement has been found thus far include humans, primates, cats, rabbits, turtles, salamanders, and owls. Regular eye movement alternates between saccades and visual fixations, the notable exception being in smooth pursuit, controlled by a different neural substrate that appears to have developed for hunting prey. The term [...] "fixation" [...] can either be used to refer to the point in time and space of focus or the act of fixating. Fixation, in the act of fixating, is the point between any two saccades, during which the eyes are relatively stationary and virtually all visual input occurs. In the absence of retinal jitter, a laboratory condition known as retinal stabilization, perceptions tend to rapidly fade away. To maintain visibility, the nervous system carries out a mechanism called fixational eye movement, which continuously stimulates neurons in the early visual areas of the brain responding to transient stimuli. There are three categories of fixational eye movements: microsaccades, ocular drifts, and ocular <b>microtremor.</b> Although the existence of these movements has been known since the 1950s, only recently their functions have started to become clear.|$|E

In the <b>microtremors,</b> the time-dependent HVSRs (ratiograms) are a useful tool to discriminate between the presence of real dominant frequencies linked to resonances of the subsurface structure and the spurious appearance of peaks due to local transients. We verified that the results are repeatable, in the sense that <b>microtremors</b> recorded at the same site but at different times yield a very similar HVSR function. Two types of results are found: (1) sites where there is no resonance of the propagating <b>microtremors,</b> and therefore no value of a dominant frequency can be assessed; and (2) sites where a stationary peak in the HVSR is found and a dominant frequency related to resonance of the shallow structure can be estimated. These resonant frequencies show substantial spatial variations even for nearby sites, which reflects the complexity of the shallow velocity structure in the Las Cañadas area. Large dominant frequencies occur near the caldera walls and also at a few locations that coincide with the intersections of the inferred rims of the three calderas forming Las Can ˜ adas.
