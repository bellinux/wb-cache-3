40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the mapping of eighteenth-century Scotland {{in relation to}} the British state’s imperatives to know the spaces of the nation. It {{examines the}} idea of the ‘military landscape’—that conjunction of forts, roads, and barracks—represented and constructed by the military engineers, surveyors, and draughtsmen of the Board of Ordnance between 1689 and 1815. In total, 940 maps constitute the Board of Ordnance ‘archive’ housed mainly in the National Library of Scotland, the British Library, the National Archives (Kew), and the Royal Library at Windsor. The study of the Board of Ordnance military maps of Scotland is considered {{in relation to the}} epistemological foundations of map making in the Enlightenment, particular focus being paid to the relations between government institutions and <b>military</b> <b>cartography.</b> The thesis considers how political and military power was embodied in the engineers’ maps and plans. It explores {{the extent to which the}} Scottish landscape—especially the Highlands—was an unknown territory demanding intellectual and material civilisation in cartographic form. In its main chapters on forts, movement, and battles, the thesis is organised to reflect the purpose behind the creation of military maps. It includes representations of military activities that consistently had recourse to mapping—fortifying, intelligence, reconnaissance, marching, encamping, and battle—and explains why military maps were conceived thus and how they were used. Fortification cartography dominates the representation of Scottish military landscapes: 73 % of the archive constitutes maps, plans, sections, and views of forts, barracks, and coastal batteries; 22 % maps associated with military movement; and 5 % battle maps. By examining the different genres of military mapping, the thesis offers an evaluation of the Board’s endeavours to rationalise and to codify <b>military</b> <b>cartography</b> in order to bring it in line with wider European practices. This review of the nature and extent of military mapping of eighteenth-century Scotland reveals the practice to be a result of institutional imperatives to assert territorial control rather than simply a cartographic enterprise. In (re) constructing the military landscape, the thesis extends current knowledge of military mapping in eighteenth-century Scotland and provides for the first time a substantive examination of the Board of Ordnance as an agency of state and cartographic authority.

40|$|In {{the years}} of 2004 to 2006, the Portuguese {{authority}} for forestry, the Direcção Geral dos Recursos Florestais (DGRF) ordered a digital photo flight over the whole country. The images, acquired with a Vexcel UltraCamD digital camera, have a GSD of about 50 cm and GPS/IMU data from an IGI AeroControl IId system were also available {{for most of the}} flown strips. Although the first objective of the images was to produce orthophotos {{to be used in the}} updating of the national forest inventory, several national institutions are using parts of the digital coverage for other products. In the Instituto Geográfico do Exército (IGeoE), the Geographic Institute of the Portuguese Army, a block of 142 of the existing images was analysed in order to conclude about its suitability for the actualization of the <b>military</b> <b>cartography</b> in the scale 1 : 25000. This paper describes the analysis made to the block from the point of view of a producing institution, whose concerns were mainly whether the geometric accuracy and radiometric resolution of such images fulfil the requirements for military mapping and whether the provided GPS/IMU data were accurate enough for dispensing aerotriangulation and ground control points. 1...|$|E

40|$|Although laser {{rangefinder}} technologies {{have been around}} for decades in <b>military,</b> <b>cartography,</b> building, industrial and research applications it is only in recent years that more generally applicable and cheaper consumer grade laser range finder sensors have become available. This project investigates the possibilities and limitations of creating a mobile 360 degree, two-dimensional obstacle detection system using off-the-shelf available electronic components. Using a Lidar Lite 3 from Garmin Ltd., an Arduino compatible microcontroller based on Atmel 328 P, a Raspberry Pi 3 from The Raspberry Pi Foundation and an electronic speed controlled brushless DC motor driving the rotation, it is shown how range data measurements can be collected, communicated, processed and displayed at measurement rates between 500 and 1000 Hz. At 5 Hz update rate of a complete 360 -degree data set, this translates to a worst case angular resolution of 2. 5 degrees at ranges reaching 10 meters depending on target reflectivity. Configured for these faster measurement rates, at static measurements of a white painted wall, the measurements show a standard deviation of 0. 06 m at a five-meter range, going up to 0. 19 m at a range of 10 meters. A modular and mobile prototype was designed and built. The modularity allowed testing and verification of two configurations. Configuration A uses a slip ring for power and data transfer to the rotating sensor. Configuration B allows the laser range finder to be stationary and instead rotates a first surface aluminum mirror positioned at 45 degrees above the sensor. The measurement results show that increasing range has a notable adversely effect on the number of successful readings in a setting demanding faster measurement rates of above 500 Hz. The number of successful readings decreases at ranges above 5 meters, and this decrease of successful readings is more pronounced in the configuration using a mirror to reflect the measurement. The mirror reflected version does on the other hand allow an electromechanically simpler, more silent and durable system. Using a density based clustering algorithm it is shown how person sized objects in the point cloud data can be robustly detected at ranges up to 5 meters. ...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Diplomarbeit beschäftigt sich sowohl theoretisch als auch empirisch mit den Methoden der Genauigkeitsanalyse historischer Karten. Anhand einer umfangreichen Literaturrecherche werden zunächst alle relevanten Verfahren der Lage- und Höhengenauigkeitsuntersuchung theoretisch erläutert. Die Dissertationen von BEINEKE [2001] und NIEDERÖST [2005] lieferten hierzu wesentliche Grundlagen. Mittels adäquater Methoden wird im Anschluss erstmals eine umfassende Genauigkeitsanalyse am Beispiel der Dritten Österreichischen Landesaufnahme (1869 - 1887) durchgeführt. Ihre Kartenwerke zählen zu den bedeutendsten des 19. Jahrhunderts. Die Untersuchung erfolgt beispielhaft an zwei ausgewählten Gradkartenblättern (Innsbruck und Lienz) im Maßstab 1 : 25. 000, sowie an deren Reambulierungen. Als Referenzkartenwerk dient die aktuelle Landesaufnahme in Form der Österreichischen Karte 1 : 50. 000 (ÖK 50). Für die Lagegenauigkeitsanalyse wird die Open-Source-Software MapAnalyst eingesetzt. Die Analyse der Höhen-genauigkeit erfolgt mit Hilfe folgender Methoden: dem Vergleich kotierter Punkte und dem Vergleich digitaler Höhenmodelle. Die erzielten Ergebnisse zeugen schließlich von einer qualitativ hochwertigen Ingenieurleistung der damaligen österreichischen Militärkartographie. This thesis {{deals with}} the methods of the {{accuracy}} analysis of historical maps, both theoretically and empirically. In a first part, all major techniques of surveying the horizontal accuracy and the accuracy of elevation are explained theoretically {{on the basis of}} an extensive literature research. Essential foundations were provided by the dissertations of BEINEKE [2001] and NIEDERÖST [2005]. A comprehensive accuracy analysis is realized for the first time using the example of the third Austrian land survey (1869 - 1887) by applying adequate methods. The map series of the third Austrian land survey is generally {{known as one of the}} most outstanding of the 19 th century. The study is carried out by means of two selected survey sheets (Innsbruck and Lienz) and their revisions representatively, which are both on a scale of 1 : 25. 000. The Austrian map 1 : 50. 000 (ÖK 50) of the current land survey acts as the reference map series. The open source software MapAnalyst is employed for analysing the horizontal accuracy of the historical maps. The analysis of the accuracy of elevation is conducted by applying the following methods: the comparison of surveyed points as well as the comparison of digital elevation models. In conclusion the achieved results are evidence of a ‘high-quality’ engineer work by the former Austrian <b>military</b> <b>cartography...</b>|$|E
