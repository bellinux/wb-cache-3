First, there are the national and local institutions, which provide the broad guidelines for the organization and execution of the program.

The main aim of this chapter is to analyse what they mean and what they involve with respect to other formal mechanisms of participation that have been in operation in European cities for decades, and which were largely based on the role given to associations. We shall avoid here the justification of why it is necessary to open more forums to citizen participation in the design of public policies, a subject that we have already discussed in other papers (Font, 2001). Working therefore on the basis that this participation is necessary, the argument developed here refers to how these participatory processes work and who leads them. Specifically, we want to analyse a series of experiences which have in common the fact that they go beyond the instruments of associative democracy which most Spanish and European town councils have adopted for many years (Navarro, 1999). That is, here we shall study all those participation mechanisms involving some innovation with respect to the <b>municipal</b> <b>consultative</b> <b>councils,</b> the presence of which has become generalised in our large and medium-sized municipalities.
