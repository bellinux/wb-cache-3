40|$|Hilbert-Huang {{method is}} {{proposed}} to identify of <b>modal</b> <b>responses</b> of hysteretic multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures under free vibration. In this study, a response time history is first decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The Hilbert transform is then applied to each IMF {{to obtain the}} instantaneous amplitude and frequency. Modal analysis of nonlinear structures, which treats the nonlinearity at each time step as a pseudo force, is used to uncouple the equations of motion {{in order to obtain}} the nonlinear <b>modal</b> <b>responses.</b> The Bouc-Wen model is used to simulate the hysteretic behavior of a two-degree-of-freedom shear-beam building model. The IMF components of the displacement responses are compared with the nonlinear <b>modal</b> <b>responses</b> obtained from the modal analysis, in which three cases are considered for the pseudo force. In Cases 1 and 2, the pseudo force is the hysteretic force without and with its linear component, respectively. The pseudo force in Case 3 is taken in the form that the stiffness matrix becomes {{the same as that of}} the linear building model.

This study aims to experimentally validate the blind source separation using ICA method and propose a novel method for identification of the modal parameters from the decomposed <b>modal</b> <b>responses.</b> The result of the experimental testing on the three-story steel scale model shows that the mode shapes obtained by ICA method are in good agreement with those by the analytical and peak-picking method in the frequency domain. Based on the robust mathematical model, ICA can calculate the natural frequency and damping ratio effectively using the probability distribution function of the instantaneous natural frequency determined by Hilbert transform of the decomposed <b>modal</b> <b>responses</b> and the change in the output covariance. Finally, the validity of the proposed method paves the way for more effective output-only modal identification for assessment of existing steel-concrete buildings.|$|R

The resulting IMFs are compared with the corresponding nonlinear <b>modal</b> <b>responses,</b> including their instantaneous frequencies and time-dependent amplitudes from the HT method. The comparison indicates that the resulting IMFs from the EMD method can reveal the nonlinear <b>modal</b> <b>responses.</b> It is seen that this EMD-based technique is fairly accurate to determine the nonlinear stiffness characteristics of the building model.

40|$|To {{understand}} the dynamic mechanisms {{of the mechanical}} milling process in a vibratory mill, {{it is necessary to}} determine the characteristics of the impact forces associated with the collision events. However, it is difficult to directly measure the impact force in an operating mill. This paper describes an inverse technique for the prediction of impact forces from acceleration measurements on a vibratory ball mill. The characteristics of the vibratory mill have been investigated by the modal testing technique, and its system modes have been identified. In the modelling of the system vibration response to the impact forces, two modal equations have been used to describe the <b>modal</b> <b>responses.</b> The superposition of the <b>modal</b> <b>responses</b> gives rise to the total response of the system. A method based on an optimisation approach has been developed to predict the impact forces by minimising the difference between the measured acceleration of the vibratory ball mill and the predicted acceleration from the solution of the modal equations.

A three-dimensional nonlinear model is developed incorporating frame elements, eccentric infill struts, and shear-prone short columns.

40|$|Jetty {{structures}} are relatively long structures. Codes applied to seismic engineering, e. g. eurocode 8, {{do not make}} a differentiation to relatively long structures. So, what {{is the effect of}} uneven excitation on relatively long structures? Is there an effect at all? Do the structural stresses increase/ decrease? The earthquake load, according to the eurocode 8, is modelled by a modal analysis spectrum. Consequently, this <b>modal</b> <b>response</b> spectrum is applied on a modal analysis. The only information a <b>modal</b> <b>response</b> spectrum contains, is the information about the maximum response of a single degree of freedom model during a design earthquake event. The <b>modal</b> <b>response</b> spectrum does not contain information about the time delay in excitation.

A model has been set up according the Euler- Bernoulli beam model. The calculation is done for the Alkion earthquake for variable angles of incidence. For particular angles of incidence does the maximum bending moment peak. The cause of this response amplification is discovered in the transfer functions.

40|$|High {{response}} pressure {{data from a}} high-speed 1. 5 -stage turbine Hot Gas Ingestion Rig shows the existence of cavity modes in the rim-seal-wheelspace cavity for representative turbine engine operating conditions with purge flow. The experimental results and observations are complemented by computational assessments of cavity modes associated with flow in canonical cavity configurations. The cavity modes identified include Shallow Cavity modes and Helmholtz resonance. The response of the cavity modes to variation in design and operating parameters are assessed. These parameters include cavity aspect ratio, purge flow ratio, and flow angle defined by the ratio of primary tangential to axial velocity. Scaling the cavity <b>modal</b> <b>response</b> based on computational results and available experimental data {{in terms of the}} appropriate reduced frequencies appears to indicate the potential presence of a Deep Cavity mode as well. Computational assessment of canonical cavity flow suggests that increasing purge flow ratio mitigates Shallow Cavity <b>modal</b> <b>response,</b> in accord with data for the first Shallow Cavity mode but in contrast to data for the second Shallow Cavity mode. Likewise, increasing primary flow angle reduces the Shallow Cavity <b>modal</b> <b>response</b> that vanishes for flow angle beyond 450 *. This computational observation is in contrast to the rig data that show the <b>modal</b> <b>response</b> is nevertheless present with a flow angle greater than 45 *. An implication from the computational parametric assessments is that increasing purge flow and primary flow angle could provide a stabilizing effect on the response. Experimental requirements to quantify the effects of cavity modes on hot gas ingestion are identified along with inadequacies in the current rig set-up with the associated instrumentation system. As such, the role of cavity modes on hot gas ingestion cannot be clarified based on the current set of data. by Rachel A. Berg. Thesis: S.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the sources of error in seismic modal {{analysis}} of primary-secondary coupled systems using the 'combination of modal properties' approach. Four sources of error are studied: non-classical damping, evaluation of modal properties of the combined system, combination of <b>modal</b> <b>responses</b> and response contribution from the high frequency modes. Harmonic response of a non-classically damped system provides a valuable insight into its response to a general load. For a non-harmonic load, the error involved in diagonalization depends on its frequency content. The dependence of the error on the applied load increases with the severity of non-classical nature. Use of approximate mode shapes obtained by perturbation {{is an attempt to}} transform the equations of motion using a transformation matrix that is different from the exact-mode-shape matrix. The error involved in an attempted modal superposition analysis for such a case mainly stems from the neglect of off-diagonal terms in the transformed mass, stiffness and damping matrices.
