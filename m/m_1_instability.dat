The background stars are stationary equilibrium configurations with purely toroidal magnetic fields. We find that an <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> <b>instability</b> of toroidal magnetic fields, already known from local analyses, {{may also be}} found in our relatively low-resolution global study. We present quantitative results for the instability growth rate and its suppression by rotation. The instability is discussed as a possible trigger mechanism for soft gamma repeater flares.

We provide some analytic and numerical evidence for this periodic orbit to be linearly stable. We then use a continuation method to numerically find symmetric periodic simultaneous binary collision orbits in a regularized planar pairwise symmetric <b>1,</b> <b>m,</b> <b>1,</b> <b>m</b> four-body problem for m between 0 and 1. We numerically investigate the linear stability of these peri-odic orbits through long-term integration of the regularized equations, showing that linear stability occurs when 0. 538 ≤ <b>m</b> ≤ <b>1,</b> and <b>instability</b> occurs when 0 < m ≤ 0. 537 with spectral stability for m ≈ 0. 537. 1...|$|R
40|$|Lopsidedness {{is common}} in spiral galaxies. Often, there is no obvious {{external}} cause, such as an interaction with a nearby galaxy, for such features. Alternatively, the lopsidedness may have an internal cause, such as a dynamical instability. In order to explore this idea, we have developed a computer code that searches for self-consistent perturbations in razor-thin disc galaxies and performed a thorough mode-analysis of a suite of dynamical models for disc galaxies embedded in an inert dark matter halo with varying amounts of rotation and radial anisotropy. Models with two equal-mass counter-rotating discs and fully rotating models both show growing lopsided modes. For the counter-rotating models, this is the well-known counter-rotating instability, becoming weaker as the net rotation increases. The <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> mode of the maximally rotating models, on the other hand, becomes stronger with increasing net rotation. This rotating <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> mode {{is reminiscent of the}} eccentricity instability in near-Keplerian discs. To unravel the physical origin of these two different <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> <b>instabilities,</b> we studied the individual stellar orbits in the perturbed potential and found that the presence of the perturbation gives rise to a very rich orbital behaviour. In the linear regime, both instabilities are supported by aligned loop orbits. In the non-linear regime, other orbit families exist that can help support the modes. In terms of density waves, the counter-rotating <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> mode is due to a purely growing Jeans-type instability. The rotating <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> mode, on the other hand, grows {{as a result of the}} swing amplifier working inside the resonance cavity that extends from the disc centre out to the radius where non-rotating waves are stabilized by the model's outwardly rising Q profile...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{simplest}} model that permits a largely analytical {{exploration of the}} <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> counter-rotating <b>instability</b> in a `hot' nearly Keplerian disc of collisionless self-gravitating matter. The model consists of a two-component softened gravity disc, whose linear modes are analysed using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. The modes are slow {{in the sense that}} their (complex) frequency is smaller than the Keplerian orbital frequency by a factor which is of order the ratio of the disc mass to the mass of the central object. Very simple analytical expressions are derived for the precession frequencies and growth rates of local modes; it is shown that a nearly Keplerian discm must be unrealistically hot to avoid an overstability. Global modes are constructed for the case of zero net rotation...|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} two small planets {{orbiting}} {{the sun on}} low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbits is stable with respect to close encounters if the initial semi-major axis dierence,, measured in mutual Hill radii, RH, exceeds 2 p 3, due to conservation of energy and angular momentum (Gladman 1993). We investigate the stability of systems {{of more than two}} planets using numerical integrations. We nd that systems with 10 are also unstable. The slope b depends weakly on the number of planets, but is independent of planetary mass, m, if we measure in units that are proportional to <b>m</b> <b>1</b> = 4 rather than the usual RH / <b>m</b> <b>1</b> = 3. <b>Instability</b> in multi-planet systems arises because energy and angular momentum are no longer conserved within each two-planet subsystem due to perturbations by the additional planet(s). These results suggest that planetary-embryos will not become isolated prior to the nal stage of terrestrial-planet formation simply due to a failure to achieve close encounters. Other factors leading to isolation cannot be ruled out at this stage. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that pure {{exponential}} discs in spiral galaxies {{are capable of}} supporting slowly varying discrete global lopsided modes, which can explain the observed features of lopsidedness in the stellar discs. Using linearized fluid dynamical equations with the softened self-gravity and pressure of the perturbation as the collective effect, we derive self-consistently a quadratic eigenvalue equation for the lopsided perturbation in the galactic disc. On solving this, {{we find that the}} ground-state mode shows the observed characteristics of the lopsidedness in a galactic disc, namely the fractional Fourier amplitude A(1), increases smoothly with the radius. These lopsided patterns precess in the disc with a very slow pattern speed with no preferred sense of precession. We show that the lopsided modes in the stellar disc are long-lived because of a substantial reduction (approximately a factor of 10 compared to the local free precession rate) in the differential precession. The numerical solution of the equations shows that the groundstate lopsided modes are either very slowly precessing stationary normal mode oscillations of the disc or growing modes with a slow growth rate depending on the relative importance of the collective effect of the self-gravity. N-body simulations are performed to test the spontaneous growth of lopsidedness in a pure stellar disc. Both approaches are then compared and interpreted in terms of long-lived global <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> <b>instabilities,</b> with almost zero pattern speed...|$|R

An annular jet {{is an example of}} these particular flows (used in burners, cooling processes, inlet valve in a combustion chamber, processing glass fibers [...] .) : an obstacle for the flow, placed {{in the center of a}} round nozzle creates two axisymmetric shear layers at the jet exit. These shear layers are significant for the organization and the evolution of the flow. This study talks about coherent structures developed in shear layers and their effects on three-dimensional instabilities of the annular jet flow. A method to detect and identify coherent structures, called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (P. O. D.) is applied on velocity fields recorded by Particle Image Velocimetry (P. I. V.) measurement to understand how a modification of the nozzle geometry could change the flow morphology. The P. O.

We study the linear stability of these equilibria, assuming a rigid impenetrable {{wall at the}} outer cylindrical radius R j. We find that equilibria in which the Lorentz factor γ(R) increases monotonically with increasing radius R are stable. On the other hand, equilibria in which γ(R) reaches a maximum value at an intermediate radius and then declines to a smaller value γ j at R j are unstable. The most rapidly growing mode is an <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> kink <b>instability</b> which has a growth rate ∼ (0. 4 /γ j) (c/R j). The e-folding length of the equivalent convected instability is ∼ 2. 5 γ jR j.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{interaction of}} a set of tearing instabilities and plasma flow is studied in a cylindrical plasma. An analytic theory of mode locking is developed which includes the effects of the localized electromagnetic torques, plasma inertia and cross-field viscosity. The calculation is specialized for the case of mode locking on the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed field pinch. In MST plasmas, a set of <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> tearing <b>instabilities</b> become phase locked and form a toroidally localized, rotating magnetic disturbance. An evolution equation for the phase velocity of this magnetic disturbance is derived which accounts for two types of electromagnetic torques. The external torques describe the interaction of the tearing modes with static magnetic perturbations located outside the plasma region. The interior torques describe the nonlinear interaction of three tearing modes which satisfy a wave number resonance condition. For conditions typical of MST, the internal torques dominate the external torques, which suggest the nonlinear interaction of tearing instabilities play a prominent role in the momentum degradation and mode locking...|$|R

Under the influence of the <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> azimuthal component of the tidal potential, viscous oscillations in the outer disk excite an <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> eccentric <b>instability</b> in the disk. While the m = 2 azimuthal component of the tidal potential excites a Papaloizou-Pringle instability in the inner disk (a saturated m = 2 azimuthal mode), with an elliptic pattern rotating at about a fraction (approx. = 1 / 3) of the local Keplerian velocity in the inner disk. The period of the elliptic mode corresponds well to the periods of the short-period oscillations observed in cataclysmic variables. In cold disks (r(Omega) /c(sub s) = M approx. = 40) we also find a critical value of the viscosity parameter (alpha approx. = 0. 01), below which shock dissipation dominates and is balanced by the wave amplification due to the wave action conservation.

40|$|Aims. To {{establish}} the dominant wave modes generated by an internal, <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> kink <b>instability</b> {{in a short}} coronal flux tube. Methods. The 3 D MHD numerical simulations are performed using Lare 3 d to model the kink instability and the subsequent wave generation. The initial conditions are a straight, zero net current flux tube containing a twist higher than the kink instability threshold. Results. It is shown that the kink instability initially sets up a 1 st harmonic (1 st overtone) that is converted through the rearrangement of the magnetic field into two out-of-phase fundamental slow modes. These slow modes are in the two entwined flux tubes created during the kink instability. Conclusions. The long-lived oscillations established after a kink instability provide a possible way to identify whether sudden, short coronal loop brightenings may have resulted from a confined kink instability. The mode oscillation structure changes from the 1 st harmonic to fundamental due to field line relaxation. The subsequent decay in the fundamental mode is comparable to observations and is caused by shock dissipation. This result has important consequences for the damping of the slow mode oscillations observed by SUMER...|$|R
40|$|The current renewed {{interest}} in the dense linear z-pinch is {{due in large part}} to a recent Los Alamos Study which concluded that a z- pinch based reactor could produce 4. 4 KJ of fusion energy per pulse for the modest input of 140 kJ per pulse, if a straight pinch could be maintained for 2 {mu}sec. Early attempts to achieve suitable high density z-pinches were of the implosion type which produced hollow pressure profiles that quickly resulted in disruptive m = 0 instabilities. These instabilities are not found in the gas embedded pinch in which an initially small diameter plasma is kept in radial equilibrium by following a prescribed current waveform. Unfortunately, these pinches are prone to a rapid accretion of the surrounding gas during the early stages of formation. Our approach is to form the pinch inside small diameter quartz capillaries filled with neutral hydrogen. This fixes the line density. By driving currents through the pinch at a rate that exceeds that necessary for radial equilibrium, we expect the pinch to contract away from the walls and be subject to compressional, as well as ohmic heating. This contraction will, of course, produce a plasma between the pinch and the capillary wall, but we anticipate this ``corona`` will be kept at a low temperature (i. e., high resistance) by radiation and hence shunt only a small fraction of the pinch current. We also expect negligible impurities in the pinch as the classical mixing time will be much longer than the pinch duration at the densities (10 {sup 21 }- 10 {sup 22 } ions/cm{sup 3 }) and magnetic fields (1 - 10 MG) involved. However, we do expect the presence of the dense corona to reduce the growth rate of the <b>m</b> = <b>1</b> <b>instability.</b> Our results demonstrate that a z-pinch can be formed inside a capillary, but our limited current rise rates and peak current have limited our test abilities.

Double labelling using antibodies against neurochemical markers was used to identify neuron subytpes bearing <b>M</b> <b>1</b> r. <b>M</b> <b>1</b> r immunoreactivity (IR) was present on neurons in the myenteric and submucosal ganglia. The two antibodies gave similar <b>M</b> <b>1</b> r-IR patterns and <b>M</b> <b>1</b> r-IR was abolished upon antibody preabsorption. <b>M</b> <b>1</b> r-IR was present on cholinergic and nNOS-IR nerve cell bodies in both guinea pig and human myenteric neurons.

40|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (<b>M</b> <b>1)</b> {{has been shown}} to induce changes in motor performance and learning. Recent studies indicate that tDCS is capable of modulating widespread neural network properties within the brain. However the temporal evolution of online- and after-effects of tDCS on functional connectivity (FC) within and across the stimulated motor cortices (<b>M</b> <b>1)</b> still remain elusive. In the present study, two different tDCS setups were investigated: (i) unilateral <b>M</b> <b>1</b> tDCS (anode over right <b>M</b> <b>1,</b> cathode over the contralateral supraorbital region) and (ii) bilateral <b>M</b> <b>1</b> tDCS (anode over right <b>M</b> <b>1,</b> cathode over left <b>M</b> <b>1).</b> In a randomized single-blinded cross-over design, 12 healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest before, during and after 20 min of either bi-, unilateral, or sham <b>M</b> <b>1</b> tDCS. Seed-based FC analysis was used to investigate tDCS-induced changes across and within <b>M</b> <b>1.</b> We found that bilateral <b>M</b> <b>1</b> tDCS induced (a) a decrease in interhemispheric FC during stimulation and (b) an increase in intracortical FC within right <b>M</b> <b>1</b> after termination of the intervention.

The transition from local to systemic infection occurs by an unknown mechanism; however invasive <b>M</b> <b>1</b> T 1 clinical isolates are known to express significantly less cysteine protease SpeB than <b>M</b> <b>1</b> T 1 isolates from local infections. Here, we show that {{in comparison to the}} <b>M</b> <b>1</b> T 1 strain 5448, the isogenic mutant ∆speB accumulated 75 -fold more human plasmin activity on the bacterial surface following incubation in human plasma. Human plasminogen was an absolute requirement for <b>M</b> <b>1</b> T 1 strain 5448 virulence following subcutaneous infection of humanized plasminogen transgenic mice.

The GAS <b>M</b> <b>1</b> protein is a major virulence factor promoting GAS invasiveness and resistance to host innate immune clearance. <b>M</b> <b>1</b> displays an irregular coiled-coil structure, including the B-repeats that bind fibrinogen. Previously, we found that B-repeat stabilisation generates an idealised version of <b>M</b> <b>1</b> (<b>M</b> <b>1)</b> characterised by decreased fibrinogen binding in vitro. To extend these findings based on a soluble truncated version of <b>M</b> <b>1,</b> we now studied the importance of the B-repeat coiled-coil irregularities in full length <b>M</b> <b>1</b> and <b>M</b> <b>1</b> expressed in live GAS and tested whether the modulation of <b>M</b> <b>1</b> -fibrinogen interactions would open up novel therapeutic approaches. We found that altering either the <b>M</b> <b>1</b> structure on the GAS cell surface or removing its target host protein fibrinogen blunted GAS virulence.
