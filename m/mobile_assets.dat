2500|$|In modern times, {{the notion}} of {{constructing}} large-scale static defenses to combat land-based threats has largely become obsolete. The use of precision air campaigns and large-scale mechanization have made lighter, more mobile defenses desirable to military planners. The obsolescence of large fortifications was displayed {{by the failure of}} the Maginot Line in the beginning of World War Two. [...] Nations defending against modern invasions normally use large population centers such as cities or towns as defensive points. The invader must capture these points to destroy the defender's ability to wage war. The defender uses mobile armored and infantry divisions to protect these points, but the defenders are still very mobile and can normally retreat. A prominent example of the use of cities as fortifications {{can be seen in the}} Iraqi Army's stands in the 2003 invasion of Iraq at Baghdad, Tikrit, and Basra in the major combat in the Iraq War. A defender can also use these <b>mobile</b> <b>assets</b> to precipitate a counteroffensive like the Soviet Red Army at the Battle of Kursk or the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.|$|E

40|$|A <b>mobile</b> <b>asset</b> with {{a sensor}} node in a <b>mobile</b> <b>asset</b> {{tracking}} system moves around a monitoring area, leaves it, and then {{returns to the}} region repeatedly. The system monitors the in/out status of the <b>mobile</b> <b>asset.</b> Due to the continuous movement of the <b>mobile</b> <b>asset,</b> the system may generate an error for the in/out status of the <b>mobile</b> <b>asset.</b> When the <b>mobile</b> <b>asset</b> is inside the region, the system might determine that it is outside, or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a method to detect and correct the incorrect in/out status of the <b>mobile</b> <b>asset.</b> To solve this problem, our approach uses data about the connection state transition and the battery lifetime of the mobile node attached to the <b>mobile</b> <b>asset.</b> The connection state transition is used to classify the mobile node as normal or abnormal. The battery lifetime is used to predict a valid working period for the mobile node. We evaluate our method using real data generated by a medical asset tracking system. The experimental results show that our method, by using the estimated battery life time or by using the invalid connection state, can detect and correct most cases of incorrect in/out statuses generated by the conventional approach...|$|R

50|$|For many {{industrial}} applications, such {{as commercial}} trucking, GIS, agriculture, <b>mobile</b> <b>asset</b> management, and other industries, custom electronic hardware is still preferred.

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} data capture technologies {{are becoming increasingly}} important {{in the management of}} supply chain, manufacturing flow management, <b>mobile</b> <b>asset</b> tracking, inventory management, warehousing, and any application where physical items move through location in time.

40|$|Abstract—While {{more and}} more {{companies}} plan to implement asset management solutions to control supply chain costs and public sectors strive for effective and timely management of public facilities, there are significant moves coming to improve both asset management processes and the information technology (IT) that support them. In the arena of IT, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{is one of the}} most promising technologies to improve the effectiveness of asset management. In this research we propose an RFID and ERP enabled <b>Mobile</b> <b>Asset</b> Management Information System (MAMIS) that will produce real value in the form of reduced costs, staff productivity, and effective management today. The proposed system was designed for tagging valuable assets or equipment, providing asset location information, auditing and triggering for service, and retrieving maintenance requirements and procedure based on data in ERP...|$|R
