A broad {{objective of the}} “rice drying process”, which comprises drying and tempering, is to maximize the yield of “whole, intact milled kernels”, quantified by the “head rice yield” (HRY). Since rough rice is commonly dried using cross-flow (CF) dryers in the United States of America, {{the aim of this}} research was to assess the effect of drying and tempering treatments on <b>milling</b> <b>yields</b> when rice was dried in an experimentally-simulated CF drying column. First, because airflow rate was found to be the least-studied “drying variable”, its effect on drying air conditions and rice moisture content profiles was assessed.

For the same rice and drying conditions, tempering approach significantly affected HRYs, especially HRYs of samples that were located near the heated-air plenum during CF drying. Third, drying treatments were selected based on the glass transition temperature of rice kernels and applied in the drying column. When kernels did not undergo material state transitions during drying, there was negligible HRYR, regardless if samples had been tempered or not.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Milling</b> <b>yield</b> {{and eating}} quality are two {{important}} grain quality traits in rice. To identify the genes {{involved in these}} two traits, we performed a deep transcriptional analysis of developing seeds using both massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS). Five MPSS and five SBS libraries were constructed from 6 -day-old developing seeds of Cypress (high <b>milling</b> <b>yield),</b> LaGrue (low <b>milling</b> <b>yield),</b> Ilpumbyeo (high eating quality), YR 15965 (low eating quality), and Nipponbare (control). Results The transcriptomes revealed by MPSS and SBS had a high correlation co-efficient (0. 81 to 0. 90), and about 70 % of the transcripts were commonly identified in both types of the libraries. SBS, however, identified 30 % more transcripts than MPSS. Among the highly expressed genes in Cypress and Ilpumbyeo, over 100 conserved cis regulatory elements were identified. Numerous specifically expressed transcription factor (TF) genes were identified in Cypress (282), LaGrue (312), Ilpumbyeo (363), YR 15965 (260), and Nipponbare (357). Many key grain quality-related genes (i. e., genes involved in starch metabolism, aspartate amino acid metabolism, storage and allergenic protein synthesis, and seed maturation) that were expressed at high levels underwent alternative splicing and produced antisense transcripts either in Cypress or Ilpumbyeo. Further, a time course RT-PCR analysis confirmed a higher expression level of genes involved in starch metabolism such as those encoding ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and granule bound starch synthase I (GBSS I) in Cypress than that in LaGrue during early seed development. Conclusion This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the developing seed transcriptome of rice available to date. Using two high throughput sequencing methods, we identified many differentially expressed genes that may affect <b>milling</b> <b>yield</b> or eating quality in rice. Many of the identified genes {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of starch, aspartate family amino acids, and storage proteins. Some of the differentially expressed genes could be useful for the development of molecular markers if they are located in a known QTL region for <b>milling</b> <b>yield</b> or eating quality in the rice genome. Therefore, our comprehensive and deep survey of the developing seed transcriptome in five rice cultivars has provided a rich genomic resource for further elucidating the molecular basis of grain quality in rice. </p...|$|E

Despite these efforts, losses are generally considered to remain high although, as noted, there are significant measurement difficulties. One problem is that while engineers have been successful in developing innovations in drying and storage these innovations are often not adopted by small farmers. This may be because farmers are not convinced of the benefits of using the technology. The costs may outweigh the perceived benefits and even if the benefits are significant the investment required from farmers may present them with a risk they are not prepared to take.
