40|$|DDoS {{attack is}} a form of DoS attack in which {{attacker}} uses authorized user IP address to attack on a particular victim. Of the two types of attack it falls in the active category. The main aim of the attacker is to jam the resources in order to deny services to the recipient. The attacker can use several strategies to achieve this goal, one of which is by flooding the network with bogus requests. The attack is distributed because the attacker is using multiple computers to launch the denial of service attack. In this paper we have first identified the types of DoS and DDoS attack. Then we have provided the solution for those attacks on the basis of attacker’s identification. Main focus {{of this paper is to}} identify the actual attacker, who has performed attack by sitting behind a forged System. For that purpose first we prevent IP forgery by using sender authentication process, then calculate TCP flow rate and from it we identify whether packets are nor- mal packet or malicious packet. We detect attack on receiver proxy server by using entropy and normalize entropy calculation on receiver proxy server. If attack is detected then we drop packets, get their <b>mark</b> <b>value</b> and trace them back to the source. Finally we use the concept of ISP and IANA to identify the actual attacker. NS 2 has been used to simulate the proposed methods.

40|$|Abstract: Although it {{has been}} fashionable lately to read Old English poetry as being {{critical}} {{of the values of}} heroic culture, the heroic idiom is the main, and perhaps the only, marker of quality in Old English poetry. Considering in turn the ‘sacred heroic ’ in Genesis A and Andreas, the ‘mock heroic ’ in Judith and Riddle 51, and the fiercely debated status of Byrhtnoth and Beowulf in The Battle of Maldon and Beowulf, this discussion suggests that modern scholarship has confused the measure with the measured. Although an uncritical heroic idiom may not be to modern critical tastes, it is suggested here that the variety of ways in which the heroic idiom is used to evaluate and <b>mark</b> <b>value</b> demonstrates the flexibility and depth of insight achieved by Old English poets through their apparently limited subject matter. A hero can only be defined by a narrative in which he or she meets or exceeds measures set by society—in which he or she demonstrates his or her quality. In that sense, all heroic narratives are narratives about quality. In Old English poetry, the heroic idiom stands as the marker of quality {{for a wide range of}} things: people, artefacts, actions, and events that are good, respected, desirable, and valued are marked by being presented with the characteristic language and ethic of an idealised, archaic warrior-culture. 1 This is not, of course, a new point; it is traditional in Old English scholarship to associate quality with the elite, military world of generous war-lords, loyal thegns, gorgeous equipment, great acts of courage, and 1 The characteristic subject matter and style of Old English poetry is referred to in varying ways by critics. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of buildings is attracting significant {{attention from the}} research community as the world is moving towards sustainable buildings design. Energy efficient approaches are measures or {{ways to improve the}} energy performance and energy {{efficiency of}} buildings. This study surveyed various energy-efficient approaches for commercial building and identifies Envelope Thermal Transfer Value (ETTV) and Green applications (Living wall, Green facade and Green roof) as most important and effective methods. An in-depth investigation was carried out on these energy-efficient approaches. It has been found that no ETTV model has been developed for sub-tropical climate of Australia. Moreover, existing ETTV equations developed for other countries do not take roof heat gain into consideration. Furthermore, the relationship of ETTV and different Green applications have not been investigated extensively in any literature, and the energy performance of commercial buildings in the presence of Living wall, Green facade and Green roof has not been investigated in the sub-tropical climate of Australia. The study has been conducted in two phases. First, the study develops the new formulation, coefficient and bench <b>mark</b> <b>value</b> of ETTV in the presence of external shading devices. In the new formulation, roof heat gain has been included in the integrated heat gain model made of ETTV.

Finally, the study demonstrates the amount of energy that can be saved annually from different combinations of Green applications, i. e., Living wall, Green facade; combination of Living wall and Green facade; combination of Living wall and Green roof. The estimations are supported by experimental values obtained from extensive experiments of Living walls and Green roofs...|$|E

40|$|When {{linguists}} {{talks about}} features, they usually talk about markedness as well.

Φ-features are a particularly interesting case since they are important in many different domains of linguistic inquiry, and therefore markedness considerations arise in several different ways.

Later works (Noyer 1992, Harley & Ritter 2002), focus more narrowly on morphological markedness. My focus, however, is semantic markedness.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} correlation between grammatical markedness and the phonological properties of outputs inflected for morpho-syntactic categories on a grammatical markedness hierarchy. The main claim made in the thesis is that, under otherwise similar phonological conditions, outputs carrying specifications for a marked member (g) of a given grammatical category (G) can license a given type of marked phonological structure (M) to an extent that is equal or greater than outputs inflected for the unmarked category.; I label this generalization 'Marked in the Marked' (MIM). Within the theoretical framework assumed for the dissertation (Optimality Theory, Prince and Smolensky 1993 / 2004), I propose that the universal repository of constraints (CON) be enriched so as to include a family of formal licensing constraints LICENSE(M,g) that license marked phonological structure (M) in output words that carry the morpho-syntactic specifications of the marked member (g) of G. I propose that the licensing constraint is functionally grounded {{in the sense that}} the <b>marked</b> <b>value</b> g is determined by recourse to language use factors such as frequency of occurrence in discourse. Only licensing constraints for <b>marked</b> <b>values</b> g are allowed in CON.; The content of the notions 'grammatical markedness' and 'phonological markedness' is reviewed and criteria for the two kinds of markedness are discussed. Manifestations of phonological markedness and their grammatical category underpinnings are discussed at the following levels: prosodic (Old Saxon), segmental (Romanian) and phonotactic (Mayak). For all these cases, the Marked in the Marked constraint schema (in interaction with other relevant constraints) and the factorial typology associated with it are shown to make the correct empirical predictions.; A functional grounding account of the MIM effects discussed in the dissertation is laid out. MIM phenomena are assumed to arise from factors of economy in language production in the sense that confining marked phonological structure to less frequent, grammatically marked forms contributes to minimization of speaker's effort. Also, the presence of marked phonological material in outputs inflected for the marked grammatical category may have certain advantages in language perception, retrieval and acquisition...|$|R
