Going beyond binary relations, embracing n -ary relations in network science can generalise many structures. This starts with hypergraphs and their Galois structures.

5000|$|Multi-screen casing completion: the MLS is {{installed}} {{inside of a}} multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each well screen segment has a sand or gravel pack {{between it and the}} borehole wall, and is thus isolated from monitoring zones above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi-screened well. This adds another step to the well installation process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing <b>multilevel</b> monitoring <b>systems.</b> Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the <b>multilevel</b> <b>systems</b> can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various monitoring zones can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the <b>multilevel</b> monitoring <b>systems</b> are installed in the wells. Finally, installing <b>multilevel</b> <b>systems</b> inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the <b>multilevel</b> <b>systems</b> can be constructed {{so that they can be}} easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure-grouted or drilled out using standard well decommissioning procedures.|$|R

Rather, for obtaining sufficient number of design points, approximate but faster evaluation methods are acceptable. Thus, the <b>multilevel</b> <b>system</b> modeling enables quick analysis of many design points using high level models. The final configuration is obtained by performing a more accurate low level simulations on the most promising candidates obtained from the high level approximation methods.|$|E

The probability that a point belongs to the percolating or [...] "infinite" [...] cluster is written as P∞ in percolation theory, and it is related to R2(p) by R2(p)/L2 = p &minus; P∞ where L is the size of the square.

40|$|A formal {{theory of}} <b>multilevel</b> <b>systems</b> {{is needed for}} {{modelling}} the outcomes of policy. The dynamics of social systems are coupled between levels and models that do not reflect this are incomplete and a poor basis for policymaking. The structures developed here are necessary for the new kinds of models and computer simulations needed to support policy makers as they tackle the problems of an increasingly connected multilevel world. Almost all social systems have many levels of organisation, from micro to macro levels, and multilevel structure is fundamental to their dynamics. Part-whole structures {{play a major role}} in <b>multilevel</b> <b>systems,</b> where intermediate wholes may themselves be parts in higher level structures. Taxonomic aggregation plays another major role in <b>multilevel</b> <b>systems,</b> but is very different to part-whole aggregation. Generally part-whole and taxonomic aggregation are interleaved. Both space and time have natural multilevel structure relevant to social organisation. Multilevel structure can be relational or numerical. Generally relations determine organisational structure, with patterns of numbers defined on it. These numbers aggregate and disaggregate with the multilevel part-whole and taxonomic structures. In this chapter the ideas are developed descriptively in the first instance in order to be accessible to everyone. The second part uses a more formal approach that enables the fundamental concepts to be developed with greater precision...|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} an {{intensification}} {{of research on the}} consequences as well as the character of multi-level governance. The concept was developed as a tool of pure research, but it now motivates policy makers. From the late 1990s the European Commission began to refer to its own mission as one of achieving multilevel governance, especially in cohesion policy. In 2001, the Commission set up a committee on multilevel governance to contribute to its White Paper on governance. José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, claims that ‘the <b>multilevel</b> <b>system</b> of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge’ and that, in the current economic crisis, 'multilevel governance must be a priority'. In an October 2008 resolution, the European Parliament called on the member states ‘to develop as quickly as possible the practical measures set out in the First Action Programme [...] [...] [...] with a view to strengthening multilevel governance’. In 2009, 344 representatives of elected regional and local authorities across the EU approved a resolution on a 'European Union Charter for Multilevel Governance', which would bring localities and regions into European democratic decision making.|$|E

40|$|Indonesian Palm Oil Industry has {{the largest}} market share in the world, but still faces {{problems}} in order to strengthen the level of competitiveness. Those problems are in the industry chains, government regulation and policy as meso environment, and macro economic condition.
