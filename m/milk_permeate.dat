Then, the operator removes the whey that makes up for 80% of the initial volume of milk. The milk serum or <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> is later given to the cows, spread in the fields. It can also be collected by some dairy industries that extract cream from it, turn it into powder to feed the calves, or use it in the elaboration of other food products, such as chocolate and pre-packaged-meals. Once drained, the bits of renneted milk are pressed {{for the first time}} into their mould thanks to a machine. The compressed cheese is called “tome”. The “tome” is then wrapped into linen, a little casein slab (oval or square) is put on top of it, and the cheese is salted (with some brine). Next, it is put into a press, for 12 to 24 hours. The next step is called “ressuyage” (lit. “re-wiping”), when the cheese is unwrapped, and stored in a cold room, at 10 C, with between 40% to 60% of hygrometry. Farmers and dairy producers can let the “tome” to mature, or sell then to people specialized in cheese maturing.|$|E

Aims: The current study evaluated the biological and sensory properties of a novel dairy-based drink for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Methods and Materials: The novel dairy-based drink was prepared by emulsifying corn germ oil with casein glycomacropeptide (GMP) solution in <b>milk</b> <b>permeates.</b> The chemical composition and sensory properties of the dairy-based drink were determined. In addition, the dairy-based drink was nutritionally evaluated using patient volunteers. These patients followed a strict diet limiting phenylalanine in their food.

Three media were used for starch pasting: NaCl aqueous solution, <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> and skim milk. Starch granules significantly swelled more when pasted in the pilot plant or during a longer time of thermo-mechanical treatment at laboratory scale. Moreover, whereas at laboratory scale the presence of lactose or milk proteins did not modify the swelling behavior of starch, a larger increase was obtained in presence of lactose (<b>milk</b> <b>permeate)</b> and milk proteins (skim milk) at pilot scale. At least, different dependence on starch granules diameter ratio versus relative viscosities were obtained at laboratory and pilot scales. Two complementary hypotheses on milk proteins/starch interactions were proposed to explain these results.

40|$|Synthetic {{microporous}} membranes with functional groups covalently attached {{were used}} to selectively separate beta-lactoglobulin, BSA, and alpha-lactalbumin from rennet whey. The selectivity and membrane performance of strong (quaternary ammonium) and weak (diethylamine) ion-exchange membranes were studied using breakthrough curves, measurement of binding capacity, and protein composition of the elution fraction to determine the binding behavior of each membrane. When the weak and strong anion exchange membranes were saturated with whey, they were both selective primarily for beta-lactoglobulin with less than 1 % of the eluate consisting of alpha-lactalbumin or BSA. The binding capacity of a pure alpha-lactoglobulin solution was in excess of 1. 5 mg/cm(2) of membrane. This binding capacity was reduced to approximately 1. 2 mg/cm(2) when using a rennet whey solution (pH 6. 4). This reduction in protein binding capacity {{can be explained by}} both the competitive effects of other whey proteins and the effect of ions present in whey. Using binary solution breakthrough curves and rennet whey breakthrough curves, it was shown that alpha-lactalbumin and BSA were displaced from the strong and weak anion exchange membranes by beta-lactoglobulin. Finally, the effect of ionic strength on the binding capacity of individual proteins for each membrane was determined by comparing model protein solutions in <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> (pH 6. 4) and a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6. 4). Binding capacities of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, and BSA in <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> were reduced by as much as 50 %.

The objectives of this study were to determine the mass balance of taurine during the conversion of milk to cheese and during the processing of whey through lactose crystallization and to determine the antioxidant activity of whey fractions in ribosome and hemoglobin model systems. Raw milk was pasteurized and inoculated with a commercial lactic acid bacteria culture and sampled hourly until it coagulated. The concentration of taurine did not change during fermentation which showed that the bacteria did not use taurine as a nutritive source. Whey from Cheddar cheese was pasteurized at 63 C? for 30 min, cooled to 5 C?, and centrifuged to remove fat and other particles. The clarified whey was subjected to ultrafiltration and the permeate concentrated by evaporation to about 40 % total solids. Lactose was crystallized and separated from the remaining liquid. An HPLC method was employed to determine the concentration of taurine in <b>milk,</b> whey, <b>permeate</b> and mother liquor. The concentration of taurine in the <b>milk,</b> Whey, <b>permeate,</b> and mother liquor was 32, 26, 33, and 394 nmol/ml (41. 2 % total solids), respectively. The pH of permeate of whey from Cheddar cheese was adjusted to 9. 8 and subjected to anion exchange chromatography. Taurine was eluded from the column with 0. 5 N acetic acid at pH 2. 53. The percentage of taurine eluded from the column was determined by ??C radioactive labeling. The antioxidant activity of taurine and the whey fractions was tested in a ribosome system made from phosphatidylcholine using either FeCl? or lipoxidase as the catalyst and in a hemoglobin antioxidant model system. Antioxidant activity was observed for all whey fractions in the ribosome and hemoglobin antioxidant systems. Taurine did not exhibit antioxidant activity in the ribosome system but did have antioxidant activity in the hemoglobin system. These results indicate that taurine in whey fractions might have antioxidant activity but it is not responsible for the antioxidant activity observed using the ribosome model system. Antioxidant activity present in mother liquor indicates that the mother liquor might be useful as a food ingredient to prevent oxidation of food...|$|R

Protein contents in concentrates from milk microfiltrate and cheese wheys were respectively 95 and 74 % on a dry matter basis, while their fat contents were respectively 0. 2 and 15 %. Protein solubility of the milk microfiltrate isolate was over 95 % between pH 3 and 8, while protein solubility of cheese whey concentrate varied between 75 and 90 % {{over the same}} pH range.

Total calcium and phosphate in concentrated milk protein suspensions decreased with NaCl concentration, with a corresponding increase of the permeable calcium and phosphate, and of non-sedimentable caseins. In both untreated and concentrated milk protein samples, the viscosity increased with NaCl concentration. The characteristic decay time (τ) and turbidity measured under non-diluted conditions using diffusing wave spectroscopy showed a gradual decrease with NaCl addition.

The gelation of iota-carrageenan is closely related to the helix-coil transition they undergo at approximately 48 degreesC in milk. Carrageenan gels (e. g. iota with and without nu precursors) were formed in <b>milk</b> or <b>permeate</b> by decreasing the temperature from 60 to 10 degreesC following various mechanical treatments, e. g. gelation and ageing of the gel at rest, gelation under shearing and ageing at rest. Gels were characterized rheologically during cooling and ageing, performed in the dynamic mode, to follow the mechanical recovery of the mixed systems at rest. In many cases, a strain-hardening behavior was observed using strain sweep measurements: above the upper limit of the linear domain, stress increased more than proportionally to the strain. Two types of iota-carrageenan were compared: iota with and without nu precursors. The content of the precursor affects the ability to form helical structures. Samples without precursor gave the highest level of helical structures. The carrageenan concentration effect was tested in the range 0. 1 - 0. 5 wt%. Differences in sheared and unsheared gel properties, particularly in large strain conditions, are discussed in terms of gelation process, phase separation, carrageenan/milk proportion and carrageenan type.

40|$|Abstract – This study {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} {{the role of}} colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP) in acid gelation of milk. Milks were depleted in Calcium (Ca) by dialysis against <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> containing a cation-exchange resin. Dialysed milks were then heated (90 °C- 10 min) and acidgelled at 42 °C with a yoghurt culture. Minerals, total and soluble protein contents, pH and optical density were measured in unheated and heated dialysed milk, together with diameters and ζ-potentials of particles. Dialysis of milk led to a dissociation of 45 % total Ca and 30 % total phosphorus, {{to an increase in}} sodium content and pH of milk, to lower turbidity and ξ-potential, but did not change the casein particle size. Soluble Ca and casein-bound Ca were removed from milk, CCP being removed increasingly, while Ca removed from the phosphoserine residues increased very little during the dialysis experiments. Maximal dissociation of αs 1 - and αs 2 -casein was 20 %, while that of β- and κ-casein was 35 – 40 % of total at the end of dialysis, and it increased after heating, especially for κ-casein. The pH value at which the milk sample begins to gel increased for low mineral depletion rates but decreased for higher depletion levels. This was due to the increase in the pH value of milk and in the κ-casein dissociation. The elastic modulus decreased in samples at the lowest depletion and then levelled off, which suggested that the phosphoserine-bound Ca {{played a critical role in}} the formation of acid gels...|$|E

Methods and Results: Experiments for increased acetate productivity by thermophilic anaerobes grown on lactose were carried out in batch cultures. Lactose at concentration of 30 mmol l(- 1) (10 g l(- 1)) was completely degraded by Cl. thermolacticum and growth rate was maximal. High concentrations of by-products, ethanol, lactate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were generated. By using an efficient hydrogenotroph, Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus, in a defined thermophilic anaerobic consortium (58 degreesC) with Cl. thermolacticum and the acetogenic Moorella thermoautotrophica, the hydrogen partial pressure was dramatically lowered.

Further experiments revealed that the pH and Ca 2 + concentration of permeates showed high temperature dependence above the temperature at which they were separated, but a much lower temperature dependence below that temperature.

The suspensions were dried in a spray dryer with inlet and outlet temperatures of 180 and 80 °C, respectively. Increasing permeate concentration in the mixture showed a greater tendency to stickiness manifested by lowered the cyclone recovery of the powder as more powder stuck {{on the wall of}} the dryer. Increasing permeate concentration in the resultant powder did not significantly affect the bulk density but led to a reduction in the particle size and also made the powder slight green and yellowish in color. It also found to lower the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the skim milk powder (SMP) and induce crystallization of lactose at lower water activity (aw = 0. 328 for SMP:MPP of 3 : 7 and 0 : 1 compared to aw = 0. 0. 432 for SMP:MPP of 1 : 0 and 3 : 7). Addition of MP in SMP lowered the Tg values of the resulting powders.

Whey protein aggregates (WPIA) were generated from a whey protein isolate upon controlled heating conditions. Mixtures of Native Micellar Casein (NMC) and WPIA were suspended in a <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> at different weight ratios ranging from 0 % to 100 % NMC.

Acid-induced gelation of these systems was followed using small deformation rheology as function of pH followed by large deformation test at pH 4. 5.

The results from this study confirmed that systems with different numbers of each type of protein particles behaved differently during the acid gelation. Increasing the content in WPIA led to an increase in their pH of gelation and final elastic modulus (G’) and a decrease in tan. CSLM shows that increasing WPIA content produced a gel structure with smaller pores which led to a firmer gel as showed by the texture measurements. Furthermore, a more firm gel bound more whey which led to higher whey retention. The results are discussed in terms of interaction between the WPIA and the casein micelles, possibly creating dense clusters or knots in the finer WPIA network...|$|E

Acid gelation was studied by rheology, namely by small amplitude oscillation, followed by large deformation measurement at pH 4. 5. Viscoelastic moduli versus time or pH were compared for the different systems at different concentrations, while the microstructure of the gels at their final pH value was studied by confocal scanning laser microscopy. Results show that increasing the protein concentration for the 3 systems promoted a faster gelation, led to higher moduli and to gels with smaller pore sizes, which is due to {{the increase in the number}} of particles and consequently probably in the number of potential bonds between them and to the reduction in the distances between colloids. Replacing 20 % of CAS by WPA increased the moduli of the acid gels as long as the protein concentrations was 2. 6, and probably built under a reaction-limited mechanism. The WPA gel was of the strong-link regime, with lower Df value around 1. 7 and produced by a diffusion-limited mechanism. We suspect that these differences were possibly due to the different surface interactive properties of these 2 colloids, together with their different internal structure that lead to a different mechanism of acid gelation...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{spoilage}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of consequential losses in the dairy industry. In this context, the use of bioprotective cultures can be an alternative or a complementary approach to be considered. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionibacteria, as well as some fungal species, can exhibit antifungal activities with large differences in activity between strains. Therefore, it is necessary to develop high-throughput screening methods to test a large number of strains and find the most efficient ones. In the present study, we developed a miniaturized high-throughput screening technique to rapidly detect antifungal activities in a cheese-like model. This model, distributed in a 24 -well plate, consisted of 5 -fold concentrated whole milk ultrafiltration retentate (final fat concentration of 45 %), rennet (0. 03 %) and inoculated with a mesophilic lactic commercial starter and a pH indicator. Each well of the plate could be considered as a miniature cheese of ~ 2 g. Potent antifungal isolates were cultured in two dairy media; (i) a 10 %-reconstituted low heat skim milk supplemented with 45 % anhydrous milk fat (LH) and (ii) a 6 -fold concentrated <b>milk</b> ultrafiltration <b>permeate</b> sterilized by 0. 22 μm filtration and complemented with 10 g/l yeast extract and a pH indicator (UF). After cultivation, cultures (100 µl) were deposited on the miniature cheese surfaces followed by inoculation in duplicate with 50 spores or cells of 4 different fungal targets (1 fungi/plate), e. g., Mucor racemosus, Galactomyces geotrichum, Penicillium commune and Yarrowia lipolytica, and incubation at 12 °C for up to 15 days. We screened 505 bacterial isolates belonging to Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Propiobacterium genera and 198 fungal isolates belonging to 28 genera. This high-throughput screening for antifungal activity revealed that 52 and 216 bacteria, and, 53 and 89 fungi, inhibited at least one fungal target after cultivation in UF and LH, respectively. Among the 4 tested fungal targets, P. commune was the most frequently inhibited fungus while only few isolates were able to inhibit M. racemosus or Y. lipolytica. This method opens new possibilities to screen microorganisms for antifungal activities. These results also underline the importance of the culture and screening media used on the expression of antifungal activities by bacteria or fungi...|$|R

40|$|The {{particle}} gun {{provides a}} valuable method to investigate powder stickiness properties. This method gives reproducible results when used under constant testing conditions {{and allows the}} isolation of factors influencing stickiness behaviour such as velocity and angle of impact. The (T-Tg) critical and rate of stickiness development obtained from the particle gun method were functions of the air velocity, angle of impact, powder aw and ambient air conditions. Under constant testing conditions (feed rate of 0. 3 g. s - 1, air velocity of 20 m. s- 1, ambient air at < 50 %RH, room temperature and constant powder aw (T-Tg) critical was reproducible within ± 0. 8 °C while the rate of stickiness development was reproducible within ± 0. 45 %deposition/°C. The results obtained from the particle gun were consistently higher than the fluid bed results and {{can be explained by}} the different impact time and force experienced by the particles. Particle gun results can successfully be used to predict blockages in cyclones provided the appropriate correction is made for particle impact force and time. Blockage data from Te Rapa D 5 indicates that the critical T-Tg where blockages occur in the cyclones is 27 °C for SMP. Currently D 5 is running satisfactorily for SMP at a T-Tg value of 28 °C. Under these operation conditions the cyclone wall temperature results in a T-Tg value of 33 °C. the same (T-Tg) critical value predicted by the particle gun for standardised SMP. This implies that the cyclone is operating correctly at the maximum T-Tg value before particles become sticky enough to cause blockage problems. Protein standardisation of milk powder via the addition of <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> or lactose solution had no detectable effect on the stickiness characteristics of SMP or WMP as measured by the particle gun or the fluid bed rig. No difference was seen in either the bulk or surface composition of the milk powder.

40|$|International audienceStarch {{is often}} used as a {{thickening}} agent in food systems {{in combination with other}} ingredients such as milk. The viscosity of starch dispersion in milk is higher than that in water. This effect can not be completely explained by the contribution of milk proteins to the viscosity, and thus interactions between milk components and starch granules are suspected [1]. This study focused on the influence of skim milk components on the swelling behavior of modified (resistant to thermal and mechanical treatments) waxy maize starch during gelatinization and the rheological properties of the resulting starch suspensions. Three suspension media were selected for stepwise building up of milk complexity: NaCl (0. 1 Mol), reconstituted skim <b>milk</b> <b>permeate</b> (ions and lactose) and reconstituted skim milk (ions, lactose and milk proteins). Suspensions of starch (3 %w/w) were heated under shear (up to 85 ?C, 10 ?C/min). Sampling of the suspensions at different stages of the thermomechanical treatment (between 50 to 85 ?C) was done. The rheological study was performed by means of flow curve measurements at 60 and 20 ?C using a MCR 301 (Anton Paar, Austria) fitted with coaxial cylinders. Viscosity at the Newtonian plateau was recorded, and the relative viscosity calculated. The swelling level was assessed by means of particle size analysis using a Malvern Master sizer (2000, Malvern Instruments, UK). For each medium, the evolution curves of relative viscosities at 60 and 20 ?C in relation to the starch volume fraction of the samplings were built. The curves obtained for the three media, presenting the relative viscosity at 60 ?C, were overlaid. The size of the starch granules versus the relative viscosity (60 ?C) were not modified by the presence of milk constituents. Nevertheless, at 20 ?C, the relative viscosity of starch/skim milk mixtures increased as a function of starch volume fraction quicker than the two other media. It is thus suspected that interactions between starch and milk proteins during gelatinization could impact the characteristics of starch granules, the effects of those modifications would be increased with their retrogradation. Several ageing durations of the suspensions were tested and DSC experiment set (DSC 7, Perkin-Elmer, USA) ...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Biological chemistryWhey is {{becoming}} an important product for the dairy industry. In the last 15 years, the characterization of whey proteins (β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg), α-lactalbumin (α-La), Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Immunoglobulin (Ig), Lactoferin (LF), Glycomacropeptide (GMP) and Casein macropeptide (CMP)) has become an important issue for biochemists and dairy companies. Characterization of the protein in whey is necessary to obtain possible methods to achieve the best whey based products. This project is a comparison of three different methods for protein characterization in order to observe and compare the main proteins in whey and skimmed milk. Whey samples were generated through the microfiltration of skimmed milk where permeate is defined as native whey. During this whey sample preparation, a second type of whey was formed. This whey is the retentate generated from the ultrafiltration of permeate (native whey) and is called native whey protein concentrate from microfiltrated milk. FT-IR spectroscopy, Gel electrophoresis and Mass spectrometry based proteomics were the methods {{that were used in}} this project to characterize the milk samples concentrate. Initially sample preparation methods were developed to obtain protein samples for analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to evaluate differences between each sample according to the type of filtration or the concentration factor of each process. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to FT-IR spectra in regions of 3043 - 898 cm− 1 in order to identify the differences between skimmed <b>milk,</b> <b>permeate</b> and retentate proteins. Use of this method allowed analysis of the most important wavenumbers for each group of samples. PLS modelling was used to compare the data from FT-IR against other methods, by showing the correlation between samples. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to predict the presence of certain proteins in the samples based on their molecular weight. Gel scans show the distinct protein sizes in the whey and skimmed milk. The method does not allow identifying proteins but it may answer some biochemical questions. Mass spectrometry based proteomics (using LC-MS/MS) is commonly used to identify proteins in biological samples. Protein characterization by this method is based on detection of peptides following trypsination of the samples, a so called bottom-up approach. Tandem mass spectra are collected from peptides and in order to identify the proteins, the results are searched against a database of proteins derived from genomic sequences. Β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin and casein were the major proteins present in my samples. The existence of BSA, lactoferin, immunoglobulin and glycomacropeptide as the minor proteins were also detected. Most of the SDS-PAGE observations were in agreement with LC-MS/MS results. The results indicate that mass spectrometry provided the most information concerning the protein content of the samples. Although depending on the research needs SDS-PAGE or FT-IR analysis may be sufficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of processes for {{the preparation of}} prebiotic compounds, namely inulin from tubers of Jerusalem artichoke (JA-Helianthus tuberosus L.), and lactulose from <b>milk</b> concentration <b>permeate</b> (MCP) was examined. Inulin was extracted from the whole JA tubers using hydrothermal extraction process, followed by clarification and concentration. The concentrate was fractionated using two different procedures i. e. ethanol fractionation and cold precipitation (+ 4 and/or - 24 C) into high- and low-molecular-weight components. The most satisfactory method was cold fractionation wherein the insoluble heavier inulin fractions were found to settle {{to the bottom and}} were separated and spray-dried to obtain inulin powder. Lactose in MCP was isomerised into lactulose using carbonate-based catalysts (oyster shell and egg shell powders) followed by clarification and concentration. Th e high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detector (HPLC-RID) chromatograms and changes in pH and colour values confirmed the conversion of lactose into lactulose and decomposition of lactulose into by-products. The results obtained showed the suitability of oyster shell powder for lactose isomerisation in lieu of egg shell powder. For preparing lactulose-enriched MCP with acceptable lactulose yield of 22 %, the optimum reaction conditions were found to be catalyst loading of 12 mg per mL of MCP and isomerisation time of 120 min at 96 C. The resulting products i. e. JAI concentrate and powder and lactulose-enriched MCP syrup (40 ºB) were tested for their prebiotic power in media broth and in fermented milk models. Prebiotic properties of these compounds were observed as supplementation levels increased from 0 - 2 % to 3 - 4 %. Based on the growth and acidification abilities of the probiotic strains tested, the combination of Lactobacillus casei LC- 01 with JAI, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 with lactulose-enriched MCP syrup were found to be the best for {{development of}} synbiotic yoghurt. The prebiotic effect of JAIP was then compared with the two commercial chicory inulin products (Raftiline GR and Raftilose P 95). Probiotic yoghurts supplemented with 4 % inulin powders were prepared from reconstituted skim milk using mixed cultures of Lactobacillus casei LC- 01, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (1 : 0. 5 : 0. 5, w/w). The survival and acidifying activity of probiotic and lactic acid cultures were investigated during the shelf life of 28 days at 4 ºC. Incorporation of JAIP and chicory inulins resulted in a significant improvement in viability of LC- 01 compared with non-supplemented yoghurt, maintaining more than 107 CFU g- 1 throughout storage time. Additionally, the suitability of JAIP as fat replacer was determined in a set of fat-free yoghurt in comparison to three commercial chicory inulin products. Results of large deformation tests revealed that the firmness of JAIP-supplemented yoghurt was reduced to a similar level as the full-fat control yoghurt. However, small deformation results showed that the JAIP could not fully mimic milk fat to the same extent as Raftiline HP with an average DP of 23. The rheological effects of JAIP addition were comparable to those of short-chain (Raftilose P 95 with an average DP of 4) and medium-chain inulins (Raftiline® GR with an average DP of 12) ...|$|R

During {{each of the three}} experimental periods, 8 days of total collection balance trials were conducted during which goats were allocated for 72 h (three 24 h cycles) in open circuit respiration chambers to determine methane and heat production and, hence, the energy balance. Diet F, in comparison with diets M and W, significantly increased the milk fat content (4. 13 vs 3. 11 and 3. 14 %, P< 0. 001) and the 4 %-FCM yield (3367 vs 2927 and 3055 g/d, P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 05, respectively), while no relevant changes were observed for milk protein content and yield. Energy digestibility was equal in diets F and W. Megalac® did not decrease fibre digestibility. The partition of the gross energy intake (EI) differed significantly between diets: diet M had lower DE (72. 4 vs 74. 3 and 74. 3 %; P< 0. 01) and ME (62. 1 vs 64. 7 and 63. 5 %; P< 0. 05) in comparison with diets F and W, respectively. Energy lost as methane was not significantly decreased by the inclusion of rumen- protected fat in the diet, although a trend for a reduction of methanogenesis was observed. Heat production deter- mined by treatment F was lower in comparison with the other treatments. This difference was almost significant (P= 0. 056) when expressed {{as a percentage of the}} ME. Milk energy output increased significantly (+ 12 %, P< 0. 001) by including fat in the diet, as compared with treatments M and W: 21. 4 vs 19. 1 and 19. 0 % of the EI. The net ener- gy content of the protected fat was 27. 94 MJ NEl/kg DM (+ 340 % vs maize meal); its kl value resulted 0. 77. The corresponding values for whey permeate were 7. 76 MJ NEl/kg DM (- 5 % vs maize meal) and 0. 50, respectively. Summarizing, the {{efficiency of}} energy utilization in diet M was significantly lower in comparison with the other two diets in terms of digestibility and metabolisability, while its NEl content was similar to that of diet W. On the other hand, diet F had a significantly higher ME (P< 0. 01) and NEl (P< 0. 05) as compared to the other two diets. Diet F greatly influenced the fatty acid composition of the milk fat with less short (- 30 %) and medium (- 33 %) chain fatty acids and more (+ 18 %) long chain fatty acids. In conclusion, whey permeate and even more Megalac® can be suc- cessfully used as feed ingredients in the diet of highly productive lactating goats, but the economical convenience of their utilisation must be evaluated based on the market values of feedstuffs...|$|R
40|$|Ziel und Gegenstand der experimentellen Arbeiten: Die komplexen Oligosaccharide der Humanmilch (HMO) sind sowohl hinsichtlich ihrer Konzentration in der Milch als auch aufgrund ihrer strukturellen Vielfalt einzigartig im Reich der Säuger. Weder über ihr Schicksal nach Aufnahme durch den Säugling noch über ihre biologische Funktion besteht gegenwärtig Klarheit. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden daher folgende Aspekte näher untersucht: 1) die hydrolytische Stabilität der HMO im Gastrointestinaltrakt, 2) Art und Umfang der Resorption der HMO, 3) zellbiologische sowie 4) antiadhäsive Wirkungen der HMO. Untersuchungsmethoden und Befunde: Ad 1) Verschiedene aus Humanmilch isolierte Fraktionen von HMO wurden bis zu 20 Stunden mit Präparationen von Pankreas- und Dünndarmgewebe inkubiert und enzymatisch sowie massenspektro-metrisch charakterisiert. Exemplarisch wurden im Tiermodell HMO an junge Mäuse intragastral verabreicht und deren Schicksal durch dünnschichtchromatographischen Nachweis in Faecesproben und Organen betrachtet. Sowohl die {{in vitro}} als auch die in vivo Untersuchungen ergaben, daß die HMO eine außergewöhnliche Stabilität gegenüber Hydrolasen des Gastro-intestinaltraktes aufweisen. HMO können damit weitgehend unverändert den Dünndarm passieren und unterliegen erst im Dickdarm einer bakteriellen Hydrolyse. Die Oligosaccharide können aus diesem Blickwinkel als die lösliche Ballaststofffraktion der Humanmilch angesehen werden. Ad 2) Die intestinale Resorption von HMO wurde in Zellkulturmodellen des menschlichen Dünndarms und tierexperimentell an Mäusen untersucht. Die in vitro Versuche ergaben, daß HMO in einem Umfang von 2 bis 3 % der angebotenen Menge in intakter Form das Epithel von Caco- 2 Zellen permeieren können und dies überwiegend parazellulär erfolgt. Die ermittelten Resorptionsraten stimmen mit denen in Mäuse überein, bei welchen die HMO in geringem Umfang sowohl in der Leber als auch im Urin zum Teil noch in intakter Form nachgewiesen werden konnten. Ad 3) Die hohe Stabilität und geringe Resorptionsrate der HMO ermöglichen den intensiven Kontakt mit Epithelzellen im Dünndarm und Dickdarm. Bei den Studien zur möglichen Beeinflussung der Zellproliferation, -differenzierung und Apoptose zeigten die Oligosaccharide meist nur schwache Wirkungen auf die Biologie der Epithelzellen. Die nachgewiesenen proliferationshemmenden Effekte einiger Vertreter der HMO (negativ geladene bzw. höhermolekulare HMO) erscheinen unter physiologischen Bedingungen und im Vergleich zu anderen Nahrungsinhaltstoffen als relativ unbedeutend. Ad 4) Nach Befunden aus der Literatur besitzen ausgewählte HMO antibakterielle und antivirale Eigenschaften, da sie als lösliche Liganden im Respirations-, Gastrointestinal- und Urogenitaltrakt fungieren können. Trotz umfangreicher Validierung verschiedenster Modellsysteme gelang es uns nicht, die antiadhäsive Wirkungen von HMO in physiologischen Konzentrationsbereichen nachzuweisen. Reproduzierbare Befunde konnten jedoch mit dem glykosylierten Peptidbruchstück des bovinen K-Casein erhalten werden. Zusammenfassend lässt sich für die hier durchgeführten Studien zum Schicksal der Oligosaccharide der Humanmilch im Gastrointestinaltrakt und zu ihrer biologischen Rolle feststellen: Aufgrund ihrer außerordentlichen Stabilität gegenüber intestinalen Hydrolasen und ihrer geringen Resorptionsrate im Dünndarm scheinen die Oligosaccharide in erster Linie als fermentierbare Ballaststoffe für den Säugling zu fungieren. Human milk is {{especially}} rich in complex oligosaccharides providing an extraordinary structural diversity. Neither their fate after intake {{by the human}} infant nor their biological functions are known. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to answer the following questions: Are the secreted pancreatic enzymes and/or the brush border bound hydrolases in the small intestine capable of hydrolysing the free oligosaccharides of human milk ? Our in vitro as well as in vivo experiments demonstrated an exceptional enzymatic stability of the oligosaccharides against hydrolases of the gastrointestinal tract. Even fucose and sialic acid in terminal positions of the oligosaccharides were highly resistant to the enzymatic attack. A complete hydrolysis could only be achieved by applying intracellular or lysosomal enzymes of pancreatic tissues. However, these enzymes are not or only in trace amounts inherent in pancreatic secretions. Therefore, human milk oligosaccharides most likely survive passage along the human small intestine as intact molecules. As shown recently, the milk oligosaccharides are submitted to fermentation in the infants large intestine comparable to other non starch polysaccharides. In this way these oligosaccharides may serve primarily as the soluble fiber fraction of human milk. Are oligosaccharides of human milk absorbed in their intact form or after partial digestion? Supported by the results obtained in our in vitro systems, oligosaccharides of human <b>milk</b> may <b>permeate</b> the small intestinal epithelia in intact form with an absorption rate of 2 - 3 %. Within this range of low permeation rates smaller uncharged oligosaccharides show enhanced absorption when compared to the negatively charged or larger saccharides. As there were no differences in the permeation rates between oligosaccharides and mannitol, the oligosaccharides most likely use the paracellular permeation route; similar to mannitol. This implies that intracellular hydrolysis in epithelia may not be of great importance. When oligosaccharides were administered to young mice, small amounts were detected in the liver as well as in the urine, partly in intact form. However, the absorption rates in this animal model were similar to those determined in Caco- 2 monolayer cultures. As human milk oligosaccharides mostly escape absorption, larger amounts are submitted to the microflora of the human infant. This might be important for the selection of a particular colonic flora. Furthermore, the fermentation products of the oligosaccharides such as butyrate may serve as energy fuel in colonic cells and provoke the growth of the epithelium. Do oligosaccharides of human milk affect the cell cycle of intestinal epithelial cells ? The high stability and low absorption rate of the oligosaccharides provide an intense contact with the intestinal epithelial cells. The results of our studies do not indicate a profound effect of milk oligosaccharides on proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis of epithelial cells. Although proliferation rates of Caco- 2 and HT- 29 cells were significantly reduced, especially by high concentrations of acidic or high molecular weight oligosaccharides, this was not accompanied by an increase in differentiation or induction of physiological cell death. The reduced proliferation rates seen with some human milk oligosaccharides seem to be of no great importance under physiological conditions and in comparison to other food ingredients. Do free or peptide bound milk oligosaccharides possess anti-adhesive properties ? According to the literature several milk oligosaccharides have anti-bacterial as well as anti-viral properties in acting as soluble receptors in the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal as well as the urinary tract. To test this assumption for the milk oligosaccharides available to us, we developed different model systems. In spite of several methods to test the adherence of bacterial strains to epithelial cells or isolated brush border membranes, none of the human milk oligosaccharides showed reproducible effects on adhesion. Only a cell culture model of Caco- 2 cells provided consistent results showing distinct anti-adhesive effects of the glycosylated part of bovine k-casein at higher concentrations but not of free milk oligosaccharides. These results, along with the low absorption rates, do not support an important role of human milk oligosaccharides as anti-adhesive molecules in extraintestinal tissues such as the respiratory or urogenital tract. In summary, we conclude with respect to the fate and biological role of human milk oligosaccharides, that - based on their extraordinary stability against gastrointestinal hydrolysis and their low rates of absorption in the small intestine - they seem to function primarily as the soluble fibre fraction of human milk. As there might be the possibility of further biological functions of human milk oligosaccharides in infant metabolism, they clearly need to be investigated further...|$|R
