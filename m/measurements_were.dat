However, deriving optimal quantum <b>measurements</b> <b>is</b> often difficult.

Among other results, we show that a minimum-cost measurement for a set of given pure states is formally equivalent to a minimum-error measurement for mixed states of those same pure states. For pure symmetric states it turns out that for a certain class of cost matrices, the minimum-cost <b>measurement</b> <b>is</b> the square-root <b>measurement.</b> That <b>is,</b> the optimal minimum-cost <b>measurement</b> <b>is</b> in this case the same as the minimum-error measurement. Finally, we consider sequences of individual ``local" systems, and examine when the global minimum-cost <b>measurement</b> <b>is</b> a sequence of optimal local measurements. We also consider an example where the global minimum-cost <b>measurement</b> <b>is,</b> perhaps counter-intuitively, not a sequence of local measurements, and discuss how this is related to related to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph argument for the nature of the wave function.

5|$|The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; {{the tilt}} {{is similar to}} that of the Earth (11.3°). Its {{equatorial}} field strength is about 776.6μT (7.766G), which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 2.83 T·m3. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000times larger. Jupiter's magnetic field rotates at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m. No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first <b>measurements</b> <b>were</b> taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid-1970s.|$|E
