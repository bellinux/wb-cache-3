40|$|In the sine dwell {{school of}} modal testing, a {{frequency}} domain function, most {{often called the}} <b>Mode</b> <b>Indicator</b> Function (MIF), has been employed for several years to detect the presence of real normal modes. This function is calculated from Frequency Response Functions from a single exciter location to highlight those frequencies where the global response phase lags the sinusoidal excitation by 90 degrees. Recently, a multivariate <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> procedure was presented, that, using FRF's from several exciter loca-tions, can detect repeated roots, {{as well as providing}} initial force patterns for the sine dwell tuning of the asso-ciated modes. This paper presents a brief outline of the theory of this multivariate <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> and then shows how the in-formation generated by this procedure may be used for the extraction of selected modal parameters through function enhancement and frequency domain SDOF techniques. The use of the multivariate <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> in the traditional MDOF procedures will also be discussed. Examples will be presented from several tests...|$|E
40|$|Perception is a {{fundamental}} function because it allows organisms to be {{in contact with the}} environment and adjust to environmental conditions. Humans also possess higher intellectual functions, which allow for elaborate handling of perceptually obtained information. The thesis concerns a distinction between an inferential ("cognitive") mode and a (direct-) perceptual mode of apprehension, and a notion of perceptual skill acquisition as a transition from the inferential to the perceptual mode. The mode distinction and the mode-transition model was formulated by Runeson, Juslin, and Olsson (2000) within the ecological direct-perception framework (Gibson, 1966, 1979). The modes of apprehension were investigated in an experimental paradigm that concerned visual perception of the relative mass of two colliding objects. The relative mass is specified by an optical variable in the collision movement pattern, which observers may pick up while functioning in the perceptual mode. However, novices often rely on other, nonspecifying, optical variables that may constitute cues that are used in the inferential mode (Runeson et al., 2000). Four tentative <b>mode</b> <b>indicators</b> were employed: participants' realism of confidence, introspective mode reports, amplitudes of brain event-related potentials, and response times. Generally, the results did not support the mode-transition model of skill acquisition. Furthermore, results suggested that reliance both on the specifying and nonspecifying variables might have occurred either in the inferential or in the perceptual mode. However, the <b>mode</b> <b>indicators</b> may not have captured mode as intended. For instance, the discriminability of used optical variables, and not the mode of apprehension, may have affected both amplitudes of event-related potentials and mode reports. It is argued that the mode-transition model and the distinction between two modes of apprehension should be further investigated employing other methodologies, and, furthermore, that the mode distinction has a place within an ecological framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the multivariate}} <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> {{function}} (MMIF) method {{has been applied}} to simulated flutter test data in order to evaluate the potential application of normal mode force appropriation to flight flutter testing where there are many close modes and noise levels are severe. It is seen that the approach is capable of estimating accurate modal frequencies and force patterns from corrupted test data, for use in the appropriation of particular modes. Damping ratios are accurately estimated from a decay response following a resonance dwell. The complex <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> function (CMIF) has also been considered. The practical limitations of in-flight force appropriation are discussed, and the effects of the limited excitation possibilities are demonstrated by simulation. The number and position of exciters used are arguably the most important factors in determining the success of this technique. The application of force appropriation to flight flutter testing may well depend on the availability of small detachable vanes which allow direct excitation of all areas of the aircraft structure...|$|E

40|$|The Complex <b>Mode</b> <b>Indicator</b> Function (CMIF) was origi-nally {{proposed}} {{as a method}} for improving modal parameter estimation. CMIF utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) {{on a set of}} FRFs as a means of extracting modal pa-rameters. The Multivariate <b>Mode</b> <b>Indicator</b> Function (MMIF) was originally {{proposed as}} a method for force appropriation to excite normal modes. MMIF utilizes an eigenvalue solution method on a set of FRFs to isolate modes. Both CMIF & MMIF also have the ability to indicate the presence of closely coupled modes or repeated roots in a structure. Both methods can also be used as tools for identi-fying a minimum set of reference DOFs for performing a modal test. Using a small set of potential reference FRFs and their cross measurements, either CMIF or MMIF can be used to deter-mine the minimum number of references required to ade-quately excite all the desired modes in a frequency band. This technique has previously been demonstrated to provide reasonable results on several test structures.

40|$|<b>Mode</b> <b>indicator</b> {{functions}} (MIFs) {{are used}} in modal testing and analysis {{as a means of}} identifying modes of vibration, often as a precursor to modal parameter estimation. Various methods have been developed since the MIF was introduced four decades ago. These methods are quite useful in assisting the analyst to identify genuine modes and, {{in the case of the}} complex <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> function, have even been developed into modal parameter estimation techniques. Although the various MIFs are able to indicate the existence of a mode, they do not provide the analyst with any descriptive information about the mode. This paper uses the simple summation type of MIF to develop five averaged and normalised MIFs that will provide the analyst with enough information to identify whether a mode is longitudinal, vertical, lateral or torsional. The first three functions, termed directional MIFs, have been noted in the literature in one form or another; however, this paper introduces a new twist on the MIF by introducing two MIFs, termed torsional MIFs, that can be used by the analyst to identify torsional modes and, moreover, can assist in determining whether the mode is of a pure torsion or sway type (i. e., having a rigid cross-section) or a distorted twisting type. The directional and torsional MIFs are tested on a finite element model based simulation of an experimental modal test using an impact hammer. Results indicate that the directional and torsional MIFs are indeed useful in assisting the analyst to identify whether a mode is longitudinal, vertical, lateral, sway, or torsion...|$|E

The innovation <b>mode</b> <b>indicators</b> are calculated using the results of the third Community Innovation Survey (CIS- 3) for innovation activities between 1998 and 2000. The analysis shows that in nations where work is organized to support high levels of discretion in solving complex problems firms tend to be more active in terms of innovations developed through their in-house creative efforts. In countries where learning and problem solving on the job are more constrained, and little discretion is left to the employee, firms tend to engage in a supplier-dominated innovation strategy. Their technological renewal depends more on the absorption of innovations developed elsewhere. These patterns remain when we divide the economies into manufacturing and services.

30|$|Motivated {{by these}} {{existing}} issues, this paper proposes a multi-channel CWT-based (MCWT) mode estimation approach. In {{order to improve}} the computational efficiency of CWT in processing multi-channel measurement data, a data compression technique is developed to remove the redundancies and retain the dominant components. The data compression technique consists of two parts: the first part based on SVD is responsible for decomposing the covariance matrix generated by the multi-channel measurement signals; the second part is to construct measurement signal using the results of SVD with a proposed model order determination method. For the constructed measurement signal, CWT is applied to form wavelet coefficient matrix (WCM) at the same dilation. With the WCMs, a singular-value vector is constructed using the maximum singular value of each WCM obtained through SVD. In this singular value vector, the maximum component is considered as the dominant oscillation <b>mode</b> <b>indicator</b> to select the right-singular vector. Using the selected right vectors, the dominant modes can be estimated holistically.|$|E

In the second step, the modal damping parameters {{as well as}} physical damping parameters (allowing to update global non-proportional damping) are open for updating. The updating techniques are based on the inverse sensitivity approach and use frequency response data only at the resonance peaks. The optimization process is solved by minimizing an objective function containing two residuals. The first represents the differences between the analytical and the experimental resonance peaks utilizing the fact, that the analytical and the experimental FRF peaks occur at different resonace frequencies. The decision on what test/analysis FRF peak differences to include in the objective function is based on the Frequency Domain Assurance Criterion (FDAC).
