40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the potential for}} building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) incorporation of thin-film photovoltaics, commercially available quantum dots (QDs) have been deposited, {{as part of a}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composite film, on a cadmium telluride (CdTe) <b>micro-module.</b> This resulted in an increase in photocurrent generation through the luminescent down-shifting (LDS) process. The optical properties of these films were characterized through UV–vis spectroscopy. The impact of the film on the <b>micro-module</b> was studied through current–voltage (I–V) and external quantum efficiency measurements. Further layers were added to the initial single-layer LDS film, however no additional improvement to the <b>micro-module</b> were observed. Additionally, a range of emission wavelengths have been explored. The majority of these films, when tested on a CdTe device, were shown to improve the photocurrent generation whilst also visually displaying the vivid colour palette provided by quantum confined materials. The future feasibility of using QD based LDS films for large scale BIPV-based power generation has also been discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{interests in}} using renewable energies {{are coming from}} solar thermal energy and solar photovoltaic systems to the micro production of electricity. Usually we already have considered the solar tracking topology in large scale applications like power plants and satellite but most of small scale applications don’t have any solar tracker system, mainly because of its high cost and complex circuit design. From that aspect, this paper confab microcontroller based one dimensional active <b>micro-module</b> solar tracking system, in which inexpensive LDR is used to generate reference voltage to operate microcontroller for functioning the tracking system. This system provides a fast response of tracking system to the parameters like change of light intensity as well as temperature variations. This <b>micro-module</b> model of tracking system {{can be used for}} small scale applications like portable electronic devices and running vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To realize {{faster and}} more precise {{treatment}} of patients, CT technology has an urgent demand to make the CT detector arrays larger, and to cover a larger section of the body during one scan of X-ray imaging. A novel detector <b>micro-module</b> is developed in this thesis to meet this demand. In the novel detector <b>micro-module,</b> photocurrent signals are read out from the bottom side of the photodiode array chip. By avoiding {{the use of the}} top surface of the chip for routeing, {{as is the case in}} conventional CT modules, rectangular detector building blocks containing a certain number of detector elements can be produced. By tiling such building blocks in both x- and y-directions in a plane, detector arrays with any number of detector elements (in multiples of the number in a single building block) can be built. This cannot be achievable by the conventional method. The novel detector <b>micro-module</b> developed in this thesis consists of an array of 16 × 16 active elements, and the size of the array is 21 × 21 mm 2. The array of detector elements is soldered to a multilayer LTCC (low temperature co-fired ceramics) substrate via a BGA (ball grid array) with each element soldered onto one solder sphere, from which photocurrent signals are read out. In this thesis, the working principle and the evolution of CT detector modules are reviewed and the necessity of developing the novel detector modules is justified. The concept and the structure of the novel detector <b>micro-module</b> are presented. The thermo-mechanical stress modeling and simulation of the structure is performed. The design and the process technology of the photodiode array for the novel detector micro-modules are discussed. The electronic characteristics of the novel detector micro-modules and the related front-end electronics are theoretically analyzed. The LTCC multi-layer substrate is developed. The assembly process of the novel detector <b>micro-module</b> is developed. The basic detector characteristics and light response measurement results of the novel <b>micro-module</b> are presented and discussed. By improving the photodiode silicon process technology, a dark current density as low as 33 pA/cm 2 is achieved. Excellent mechanical accuracy is achieved with the LTCC substrate. The dimensional tolerance is +/- 10 μm and the flatness value is less than 50 μm over a distance of a 30. 5 mm distance. A 64 -slice detector module is produced successfully by tiling several novel micro-modules. The novel detector micro-modules are superior to conventional CT modules on many respects while being tileable. Their light sensitivity curve is smoother. They exhibit extremely low signal cross-talk; They have nearly zero wiring capacitance compared to up to 20 pF in commercial CT detector modules. They also have almost zero wiring resistance compared to tens of ohm or more than one hundred ohms in the present products. This result will have a significant impact on CT technology and the CT industry because the detector will be no longer the limiting factor in CT system performance...|$|E

40|$|Moisture content at {{harvest is}} a key {{parameter}} that impacts quality and how well the cotton crop can be stored without degrading before processing. It is also a key parameter of interest for harvest time field trials as it can directly influence {{the quality of the}} harvested crop as well as skew the results of in-field yield and quality assessments. Microwave sensing of moisture has several unique advantages over lower frequency sensing approaches. The first is that microwaves are insensitive to variations in conductivity, due to presence of salts or minerals. The second advantage is that microwaves can peer deep inside large bulk packaging to assess the internal moisture content without performing a destructive tear down of the package. To help facilitate the development of a microwave moisture sensor for seedcotton; research was performed to determine the basic microwave properties of seedcotton. The research was performed on 110 kg <b>micro-modules,</b> which are of direct interest to research teams for use in ongoing field-based research projects. It should also prove useful for the enhancement of existing and future yield monitor designs. Experimental data was gathered on the basic relations between microwave material properties and seedcotton over the range from 1. 0 GHz to 2. 5 GHz and is reported on herein. This research is part one of a two-part series that reports on the fundamental microwave properties of seedcotton as moisture and density vary naturally during the course of typical harvesting operations; part two will utilize this data to formulate a prediction algorithm to form the basis for a prototype microwave moisture sensor...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} requirements to existing heat-insulation layers in enclosure structures of wall panels has been carried out, a general principles on development of thermal insulation systems, substantiation on the necessity {{to develop a new}} wall panel design with improved thermal characteristics. The proposed design of the wall panel differs from the existing one in the fact that its external layer is made of protective sheets being perforated in their top and bottom parts with perforated aluminum foil layer placed on them. Air layer performs function of one of thermal insulation layers, and the second layer is made up in the form of several micro-modular sub-layers which are divided by perforated aluminum foil and a grid. An inner concrete layer is also separated from micro-modular layers by aluminum foil. Protective sheets and the grid can be made of aluminum or polyethylene. The arrangement of hollow micro-modular cells in the zone of negative temperatures prevents condensate accumulation. The arrangement of the perforated aluminum foil layers between micro- modular layers leads to increase in thermal resistance of the panel due to decrease of a radiant component in presence of several screens and does not interfere with a vapor permeability of thermal insulation layers from <b>micro-modules.</b> At the same time placement of a non-perforated foil layer on an inside panel layer interferes with penetration of water vapor from rooms in micro-modular thermal insulation layers. Technological principles lie in the arrangement of perforation slots in the top and bottom zones of protective sheets that allows to delete excess moisture from thermal insulation layers and air layer and also leads to improvement of thermo-technical characteristics, durability and reliability in construction operation as a whole. The executed calculations of heat and humidity fields in external enclosure structures confirm advantages of the presented technical solution. </p...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an ex-ante assessment of the poverty and income distribution impacts of the Central American Free Trade Area agreement on Nicaragua. A general equilibrium macro model is used to simulate trade reform scenarios and estimate their price effects, while a <b>micro-module</b> maps these price changes into real income changes at the individual household level. A useful insight from this analysis is that even if the final total impact on poverty is not too large, its dispersion across households – due to their heterogeneity of factor endowments, inputs use, commodity production, and consumption preferences – is significant and should be taken into account when designing compensatory policies. Additionally, growth and redistribution decomposition shows that, at least in the short to medium run, redistribution can be as important as growth. The main policy message that emerges from the paper is that Nicaragua should consider enlarging its own liberalization to countries other than the U. S. to boost trade-induced poverty reductions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInverting the {{classroom}} in material science {{is a method}} to let students study the science of engineering materials {{on their own and}} then take time to discuss their questions and do extended hands-on lectures or exercises in class. A sufficient number and variety of teaching materials aims at different learning skills of the students and meets the diversity of a first year class. Therefore teaching materials and <b>micro-module</b> lectures to individually chose, combine and study from a distance are provided in a newly established moodle-based course. Along with exercises and worked solutions, students can check their learning progress via self-testing. Peer instruction (Simon et al., 2010) is used to assess the learning progress prior to each class. In blended-learning scenarios students use different materials to study and understand the science in theory and then {{the classroom}} lectures offer the opportunity for students to comprehend the principle of different aspects in material science and apply their knowledge. Not all of the themes taught the first semester are suitable to apply the inverted classroom approach, but it has been proven to be successful and increase the fun of teaching throughout the first year...|$|E
40|$|While {{outcome of}} {{psychiatric}} rehabilitation has been suc-cessfully predicted by cognitive tests, efforts {{to design a}} measure to assess responsiveness to rehabilitation have been lacking. In this report, we describe the rationale for and development of a face-valid measure of responsivity to the three core components of skills training: responsive-ness to verbal instruction, ability to learn from viewing {{the behavior of a}} model, and ability to demonstrate skills ob-served during a subsequent role-play. Seven alternate forms of the new measure, called the <b>Micro-Module</b> Learning Test (MMLT), demonstrated adequate internal consis-tency and alternate-form reliability. We also present re-sults from four studies in which the MMLT was used to collect normative data as well as data on relationships with symptoms, cognitive tests, and treatment outcome. Results indicate that the MMLT is associated with cogni-tive factors found to predict treatment outcome in prior studies (e. g., verbal memory and fluency), as well as lesser investigated functions such as theory of mind ability. In addition, MMLT scores were correlated negatively with psychotic disorganization and positively with performance during a full-length skills training group. The MMLT appears to be a reliable and valid measure for rapidly assessing responsiveness to skills training procedures...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{important}} developments {{achieved with}} CdTe thin-film photovoltaic devices produced using metalorganic {{chemical vapour deposition}} at atmospheric pressure. In particular, {{attention was paid to}} understand the enhancements in solar cell conversion efficiency, to develop the cell design, and assess scalability towards modules. Improvements in the device performance were achieved by optimising the high-transparency window layer (Cd 0. 3 Zn 0. 7 S) and a device-activation anneal. These increased the fill factor and open-circuit voltage to 77 [*]±[*] 1 % and 785 [*]±[*] 7 [*]mV, respectively, compared with 69 [*]±[*] 3 % and 710 [*]±[*] 10 [*]mV for previous baseline devices with no anneal and thicker Cd 0. 3 Zn 0. 7 S. The enhancement in these parameters is associated with the two fold to three fold increase in the net acceptor density of CdTe upon air annealing and a decrease in the back contact barrier height from 0. 24 [*]±[*] 0. 01 to 0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 02 [*]eV. The optimum thickness of the window layer for maximum photocurrent was 150 [*]nm. The cell size was scaled from 0. 25 to 2 [*]cm 2 in order to assess its impact on the device series resistance and fill factor. Finally, <b>micro-module</b> devices utilising series-connected 2 -cm 2 sub-cells were fabricated using a combination of laser and mechanical scribing techniques. An initial module-to-cell efficiency ratio of 0. 9 was demonstrated for a six-cell module {{with the use of the}} improved device structure and processing.
