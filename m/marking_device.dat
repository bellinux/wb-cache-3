50|$|Many {{types of}} chart {{recorders}} use a galvanometer {{to drive the}} <b>marking</b> <b>device.</b> A light coil of wire suspended in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet deflects {{in proportion to the}} current through it; instead of the pointer and scale of a direct-reading meter, the recorder deflects a pen or other <b>marking</b> <b>device.</b> The writing mechanism may be a heated needle writing on heat-sensitive paper or a simple hollow ink-fed pen. If the pen is continuously pressed against the paper, the galvanometer must be strong enough to move the pen against the friction of the paper. To lessen the strain on the galvanometer the pen might instead only intermittently be pressed against the writing medium, to make an impression, and then move while pressure is released.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{determination}} of anatomical reference frames in the rearfoot during 3 D Multisegment foot modeling has been hindered {{by a number}} of factors. One of these factors is related to the difficulty to palpate, or the absence of, anatomical landmarks. A novel <b>device</b> (Calcaneal <b>Marker</b> <b>Device),</b> aiming at standardizing marker placement at the calcaneus, was therefore developed and evaluated for its reliability. Methods: Throughout a random-repeated measure design the repeatability of calcaneal marker placement was evaluated for two techniques: manual placement and placement using the novel <b>device</b> (Calcaneal <b>Marker</b> <b>Device).</b> Translational changes following marker placement as well as the clinical impact on intersegment angle calculation was quantified. Results: Intra-observer variability was greater in therapist two (< 5. 3 mm) compared to therapist 1 (< 2. 9 mm). Additionally, intra-observer variability was found to be < 1. 6 mm throughout the use of the CMD. Inter-observer variability was found to be significantly higher for the position of markers placed manually (5. 8 mm), whereas with the CMD the variability remained lower (< 1. 3 mm). The impact on the computed inter-segment angles followed a similar trend, with variability between 0. 4 °- 4. 0 ° and 1. 0 °- 8. 7 ° for respectively the placement with the CMD and the manual placement. status: publishe...|$|R

The two particles lé and lá occur under specific focus {{conditions and}} are therefore regarded as focus markers in the sparse literature.

The body is a sheet-steel cylinder with emission holes in the top and bottom. These allow the smoke to be released when the grenade is ignited. There are two main types, one producing coloured smoke for signaling, and the other for screening smoke. In coloured smoke grenades, the filler consists of 250 to 350 grams of coloured smoke mixture (mostly potassium chlorate, lactose and a dye). Screening smoke grenades usually contain HC (hexachloroethane/zinc) smoke mixture or TA (terephthalic acid) smoke mixture. HC smoke contains hydrochloric acid and is harmful to breathe. These grenades can become hot enough to scald or burn unprotected skin.|$|R
