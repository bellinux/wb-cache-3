5|$|In 1922 Rabi {{returned}} to Cornell {{as a graduate}} chemistry student, and began studying physics. In 1923 he met, and began courting, Helen Newmark, a summer-semester student at Hunter College. In order to be near her when she returned home, Rabi continued his studies at Columbia University, where his supervisor was Albert Wills. In June 1924 Rabi landed {{a job as a}} part-time tutor at the City College of New York. Wills, whose specialty was magnetism, suggested that Rabi write his doctoral thesis on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of sodium vapor. The topic did not appeal to Rabi, but after William Lawrence Bragg gave a seminar at Columbia about the electric susceptibility of certain crystals called Tutton's salts, Rabi decided to research their <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility,</b> and Wills agreed to be his supervisor.|$|E
5|$|Uncommon {{magnetic}} properties (spin glass state) {{were observed in}} diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike paramagnetic host material, <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|Born into a {{traditional}} Jewish family in Rymanów, Galicia, {{in what was}} then part of Austria-Hungary, Rabi came to the United States as a baby and was raised in New York's Lower East Side. He entered Cornell University as an electrical engineering student in 1916, but soon switched to chemistry. Later, he became interested in physics. He continued his studies at Columbia University, where he was awarded his doctorate for a thesis on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of certain crystals. In 1927, he headed for Europe, where he met and worked with many of the finest physicists of the time.|$|E

In similarity to triboelectrostatic separation technology, dry {{magnetic separation}} technology also requires that the feed coal has high degree of dissociation {{in order to facilitate}} the separating process of coal and gangue depending on <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> difference. Meanwhile, dry magnetic separation technology also has comparative small handing capacity.|$|R
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|On Wills' advice, Rabi {{traveled}} to Leeds for the 97th {{annual meeting of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where he heard Werner Heisenberg present a paper on quantum mechanics. Afterwards, Rabi moved to Copenhagen, where he volunteered to work for Niels Bohr. Bohr was on vacation, but Rabi went straight to work on calculating the <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of molecular hydrogen. After Bohr returned in October, he arranged for Rabi and Yoshio Nishina to continue their work with Wolfgang Pauli at the University of Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|The first curium {{samples were}} barely visible, and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> {{was very close to}} that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was produced only in 1951 by reduction of CmF3 with barium.|$|E

30|$|The {{siliceous}} sandstone blocks {{used in the}} Preah Vihear monument have low <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities,</b> with average values {{in the range of}} 0.011 – 0.068  ×  10 − 3 SI units. In contrast, the gray to yellowish-brown sandstones used in the Angkor monuments, which are feldspathic arenites supplied from the southeastern foot of Mt. Kulen, have higher average <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities,</b> with values in the range of 0.7 – 9.1  ×  10 − 3 SI units [14, 15, 17, 18].|$|R
30|$|The Gopura V (W) {{was also}} likely {{constructed}} {{during the third}} stage, because its sandstone blocks have similar chemical compositions and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> {{to those of the}} Eastern U-shaped Extension (O 1), and it has pediments that end in scrolls made from one block. The sandstone blocks used in the upper structure of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K 2) are also similar in chemical compositions and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> to those of the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O 1), suggesting that the upper structure of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K 2) was constructed in this third stage. However, the Western L-shaped Gallery (K 2) has pediments that end in scrolls made from two blocks, which are different from those in the Eastern U-shaped Extension (O 1). Given the chemical compositions and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> of its constituent blocks, we consider the possibility that the platform of the Western L-shaped Gallery (K 2) was constructed using the same sandstone blocks as those used in second-stage buildings. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} sandstone blocks of the third stage have distinctly lower K, Ti, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Zr contents and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> than those of the second stage.|$|R
5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E

25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{that can be}} used to detect the SCO phenomena in metal complexes.

25|$|Para{{magnetism}} {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields {{in the direction of the}} applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility)</b> and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.|$|E
500|$|Two {{classes of}} phase {{transitions}} occur: first-order transitions and continuous transitions. [...] For the later, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called critical point. [...] Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as correlation length, specific heat, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility</b> diverge exponentially. [...] These critical phenomena poses serious challenges to physicists because normal macroscopic laws {{are no longer}} valid {{in the region and}} novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.|$|E
500|$|Palladium readily absorbs {{hydrogen}} at room temperatures, forming {{palladium hydride}} PdHx with x less than 1. While this property {{is common to}} many transition metals, palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches 1. This property has been investigated in designing an efficient, inexpensive, and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium, though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose. [...] The content of hydrogen in palladium {{can be linked to}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibility,</b> which decreases with the increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for PdH0.62.

This suggests that the Eastern L-shaped Gallery (K 1) was constructed at a different time to the Western L-shaped Gallery (K 2) (during the second to third stages). The style of the pediment ends suggests that the Western L-shaped Gallery (K 2) was constructed after the Gopura III (P). However, the construction sequence inferred from the style of the pediment ends contradicts that derived from the chemical compositions and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> of their sandstone blocks.|$|R
30|$|The {{sandstone}} {{used in the}} Preah Vihear monument is {{siliceous sandstone}} (quartz arenite) and clearly different from the gray to yellowish-brown sandstone (feldspathic arenite) used in the Angkor monuments [17]. This siliceous sandstone of the early Cretaceous age is found within the Khorat Plateau and Mt. Kulen regions (Fig.  1) [19]. In the Angkor monuments, red siliceous sandstone blocks were uniquely used for Banteay Srei. For {{most of the rest}} of the Angkor monuments, the Red Terrain Formation (called the Phu Kradung Formation in Thailand) of the late Jurassic to the early Cretaceous supplied the gray to yellowish-brown sandstone. The Red Terrain Formation is overlain conformably by the Upper Sandstone Formation, which consists of siliceous sandstone of the early Cretaceous age [19]. The gray to yellowish-brown sandstone outcrops at the foot of the Khorat Plateau and Mt. Kulen, but was not used in the monuments on the Khorat Plateau. In Thailand, the Upper Sandstone Formation is subdivided into three units, from bottom to top, these are the Preah Vihear (Phra Wihan), Sao Khua, and Phu Phan Formations. These formations are not homogeneous and vary in color. The Preah Vihear Formation is mainly yellowish-brown, with fine to coarse grain size, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> of less than 0.068  ×  10 − 3 SI units (0.020  ×  10 − 3 SI units on average) [1].
