5000|$|In 1979, the United States {{launched}} an informal program {{to promote the}} [...] "rights and freedoms of navigation and overflight guaranteed to all nations under international law." [...] The program was initiated because the US government believed that many countries were beginning to assert jurisdictional boundaries far beyond traditional claims. The program was specifically implemented because diplomatic protests seemed ineffective. Thus, the US stance was that a state may lose its rights under international law {{if it does not}} maintain a consistent maritime policy (for instance, if a nation were to assert an excessive <b>maritime</b> <b>claim</b> and the US avoided operating its ships and aircraft in the disputed area, the US inaction would eventually contribute to the emergence of new customary international law).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{losing its}} {{maritime}} coast, the so-called Litoral Department, after the War of the Pacific, Bolivia has historically maintained, {{as a state}} policy, a <b>maritime</b> <b>claim</b> {{to that part of}} Chile; the claim asks for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and its maritime space. The issue has also been presented before the Organization of American States; in 1979, the OAS passed the 426 Resolution, which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem. On 4 April 1884, a truce was signed with Chile, whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through Antofagasta, and freed the payment of export rights in the port of Arica. In October 1904, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed, and Chile agreed to build a railway between Arica and La Paz, to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports.|$|E

In particular, the traditional dependence on normal low water baselines as the starting point for measuring <b>maritime</b> <b>claims</b> is problematic given the likely retreat of normal baselines inland as sea levels rise.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the most important}} questions concerning the temporary arrest of seagoing ships through solutions given in the existing international conventions. Special attention {{is given to the}} changes contained in the International Convention on Arrest of Ships of 1999 that came into force on 14 September, 2011, compared to the previous Convention of 1952. The basic approach to the principle of temporary arrest of ships remained unchanged according to the Convention of 1999 compared to the 1952 Convention. Still, temporary arrest of ships can only be effected for <b>maritime</b> <b>claims.</b> Having in mind that the 1999 Convention increases the number of <b>maritime</b> <b>claims</b> in relation to the Convention of 1952, and in a way that certain <b>maritime</b> <b>claims</b> that were previously considered claims for purely business relationship, for which creditors {{had not been able to}} enjoy the protection relating to arrest of the ship, are deemed to be <b>maritime</b> <b>claims.</b> Changes were also made to the right of re-arrest and multiple arrest of the ship. Convention of 1999 does not greatly alter the existing international regulations as established by the previous Convention, but attempts to additionally specify certain solutions contained in both the Conventions, in terms of their improvement and modernization...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Reconciling the {{conflicting}} {{interests of the}} maritime claimants and shipowners {{has always been a}} controversial issue in the domain of Admiralty Law. [...] . (a) The person who owned the ship at the time when the <b>maritime</b> <b>claim</b> arose is liable for the claim and is owner of the ship when the arrest is effected; or(b) the demise charterer of the ship at the time when the <b>maritime</b> <b>claim</b> arose is liable for the claim and is demise charterer or owner of the ship when the arrest is effected. [...] . Where the <b>maritime</b> <b>claim</b> is in respect of ownership or possession of a ship, sister ship arrest is not permissible under either of the conventions. [...] . In modern shipping practice, many fleets operate within large shipowning groups, owned and controlled by the same parent corporation or holding company, but with each vessel in the fleet or group legally owned by (in other words, registered in the name of) a separate one-ship company.

40|$|Opportunities {{may arise}} to arrest a ship in {{maritime}} zones beyond internal waters, e. g. in the territorial {{sea and the}} exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This paper examines the possibilities for arrest in those areas {{on the basis of}} jurisdiction ratione loci and ratione materiae. Under Belgian law the territorial sea {{is not part of the}} State's territory; accordingly, the Belgian Judicial Code does not provide for an attachment judge nor a bailiff to have jurisdiction in this area and a fortiori in the EEZ. The law of April 22, 1999 solved the problem of territorial jurisdiction in this respect. As far as a ship's arrest in the EEZ is concerned, it is not clear whether the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (articles 73 and 220) combined with the requirement of a <b>maritime</b> <b>claim,</b> allows for an arrest at all.
