5|$|Some {{computer}} forecast models initially {{predicted that}} the storm would move towards South Carolina or Georgia. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, researchers at Clemson University used Bonnie to test a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the damage a storm is likely to cause. In the state, the South Carolina National Guard put about 1,512 men on active duty, 1,474 being of the Army National Guard. On August 25, the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division activated Level 1 operations, the highest of five levels. That same day, the State Governor declared a State of Emergency, calling for mandatory evacuations of residents east of U.S. Route 17 in Horry and Georgetown counties. Schools were closed throughout the state. Over 200,000 people were evacuated from those counties, of which 120,000 were tourists. About 6,000 sought shelter at schools in Horry County. In a survey, 12% of respondents in the state took traffic as a significant consideration in deciding if they should evacuate. On the Grand Strand, Bonnie was the first storm where buses were provided to help people evacuate.|$|E

25|$|The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> {{the ratio}} of the number of {{favourable}} cases to the whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a paper written in 1779.

The latter is therefore called the probability-generating function of the former. Laplace then shows how, by means of interpolation, these coefficients may be determined from the generating function. Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a finite difference equation.|$|E

The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the numbers differed between the third and fourth surveys, though; if the third estimate were to be revised, there would have been an estimated 108–118 Iriomote cats at the time, meaning that the population is shrinking over time.|$|E

Secondly, {{the production of}} bone {{may not have been}} continuous in areas near the extremities of limbs– in allosaur skeketons lines of arrested growth ("LAGs"; rather like growth rings) are sparse or absent in large limb bones but common in the fingers and toes. While there is no absolute proof that LAGs are temperature-related, they could mark times when the extremities were so cool that the bones ceased to grow. If so, the data about oxygen isotope ratios would be incomplete, especially for times when the extremities were coolest. Oxygen isotope ratios may be an unreliable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> temperatures if it cannot be shown that bone growth was equally continuous {{in all parts of the}} animal.|$|E
25|$|Phylogenetic trees {{composed}} with a nontrivial number of input sequences {{are constructed using}} computational phylogenetics methods. Distance-matrix methods such as neighbor-joining or UPGMA, which calculate genetic distance from multiple sequence alignments, are simplest to implement, but do not invoke an evolutionary model. Many sequence alignment methods such as ClustalW also create trees by using the simpler algorithms (i.e. those based on distance) of tree construction. Maximum parsimony is another simple <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> phylogenetic trees, but implies an implicit model of evolution (i.e. parsimony). More advanced methods use the optimality criterion of maximum likelihood, often within a Bayesian Framework, and apply an explicit model of evolution to phylogenetic tree estimation. Identifying the optimal tree using many of these techniques is NP-hard, so heuristic search and optimization methods are used in combination with tree-scoring functions to identify a reasonably good tree that fits the data.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} optimal health range {{is a lack}} of a {{standard}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the ranges. The limits may be defined as those where the health risks exceed a certain threshold, but with various risk profiles between different measurements (such as folate and vitamin D), and even different risk aspects for one and the same measurement (such as both deficiency and toxicity of vitamin A) it is difficult to standardize. Subsequently, optimal health ranges, when given by various sources, have an additional variability caused by various definitions of the parameter. Also, as with standard reference ranges, there should be specific ranges for different determinants that affects the values, such as sex, age etc. Ideally, there should rather be an estimation of what is the optimal value for every individual, when taking all significant factors of that individual into account - a task that may be hard to achieve by studies, but long clinical experience by a physician may make this method more preferable than using reference ranges.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Civil Aviation Act aircraft in flight are specifically exempted from trespass and nuisance controls, which denies any form of redress to those living near airports who are disturbed by noise. Government sanctioned measurements of noise near airports take an average sound level, measured in decibels (dB), over a 16‑hour day, and are expressed as an LAeq figure. Officially, 57dB LAeq is the threshold at which noise levels become disturbing, 63dB LAeq represents moderate disturbance, whilst 69dB LAeq represents high disturbance. Technological improvements in aircraft design means that aircraft are becoming quieter. Taking Heathrow as an example, between 1990 and 2004 the area around the airport affected by noise levels of 57 db LAeq and above fell by 60 per cent, whilst the number of people similarly affected fell by 51 per cent. Campaign groups dispute the methodology used to measure noise, asserting that it is flawed in a number of ways. Amongst other issues they point to the World Health Organisation view that annoyance begins at 50 db LAeq whilst serious annoyance begins at 55dB LAeq, and they assert that the LAeq measurement does not give sufficient weight to the increasing incidence of noise events. Their conclusion is that noise levels, and the number of people affected, have increased rather than decreased. This is borne out by the latest survey of attitudes to noise published in November 2007 which reports that, compared with over 20years ago, more people today are annoyed by the same level of noise as measured by LAeq. Whilst this may be attributable to changing attitudes, the report concludes that the contribution of aircraft numbers to annoyance has increased, and that an alternative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> levels of annoyance that takes this into account would appear to be more relevant than the LAeq measurement.

The wetness index is derived from TOPMODEL, a hillslope-scale runoff simulation model. The wetness index is a distributed-parameter model, with the input parameters obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) and Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soils data. The primary objectives of the research are to: (1) compare <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> soil parameters for input into the wetness potential model; and (2) determine how the model outputs vary spatially as a consequence <b>of</b> different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> soil parameters. Three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> soil parameters are used: (a) assuming uniform soil properties; (b) using SCS data presented as ranges; and (c) using alternative literature-based <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> soil parameters. Results indicate that the wetness model responds similarly regardless of how the soil parameters are estimated, but differences in the spatial variability of the wetness potentials occur as a result <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> soil parameters through alternative approaches.

2500|$|PR-STV {{provides}} proportionality by transferring {{votes to}} minimise waste of votes, and therefore also minimises {{the number of}} unrepresented voters. In this way PR-STV provides Droop proportionality - an example STV election using the Droop quota method for 9 seats and with no exhausted preferences would guarantee representation to every distinct group of 10% of the voters, with at most just under 10% of the vote being wasted as unneeded excess. Unlike other proportional representation methods employing party lists, voters in STV do not explicitly state their preferred political party (with the exception where above-the-line voting systems are in place); this in turn can create some difficulty when attempting to analyse how an STV election's results compare with the nationwide partisan makeup. One common <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the party identification of voters is to assume their top-preference on their ballot represents a candidate from their preferred party, however this method of estimation is made more complicated {{by the possibility of}} independent candidates and of cross-party voting.

In Victoria, Australia, it is possible to make a direct comparison between the Australian Senate election and the Victorian Upper House elections although individual circumstance will always exist.
