40|$|The use of {{discrete}} limited dependent variable (LDV) models such as logit and probit is becoming ubiquitous in empirical management research. When using such models, researchers frequently postulate and test {{that the relationship}} between an explanatory variable and the dependent variable is <b>moderated</b> by another variable by including in the model an interaction variable. While recent papers clarify the methods for deriving and analyzing a <b>moderating</b> effect in LDV models, it is not widely understood or appreciated that this <b>moderating</b> effect confounds two <b>moderating</b> effects: one that arises from including an interaction variable in the model and one that arises naturally from the inherent nonlinearity of such models. This paper addresses this issue and presents a method to separate these two sources of a <b>moderating</b> effect for a general class of nonlinear models that includes all the LDV models commonly used in the management literature. Given this, the paper demonstrates that the statistically correct method to assess the validity of a <b>moderating</b> hypothesis in such models is not, as currently recommended, to test for significance of the <b>moderating</b> effect derived from the model that includes the interaction variable but is instead to test for significance of the difference between two <b>moderating</b> effects: that arising from the model that includes the interaction variable and arising from the model that excludes the interaction variable; this difference is the secondary <b>moderating</b> effect. The result that the secondary <b>moderating</b> effect is properly the focus of analysis for testing a <b>moderating</b> hypothesis is very general, in that it applies whenever a <b>moderating</b> hypothesis is to be tested by including an interaction variable in any model, whether linear or nonlinear.

40|$|AbstractThe major {{purpose of}} this article is to expand the domain of the {{business}} research by providing conceptual analysis of the <b>moderating</b> and mediating variables and exploring their potent effects in business research. To provide specific implications, Kang et al. (2015) model with respect to Balanced Scorecard technique is conceptually extended. Theoretical foundation of the <b>moderating,</b> mediating, and their major distinctions along with appropriate statistical tests applicable to each situation are also provided. The model is also extended to analyzing interaction effects of Mediated-Moderation and Moderated-Mediation designs and their testing. The article concludes that: 1) the nature of complex business problems will be more transparently captured by considering <b>moderating</b> and mediating variables, 2) without specifying <b>moderating</b> and mediating variables, business models are incomplete and therefore are not able to solve real business obstacles. Lack of inclusion of <b>moderating</b> and mediating effects is one viable reason which indicates why most business models do not function in real practice, 3) <b>moderating</b> and mediating variables are widening the scope of the prevalent business theories, and 4) <b>moderating</b> and <b>moderating</b> variables makes it possible to respond to the inquiries regarding “when” “how” and “why” a particular relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables. Hence, this study posits great impacts in future correlational and experimental studies in business...|$|R
