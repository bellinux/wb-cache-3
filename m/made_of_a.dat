5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They are <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flaky dough {{in a variety}} of shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E

5|$|Carnivàle: The Complete First Season was {{released}} as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on December 7, 2004, {{one month before}} the premiere of the second season. It was distributed by HBO Home Video and contained three audio commentaries and a behind-the-scenes featurette. The outer slipcover of the Region 1 set was <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thick cardboard to mimic a bound book. The same set {{was released}} with less elaborate packaging in Region 2 on March 7, 2005, and in Region 4 on May 11, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E

5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E

5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety of materials. In most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of}} a rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) is a {{composite}} material or fiber-reinforced plastic <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers.

5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of Puck. It is probably <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mixture of water ice with the dark material similar to that found in the rings. This dark material is probably made of rocks or radiation-processed organics. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E
5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> polyester mesh, {{which does not}} trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E
5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single, solid {{piece of}} wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It {{is a hard}} round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E
