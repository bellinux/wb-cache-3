2500|$|SR22s and SR20s {{built before}} 2003 were {{equipped}} with traditional analog instruments and a 10" [...] <b>Multi-function</b> <b>display</b> (MFD). In February 2003, Cirrus began offering SR22s with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display (PFD), making the plane {{the first of}} its kind to come with a glass cockpit. Later that year, this instrumentation became standard equipment on all SR-series aircraft and helped pioneer the use of glass cockpits in the light general aviation industry. Retrofits are available for the older aircraft that replace the instrument panels with one that includes the PFD, a new MFD and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011 {{the company}} {{indicated}} that the price was being increased to US$149,000. Part of the price increase {{was due to the}} incorporation of optional features as standard, including the <b>multi-function</b> <b>display,</b> intercom and sun visors. About US$20,000 of the increase was to improve company profits on the aircraft. Russ Niles writing for AVweb noted [...] "The new price puts the Skycatcher at {{the upper end of the}} market for LSAs". The 30% price increase attracted aviation media attention. Paul Bertorelli writing for AVweb concluded [...] "Only one thing mystifies me about this decision. Cessna is the only LSA manufacturer well established with manufacturing in China. If a company with Cessna's economy of scale and marketing acumen can't make an LSA more affordable by building it in China, the notion of low-cost aircraft may very well be the myth that many people think it is." ...|$|E
50|$|Most airliners built {{since the}} 1980s — {{as well as}} many {{business}} jets and an increasing number of newer general aviation aircraft — have glass cockpits equipped with primary flight and <b>multi-function</b> <b>displays</b> (MFDs). Cirrus Aircraft was the first general aviation manufacturer to add a PFD to their already existing MFD, which they made standard on their SR-series aircraft in 2003.|$|R
