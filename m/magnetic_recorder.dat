50|$|Tigerstedt {{moved to}} Denmark, where he {{continued}} working on film sound recording devices at the Petersen & Poulsen company. He befriended the Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen (1869-1942), {{who was the}} inventor of the telegraphone steel wire <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder.</b> Tigerstedt, too, had experimented with recording sound on a steel wire. He attempted to transmit speech across the Jutland straits using 30 kHz ultrasound, but the results were not promising. He also experimented with transmitting sound underwater, which was more successful, and he was eventually granted a patent for this process.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was proposed}} {{as early as}} 1878 by Oberlin Smith, who on 4 October 1878 filed, with the U.S. patent office, a caveat regarding the magnetic recording of sound and who published his ideas on the subject in the 8 September 1888 issue of The Electrical World as [...] "Some possible forms of phonograph". [...] By 1898 Valdemar Poulsen had demonstrated a <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> and proposed magnetic tape. Fritz Pfleumer was granted a German patent for a non-magnetic [...] "Sound recording carrier" [...] with a magnetic coating, on 1928-01-31, but it was later overturned {{in favor of an}} earlier US patent by Joseph A. O'Neill.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{storage in}} the form of wire {{recording}}—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of the Electrical World. Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools. The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900) <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> was invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Poulsen's device recorded a signal on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer developed the first magnetic tape recorder. Early magnetic storage devices were designed to record analog audio signals. Computers and now most audio and video magnetic storage devices record digital data.|$|E

5000|$|On September 8, 1888, Smith {{published}} a short note entitled [...] "Some Possible Forms of the Phonograph" [...] in the British journal Electrical World, where he suggested (probably {{for the first}} time) the use of permanent magnetic impressions for the recording of sound. Smith suggested using cotton or silk thread, into which steel dust or short clippings of fine wire could be suspended. These particles were to be magnetized {{in accordance with the}} alternating current from a microphone source. Smith also discussed the possibility of using a hard steel wire, but thought it scarcely possible. A working unit was never built. Many of Smith's ideas were used by Valdemar Poulsen when he developed the first true <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Poniatoff {{was born}} in 1892 in Aysha, Zelenodolsky District, Tatarstan, Russian Empire. He emigrated from Russia to China, where {{he worked for the}} Shanghai Power Company, until he emigrated to the United States in 1927. In 1944 he founded Ampex, using his {{initials}} A.M.P. plus [...] "ex" [...] for [...] "excellence" [...] to create the name. The high-frequency bias technique, which made quality recording possible, was invented by Telefunken engineers and put into practical use by Poniatoff. Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen's original <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> was previously only usable for telephony recording. In 1956, Ampex engineers created the world's first rotary head recorder, the VR-1000 videotape recorder. Poniatoff served as president of Ampex until 1955, when he was elected chairman of the board. He died in 1980.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} nine years most films were made in South India and {{followed}} the conventions of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. Even though it is popularly held that Rekava, made in 1956 by pioneer director Lester James Peries, was the first Sinhala film to be shot completely out of studio, {{it was really the}} film [...] "Gambada Sundari", made in 1950 which was the first film shot outside studios. It was also the first Sri Lankan film where, like in [...] "Rekawa", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm, using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of where the sound was recorded on a Kinevox 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder.</b> The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was screened in Colombo in 1950.|$|E

5000|$|Orr's early {{knowledge}} {{allowed him}} to establish Orradio in 1949. When, after some uncertainty, tape became the standard medium for <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorders,</b> and as other uses such as data storage and videotape appeared, Orradio's sales expanded rapidly in the late 1950s. Orradio produced the first commercially available audio tape, video tape, and computer tape in the world. The company was purchased by a larger competitor, the Ampex Corporation, in 1959 when Ampex decided it was cheaper to own the plant than to keep buying all their tape.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of magnetic tape, <b>magnetic</b> wire <b>recorders</b> had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. Some individuals and organizations developed innovative uses for <b>magnetic</b> wire <b>recorders</b> while others investigated variations of the technology. One particularly important variation was the application of an oxide powder to a long strip of paper. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present day magnetic tape recordings.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring an earthquake, the {{physical}} and the chemical transformations along a slip zone lead to an intense deformation within the gouge layer of a mature fault zone. Because the gouge contains ferromagnetic minerals, it {{has the capacity to}} behave as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> during an earthquake. This constitutes a conceivable way to identify earthquakes slip zones. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic record of the Chelungpu fault gouge that hosts the principal slip zone of the Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw 7. 6, 1999, Taiwan) using Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project core samples. Rock magnetic investigation pinpoints the location of the Chi-Chi mm-thick principal slip zone within the 16 -cm thick gouge at ~ 1 km depth. A modern magnetic dipole of Earth magnetic field is recovered throughout this gouge but not in the wall rocks nor in the two other adjacent fault zones. This magnetic record resides essentially in two magnetic minerals; magnetite in the principal slip zone, and neoformed goethite elsewhere in the gouge. We propose a model where magnetic record: 1) is preserved during inter-seismic time, 2) is erased during co-seismic time and 3) is imprinted during post-seismic time when fluids cooled down. We suggest that the identification of a stable magnetic record carried by neoformed goethite may be a signature of friction-heating process in seismic slip zone...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDynamic {{crystallization}} {{experiments are}} conducted under {{a magnetic field}} to determine both magnetic and mineralogical properties of chondrules. The experiment reproduced synthetic dusty olivine samples that were formed by a high temperature reduction of an initially fayalitic olivine. Backscattered-electron microscopy observations confirmed that synthetic dusty olivine contains abundant fine, submicron-sized Ni-poor Fe inclusions in the cores of MgO-rich olivine grains, {{similar to that in}} natural chondrules. Alternating field demagnetization experiments of dusty olivine samples indicate mean destructive fields of up to 80 mT, suggesting the submicron-sized Fe inclusions are a carrier of stable remanence. In natural chondrules, fine Fe inclusions in the dusty olivine may have been armored against chemical alteration by surrounding host olivine crystals. Since the fine Fe inclusions were probably heated above the Curie temperature during the last chondrule forming events, the fine Fe inclusions in dusty olivine can acquire thermal remanent magnetization during the chondrule formation event. Theoretical time–temperature relation of such fine-grained Fe (kamacite) grains suggested that a paleomagnetic data observed above 490 °C in thermal demagnetization experiments of dusty olivines is reliable despite the low-grade metamorphism of unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (e. g., LL 3. 0). Therefore, the presence of fine Fe inclusions in dusty olivine in unequilibrated ordinary chondrites constrains that such dusty olivine in chondrules is a good candidate as an un-altered and stable <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> of the early solar magnetic field...|$|E
