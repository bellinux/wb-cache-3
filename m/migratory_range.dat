50|$|Shorthead redhorse {{have a wide}} habitat range. They live {{in fresh}} water and are found in streams, lakes and rivers. Shorthead redhorse can {{tolerate}} clear to cloudy water and likes loose substrate like gravel and sand. These fish are benthic feeders that like to feed in riffles and rifle margins. During a study done in Illinois by Sule et al., they found that “shorthead redhorse consumed items from approximately 60 food categories, primarily invertebrate taxa”. Twenty-four to sixty-eight percent of their diet was unidentified when stomach contents were analyzed. Also found, 21-50% of the unidentified matter, or 13% of their total diet, was organic matter. Shorthead redhorse eat the most insects {{out of all the}} fish in the sucker family. They can also eat microcrustacea and plant matter. Predators of shorthead redhorse vary depending on size. Juveniles can be eaten by northern pike, walleyes, and smallmouth bass. Adult or larger shorthead redhorse are eaten by northern pike and muskellunge. The shorthead redhorse does not actively compete for food. Because of their wide range of prey and eating the most vertebrates of all the suckers, {{they do not have a}} competitor. Humans impact shorthead redhorse habitat. The construction of dams blocked free flowing rivers like the Mississippi in which they live, disrupting their spawning migration routes. Shorthead redhorse are killed easily by pollutants in the water. “The upstream <b>migratory</b> <b>range</b> of shorthead redhorse in a Maryland river decreased due to an increase in chlorinated sewage outfalls”. Factory pollutants are dumped into streams or rivers and will settle onto the bottom. Because such a large portion of the shorthead redhorse’s diet is sediment, it ingests high concentrations of the chemicals and can die.|$|E

40|$|Across Europe, rapid {{population}} declines are ongoing in many Afro-Palaearctic migratory bird species, but {{the development of}} appropriate conservation actions across such large <b>migratory</b> <b>ranges</b> is severely constrained by {{lack of understanding of}} the demographic drivers of these declines. By constructing regional integrated population models (IPMs) for one of the suite of migratory species that is declining in the south-east of Britain but increasing in the north-west, we show that, while annual population growth rates in both regions vary with adult survival, the divergent regional trajectories are primarily a consequence of differences in productivity. Between 1994 and 2012, annual survival and productivity rates ranged over similar levels in both regions, but high productivity rates were rarer in the declining south-east population and never coincided with high survival rates. By contrast, population growth in the north-west was fuelled by several years in which higher productivity coincided with high survival rates. Simulated population trajectories suggest that realistic improvements in productivity could have reversed the decline (i. e. recovery of the population index to ≥ 1) in the south-east. Consequently, actions to improve productivity on European breeding grounds are likely to be a more fruitful and achievable means of reversing migrant declines than actions to improve survival on breeding, passage or sub-Saharan wintering grounds...|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{researchers}} {{have speculated that}} fin whales are year-round residents in the Sea of Cortez (= Gulf of California). Previous work by Berube and co-workers {{has shown that the}} degree of genetic diversity among fin whales in the Sea of Cortez at nuclear and mitochondrial loci is highly reduced. However, the relatively unobstructed connection with the North Pacific Ocean argues that Sea of Cortez fin whales are part of a much larger eastern North Pacific population given the extensive <b>migratory</b> <b>ranges</b> observed in fin whales and baleen whales in general. The low degree of genetic variation might thus simply be due to historic fluctuations in the effective population size of an eastern North Pacific population. In order to test if the reduced genetic variation detected among fin whales in the Sea of Cortez is due to small population size or a past bottleneck in an otherwise large eastern North Pacific population, we analyzed the geographic distribution of genetic variation at a single mitochondrial (control region) and 16 nuclear loci in samples collected from fin whales in the eastern North Pacific (n = 12) as well as the Sea of Cortez (n = 77). Our results showed that fin whales observed in the Sea of Cortez constitute a highly isolated and thus evolutionary unique population, which warrants special conservation measures given the current low estimate of abundance of approximately 400 individuals...|$|R
40|$|African savannas {{are complex}} socio-ecological systems with diverse wild and {{domestic}} herbivore assemblages, which adapt spatially to intra- and interannual variation in forage quantity and quality, predation and disease risks. As African savannas become increasingly fragmented by growing human populations and their associated ecological impacts, adaptive foraging options for wild and domestic herbivore populations are correspondingly limited, resulting in declining wildlife populations and impoverished pastoral societies. In addition, competition for grazing by expanding domestic herbivore populations threatens {{the viability of}} wild herbivore populations occupying similar grazing niches. Conservation initiatives are further impacted by conflicts between wildlife and local communities of people who often receive little benefit from adjacent protected areas, creating conflict between the livelihood-orientated goals of communities and the conservation-oriented goals {{of the international community}} and those with vested interests in wildlife. Conservation strategies facilitating the alignment of these opposing goals of communities and conservationists are needed. Synthesis and applications. Key to understanding facilitative and competitive interactions between wild and domestic herbivores are the concepts of niche differentiation and functional resource heterogeneity. Uncontrolled incursions of burgeoning domestic herbivore populations into protected areas (PAs) threaten the conservation of wild herbivore biodiversity. However, domestic herbivores can be managed to minimize competition with wild herbivores and to enhance habitat by maximizing grassland structural heterogeneity (greater adaptive foraging options), creation of nutrient hotspots in the landscape and facilitation of high-quality grazing. Ecosystem service benefits to communities through controlled access to grazing resources in PAs, associated with appropriate disease management, can provide a conservation payment to promote communities' support of conservation of key wildlife <b>migratory</b> <b>ranges</b> and corridors outside PAs.

40|$|When species occupy {{habitats}} {{that vary}} in quality, choice of habitat can be critical in determining individual fitness.

Using a unique dataset of marked black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa islandica) tracked throughout their <b>migratory</b> <b>range,</b> combined with analyses of stable carbon isotope ratios, we show that those individuals that occupy higher quality breeding sites also use higher quality winter sites. This seasonal matching can severely inflate inequalities in individual fitness. This population has expanded {{over the last century}} into poorer quality breeding and winter habitats and, across the whole population; individual birds tend to occupy either novel or traditional sites in both seasons. Winter and breeding season habitat selection are thus strongly linked throughout this population; these links have profound implications {{for a wide range of}} population and evolutionary processes. As adult godwits are highly philopatric, the initial choice of winter habitat by juveniles will be critical in determining future survival, timing of migration and breeding success...|$|E

To better understand turtle migrations and identify with whom the Aboriginal people of north-east Arnhem Land (Yolngu) share turtles, we used satellite telemetry to track the migration routes of 20 green turtles (Chelonia mydas) departing from a nesting beach similar to 45 km south of Nhulunbuy, north-east Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. All tracked turtles remained within the Gulf of Carpentaria. These results suggest that the foraging habitat for adults of this nesting population may be largely confined to the Gulf, offering an optimistic scenario for green turtle conservation. Given these results and the critical role Indigenous people play in conserving and managing marine turtles, we recommend that a formal network of indigenous communities be established as the foundation of a community-based turtle-management strategy for the Gulf of Carpentaria region...|$|E

40|$|Migratory {{species can}} travel tens of {{thousands}} of kilometers each year, spending different parts of their annual cycle in geographically distinct locations. Understanding the drivers of population change is vital for conserving migratory species, yet the challenge of collecting data over entire geographic ranges has hindered attempts to identify the processes leading to observed population changes. Here, we use remotely sensed environmental data and bird count data to investigate the factors driving variability in abundance in two subspecies of a long-distance migratory shorebird, the bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica. We compiled a spatially and temporally explicit dataset of three environmental variables to identify the conditions experienced by each subspecies in each stage of their annual cycle (breeding, non-breeding and staging). We used a Bayesian N-mixture model to analyze 18 years of monthly count data from 21 sites across Australia and New Zealand in relation to the remote sensing data. We found that the abundance of one subspecies L. l. menzbieri in their non-breeding range was related to climate conditions in breeding grounds, and detected sustained population declines between 1995 and 2012 in both subspecies (L. l. menzbieri, - 6. 7 % and L. l. baueri, - 2. 1 % year). To investigate the possible causes of the declines, we quantified changes in habitat extent at 22 migratory staging sites in the Yellow Sea, East Asia, over a 25 -year period and found - 1. 7 % and - 1. 2 % year loss of habitat at staging sites used by L. l. menzbieri and L. l baueri, respectively.

The fact that ASEAN countries bordering these waters are highly depended upon marine fisheries as the main source of revenue, employment, and food security, it is crucial for them to address these fisheries problems. This is especially the case with respect to the management and conservation of commercially important shared pelagic fish stacks, particularly in the South China Sea and Celebes Sea As the spatial <b>migratory</b> <b>range</b> of these stock transcends across many politically draw maritime zones of littoral States, it is highly impossible for one State, acting independently, would be able to manage these fisheries effectively within its own national jurisdiction Perhaps the best approach in dealing with this problem is through collective management and conservation of fish stocks.

BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is the most significant threat to global public health and ascertaining the role wild birds play in the epidemiology of resistance is critically important. This study investigated the prevalence of AMR Gram-negative bacteria among long-distance migratory East Canadian High Arctic (ECHA) light-bellied Brent geese found wintering on the east coast of Ireland. FINDINGS: In this study a number of bacterial species were isolated from cloacal swabs taken from ECHA light-bellied Brent geese. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified five species of Gram-negative bacteria; the dominant isolated species were Pantoea spp. (n[*]=[*] 5) followed by Buttiauxella agrestis (n[*]=[*] 2). Antimicrobial susceptibility disk diffusion results identified four of the Pantoea spp. strains, and one of the Buttiauxella agrestis strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first record of AMR bacteria isolated from long distance migratory ECHA light-bellied Brent geese. This indicates that this species may act as reservoirs and potential disseminators of resistance genes into remote natural ecosystems across their <b>migratory</b> <b>range.</b> This population of geese frequently forage (and defecate) on public amenity areas during the winter months presenting a potential human health risk.

40|$|To improve {{survival}} and reproductive success, many fish species have evolved migratory life-histories, showing ontogenetic and/or seasonal changes in habitat use. Individuals move between different areas, {{each of which}} is ‘best’ for a particular activity, such as feeding, growing or spawning. The benefits of moving to a different habitat, however, have to be balanced against the costs of migration, so any behaviour that reduces the cost of movement would be expected to expand the <b>migratory</b> <b>range</b> and thereby increase the range of habitats that can be exploited. Previous tracking experiments in the southern North Sea have shown that plaice selectively exploit the tidal streams to aid their spawning migration. Here we examine whether this behaviour is primarily (1) an energy-saving strategy, or (2) a transport mechanism by which fish that are unable to navigate over long distances can be carried reliably between feeding and spawning grounds. Because selective tidal stream transport requires that fish remain stationary on the sea-bed during the ‘non-transporting’ tide, energetic calculations predict that this behaviour is beneficial only when the current speed exceeds a critical, size-dependent, value. We have used detailed information about migratory behaviour from individual fish to calculate the metabolic costs and the likely reproductive benefits of different migratory strategies. Our results show that plaice use selective tidal stream transport only in areas where the tidal streams are suitably fast, indicating that this behaviour is primarily an energy saving strategy...|$|E
