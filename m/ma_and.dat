5|$|Deinosuchus {{was present}} {{on both sides}} of the Western Interior Seaway.

A Deinosuchus osteoderm from the San Carlos Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern Mexico. Deinosuchus fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of Deinosuchus were found in rocks dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period.

40|$|Abstract: Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac are government-sponsored {{enterprises}} that {{play a central}} role in U. S. residential mortgage markets. In recent years, policymakers became increasingly concerned about the size and risk-taking incentives of these two institutions. In September 2008, the federal government intervened to stabilize Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac in an effort to ensure the reliability of residential mortgage finance in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. This paper describes the sources of financial distress at Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac, outlines the measures taken by the federal government, and presents some evidence about the effectiveness of these actions. Looking ahead, policymakers will need to consider the future of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac as well as the appropriate scope of public sector activities in primary and secondary mortgage markets.
