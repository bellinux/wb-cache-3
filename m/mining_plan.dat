40|$|Valuable {{data for}} {{geotechnical}} interpretation and integration into effective Australian underground <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> may often be available, yet {{is not always}} fully appreciated or utilised, particularly {{in the early stages}} of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> or in due diligence studies. There may be considerable benefits associated with early prioritisation of geotechnical evaluation and impact on <b>mine</b> <b>planning.</b> Unidentified, misinterpreted, or ill-defined adverse geological and related geotechnical resource characteristics can pose significant business risk to underground coal projects and operations. Preliminary resource definition in the early conceptual <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> stages attributes significant focus (entirely warranted) on resource quality and structural geology constraints. Yet detailed geotechnical data analysis and interpretation, which may have a substantial down stream impact and sensitivity with respect to future <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> strategies, at times is given lower priority, or scoped and resourced in the later stages of a bankable feasibility study. Through extensive <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> experience and observation of downstream process impacts, it has been found there is often data available for geotechnical analysis that does not readily stand out or is not adequately understood or utilised, available at the early (conceptual) stages of <b>mine</b> <b>planning.</b> Part of the issue may be that exploration geologists are not necessarily experienced geotechnical engineers and do not necessarily recognise or understand all important parameters. Subject to appropriate application of experienced professionals data can be manipulated to provide key geotechnical hazard assessment at minimal cost, and provide a framework for understanding and optimising the <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process. Although there is no single prescribed strategy for resource evaluation from a geotechnical perspective, potential business risks and mitigation approaches can and should be adopted at the conceptual <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> stage. There has been a recent focus in the metals industry to provide a reporting framework for geotechnical classification of mining projects. This paper outlines the strategies and gives examples of key analyses adopted in <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> and discusses the relative merits of adopting a reporting framework as a tool for geotechnical classification in <b>mine</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Mine</b> <b>planning</b> {{software}} has {{and continues}} {{to contribute to the}} development of the South African mining industry. As <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software usage continues to be more widespread, it is imperative that a methodology to evaluate <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software utilisation for enhanced decision-making strategies in South Africa is established. An existing online database available on the website link [URL] was developed prior to this study in September 2012 (initial data collection date). However, the database only acted as a snapshot of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software data repository and lacked a framework to evaluate utilisation of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software in the South African mining industry. In this thesis, a methodology was developed to measure the utilisation of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software to enhance decision-making strategies in the South African mining industry. The methodology for the evaluation of utilisation of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software in various commodity sectors was developed on the basis of three variables, namely, commodity, functionality, and time factor, as a key evaluation criteria. Even though the calculations can be done on any commodity in a similar manner, in this research, calculations were only performed on four different commodities, namely coal, diamond, gold and platinum group metals which are the most significant minerals in South Africa. Six functionalities namely Geological Data Management, Geological Modelling and Resource Estimation, Design and Layout, Scheduling, Financial Valuation and Optimisation were applied on the four different commodities using two different time-stamps (September 2012 and April 2014). The following software providers availed information that was used to populate the database: Geovia, MineRP Solutions, Sable, RungePincockMinarco, Maptek, Cyest Technology and CAE Mining. Note that the CAE Mining data was only made available in April 2014 (second data collection date). However, the results indicated that the market leaders in terms of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software utilisation in South Africa differs, depending on the commodity that is being mined as well as the functionality that is being used. In addition, this thesis also proposed a framework to estimate the future use of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software on an evolving dataset by considering the fact that the database will be continually updated in the future. By using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), specifically supervised learning, time-series analyses were performed. Results from the time-series analyses were used to establish the framework for estimating the future use of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software utilisation in the South African mining industry. By using this newly developed framework, utilisation of the various <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software was measured leading to the formulation of different decision-making strategies for the various <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software stakeholders. By using this newly developed framework to estimate and measure <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software utilisation, and proposing a framework for time-series analyses on an evolving dataset, this thesis serves a number of beneficiaries; firstly, the South African mining industry to position themselves better by acquiring optimal combination of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software that is being used in South Africa so that they can improve their production levels, secondly, tertiary education institutions and mining consulting firms which make use of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software, and lastly, the aforementioned software providers by strategically positioning themselves in a limited <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software market.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} for underground <b>mine</b> <b>plans</b> {{to be created}} sequentially, where results from one planning process form the input data for another. While this is practical for manual methods, computerized optimization techniques should consider an integrated approach to creating the global <b>mine</b> <b>plan.</b> This is because optimizing an individual <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process, such as stope layouts, introduces a likelihood of increasing costs or decreasing revenues associated with other areas, such as production scheduling, as harmful decisions must be balanced. Considering the interaction and influence that individual underground <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> processes have on each other during optimization will provide more profitable results than if these are ignored. Optimization techniques for stope layouts and production scheduling are reviewed. An integer programming model is proposed that allows for either integrated or isolated optimization.

40|$|Underground mining has {{occurred}} in the Illawarra region for more than 150 years. Over time, community expectations about the environmental effects of mining and other developments have changed dramatically. It is in this context that community, government, and environmental groups have raised concerns about the effects that mining can have on rivers and other natural features, residential property, and infrastructure, such as transmission lines, roads, and bridges. On natural features, these effects can include fracturing of the rock bedding in the river, water loss to the shallow sub-strata, gas release, rock falls, and vegetation dieback. In the past, <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> has considered potential effects on engineered structures, however, the same attention has not been paid to the effects of mining on natural features. Through a Stakeholder Involvement Programme conducted by Illawarra Coal, it was identified that government and community stakeholders were seeking a more sensitive approach be taken to <b>mine</b> <b>planning,</b> particularly in significant and high risks areas. As a result, <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> processes are being reviewed {{to take into account the}} effects of mining on the surface features. The focus of this paper is the programme undertaken by BHP Billiton – Illawarra Coal to integrate environmental assessments into <b>mine</b> <b>planning.</b> This has involved internal workshops and projects, together with external consultation. The process that the company is utilising to fully incorporate environmental assessments into the <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process is described. The purpose of this process is to identify surface features, determine their sensitivity, develop mitigation and remediation options, and potentially avoidance measures early in the <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process. Another key aspect of the process is to incorporate internal and external stakeholder feedback as part of the <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process. In implementing this process, it is anticipated that it will provide a more secure outcome for the business. This is expected to occur through understanding and addressing environmental issues and incorporating stakeholder feedback early in the <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process, therefore minimizing the risk of costly changes to <b>mine</b> <b>plans</b> being required within short time frames. The rigorous Integrated <b>Mine</b> <b>Planning</b> Process (IMPP) will give the business confidence that the <b>mine</b> <b>plan</b> submitted through the Subsidence Management Plan (SMP) application to government has the highest probability of approval and will provide the most sustainable outcome – for the environment, community, and Illawarra Coal...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modern <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> {{software}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the operation of many of the world’s mining operations and projects. <b>Mine</b> <b>planning</b> software provides the mining industry with a fast, accurate, cost effective and efficient tool in order to manage their business interests worldwide. Every aspect of the mining industry is today using some form of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> software. From exploration to rehabilitation, the use of software is becoming more and more widespread. <b>Mine</b> <b>planning</b> software companies are constantly under pressure to evolve products to meet new challenges and solve new problems. Development of software is a result of both programming foresight and reaction to industry demands. Without mining industry feedback, many of the products now available would probably not have been developed.

40|$|Best {{practise}} {{environmental and}} social processes for mine closure {{at the time of}} decommissioning are well documented; however mine closure is often not given the recognition that it warrants during early <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> phases. While it is recognised that mine closure and its associated costs need to be fully incorporated into the life of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process, it is often not {{to the extent that it}} should be. This paper seeks to quantify the value that may be lost if closure planning is not adequately considered in life of <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> and the difference in the <b>mine</b> <b>plan</b> between scenarios that adequately consider closure costs and those that do not. To demonstrate this, a case study is introduced for the purpose of investigating the effect of mine closure on various aspects of the mine design of a two dimensional copper deposit. Results indicate that mining operations may benefit from an altered <b>mine</b> <b>plan</b> whereby <b>mine</b> life is extended due to the time value of money aspect associated with closure. In addition to increasing the Net Present Value (NPV), the other significant finding is that this may also significantly improve resource recovery for minimal additional environmental disruption. It is demonstrated that mine closure needs to be incorporated as part of the optimal <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process from the very outset. It is also suggested that orebody characteristics such as size, shape, grade and dip are key variables in the closure cost/mine <b>plan</b> relationship. <b>Mine</b> closure and its associated costs need to be incorporated into the <b>mine</b> <b>planning</b> process to thus play a significant role in determining the ultimate pit limit, pushback design, production schedule, mine life, resource recovery and ultimately the profitability and NPV of an operation...|$|R
