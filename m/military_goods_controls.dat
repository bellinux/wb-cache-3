The model enables us to probe the effect of comparative advantage in providing public goods. By applying the model to the United States-Japan alliance, we find that {{within the framework of}} the alliance the United States will specialize in the provision of <b>military</b> <b>goods,</b> while Japan will specialize in foreign aid; that is, the United States has a comparative advantage in the provision of <b>military</b> <b>goods,</b> and Japan in foreign aid.

40|$|Objective: This study {{set out to}} {{find the}} level of {{glycaemic}} control amongst persons with diabetes mellitus in Benin City. Methods: Forty two persons with diabetes had their glycaemic control assessed by measuring the level of their glycated hae-moglobin. Other data collected included age, sex, duration of diabetes, type of diabetes, weight, height, body mass index and waist hip ratio. Results: There were twenty four males and eighteen females in the study population. Thirty one subjects had type 2 diabetes, while eleven had type 1 diabetes. Nineteen subjects (46 %), had poor glycaemic control (HbAic > 7 %) while twenty three (54 %) had <b>good</b> <b>control</b> (HbAic ͳ 7 %). Thirteen males (54 %) had <b>good</b> <b>control</b> while ten females (53 %) had <b>good</b> <b>control</b> and this was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). Eighteen of the thirty-one type 2 DM subjects (58 %) had <b>good</b> glycaemic <b>control,</b> while five persons out of eleven with type 1 DM (45 %) had <b>good</b> glycaemic <b>control</b> and this was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: This study has shown that poor glycaemic control is common amongst persons with diabetes mellitus in Benin City. Studies have shown that <b>good</b> glycaemic <b>control</b> prevents and delays the complications of diabetes mellitus. We therefore recommend that health education on the benefits of <b>good</b> glycaemic <b>control</b> should be given in diabetes clinics, and ef-forts intensified to achieve target glycated haemoglobin levels to prevent diabetes complications...|$|R
