40|$|Abstract. With {{superheated}} steam, {{there is}} no direct relationship between temperature and pressure, Therefore, at a particular pressure it is possible for superheated steam to exist at a wide range of temperatures higher than that of its saturated steam. The heat transfer coefficient is 1 / 150 - 1 / 250 as much as that of saturated steam during heat transferring, and it takes a relatively long time to cool, during which time the steam is releasing very little energy and transmitted long distances. The mechanisms of superheated steam stimulation are mainly pointed to the performance of crude oil viscosity reduced, flow environment improved, rock wettability changed, oil displacement efficiency improved. Physical simulation shows that oil displacement efficiency by superheated steam is 6 - 12 % higher than that of saturated steam at the same temperature, and under the condition of carrying the same heat, superheated steam enlarged the heating radius by about 10 m, oil steam ratio increased by 0. 7. Superheated steam stimulation was put into Kazakstan’s heavy oil reservoir after two cycles of saturated steam stimulation. The average daily oil production was 2 - 4 times that of saturated steam stimulation, which improved heavy oil production effectively. The secondary heavy oil thermal recovery by superheated steam stimulation applied in <b>marginal</b> heavy <b>oil</b> reservoirs achieved satisfactory effect...|$|R

The study points out the asymmetric effects of oil price shocks; for instance, positive as well as negative oil price shocks significantly increase inflation and also directly increases real national income through higher export earnings, though part of this gain is seen to be offset by losses from lower demand for exports generally due to the economic recession suffered by trading partners.

30|$|Most of the {{previous}} experimental studies reported that CO 2 diffusion mechanism is beyond the increment in oil recovery obtained in laboratory conditions. Then, the observed increment in oil recovery and/or the CO 2 diffusion rate obtained in laboratory conditions were upscaled directly to field scale by using numerical simulation methods. Although modeling of the diffusion effect on ultimate oil recovery in shale reservoirs {{is very important to}} develop these <b>marginal</b> shale <b>oil</b> projects, evaluation of the recovery contribution from diffusion will help in understanding the recovery mechanisms (Wan and Sheng 2015). We think that this direct upscaling methodology is so optimistic due to that the laboratory cores have higher contact area and longer exposure time to CO 2 than what might happen in the real conditions of unconventional reservoirs. As a result, both of previous simulation studies and experimental works might be too optimistic to predict a quick improvement in oil recovery from injecting CO 2 in these tight formations. And, this explains why {{the previous}} simulation studies have a clear gap with CO 2 pilot tests performance. It is true that the molecular mechanism is more dominated in naturally fractured reservoirs due to two main reasons (Da Silva and Belery, 1989): (1) dispersive flux through fractures rapidly increase the contact area for diffusion, (2) this mechanism needs small spacing for natural fractures which is so possible to exist in naturally fractured reservoirs. However, the effective diffusion rate in the reported laboratory conditions is much faster than in the field scale conditions due to the difference in the contact area and the exposure time. This gap in the effective diffusion rates would clearly happen between the laboratory scale and the field scale of shale oil reservoirs.|$|R
