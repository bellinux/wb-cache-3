50|$|In {{the event}} that a study {{requires}} the shoreline position from before aerial photographs, or if the location has poor photographic coverage, historical maps provide an alternative. Many errors are associated with early maps and charts. Such errors {{may be associated with}} scale, datum changes, distortions from uneven shrinkage, stretching, creases, tears and folds, different surveying standards, different publication standards and projection errors. The severity of these errors depends on the accuracy of the map and the physical changes that occurred after it was made. The oldest reliable source of shoreline data in the United States dates is the U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey/National Ocean Service T-sheets and dates to the early-to-mid-19th century.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the MSG-SEVIRI operational snow cover product over Austria. The SEVIRI instrument is aboard the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. The snow cover product provides 32 images per day, with a relatively low spatial resolution of 5 km over Austria. The <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> is examined at 178 stations with daily snow depth observations and compared with the daily MODIS-combined (Terra + Aqua) snow cover product for the period April 2008 –June 2012. The results show that the 15 min temporal sampling allows a significant reduction of clouds in the snow cover product. The mean annual cloud coverage is less than 30 % in Austria, as compared to 52 % for the combined MODIS product. The <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> for cloud-free days is 89 % as compared to 94 % for MODIS. The largest mapping errors are found in regions with large topographical variability. The errors are noticeably larger at stations with elevations that differ greatly from those of the mean MSG-SEVIRI pixel elevations. The median of <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> for stations with absolute elevation difference less than 50 m and more than 500 m is 98. 9 and 78. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|A linkage disequilibrium-based {{method for}} fine mapping {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) {{has been described}} that uses similarity between individuals' marker haplotypes to determine if QTL alleles are identical by descent (IBD) to model covariances among individuals' QTL alleles for a mixed linear model. <b>Mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> with this method {{was found to be}} sensitive to the number of linked markers that was included in the haplotype when fitting the model at a putative position of the QTL. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal haplotype structure for this IBD-based method for fine mapping a QTL in a previously identified QTL region. Haplotypes consisting of 1, 2, 4, 6, or all 10 available markers were fit as a “sliding window” across the QTL region under ideal and nonideal simulated population conditions. It was found that using haplotypes of 4 or 6 markers as a sliding “window” resulted in the greatest <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> under nearly all conditions, although the true IBD state at a putative QTL position was most accurately predicted by IBD probabilities obtained using all markers. Using 4 or 6 markers resulted in greater discrimination of IBD probabilities between positions while maintaining sufficient accuracy of IBD probabilities to detect the QTL. Fitting IBD probabilities on the basis of a single marker resulted in the worst <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> under all conditions because it resulted in poor accuracy of IBD probabilities. In conclusion, for fine mapping using IBD methods, marker information must be used in a manner that results in sensitivity of IBD probabilities to the putative position of the QTL while maintaining sufficient accuracy of IBD probabilities to detect the QTL. Contrary to expectation, use of haplotypes of 4 – 6 markers to derive IBD probabilities, rather than all available markers, best fits these criteria. Thus for populations similar to those simulated here, optimal <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> for this IBD-based fine-mapping method is obtained with a haplotype structure including a subset of all available markers...|$|E
