40|$|While {{the recent}} {{increase}} in computational power gave computers an irreplaceable spot in our lives, humans {{still have to}} rely on their innate capabilities for some tasks that no electronic device can outperform. Those processes strictly linked to survival tasks, like hearing, vision or social interaction are the fields where the human being shows an efficiency that no machine can compare to. Limiting the discussion to the field of shape analysis and recognition, this work takes inspiration from the most influential studies on human perception to demonstrate how our brains perform simple operations that allow us to unambiguously recognize a viewed object, while the current state-of-the-heart algorithms heavily rely on mathematical computations based on data, given by the shape primitives, that are of no use to a human observer. By mimicking human behaviour into the proposed algorithms, the author introduces the paradigm of Perceptual Shape Analysis, obtaining fast and efficient solutions for the main Shape Analysis problems while <b>maintaining</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>independence</b> on the object representation. This new approach is, in the author's opinion, an innovative and fresh point of view that could bring inspiration for the future evolution of the field...|$|E

They were (<b>a)</b> <b>complete</b> <b>independence,</b> (b) assimilation within New Zealand, (c) self-government while remaining associated with New Zealand via citizenship, and (d) membership in a future Polynesian federation. The third option was chosen by the Legislative Assembly of the Cook Islands, and the 1965 election was planned as an intervening election before the arrangements for self-government were finalised. Henry's CIP supported the third option; it campaigned as a party that would implement self-government while maintaining New Zealand citizenship for Cook Islanders.|$|R
