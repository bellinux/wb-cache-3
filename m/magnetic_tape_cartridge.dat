40|$|An {{earthquake}} {{detection and}} recording system known as EARSS {{has been developed}} for permanent seismograph stations and temporary field installations. It records three components of ground motion with a dynamic range of 120 dB. A frequency-domain algorithm detects earth-quakes and initiates the recording of data on magnetic tape. Alterna-tively, EARSS can record data continuously, for preselected periods of time, or recording can be triggered by a time-domain phase picker. Up to 1500 earthquakes (25. 5 Mbytes) can be recorded on each <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The field version of EARSS supplies power to the tape drive only when data is being written to tape, thus reducing the normal power consumption of 12 watts (at 12 volts) to 2. 5 watts. A field trial using a network of eight EARSS seismographs resulted in 1020 successful station-days of operation from a possible total of 1098 station-days (3 years). Of the 78 lost days of operation, 23 were due to power supply problems external to EARSS, and 52 were caused by a low-temperature failure of the recording system, which has since been corrected. A total of 442 Mbytes of data were recorded, of which about 250 Mbytes were useful data...|$|E

40|$|Expensive {{analysis}} {{programs are}} often combined with optimization procedures to solve engineering problems. An optimal solution requires numerous iterations between the analysis program and an optimizer. This often becomes prohibitive due to cost {{and amount of}} computer time needed to converge to an optimal solution. NETS/PROSSS was developed to provide a system for combining NETS (MSC- 21588), a neural network program developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center, and the optimization program CONMIN (Constrained Function Minimization, ARC- 10836) developed at Ames Research Center. After training, NETS approximates {{the results from the}} analysis program, possibly allowing the user to reach a near-optimal solution in much less time than before. These results can then be used as a starting point in a normal optimization process, possibly allowing the user to converge to an optimal solution in significantly fewer iterations.

40|$|Many {{developers}} of software and algorithms for control system design {{have recognized that}} current tools have limits in both flexibility and efficiency. Many forces drive {{the development of new}} tools including the desire to make complex system modeling design and analysis easier and the need for quicker turnaround time in analysis and design. Other considerations include the desire to make use of advanced computer architectures to help in control system design, adopt new methodologies in control, and integrate design processes (e. g., structure, control, optics). CAESY was developed to provide a means to evaluate methods for dealing with user needs in computer-aided control system design. It is an interpreter for performing engineering calculations and incorporates features of both Ada and MATLAB. It is designed to be reasonably flexible and powerful. CAESY includes internally defined functions and procedures, as well as user defined ones. Support for matrix calculations is provided {{in the same manner as}} MATLAB.

40|$|Geological studies analyze {{spectral}} data {{in order to}} gain information on surface materials. RATIO_TOOL is an interactive program for viewing and analyzing large multispectral image data sets that have been created by an imaging spectrometer. While the standard approach to classification of multi{{spectral data}} is to match the spectrum for each input pixel against a library of known mineral spectra, RATIO_TOOL uses ratios of spectral bands in order to spot significant areas of interest within a multispectral image. Each image band can be viewed iteratively, or a selected image band of the data set can be requested and displayed. When the image ratios are computed, the result is displayed as a gray scale image. At this point a histogram option helps in viewing the distribution of values. A thresholding option can then be used to segment the ratio image result into two to four classes. The segmented image is then color coded to indicate threshold classes and displayed alongside the gray scale image. RATIO_TOOL is written in C language for Sun series computers running SunOS 4. 0 and later. It requires the XView toolkit and the OpenWindows window manager (version 2. 0 or 3. 0).

40|$|SINDA, the Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer, is a {{software}} system for solving lumped parameter representations of physical problems governed by diffusion-type equations. SINDA was originally designed for analyzing thermal systems represented in electrical analog, lumped parameter form, although its use may {{be extended to}} include other classes of physical systems which can be modeled in this form. As a thermal analyzer, SINDA can handle such interrelated phenomena as sublimation, diffuse radiation within enclosures, transport delay effects, and sensitivity analysis. FLUINT, the FLUid INTegrator, is an advanced one-dimensional fluid analysis program that solves arbitrary fluid flow networks. The working fluids can be single phase vapor, single phase liquid, or two phase. The SINDA' 85 /FLUINT system permits the mutual influences of thermal and fluid problems to be analyzed. The SINDA system consists of a programming language, a preprocessor, and a subroutine library. The SINDA language is designed for working with lumped parameter representations and finite difference solution techniques. The preprocessor accepts programs written in the SINDA language and converts them into standard FORTRAN. The SINDA library consists {{of a large number}} of FORTRAN subroutines that perform a variety of commonly needed actions. The use of these subroutines can greatly reduce the programming effort required to solve many problems. A complete run of a SINDA' 85 /FLUINT model is a four step process. First, the user's desired model is run through the preprocessor which writes out data files for the processor to read and translates the user's program code. Second, the translated code is compiled. The third step requires linking the user's code with the processor library. Finally, the processor is executed. SINDA' 85 /FLUINT program features include 20, 000 nodes, 100, 000 conductors, 100 thermal submodels, and 10 fluid submodels. SINDA' 85 /FLUINT can also model two phase flow, capillary devices, user defined fluids, gravity and acceleration body forces on a fluid, and variable volumes. SINDA' 85 /FLUINT offers the following numerical solution techniques. The Finite difference formulation of the explicit method is the Forward-difference explicit approximation. The formulation of the implicit method is the Crank-Nicolson approximation. The program allows simulation of non-uniform heating and facilitates modeling thin-walled heat exchangers. The ability to model non-equilibrium behavior within two-phase volumes is included. Recent improvements to the program were made in modeling real evaporator-pumps and other capillary-assist evaporators. SINDA' 85 /FLUINT is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes the source code and one copy of the supporting documentation. Additional copies of the documentation may be purchased separately at any time. SINDA' 85 /FLUINT is written in FORTRAN 77. Version 2. 3 has been implemented on Cray series computers running UNICOS, CONVEX computers running CONVEX OS, and DEC RISC computers running ULTRIX. Binaries are included with the Cray version only. The Cray version of SINDA' 85 /FLUINT also contains SINGE, an additional graphics program developed at Johnson Space Flight Center. Both source and executable code are provided for SINGE. Users wishing to create their own SINGE executable will also need the NASA Device Independent Graphics Library (NASADIG, previously known as SMDDIG; UNIX version, MSC- 22001).

40|$|OSMEAN is a {{sophisticated}} FORTRAN algorithm that converts between osculating and mean classical orbit elements. Mean orbit elements are advantageous for trajectory design and maneuver planning since {{they can be}} propagated very quickly; however, mean elements cannot describe the exact orbit at any given time. Osculating elements will enable the engineer to give an exact description of an orbit; however, computation costs are significantly higher due to the numerical integration procedure required for propagation. By calculating accurate conversions between osculating and mean orbit elements, OSMEAN allows the engineer to exploit the advantages of each approach for the design and planning of orbital trajectories and maneuver planning. OSMEAN is capable of converting mean elements to osculating elements or vice versa. The conversion is based on modelling of all first order aspherical and lunar-solar gravitation perturbations {{as well as a}} second-order aspherical term based on the second degree central body zonal perturbation. OSMEAN is written in FORTRAN 77 for HP 9000 series computers running HP-UX (NPO- 18796) and DEC VAX series computers running VMS (NPO- 18741). The HP version requires 388 K of RAM for execution and the DEC VAX version requires 254 K of RAM for execution. Sample input and output are listed in the documentation.

Yet Another Menu Manager, YAMM, is an application independent menuing package, designed to remove much of the difficulty and save much of the time inherent in the implementation of the front ends for large packages. Written in C for UNIX-based operating systems, YAMM provides a complete menuing front end {{for a wide variety of}} applications, with provisions for terminal independence, user-specific configurations, and dynamic creation of menu trees. Applications running under the menu package consists of two parts: a description of the menu configuration and the body of application code. The menu configuration is used at runtime to define the menu structure and any non-standard keyboard mappings and terminal capabilities. Menu definitions define specific menus within the menu tree. The names used in a definition may be either a reference to an application function or the name of another menu defined within the menu configuration. Application parameters are entered using data entry screens which allow for required and optional parameters, tables, and legal-value lists. Both automatic and application-specific error checking are available. Help is available for both menu operation and specific applications. The YAMM program was written in C for execution on a Sun Microsystems workstation running SunOS, based on the Berkeley (4. 2 bsd) version of UNIX. During development, YAMM has been used on both 68020 and SPARC architectures, running SunOS versions 3. 5 and 4. 0. YAMM should be portable to most other UNIX-based systems.

40|$|EQAIRS {{is a set}} of FORTRAN 77 {{routines}} for computing the thermodynamic {{and transport}} properties of equilibrium air for temperatures from 100 to 30000 K. EQAIRS computes these properties over a pressure range of 1. 0 e- 4 to 1. 0 e 2 atm. The properties computed include enthalpy, total specific heat, compressibility factor, viscosity, and the total values of thermal conductivity and Prandtl number. The various properties are calculated through the use of temperature dependent curve-fits for the pressure range given above. The curve fits are based on mixture values calculated from an 11 -species air model. Individual species properties used in the mixture relations were obtained from {{a recent study by the}} program authors. It is desirable to have these equilibrium air properties computed by curve-fits as opposed to tabulated values because curve-fits generally permit more efficient computation for flow-field analyses. In addition, for accurate calculations, it is preferable that the thermodynamic and transport properties be computed in a self-consistent manner from the same set of data as in the present case. The EQAIRS routines were written in the form of FORTRAN subroutines for easy adaptation to existing programs. The subroutines are commented and can be easily modified to suit the user's needs. In an attempt to maintain generality, a total of six separate subroutines are available for use: 1) ENTHLPY (specific enthalpy); 2) SPECIFC (total specific heat at constant pressure); 3) COMPRES (compressibility factor); 4) VISCSTY (viscosity); 5) CONDUCT (total thermal conductivity; and 6) PRANDTL (total Prandtl number). EQAIRS has been successfully implemented on a DEC VAX series computer running VMS, a Sun 4 series computer running SunOS, and an IBM PC compatible computer running MS-DOS.

40|$|The DET/MPS {{programs}} {{model and}} simulate the Direct Energy Transfer and Multimission Spacecraft Modular Power System {{in order to}} aid both in design and in analysis of orbital energy balance. Typically, the DET power system has the solar array directly to the spacecraft bus, and the central building block of MPS is the Standard Power Regulator Unit. DET/MPS allows a minute-by-minute simulation of the power system's performance as it responds to various orbital parameters, focusing its output on solar array output and battery characteristics. While this package is limited in terms of orbital mechanics, it is sufficient to calculate eclipse and solar array data for circular or non-circular orbits. DET/MPS can be adjusted to run one or sequential orbits up to about one week, simulated time. These programs have been used {{on a variety of}} Goddard Space Flight Center spacecraft projects. DET/MPS is written in FORTRAN 77 with some VAX-type extensions. Any FORTRAN 77 compiler that includes VAX extensions should be able to compile and run the program with little or no modifications. The compiler must at least support free-form (or tab-delineated) source format and 'do do-while end-do' control structures. DET/MPS is available for three platforms: GSC- 13374, for DEC VAX series computers running VMS, is available in DEC VAX Backup format on a 9 -track 1600 BPI tape (standard distribution) or TK 50 tape cartridge; GSC- 13443, for UNIX-based computers, is available on a. 25 inch streaming <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> in UNIX tar format; and GSC- 13444, for Macintosh computers running AU/X with either the NKR FORTRAN or AbSoft MacFORTRAN II compilers, is available on a 3. 5 inch 800 K Macintosh format diskette. Source code and test data are supplied. The UNIX version of DET requires 90 K of main memory for execution. DET/MPS was developed in 1990.
