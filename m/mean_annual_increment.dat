5000|$|Biologists use {{the concept}} of maximum {{sustainable}} yield (MSY) or <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> (MAI), to determine the optimal harvest age of timber. MSY {{can be defined as}} “the largest yield that can be harvested which does not deplete the resource (timber) irreparably and which leaves the resource in good shape for future uses”. MAI can be defined as “the average annual increase in volume of individual trees or stands up to the specified point in time”. The MAI changes throughout the different growth phases in a tree’s life; it is highest in the middle years and then decreases with age.

5000|$|The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> (MAI) or mean {{annual growth}} {{refers to the}} average growth per year a tree or stand of trees has exhibited/experienced to a {{specified}} age. For example, a 20-year-old tree that has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 10.0 inches has an MAI of 0.5 inches/year. MAI is calculated as [...] where Y(t) = yield at time t. Because the typical growth patterns of most trees is sigmoidal, the MAI starts out small, increases to a maximum value as the tree matures, then declines slowly over {{the remainder of the}} tree's life. Throughout this, the MAI always remains positive. MAI differs from periodic annual increment (PAI) because the PAI is simply the growth for one specific year or any other specified length of time.|$|E

40|$|Exotic {{tree species}} predominate in {{reforestation}} in tropical regions worldwide. However, some native species {{are suitable for}} plantations, providing {{a wider variety of}} products. Adequate government programs of incentives, coupled with good technical advice to farmers, are needed to stimulate reforestation, especially among small and medium-sized farmers with limited financial resources. This project evaluates growth of native and exotic tree species on plantations in small and medium-sized farms in the Atlantic humid lowlands of Costa Rica, Central America. A total of 210 pure plantations, ranging in age from 6 to 11 years, were evaluated on 123 farms that had used government incentives for reforestation, and had received technical advice from local non-government organizations. For each species, seven plantations were chosen at random for study. In each plantation, plots of 15 trees each were chosen systematically for evaluation of diameter at breast height (dbh), total height, number of trees per hectare, tree form and spacing. Terminalia amazonia (J. F. Gmel) Exell, Hieronyma alchorneoides Allemao, and Vochysia guatemalensis Donn. Sm. were the most frequent species found in plantations in the region of study. Gmelina arborea Roxb. (exotic) and V. guatemalensis (native) had the highest <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> diameter <b>increment</b> with 2. 90 and 2. 59 cm, respectively. Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess. (native) had the lowest <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> diameter <b>increment</b> (1. 48 cm). G. arborea and V. guatemalensis had the highest <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> volume <b>increment,</b> followed by Tectona grandis (L. f) Lam. (exotic), and T. amazonia and Cordia alliodora (R&P) Cham. (both native). Although G. arborea had the greatest <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> diameter <b>increment,</b> it had the lowest plantation density and problems with form. V. guatemalensis and T. amazonia, two native species, were the most promising species for reforestation, due to good growth in volume, good form, and adaptability to a variety of sites. The poor form of exotic species was related to the low intensity management methods of small farmers. Exotic species had the highest performance variability between sites, while native species showed relatively high growth homogeneity. Therefore, native species seem more promising than exotics for general use across varying ecological conditions...|$|R

We also calculated <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> for a subset of the trees. The inclusion of very large trees in the data set makes these volume equations unique. For the five most common species, separate volume equations were calculated for each of the two easternmost islands (Kosrae and Pohnpei), the remaining islands (‘Western Islands’, including Chuuk, Yap, and Palau), and all the islands together (Micronesia). Tree structure differed significantly among the three island groupings and for two species, between Kosrae and Pohnpei, which are only 560 km apart. <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> diameter <b>increments</b> for Sonneratia alba and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza indicated significantly faster growth on Kosrae (0. 96 and 0. 44 cm/year, respectively) than on Pohnpei (0. 33 and 0. 26 cm/year, respectively). Frequency distributions of diameter size classes on these two islands demonstrated a more even distribution of sizes and more large trees on Kosrae (e. g., up to 3. 2 m in diameter for S. alba).

The data were inventoried (in 1951 - 1953) using a systematic temporary circular plot line survey. Each plot represented a particular stand.

The {{results show that the}} fastest height growth was found in ash growing on hornbeam sites, but in the age class of over 70 growth was fastest in ash trees growing on ash sites. Ash trees on mountainous limy beech sites recordedthe slowest height growth. On the same sites, however, the diameter growth of ash is moderate, but very persistent and does not decline with age. At the age of 80 - 90 years the diameter growth of ash on limy beech sites exceeds the growth curves of ash from the other site groups. In fact, the diameter growth of ash on ash sites, hornbeam sites and beech sites of mixed or silicated bedrock continues to rise until the age of 50, and after that it starts decreasing, the decrease being slowest on ash sites.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The Levels-of-Growing-Stock Studies in Douglas-fir is a {{regional}} cooperative {{to investigate the}} effects of levels of growing stock on young stand growth. The Hoskins installation, in western Oregon, was established in a dense, high site natural stand at total age 20 years. The initial thinning resulted in an immediate 131 percent increase in diameter growth. Subsequent crown type thinning treatments retained eight different, predetermined percentages of the gross basal area growth on the control plots. At age 45, diameter growth remains strong on the heavily thinned treatments, but decreases with increased growing stock. Gross volume growth increased with growing stock, while gross basal area growth was much less influenced by growing stock. Volume growth was strongly related to density because of the rapid height growth of this young stand. Heavy thinnings reduced volume production because of the depletion of growing stock. Total volume production was only slightly reduced on the light thinnings, whereas merchantable volume was greater than the unthinned control. Mortality was heavy on the control, but negligible on the treated plots. Heavy mortality in the last period, reduced net volume growth on the control to less than the treatments. Periodic <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> (PAI) for cubic foot volume appear to have culminated for the treatments, although they are nearly twice the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> on the thinned plots.

The diameter growth of individual trees was particularly influenced by the amount of density in trees larger than any given tree. Density had only a minor effect on height growth. Trees in lower densities had longer crowns and greater taper. Results from simulations of alternative thinning regimes show the desirability of early thinnings. Compared to thinning from below, crown thinning appeared to give the greatest release to the residual stand and produce high volume growth. Management must consider the trade-off s between greater diameter growth at low densities and greater volume growth at high densities...|$|R
50|$|Newton’s (2003) {{systematic}} review of yield responses of white spruce and 3 other North American conifers to forest tree improvement practices indicated that correct provenance-progeny selection could yield juvenile height growth gains of about 12% at 20 years for white spruce, and a corresponding merchantable productivity (<b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> merchantable volume <b>increment)</b> gain of 26% at 50 years for plantations established at nominal initial densities on medium-to-good quality sites. Also, preliminary estimates derived from individual case studies indicated that first generational selection strategies for white spruce could increase merchantable productivity by approximately 20% at 45 years.|$|R
