Self-synthesized gadolinium-based <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> contrast agent, [Gd(DOTA-FPβG) ], was administered to measure enhancement on <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> images using a commercially available agent, [Gd(DOTA) ]−, as control in a clinical 3. 0  tesla (T) <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>scanner.</b> In vivo fluorescence imaging and histopathology of the liver were also performed to compare and correlate with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> studies. The in vivo fluorescence imaging failed to depict a sufficiently intense signal for liver or liver tumor of mice without exposure of the liver following an incision on the abdominal wall. The tissue-specific <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> agent, [Gd(DOTA-FPβG) ], caused significantly stronger enhancement in tumors expressing βG (CT 26 /mβG-eB 7) than in tumors not expressing βG (CT 26) (p <  0. 05). In the <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging studies using control agent [Gd(DOTA) ]−, the tumors with and without βG expression depicted {{no significant difference in}} enhancement on the T 1 -weighted images. The [Gd(DOTA-FPβG) ] also provided significantly more contrast uptake in the CT 26 /mβG-eB 7 tumor than in the normal liver parenchyma, whereas the [Gd(DOTA) ]− did not.

40|$|A fast, {{accurate}} and fully automatic method of segmenting magnetic resonance {{images of the}} human brain is introduced. The approach scales well allowing fast segmentations of fine resolution images. The approach is based on modifications of the soft clustering algorithm, fuzzy c-means, that enable it to scale to large data sets. Two types of modifications to create incremental versions of fuzzy c-means are discussed. They are much faster when compared to fuzzy c-means for medium to extremely large data sets because they work on just parts of the data. They are comparable in quality to application of fuzzy c-means to all of the data. The clustering algorithms coupled with inhomogeneity correction and smoothing are used to create a framework for automatically segmenting magnetic resonance images {{of the human brain}}. The framework is applied to a set of normal human brain volumes acquired from different <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>scanners</b> using different head coils, acquisition parameters and field strengths.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the brain’s resting-state {{activity}} (RSA) is organized in low frequency oscillations that drive network connectivity. Recent research has also shown that elements of RSA described by high-frequency and nonoscillatory properties are non-random and functionally relevant. Motivated by this research, we investigated nonoscillatory aspects of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) RSA using a novel method for characterizing subtle fluctuation dy-namics. The metric that we develop quantifies the relative variance of the amplitude of local-maxima and local-minima in a BOLD time course (amplitude variance asymmetry; AVA). This metric reveals new properties of RSA activity, without relying on connectivity as a descriptive tool. We applied the AVA analysis to data from 3 differ-ent participant groups (2 adults, 1 child) collected from 3 different centers. The analyses show that AVA patterns a) identify 3 types of RSA profiles in adults ’ sensory systems b) differ in topology and pattern of dynamics in adults and children, and c) are stable across <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>scanners.</b> Furthermore, children with higher IQ demonstrated more adult-like AVA patterns.
