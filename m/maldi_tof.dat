40|$|My bachelor´s thesis {{focuses on}} the most major {{pathogen}} of the genus named Haemophilus, and Haemophila influenzae. H. influenzae is an originator of more serious infections, mainly its type b, {{which is the most}} virulent organism, causing invasive diseases mainly with children and older people. It causes mainly meningitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the theoretical part of my bachelor´s thesis I write about the genus Haemophilus and clinic significances of the most famous species which occur at present. The genus Haemophilus is an aerobic and a facultative aerobic gram that means it is a negative bacteria, which is characteristic for its arduous requests for accretion. I used some methods for the diagnosis. I used the following methods a test with growth factors, which is a common diagnostic method, which distinguishing Haemophilus according to their addiction to the growth factors. This method is financially very demanding and currently the mason being why its results are not so accurate. But thanks to a new technology a more modern method called <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> weight spektronomie (MS) was found, which is easier, quicker and more accurate than the first one. <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> enables a diagnosis of the most demanding pieces of bacteria, yeast and mushrooms. The <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> diagnosis is characterized by undisputed reliability and cost effectiveness. Lactam antibiotics, mainly antibiotics - co-amoxicilin and chloramfenikol are used as treatment methods against Heamophilus. Against serious infections can one protect themselves with a vaccination the Hib vaccination. In the practical part of my bachelor´s thesis I described some processes and laboratory diagnostics of the pathogen H. influenza by methods <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS and by the Test for growth factories in a microbiological laboratory named Synlab, czech s. r. o., in České Budějovice. The results of how frequently H. influenza occurred in the year 2013, were gained from of the previously mentioned laboratory information system and were transported into the other laboratory from a field office of general practisioners. The other aim of my bachelor´s thesis was to compare severity and of each method. HYPOTHESIS 1 : The frequency of H. influenzae in the year 2013 depends on a season. HYPOTHESIS 2 : The <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS method is reliable and fast for identification of the genus Haemophilus. The Test with growth factories is not so reliable and fast. From the results {{it is obvious that the}} frequency of H. influenzae depends on the season. Heamophilus are very demanding and sensitive bacteria for cultivation and they need optimal conditions for their accretion. In this season the viral diseases increase and they can affect the process of the treatment. During the comparison of these two methods I managed to prove that the second hypothesis <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> is useful in a diagnosis. This method is not demanding.

40|$|Five {{different}} model systems {{exist for}} physical studies of disorders that afflict the human central nervous system: 1) brain tissue, 2) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 3) laboratory animals, 4) genetics, and 5) peripheral blood cells. Post-mortem brain samples, CSF, and peripheral blood cells harbor {{a great number}} of neuropeptides and proteins of diagnostic importance. Studies of these molecules have traditionally relied on antibody-based methods such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and Western blotting. While sensitive, these types of assays are limited by the fact that antibodies recognize only an epitope on the molecule of interest. Thus, there is an omnipresent risk of the detecting antibodyís cross-reacting with other molecules containing this epitope. Likewise, truncated or otherwise modified forms of the peptide or protein may escape recognition. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (<b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS), a technique first described in 1988, has been utilized to provide molecular mass and sequence information for peptides, including neuropeptides, and proteins isolated from tissues that reflect disease states of the central nervous system. By combining affinity chromatography with HPLC separation, RIA, <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS, and post-source decay analysis, we were able to characterize the substance P-like immunoreactivity measured in porcine cortex and cortical nuclei. By studying the processing of four neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y 1 - 36, neuropeptide Y 18 - 36, somatostatin 1 - 28, and somatostatin 15 - 28 in neat CSF by <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS, and comparing our results to the HPLC-RIA profiles obtained from CSF, we were able to characterize the neuropeptide Y- and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity measured in these assays. Fundamental information about how neuropeptides are processed in CSF, depending on size and/or secondary structure, was also obtained in this study. The processing of neuropeptide Y 1 - 36, neuropeptide Y 18 - 36, somatostatin 1 - 28, and galanin was studied using <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS alone, in CSF samples taken from patients suffering from Alzheimerís disease, frontotemporal dementia, and neurologically normal controls. Differences in individual rates of neuropeptide processing and patterns of processing could be observed using this technique. Many proteins in CSF are of diagnostic importance. We have demonstrated that at least three of these can be monitored through <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS analysis of neat CSF. Using <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS analysis of neat CSF, {{it may be possible to}} diagnose certain inherited diseases directly, at the level of protein expression.

Bee products were administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts in addition to the control group. First experimental group was with propolis in feed mixture with the addition of 200 mg propolis per 1 kg of compound and second group was with pollen with the addition of 250 mg pollen per 1 kg of compound. In this experiment, quantitative counts of Enterococci in ceca of 49 -day-old chicken (Ross 308) using classical and <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS Biotyper method were investigated. Counts of Enterococci on Slanetz-Bartley agar were monitored. Enterococcus cells, isolated from gastrointestinal tract, were detected using <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS Biotyper. Counts of CFU of Enterococci were compared in experimental and control treatments, respectively. The lowest count was detected in the control experimental group. The highest count was detected in the first experimental group where was 200 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture. Using <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS Biotyper, we identified the species range of the genera Enterococcus in the intestinal tract of broiler. Detected species from the genus Enterococcus were:      E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus. In the experimental groups (caecal samples) were most frequent species of E. avium E. faecium and E. gallinarum. </h 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{it has been}} shown that both the laser desorption/ionization mass {{spectrometry}} (LDI MS) and the matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (<b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS) are the simple and quick methods for determination of relative natural isotopic distribution of lead. The analysis of metal salts with these approaches does not require any time-consuming preparation of samples: a single run can take only a minute, and numerous information can be obtained. Results obtained in this work show that chosen matrix has no negative effect on quantitative determination of lead isotopes and support once more the applicability of <b>MALDI</b> <b>TOF</b> MS for lead isotope distribution determination in the sample, and accuracy of data obtained. Additionally, the generation of PbnOn and PbnOn- 1 (n: 2 - 6) clusters have been successfully achieved in the positive mode, using the both LDI and MALDI methods. All stoichiometries were confirmed using isotopic pattern modelling. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 0172011...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of sepsis {{and the number}} of sepsis-related deaths are increasing, making sepsis {{the leading cause of death}} in critically ill patients in Europe and the U. S. A. Delayed recognition of sepsis and inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy are associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Rapid and accurate identification of sepsis and its causative organisms are a prerequisite for successful therapy. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of sepsis is culture of blood and other body fluids or tissues. However, even in severe sepsis, blood cultures (BC) yield the causative microorganism in only 20 - 40 % of patients. Moreover, at least 24 hours are needed to get preliminary information about the potential organism. Therefore, novel laboratory methods for the diagnosis of sepsis, such as multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (<b>MALDI)</b> time-of-flight (<b>TOF)</b> mass spectrometry (MS) (MALDI-TOF MS) and calorimetry, have been developed and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|S. agalactiae {{are common}} commensals of the nasopharynx, vagina and {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Now digestive tract {{is considered a}} very likely source of vaginal colonization. Colonization by the bacteria is in many cases asymptomatic. S. agalactiae causes a variety of infections in neonates and is {{a leading cause of}} neonatal morbidity and mortality. Transmission takes place vertically from colonized mother to fetus. A potential source of GBS infections may also be mother's milk. This type of transmission is very rare. S. agalactiae infection induces not only in neonates but also in adults, particularly in older persons and persons with other ongoing disease. In the theoretical part, I focused on the current knowledge about S. agalactiae, neonatal GBS infections and their prevention options. Then I assess current possibilities of identification and diagnostics of S. agalactiae, including the determination of antibiotic susceptibility. I outlined the current situation of the increasing resistance of S. agalactiae to macrolides and lincosamides and described the situation in several different countries. The practical part is performed on bacteriological department Ceske Budejovice Hospital, a. s. where I dealt with the whole process of identification and diagnostics of S. agalactiae. Firstly I did cultivate, or also preparing specimens for microscopic evaluation. I also identified S. agalactiae using CAMP assay, latex agglutination method or <b>MALDI</b> - <b>TOF.</b> For strains identified as S. agalactiae was performed for antibiotic sensitivity by the disc diffusion test. All the work I carried out {{under the supervision of the}} head of his thesis and laboratory staff according to standard operating procedures. Part of my work is devoted to the results. Their statistical processing, I found the colonization by S. agalactiae in a population of pregnant women. I also concentrated on the distribution of individual serotypes of this bacterium in newborns. For each strain isolated from pregnant women and infants I assess its sensitivity to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. The practice in the laboratory showed that the most frequently used methods for identification of S. agalactiae are CAMP test and <b>MALDI</b> - <b>TOF</b> mass spectrometry.

40|$|MALDI imaging mass {{spectrometry}} (MALDI-IMS) {{has become a}} powerful tool for the detection and localization of drugs, proteins, and lipids on-tissue. Nevertheless, this approach can only perform identification of low mass molecules as lipids, pharmaceuticals, and peptides. In this article, a combination of approaches for the detection and imaging of proteins and their identification directly on-tissue is described after tryptic digestion. Enzymatic digestion protocols for different kinds of tissues—formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and frozen tissues—are combined with MALDI-ion mobility {{mass spectrometry}} (IM-MS). This combination enables localization and identification of proteins via their related digested peptides. In a number of cases, ion mobility separates isobaric ions that cannot be identified by conventional <b>MALDI</b> time-of-flight (<b>TOF)</b> mass spectrometry. The amount of detected peaks per measurement increases (versus conventional MALDI-TOF), which enables mass and time selected ion images and the identification of separated ions. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of direct proteins identification by ion-mobility-TOF IMS from tissue. The tissue digestion combined with MALDI-IM-TOF-IMS approach allows a proteomics “bottom-up” strategy with different kinds of tissue samples, especially FFPE tissues conserved for a lon...|$|R
