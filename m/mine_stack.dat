40|$|Abstract—Stack Overflow is {{a highly}} {{successful}} questionanswering website in the programming community, which not only provide quick solutions to programmers ’ questions but also is considered as a large repository of valuable software engineering knowledge. However, despite having a very engaged and active user community, Stack Overflow currently has more than 300 K unanswered questions. In this paper, we <b>mine</b> <b>Stack</b> Overflow dataset to investigate why these questions remain unanswered by applying a combination of statistical and data mining techniques. Our results indicate that {{although there are some}} topics that were never answered, most questions remained unanswered because they apparently are of little interest to the user community.

30|$|In our study, we <b>mined</b> <b>Stack</b> Overflow to {{investigate}} the abovementioned research question. Our work was inspired by studies performed by Bajaj et al. (Bajaj & Mesbah, 2014) who analyzed technical questions asked by web developers in Stack Overflow, Barua et al. (2014) (focus: testing), and Rosen and Shihab (2016) (focus: mobile developers). The contributions of this paper are a set of four key insights and 10 developer governance strategies that can help keystones to understand developer engagement in an MSECO. The four key insights were evaluated regarding the relevance level to developer governance in MSECOs. Then, strategies were associated to key insights from 65 studies of existing technical literature on developer governance in order to indicate practical ways for the execution of key insights (Fontao et al., 2017).|$|R
50|$|Dump {{leaching}} {{is similar}} to heap leaching, however {{in the case of}} dump leaching ore is taken directly from the <b>mine</b> and <b>stacked</b> on the leach pad without crushing where, in the case of gold and silver, the dump is irrigated with a dilute cyanide solution that percolates through the ore to dissolve gold and silver. The solution containing gold and silver exits the base of the dump, is collected and precious metals extracted. The resultant barren solution is recharged with additional cyanide and returned to the dump.|$|R

Similar hairs were found in the store's vacuum cleaner. Also present was a large damp spot on the carpet that was later determined to be saliva. The police also noted that peepholes had been drilled into the dressing rooms.|$|R
50|$|The MATS/1.4 is a scatterable Italian circular, plastic-cased minimum metal blast-resistant {{anti-tank}} blast mine. It uses a pneumatic fuze {{which is}} resistant to shock and blast. The mine's plastic case is waterproof, and the mine can be scattered from a helicopter travelling {{at up to}} 200 km/h. The mine is normally tan-colored. The mine's main charge is relatively small, so when hand-emplaced the <b>mine</b> can be <b>stacked,</b> to increase its effect.|$|R
40|$|Spectral and cepstral {{analysis}} {{were performed on}} regional-array NORESS recordings of mining explosions in Scandinavia and Russia in order to detect the effects of delayed explosions or &quot;ripple firing &quot; commonly used in mine-blasting practice. NORESS array-stacked spectra, corrected for instrument and noise, were computed in windows on Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg waves from the mine blasts by averaging individual channel spectra, frequency by frequency, across the array. For comparison, spectra were also computed for six western Norway earthquakes located near the Blasjo and Titania Norwegian <b>mines.</b> Also, <b>stack</b> spectra of P coda, Sn, and Lg were computed using NORSAR seismograms for presumed peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) located at near-regional distances (A> 10 °) in western Russia. The NORSAR spectra were determined {{in the same manner}} as the NORESS spectra, except that an individual source correction was applied to the spectra. Comparison of western Norway mine-blast spectra and nearby earthquakes shows that the earthquake Pn spectra are peaked in the 8...|$|R

Once coal removal is completed, the <b>mining</b> operators back <b>stack</b> overburden from the next area to be mined into the now empty pit. After backstacking and grading of overburden has been completed, topsoil (or a topsoil substitute) is layered over the overburden layer. Next, grass seed is spread {{in a mixture of}} seed, fertilizer, and mulch made from recycled newspaper. Depending on surface land owner wishes the land will then be further reclaimed by adding trees if the pre-approved post-mining land use is forest land or wildlife habitat. If the land owner has requested other post-mining land uses the land can be reclaimed to be used as pasture land, economic development or other uses specified in SMCRA.|$|R
500|$|For a time, {{the only}} {{landmark}} that {{remained at the}} old mining location was a 200-foot smokestack near the defunct Corsica <b>mine.</b> The <b>stack,</b> built by Cornish miners in 1901, had a unique design. The Iron Range Historical Society wanted the stack, the last of its kind on the Mesabi Iron Range, to be preserved as an off-premises attraction, since it was structurally sound and historically significant, but its demolition had already been contracted {{as a part of}} the Minnesota Mineland Reclamation Act Abandoned Minelands Cleanup Program. Many people feared it might fall and injure someone; others considered it an aerial obstruction. In 1976, the stack was destroyed; it took three blasting attempts and nearly 100 pounds of dynamite to bring the structure down. After the demolition, responsibility for the land on which Elcor stood changed hands on several different occasions. As early as 1978, management of the property was acquired by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. Property rights were then transferred to LTV Steel after the merger of Jones and Laughlin with Republic Steel in 1984. Property rights were later acquired by the Inland Steel Company in a transfer from LTV. In 1993, Inland Steel began stripping the overburden near the old town site, and the Laurentian mine was born. The mine is now owned by ArcelorMittal and was renamed the Minorca mine after the acquisition of Inland Steel by Mittal in 1998.|$|R
40|$|Overview of Data This dataset cosists of XML {{containing}} {{stack overflow}} {{questions and answers}} as of August 2012 {{that can be used}} for text <b>mining.</b> The <b>stack</b> overflow dataset contains code snippets used by Haggis, a system for mining code idioms developed by the researchers. The GitHub Java Corpus is a collection of Java code at a large scale, while it has been filtered to have an above-average quality (see next section). It can be used to study coding practice in Java at a large scale. It contains all project code, tracked by git with all the associated files. The containing open-source projects are from multiple domains. The code is not ours but is open-source. Please respect the license of each project. How the corpus was collected We processed GitHub's event stream, provided by the [GitHub Archive]([URL] and filtered individual projects that were forked at least once. For each of these projects we collected the URL, the project's name and its language. Filtering by forks aims to create a quality corpus: Since we filter away the majority of projects that have a below-average "reputation", we obtain code of better quality. This criterion is not clear-cut and we could have chosen another method (e. g. GitHub's star system), but we found this preprocessing sufficient. We then downloaded (clone in Git's terms) the full repositories for all remaining Java projects and removed any duplicates: We found about 1, 000 projects that shared common commit SHAs indicating that they were most likely forks of the same project (but not declared on GitHub) and we manually picked those projects that seemed to be the original source. Project duplicates need to be removed to avoid a "leak" of data from the test to the train projects and also to create a more representative corpus of repositories. We split the repository 75...|$|R
40|$|Thawing {{permafrost}} – in {{the form}} of shoreline retrogressive thaw slump events – influence adjacent arctic tundra lake systems near Inuvik, NT. Slump-affected lakes demonstrated lower organic matter and key nutrients such as phosphorus (P), as well as greater water clarity. Key terrestrial permafrost soil indicators such as U, Sr, and Li, were identified to be elevated in slump-affected lakes, while other more biologically important metals (e. g. Fe, Mn) were significantly lower in affected lakes. These physical-chemical changes led to increasing P-limitation for both phytoplankton and periphyton, resulting in lower phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a). Using P as covariate in ANCOVA analysis, slump-affected lakes were also lower in phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) relative to other study landscapes across the Canadian low-Arctic. Slump-affected lakes also exhibited lower organic matter leading to lower overall Hg concentrations within slump-affected lakes. However, this same reduction in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has also led to an increase in bioavailable Hg, and increased bioaccumulation of Hg in both periphyton as well as macroinvertebrate species in our most disturbed lakes with DOC concentrations less than 6 and 9 mg DOC/L, respectively. A negative correlation between Hg bioaccumulation and DOC above these concentrations was also observed, and is the typical condition within reference lakes. The legacy impacts of mining were also observed in lakes within 25 km of the Giant <b>Mine</b> roaster <b>stack</b> in the Yellowknife region. Increases in both arsenic (As) and methyl mercury were measured in lakes nearer to the mine, with As concentrations well above water quality guidelines in lakes within 17 km of the roaster stack. This research highlights the necessity of baseline environmental monitoring prior to resource development, as well as the potential for compounded influences of such development within sensitive permafrost regions exposed to thawing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study <b>mining</b> the {{exception}} <b>stack</b> traces included in 159, 048 issues reported on Android projects hosted in GitHub (482 projects) and Google Code (157 projects). The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate whether stack trace information can reveal bug hazards related to exception handling code that may lead to a decrease in application robustness. Overall 6, 005 exception stack traces were extracted, and subjected to source code and bytecode analysis. The outcomes of this study include the identification of the following bug hazards: (i) unexpected cross-type exception wrappings (for instance, trying to handle an instance of OutOfMemoryError “hidden” in a checked exception) which can make the exceptionrelated code more complex and negatively impact the application robustness; (ii) ndocumented runtime exceptions thrown by both the Android platform and third party libraries; and (iii) undocumented checked exceptions thrown by the Android Platform. Such undocumented exceptions make difficult, and most of the times infeasible for the client code to protect against “unforeseen” situations that may happen while calling third-party code. This study provides further insights on such bug hazards and the robustness threats they impose to Android apps as well as to other systems based on the Java exception model.

500|$|Land mines {{were used}} by the SADF and SWAPO and became a major feature of the war, {{triggering}} the development of mine-protected vehicles (MPV). The SADF typically laid marked, fenced, anti-personnel minefields as perimeter protection for bases and vital assets. It laid a reported 45,000 mines during the conflict, of which 3,000 were unaccounted-for when UNTAG arrived. SWAPO used mines for ambushing or intimidation. Mines were laid individually or in clusters; anti-tank <b>mines</b> were often <b>stacked.</b> The <b>mines</b> were obtained from South Africa, the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. After initial training by the SADF's 25th Field Squadron, an early task of the Field Troop was to conduct mine-awareness training for the other contingents. For {{the remainder of the}} deployment, much of the work of the 75 field engineers was clearing exposed mines, marking minefields and clearing routes. Crocker wrote, [...] "for {{the first time since the}} Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".|$|R
5000|$|Residents of the company-owned {{houses were}} given the option to buy them at bargain prices {{provided}} they move them out of town. For many, it took a great chunk of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations and uprooted lots. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after it became official that Elcor’s fate was sealed, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been $75 were now being sold {{for as much as}} $500. Most of the remaining families moved a mile west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the staid old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through {{what was left of the}} town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of a thriving community.
