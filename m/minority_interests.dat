2500|$|That {{forces the}} Court {{to reach the}} {{constitutional}} question, Rutledge argued, and the Act plainly is unconstitutional on such grounds. The statute was not narrowly drawn and did not specifically proscribe the conduct to be prohibited. Rather, it imposed a blanket prohibition on labor union participation in the political process, and that was patently unconstitutional: [...] "To say that labor unions as such have nothing of value to contribute to that process and no vital or legitimate interest in it is to ignore the obvious facts {{of political and economic}} life and of their increasing interrelationship in modern society." [...] The majority, Rutledge pointed out, also cites Congressional debate, which indicates a purpose of the statute was to protect <b>minority</b> <b>interests</b> within labor unions. However, even if that reading of the statute's legislative history were correct, the statute would still be unconstitutionally overbroad in reaching that objective.|$|E

[...] From the 1994 briefing at the International Human Rights Law Group: [...] "the problem in Turkey is the Constitution is against the Kurds and the apartheid constitution {{is very similar to}} it."

The results in this paper show that the reform may improve the value relevance of operating profits and ordinary income. We cannot find {{the evidence that the}} reform decreases the relevance of the multi-step earnings. Though we cannot definitively conclude that the reform was the best way for improving the value relevance of earnings, the reform can be positively evaluated. While FASB makes a new proposal that income of economic unit (consolidated group) should be disclosed on the bottom line in the income statement in the U.
