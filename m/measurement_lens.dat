Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 54 consecutive eyes in 52 patients who received pars plana vitrectomy with relaxing retinotomy during retinal detachment repair. Perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) was used as a standard procedure to stabilize the retina during retinotomy to prevent slippage or inversion of the posterior flap. If PFCL was not available due to economic reasons, dashed line relaxing retinotomy was performed instead. Best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure <b>measurement,</b> <b>lens</b> status, and fundus examination were analyzed. We excluded patients who were followed up < 4 months. Results: Regarding anatomical success rates and visual outcomes, we found no significant differences between patients treated with intraoperative PFCL and those treated with dashed line relaxing retinotomy without PFCL. Conclusion: Compared to the simple and efficient PFCL-assisted relaxing retinotomy, dashed relaxing retinotomy is not the first choice when PFCL is available. Based on our results, this modified technique may offer an alternative in patients with anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy for whom PFCL is not available.

Beautifully re-designed in a clean, contemporary layout, this second edition presents relevant and up-to-date information in a systematic manner, with a logical flow of subject matter from front to back.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{covariance}} properties of real space correlation function estimators [...] primarily galaxy-shear correlations, or galaxy-galaxy lensing [...] using SDSS data for both shear catalogs and lenses (specifically the BOSS LOWZ sample). Using mock catalogs of lenses and sources, we disentangle the various {{contributions to the}} covariance matrix and compare them with a simple analytical model. We show that not subtracting the lensing measurement around random points from the <b>measurement</b> around the <b>lens</b> sample is equivalent to performing the <b>measurement</b> using the <b>lens</b> density field instead of the lens over-density field. While the <b>measurement</b> using the <b>lens</b> density field is unbiased (in the absence of systematics), its error is significantly larger due to an additional term in the covariance. Therefore, this subtraction should be performed regardless of its beneficial effects on systematics. Comparing the error estimates from data and mocks for estimators that involve the over-density, {{we find that the}} errors are dominated by the shape noise and lens clustering, that empirically estimated covariances (jackknife and standard deviation across mocks) are consistent with theoretical estimates, and that both the connected parts of the 4 -point function and the super-sample covariance can be neglected for the current levels of noise. While the trade-off between different terms in the covariance depends on the survey configuration (area, source number density), the diagnostics that we use in this work should be useful for future works to test their empirically-determined covariances.

50|$|The {{hyperbolic}} curvatures {{are difficult}} to test, especially with equipment typically available to amateur telescope makers or laboratory-scale fabricators; thus, older telescope layouts predominate in these applications. However, professional optics fabricators and large research groups test their mirrors with interferometers. A Ritchey-Chrétien then requires minimal additional equipment, typically a small optical device called a null corrector that makes the hyperbolic primary look spherical for the interferometric test. On the Hubble Space Telescope, this device was built incorrectly (a reflection from an un-intended surface leading to an incorrect <b>measurement</b> of <b>lens</b> position) leading to the error in the Hubble primary mirror.

40|$|Training {{autonomous}} vehicles requires lots {{of driving}} sequences in all situationszhao 2016. Typically a simulation environment (software-in-the-loop, SiL) accompanies real-world test drives to systematically vary environmental parameters. A missing {{piece in the}} optical model of those SiL simulations is the sharpness, given in linear system theory by the point-spread function (PSF) of the optical system. We present a novel numerical model for the PSF of an optical system that can efficiently model both experimental <b>measurements</b> and <b>lens</b> design simulations of the PSF. The numerical basis for this model is a non-linear regression of the PSF with an artificial neural network (ANN). The novelty lies in the portability and the parameterization of this model, which allows to apply this model in basically any conceivable optical simulation scenario, e. g. inserting a measured lens into a computer game to train autonomous vehicles. We present a <b>lens</b> <b>measurement</b> series, yielding a numerical function for the PSF that depends only on the parameters defocus, field and azimuth. By convolving existing images and videos with this PSF model we apply the measured lens as a transfer function, therefore generating an image {{as if it were}} seen with the measured lens itself. Applications of this method are in any optical scenario, but we focus on the context of autonomous driving, where quality of the detection algorithms depends directly on the optical quality of the used camera system. With the parameterization of the optical model we present a method to validate the functional and safety limits of camera-based ADAS based on the real, measured lens actually used in the product.

Previous studies by the authors have shown that peripheral resolution for blue-cone isolating gratings is also sampling limited, is robust to optical defocus and short-wavelength attenuation, and yields estimates of sampling density which correspond closely with the density of small bistratified ganglion cells. We measured peripheral resolution in a group of normal subjects ranging in age from 12 to 72 years, using both achromatic and blue-cone isolating gratings, to determine how performance (and hence ganglion cell density) changed with age for both systems. Resolution was higher for achromatic than blue–yellow gratings and performance was flat for both until the fifth decade. After this, performance declined for both at a rate of ∼ 14 %/decade with {{no significant difference between the}} two rates of decline.
