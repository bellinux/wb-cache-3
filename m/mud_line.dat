5000|$|One 1973 {{site-specific}} mural, {{painted on}} a custom-designed wall {{as part of}} a history center under construction (and never completed) at Punaluu Beach, twice gained notoriety. The historical mural, titled Ancient Punaluu, Hawaii Island measured 24 ft wide by 10 ft high. According to a news report, [...] "The mural shows alii, warriors and commoners on the black sandbar, which separates Punaluu Bay from a pond where springs provide fresh water immediately behind the beach.....A ceiling of thatch gave the feeling of being inside an old Hawaiian shelter and the thatch hid lighting, which gave a natural, daylight look to the mural. Pebbles and sand {{at the base of the}} painting met real pebbles and sand on the floor of the history center." [...] In 1975 the mural survived a tsunami that destroyed the interior of the building. According to Kāne’s account on his personal blog, quoting eyewitnesses, the wave pushed all the displays out the far side of the room and left a <b>mud</b> <b>line</b> three or four feet high on the wall—except on the mural, which was dry and undamaged. Then in 2005 the mural was stolen from the site, which was vacant and unfinished. Thieves are believed to have cut out the wall in five sections using a circular saw powered by a portable generator, and in this way stole the painting, which has never been recovered. Kāne responded by recreating a version of the mural in oil paint on canvas, saying, “Now all the thieves have is a preliminary sketch. Vengeance is mine.” ...|$|E

Considering with the nonlinear characteristics of seabed soil, the variable string cross section, and the axial load on the top of string, a dynamic differential equation of casing string below <b>mud</b> <b>line</b> and its numerical solution were established. Results illustrate that, the lateral displacement, the bending moment, and the shear of the casing string are not equal when lateral dynamic cyclic loading achieves amplitude due to the soil hysteresis effect. The diameter and wall thickness of conductor have less affect to string vibration frequency, cannot adjust the string natural frequency by adjusting these parameters. The natural frequency of casing string in sand is bigger than it in clay. The undrained shear strength of soil has great effect on the natural frequency of casing string in clay.

40|$|Support {{structures}} for offshore wind turbines {{play a significant}} part {{in the cost of}} offshore wind energy. With current access systems a conventional boat landing is not necessary. Secondary steel, such as a boat landing and J-tube, influences wave loads. A way of taking the secondary steel items into account in the wave load calculation is through modifying the hydrodynamic coefficients. Wave loads are calculated using four design standards and the design of the monopiles of the Prinses Amalia Wind Farm. The wave loads results with and without secondary steel items can be used for a buckling check at the mudline for the specific case. This gives insight in the influence of the secondary steel items on wave load and wall thickness. Determining the drag coefficient using different standards will result in differences of the drag coefficient between 18 % and 22 %. A boat landing and j-tube will result in a wall thickness increase of 8 - 12 % at the <b>mud</b> <b>line</b> location of the monopile pile design of the case study.

30|$|The tsunami waves, {{train in}} Tahaddart deposits, {{generated}} {{a cycle of}} erosion–deposition processes, leading to the emplacement of successive fining-upwards sub-units. Normal grading is often reported for tsunami deposits (e.g. Shi et al. 1995; Bondevik et al. 1997 b; Minoura et al. 1997; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe 2003), especially in their upper part, reverse graded or ungraded material {{is typical of the}} lower part of tsunami deposits but is less common than normal grading (Hori et al. 2007; Paris et al. 2007; Choowong et al. 2008). Erosion of the substratum by the tsunami flood waters is attested by scour-and-fill features and rip-up clasts (of soil for example). Rip-up clasts of clay or soil (from the substratum or <b>mud</b> <b>lines)</b> grade into stretched rip-ups, discontinuous laminae (Gutiérrez-Mas et al. 2009; Pozo et al. 2010). The abundance of rip-up clasts of organic matter decreases upwards. However, a constant problem when interpreting a tsunami sequence is the doubt due to erosion of underlying deposits by each wave within the wave train, thus truncating the record, especially if wave amplitude increases during the event (Wagner and Srisutam 2011; Higman and Bourgeois 2008; Moore et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Bird nests often contain objects {{produced}} and manipulated by other animals, including human rubbish. The function, if any, {{of these items}} remains unclear, and it is unknown whether they might serve a signalling role to increase the conspicuousness of the nest lining or contribute to its crypsis. We located several nests of the introduced song thrush (Turdus philomelos) in New Zealand containing discarded cigarette butts. These items were embedded into the dried mud-matrix of the nest and appeared visually inconspicuous to the human observer. However, human and avian visual sensitivities are dramatically different. We used full-spectrum reflectance spectrophotometry, combined with perceptual modelling of the avian visual system to assess the contrast between <b>mud</b> <b>lining,</b> garbage, and the colours of thrush eggs. Our analyses confirmed that, when perceived by birds, cigarette butts were similar in appearance to the nest lining and showed sharp contrast with the eggs. We suggest that cigarette butts form an opportunistic structural component of the song thrush nest. It remains to be determined whether human-made objects in song thrush nests serve anti-predator or an olfactory signalling function. This study illustrates the application of avian perceptual modelling to test signalling based hypotheses for the extended phenotype of birds, including nest architecture.

40|$|Application of an {{integrated}} workflow for shallow-hazard characterization using a 3 D high-resolution survey offshore Azerbaijan A methodology has been developed for quantitative pre-diction of shallow-hazard zones based on 3 D high-resolution (3 DHR) seismic and shallow-log data. The main goal of the in-tegrated workflow is to produce an optimal structural image, conduct an AVO feasibility study and, if applicable, identify AVO trends within the depositional sequences of the shallow overburden at the Azeri field offshore Azerbaijan. Shallow, near-surface geologic-engineering hazards and features are not always visible on seismic volumes typically processed for reser-voir targets. The 3 D high-resolution seismic data provide good definition of shallow stratigraphy, indication of buried mudflows and landslides, and good fault delineation. AVO feasibility from rock-property analysis was affected by uncertainties arising from lack of or poor log data quality. With limited amounts of log data increasing the uncertainties, the use of trends based on data provided offered some initial understanding of shallow-seismic sensitivity. In depths < 300 m below <b>mud</b> <b>line</b> (BML), there is greater uncertainty because rock-physics models are not well un-derstood in a generally unconsolidated section.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{salt body}} at Gemini Prospect, Gulf of Mexico, has been analyzed by seismic methods, revealing a complex 3 D salt volume at depths 1 to 5 km beneath the <b>mud</b> <b>line.</b> Because {{of the high}} contrast in electrical conductivity between the salt and surrounding sediments, Gemini is an attractive target for electromagnetic inter-rogation. Using a broadband magnetotelluric (MT) sensor package developed at the Scripps Institution of Oceanog-raphy, data in the period band of 1 to 3000 s were col-lected at 42 sites {{in a series of}} profiles over Gemini, one of which was directly over a linear ridgelike salt feature strik-ing roughly northwest–southeast and another orthogonal to it. These two profiles reveal that the strongest MT re-sponse arises when the electric field is oriented northeast– southwest. We test the suitability of 2 D inversion of these data for recovering the true salt structure by examining inversions of both actual data and synthetic 3 D MT responses derived from the seismically inferred salt volume. Occam inver-sions of the northeast–southwest component result in re-sistivity images that generally agree with the seismic data, whereas inversions of the complementary component yield significantly poorer fidelity. Disagreement is greatest (1 – 2 km) along the salt sides and base. Depth errors for top of salt are less than 500 m. Although thin, deep salt (< 1 km thick at 5 km depth) is not well resolved, the inversions reveal a resistive basement and a shallow subseabed envi-ronment rich in electrical heterogeneity that is weakly, if at all, suggested by the seismic data. A notable exception is a correlation between a previously uninterpreted seismic re-flector and the base of a shallow resistivity anomaly whose presence is consistent with gas accumulation near the hy-drate stability zone...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} ocean wave-induced response of seafloor deposits. The linear wave theory is introduced for {{determination of the}} wave-induced pressure at the <b>mud</b> <b>line.</b> The seafloor deposit {{is assumed to be}} a saturated porous medium modelled by a two-phase system. The theory of mixture is used to derive the coupled governing equations. A simple material constitutive model is proposed based on the generalized plasticity-bounding surface formulation. Some comparisons of the model tests with experimental results are made. The simple model is capable of simulating both loose and dense sand behavior under monotonic and cyclic loading, drained and undrained conditions. A nonlinear finite element analysis procedure is presented. A fictitious freedom technique is used to treat the different nodal degrees of freedom due to the composition of coupled fields. A non-symmetric frontal solver subroutine is developed to accommodate the asymmetry due to the non-associated plastic flow rule. A simple artificial boundary is suggested to deal with the unbounded domain, which is easy to implement in the finite element program and universal to apply to nonlinear analysis. One important conclusion obtained from the numerical analyses is the influence of the coefficient of permeability on the susceptibility of the sand mass to liquefaction; for high values of permeability even a loose sand mass need not liquefy. This is in direct contrast to the commonly held view that the liquefaction potential is a function of density only. Two example cases are studied in detail. The first example examines the seabed response to the wave train at a pipeline site in Lake Ontario (Christian et al., 1974; Nataraja and Gill, 1983), where the deposit was measured to be loose and medium dense. The second example investigates the seafloor behavior under a storm wave as the Ekofisk tank site in the North Sea (Lee and Focht, 1975; Nataraja and Gill, 1983). Here the deposit was reported to be dense. The numerical analyses predict the susceptibility of the two sites to liquefaction which reflects the real situations. It helps build confidence in the numerical procedure adopted in this study and lends it credibility...|$|E

Hanging debris and structural damage were used to establish maximum surge heights of 3. 9 to 6 m MTL. Differences between maximum surge height and ground surface yielded flow depths of 1. 2 to 3. 2 m. Landward flow directions, as recorded by vegetation flop-overs, sand ripples, and debris shields averaged 250 °N yielding an oblique wave attack of 30 - 40 ° in central study area. Maximum inundation distances of gravel, i. e., shore-normal distance from mid-swash zone, ranged from 30 to 60 m. Maximum sand transport ranged from 90 to 400 m in distance from the shoreline.
