40|$|Introduction & Objective: Garlic (Allium sativum. L.) is an {{important}} dietary herb which its useful compounds may be altered during different processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of heating on the amounts of allicin, felavonol, felavonoid, total phenolic components, and antioxidant capacity of garlic. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study which was conducted at Shahr-e-Kord University of Medical Sciences in 2009, the alcoholic extract of fresh, <b>micro</b> <b>waved,</b> and boiled garlic were prepared. Then, their antioxidant capacities were evaluated in linoleic acid and ß-carotene linoleate system. The phenolic contents were measured with Folin–ciocalteu method, felavonoid or felavonol contents with aluminum coloride method, and allicine contents with spectrophotometry method. Collected data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS software. Differences between the means of groups were evaluated by a two-tailed t-test for independent samples. Results: The fresh and fresh boiled garlic had the highest and lowest antioxidant activities, respectively (P 0. 05). The flavonoid and phenolic compounds in fresh garlic were more than <b>micro</b> <b>waved</b> or boiled garlic. The allicin content in fresh garlic was also higher then <b>micro</b> <b>waved</b> or boiled garlic (P< 0. 05). All of these components were low in boiled garlic.

40|$|When a train {{enters a}} tunnel at high speed, {{sometimes}} an explosive sound {{occurs at the}} exit of the tunnel, shaking windows and doors of houses in the vicinity. That phenomenon {{is caused by a}} tunnel <b>micro</b> pressure <b>wave</b> (hereafter “micro pressure wave”), the mechanism of which is shown in Fig. 1.
