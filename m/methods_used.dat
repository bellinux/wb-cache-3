The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E

To automatically generate image dataset from Web, noise image removal should be conducted. Visual and semantic features {{are available to}} detect noise images.

In this paper, six types of noise image detection method are prepared: the <b>method</b> <b>using</b> visual feature, the <b>method</b> <b>using</b> semantic feature, two <b>methods</b> <b>using</b> both features in parallel and two <b>methods</b> <b>using</b> both features in serial.

Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.|$|E

In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously.
