5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> squall line. This line of severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning, the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E

Permanent exhibits include those on the Holocaust and other large-scale atrocities. It also houses temporary exhibits; one on Tibet was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011.|$|E

25|$|Menzies {{presided over}} a period of {{sustained}} economic boom and the beginnings of sweeping social change - with the arrivals of rock and roll music and television in the 1950s. In 1956, television in Australia began broadcasting, Melbourne hosted the Olympics and, for the first time, performing artist Barry Humphries performed the character of Edna Everage as a parody of a house-proud housewife of staid 1950s Melbourne suburbia (the character only later <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> critique of self-obsessed celebrity culture). It was the first of many of his satirical stage and screen creations based around quirky Australian characters.|$|E
25|$|By 1553, the Board of Ordnance in London had {{purchased}} more than 250 of Levett's guns. At a stroke, this English parson {{who had the}} armaments business thrust on him by {{death in the family}} had <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full-blown entrepreneur. Iron casting and cannon-making became England's first modern industrial economy. Old landowning families like the Sidneys, the Carylls, the Coverts and the Gratwickes rushed {{to cash in on the}} boom, which lasted for more than two centuries. The wars of Henry VIII were good for business: the 20 blast furnaces and 28 forges in Sussex in 1549 more than doubled in 25 years to 50 furnaces and 60 forges. The secret was in the English method of vertical casting.|$|E
25|$|The second release {{under the}} Method of Defiance moniker was a {{compilation}} style project focusing on drum 'n' bass. Inamorata stretched the concept out, pairing Laswell’s bass {{with a different}} combination of respected jazz and world musicians and drum 'n' bass producers on each track. Artists including Herbie Hancock, John Zorn, Pharoah Sanders, Nils Petter Molvaer, Toshinori Kondo and Buckethead were paired with drum 'n' bass producers including Amit, Paradox, Submerged, Evol Intent, Fanu and Corrupt Souls. He also released a full-on collaboration with Finnish drum 'n' bass maestro Fanu on Ohm Resistance (US) and Karl Records (Europe), entitled Lodge, which includes contributions from Molvaer and Bernie Worrell amongst others. The concept of the group has once again <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full band concept. In 2009, RareNoiseRecords released Live in Nihon, which showcased this new direction/grouping. The group now consisted of Laswell, Guy Licata, Dr. Israel, Toshinori Kondo and Bernie Worrell.|$|E

25|$|Following Canada's {{legislative}} {{independence from}} the United Kingdom (codified by the Statute of Westminster, 1931) relations—both statutory and ceremonial—between sovereign and First Nations continued unaffected as the British Crown in Canada <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> distinctly Canadian monarchy. Indeed, during the 1939 tour of Canada by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth—an event intended to express the new independence of Canada and its monarchy—First Nations journeyed to city centres like Regina, Saskatchewan, and Calgary, Alberta, {{to meet with the}} King and present gifts and other displays of loyalty. In the course of the Second World War that followed soon after George's tour, more than 3,000 Aboriginal and Métis Canadians fought for the Canadian Crown and country, some receiving personal recognition from the King, such as Tommy Prince, who was presented with the Military Medal and, on behalf of the President of the United States, the Silver Star by the King at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
25|$|V for Vendetta is a British graphic novel {{written by}} Alan Moore and {{illustrated}} by David Lloyd (with additional art by Tony Weare). Initially published {{in black and white}} as an ongoing serial in the short-lived UK anthology Warrior, it <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ten-issue limited series published by DC Comics. Subsequent collected editions have been typically published under DC's more specialized imprint Vertigo. The story depicts a dystopian and post-apocalyptic near-future history version of the United Kingdom in the 1990s, preceded by a nuclear war in the 1980s which had devastated {{most of the rest of}} the world. The fascist Norsefire party has exterminated its opponents in concentration camps and rules the country as a police state. The comics follow its title character and protagonist, V, an anarchist revolutionary dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask, as he begins an elaborate and theatrical revolutionist campaign to kill his former captors, bring down the fascist state and convince the people to abandon democracy in favour of anarchy, while inspiring a young woman, Evey Hammond, to be his protégé.|$|E

Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer and J.

[...] "Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman," [...] Hoover wrote while they were in prison, [...] "are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and return to the community will result in undue harm." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} {{inconclusive}} exchanges, {{the two sides}} prepared for a final confrontation in 1429. In March, Venice formally declared war on the Ottomans, but even then the conservative mercantile aristocracy running the Republic were uninterested in raising an army sufficient to protect Thessalonica, let alone to force the Sultan to seek terms. In early 1430, Murad was able to concentrate his forces against Thessalonica, which was finally taken by storm on 29 March 1430. The privations of the siege and the subsequent sack reduced the city to a shadow of its former self—from [...] inhabitants to —and necessitated large-scale resettlement in the following years. Venice concluded a peace treaty with the Sultan in July, recognizing the new status quo. Over the next few decades, the antagonism between Venice and the Ottomans <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rivalry over control of Albania.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} is a soca-pop song, and blends horns and {{background}} vocals with ukulele folk-pop and island percussion <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> programmed beat. It contains handclaps and subtle modern sound effects. Trainor uses an assertive throwback aural tone on the song. The rap verse in [...] "Title" [...] {{was compared to}} the works of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American duo Karmin. The song's lyrics see Trainor demanding her lover to put a name on their relationship status. It was described by the singer as [...] "call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and give me that title". Musically, Trainor felt the song showcased what her artistic style was about, and said, [...] "I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like… totally different sound." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News wrote that the song serves a lesson for women not {{to settle for a}} friends-with-benefits relationship.|$|E

Producer Rob Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer them a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album. However, after the release of The Fourth World, during Levine and Madden's {{senior year of high school}} in 1997, it had <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop. Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, [...] "Soap Disco", was a failure. According to Levine, the failure of the album was [...] "a huge disappointment" [...] that nearly led them to break up.
