6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> her letter. No, I {{will tell}} you its contents. Aunt Augusta had seen Edwin lunching at the Waldorf with a creature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't likely," [...] replied Madeline, thoughtfully. [...] "I must go {{back some}} time, though. Well, let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a few {{extracts}} from my mail." ...|$|E
60|$|Warn. Hold yet, sir, and let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> it: <b>You</b> cannot <b>read</b> my hand.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Groome, sir," [...] he pronounced, [...] "you are a wizard! You {{must have}} seen right through into the breast pocket of my coat. Allow <b>me</b> to <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a couple of letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Grace, a {{share of}} your seat I entreat," [...] she said gaily, heedless of stern looks. [...] "Nay! I'll die of {{laughing}} unless you let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} Lord Wellington's own words even more blunt," [...] said O'Moy, with a grim smile, {{and turned to}} the {{dispatch}} he held. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> exactly what he writes: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wrong?... God Almighty!" [...] {{burst out}} Blair, with hard passion. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} in this same paper." [...] With shaking hands he unfolded it, searched until he found what he wanted, and began to read: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it was {{a lovely}} catechism," [...] said Syme pathetically. [...] "Do let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> it <b>you.</b> It has only forty-three {{questions}} and answers, and some of the Marquis's answers are wonderfully witty. I like to be just to my enemy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bart, in The Simpsons, says: [...] "All right, you're right, you're right, let's, let's {{just forget}} about that. Here: let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> to <b>you</b> from my play. Ahem. cockney `Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga? Is it St. Swithin's Day already?' `'Tis,' replied Aunt Helga." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>You</b> <b>Read</b> to <b>Me,</b> I'll <b>Read</b> to You: Very Short Mother Goose Tales to Read Together is {{the third}} book in the <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> to <b>Me,</b> I'll <b>Read</b> to <b>You</b> series. It is written by Mary Ann Hoberman and {{illustrated}} by Michael Emberley.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{glad to hear}} it,' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; 'for {{the sake}} of his young carcase: as would otherways have {{suffered}} for it. Come here, young 'un; and let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a lectur', which is as well got over at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "you mustn't call me hard names. I shall {{remind you}} of the man whose works you are making <b>me</b> <b>read.</b> <b>You</b> know what he says--'The aesthete is, after all, only a dallier. The world lives and {{progresses}} by reason of its utilitarians.' This hill represents to me {{most of the things}} that are worth having in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> this," [...] he cried, {{separating}} the carbon copies {{and running the}} pages of manuscript into shape. [...] "It's my latest, and different from anything I've done. It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of it, and yet I've a sneaking idea it is good. You be judge. It's an Hawaiian story. I've called it 'Wiki-wiki.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> them to <b>you.</b> I gave {{notice to}} Isabel that I am come to dinner, {{and no doubt}} she had rather I were {{disposed}} of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you said}} you'd {{got a lot}} of books coming I thought there'd be {{something}} for <b>me</b> to <b>read.</b> Haven't <b>you</b> got any detective stories?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A similar {{series was}} Sydney station ATN-7's series Telestory (1961-1962). Somewhat similar series aired on BBC {{television}} from 1948 to 1953 called Saturday-Night Story.

6000|$|... “I {{wonder if}} you would care for one of my earlier books, The Reluctance of Lady Cullumpton,” said Mellowkent, hunting again through the bookshelf; “some people {{consider}} it my best novel. Ah, here it is. I see there are one or two spots on the cover, so I won’t ask more than three-and-ninepence for it. Do let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> how it opens: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed it does; {{but how it}} {{will make}} you love Him, and feel thankful to Him, and anxious not to waste the sufferings borne for your sake, and glad, perhaps, that you are bearing some small thing yourself. But you are spent, and I had better not talk more now. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a few prayers to help you, and then I will leave you, and come again to-morrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' he said, 'but {{you have}} not had to wade through over thirty of these gems in a single week. I have. I can assure you your views would undergo a change if you could go through what I have. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a selection. If that does not convert you, nothing will. If you will excuse me for a moment, Beckett, I will leave the groaning board, and fetch the manuscripts.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Let <b>Me</b> <b>Read</b> to <b>You</b> is an Australian {{television}} series which aired on Melbourne station GTV-9 during 1961.

Later episodes aired in a 10-minute time-slot.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{for your}} {{exceeding}} minuteness," [...] he said, [...] "in describing the monster, I {{might never have}} had it {{in my power to}} demonstrate to you what it was. In the first place, let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> to <b>you</b> a schoolboy account of the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class of Insecta--or insects. The account runs thus: ...|$|R
5000|$|Student B: Believe <b>me.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>read</b> {{the code}} too much, you will soon lose your mind. Very soon. I {{guarantee}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the good}} gentleman's study, I had a sight {{of some of}} the great poets of the world, and while he read my verses I got a taste of Milton, Spenser, and my own Shakespeare's noble sonnets. I saw what mine lacked; yet some of them rang true, so I took heart and trimmed them up in the fashion my masters set me. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> one or two, Ruth, while you tie your true lover's knots." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All kinds--financial, industrial, political, social. It's great stuff. By the way," [...] he {{continued}} with great animation, [...] "would {{you like to}} be my Minister of Labour? No? Well, I'm sorry. I half hoped you would. We're having no luck with them. The last one was thrown into the Bosphorous on Monday. Here's the report on it--no, that's the one on the shooting of the Minister of Religion--ah! here it is--Report on the Drowning of the Minister of Labour. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a bit of this: I call this one of the best reports, of its kind, that have come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I once met a {{girl who}} was {{something}} like them, only she didn't have such an easy time as they did, with a father to help, and a nice Sky-farm, and good luck generally. I've tried to write verses myself, but I always get into a muddle, and give it up. This makes me interested in other girls who can do it, and I want to help my friend. I'm sure she has talent, and I'd so like to give her a lift in some way. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a piece of hers and see what you think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear madam," [...] {{observed}} Mr Summers, {{looking at}} Mrs Foster over his spectacles, [...] "surely it is unnecessary {{for me to}} point out that this brief narrative does not give us the most distant conception of the terrors, the endurance, the heroism, incident to that night! Permit <b>me</b> to <b>read</b> <b>you</b> another paragraph. It is given more in detail and does better justice to the scene." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How well <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> witch!" [...] {{interposed}} Mr. Rochester: [...] "but {{what did}} you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?" ...|$|R
60|$|It touches <b>me</b> to <b>read</b> what <b>you</b> {{write of}} your poor mother. But, of course, at her age, each winter counts heavily. Do give her my love, {{and tell her}} that I asked you about her.|$|R
60|$|And so on. I {{forget the}} rest. Call it madness if you will--infatuation. I am an able man, a strong man: {{in ten years}} I should have owned a {{first-class}} hotel. I met her; and you see! I am a brigand, an outcast. Even Shakespear cannot do justice to what I feel for Louisa. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> some lines that I have written about her myself. However slight their literary merit may be, they express what I feel better than any casual words can. [He produces a packet of hotel bills scrawled with manuscript, and kneels at the fire to decipher them, poking it with a stick to make it glow].|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he {{said with}} an abrupt change of tone, [...] "I have told you how we found the Graham Lode, on which three of the richest claims have been {{contracted}} to me. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> the reports of different assayers to whom I submitted specimens." [...] He did so, and added: [...] "The original documents are here; you may examine and pass them round. But I must get on. These claims are mine, though my right to them might be contested by the directors of this Company--the cost of finding and proving them has been borne by myself--but, if you agree to their development and the abandoning of the Rain Bluff, I propose to hand them over as your property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, again, {{look at his}} friends. There {{is young}} First Principles. What a «head that fellow has got! Here, this article on India is by him. He'll knock up their Charter. He is a clerk in the India House. Up to the detail, you see. Let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> <b>you</b> this passage on monopolies. Then there is young Tribonian Quirk. By G--, what a mind that fellow has got! By G--, nothing but first {{principles}} will go down with these fellows! They laugh at anything else. By G--, sir, they look upon {{the administration of the}} present day as a parcel of sucking babes! When I was last in town, Quirk told me that he would not give that for all the public men that ever existed! He is keeping his terms at Gray's Inn. This article on a new Code is by him. Shows as plain as light, that, by sticking close to first principles, the laws of the country might be carried in every man's waistcoat pocket.' ...|$|E
60|$|Have yet {{patience}} with <b>me,</b> while I <b>read</b> <b>you</b> a single sentence {{out of the}} only book, properly {{to be called a}} book, that I have yet written myself, the one that will stand (if anything stand), surest and longest of all work of mine.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You will {{be pleased}} to hear that I have gone on very rapidly adding to my stock of poetry. Do come and let <b>me</b> <b>read</b> it to <b>you</b> under the old trees in the park [at Alfoxden]. We have {{little more than two}} months to stay in this place.'[42] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me one thing. I've often {{wanted to}} know, {{and now you}} speak of it I'll venture to ask. Did you care about <b>me</b> when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> Keats to <b>me</b> last summer?" ...|$|R
