5000|$|Émile [...] "Mimile" [...] Buisson (19 August 1902 - 28 February 1956) was a French gangster, and French {{public enemy}} No. 1 for 1950. A {{member of the}} French Gang <b>des</b> <b>Tractions</b> Avant, Buisson was {{responsible}} for over thirty murders and a hundred robberies. Buisson was pursued and caught by French detective of the Sûreté Nationale Roger Borniche, and was executed in 1956 by the guillotine.

5000|$|In France, the Gang <b>des</b> <b>Tractions</b> Avant was a {{criminal}} gang in the Pigalle quarter of Paris, made up of surviving members of the Carlingue militia, lapsed police officers and criminals from the French Resistance. Most of them had moved from collaboration with the German occupiers to Resistance, and then moved into organised crime - though even if their milieu changed, their behaviour and methods remained the same. The gang was known after its preferred vehicle, the Citroën 11CV [...] "Traction", used for hold-ups as violent as they were audacious.|$|R

This {{prototype}} diesel locomotive, no. 2801, {{was designed}} by Matériel <b>de</b> <b>Traction</b> Diesel Electrique (MTDE). This firm was established by the Dutch Werkspoor and French Schneiderworks {{with the purpose of}} designing and building standardised diesel lokomotives. In 1962 the prototype came into NS service and was well known for its defects; hence it was given its nickname. Therefore, this elegant locomotive was not long in service either. It was withdrawn in 1970. It was built by Werkspoor in Utrecht in 1962.|$|R
