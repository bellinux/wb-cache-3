5|$|There {{are several}} <b>moorings</b> for yachts and small craft {{on the west}} of the tidal basin.|$|E
5|$|August 24, 1827– Two {{people are}} killed when the Diamond Shoals Lightship becomes loose from its <b>moorings,</b> {{due to a}} landfalling {{hurricane}} along the state's coastline. Damage is reported across the eastern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda has an {{extensive}} marina with floating <b>moorings</b> for about 50 boats, two boat ramps and a sheltered channel {{out into the}} Barker Inlet, part of Gulf St Vincent. Recently expanded the marina now has hard stands for boats and some slipping facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal at Southcote {{is still}} used for {{pleasure}} boating; <b>moorings</b> for narrowboats are located between Southcote Lock and Burghfield Bridge. The canal is accessible from footpaths near Burghfield Bridge, Southcote Mill and Fobney Lock, and the towpath through Southcote is a designated portion of National Cycle Route 4.|$|E
5|$|The drain {{has been}} renamed as the Black Sluice Navigation by the Environment Agency. In order {{to use the}} navigation, an Environment Agency licence is required, and as there are no {{permanent}} <b>moorings</b> available on the drain, these are available for one day or seven days.|$|E
5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its <b>moorings.</b> The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} low, Erica brought strong winds to northern Queensland. Several large trees were uprooted, {{one of which}} fell on a car in Cape Tribulation and another on a house in Port Douglas. Numerous trees were defoliated and some boats {{were reported to have}} been pulling their <b>moorings</b> due to the wind. Power lines were also damaged by the low.|$|E
5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep <b>moorings</b> and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|At Briton Ferry, {{the canal}} ends under the M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, {{but there are}} plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a canal basin and <b>moorings</b> for Neath.|$|E
5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever built at the time—is damaged after breaking from its <b>moorings</b> at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock came to rest on a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point <b>moorings.</b> On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2012, {{the merits}} of the ten routes had been considered, {{including}} the economic, environmental and technical issues involved, and a broad outline of the corridor for the link was scheduled to be published in September. After that, consultation with landowners and stakeholders took place, to establish the final route, for which design of the channel and the associated locks, bridges, <b>moorings</b> and pumping stations could then begin.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments {{are most likely to be}} affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, <b>moorings,</b> dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E
5|$|Kelston Lock and weir have {{permanent}} <b>moorings</b> {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the lock and weir. The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor <b>moorings</b> and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E
5|$|On July15, the {{hurricane}} moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105mph (165km/h), or a Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum barometric pressure {{was estimated at}} 969mbar (28.61inHg). The hurricane's strong winds broke all of the boats from their <b>moorings</b> in the Matagorda harbor. Four ships were either lost or wrecked, and one schooner was washed ashore. The storm dissipated early on July16 after progressing further inland.|$|E
5|$|As the {{remnants}} of Ginny moved across Atlantic Canada, they produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 4.53in (113mm) in southern New Brunswick. Winds peaked at 99mph (160km/h) in Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The winds blew down trees in the Halifax area, and there were power outages reported there and in Antigonish. High waves broke boats from their <b>moorings,</b> causing them to either wash ashore or float out to sea. Ferry service across the region was canceled. In neighboring New Brunswick, the storm caused outages to telephone and electric services. Several injuries were reported, although there were no fatalities. The entirety of Prince Edward Island was also left without power.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by {{the defeat}} at the battle, Adolf Hitler ordered the {{majority}} of the surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged Admiral Hipper while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her <b>moorings,</b> and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952; her bell resides in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for <b>moorings,</b> and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Battleship Row and the island's naval field, the fixed <b>moorings</b> {{on the western}} side of Ford Island (capable of securing battleships or aircraft carriers) were high-priority targets. Just west of the island, the seaplane tender Curtiss was hit by a crashing dive bomber, a bomb and fragments of another bomb. She was then unsuccessfully attacked by a Japanese midget submarine, which fired a torpedo before being sunk by the destroyer Monaghan. Hangar 6 and several patrol seaplanes and other aircraft on Ford Island (33 out of 70 of the island's planes) were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the <b>moorings</b> on 16 August, and Bellerophon made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves. A schooner was torn from its <b>moorings</b> at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|On the Potomac River, where tides ran {{well above}} normal, ships broke free from their <b>moorings</b> and drifted downstream. In one instance, a large {{steamship}} called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell. At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000, {{and at least}} two dozen individuals in the city suffered injuries from falling debris.|$|E
5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their <b>moorings.</b> Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E
5|$|Strong waves caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} coastline, especially on the southern portion of Bermuda. The strong waves broke a boat from its <b>moorings</b> at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two people, tried to save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot (6m) waves, which dropped several feet {{of water in the}} ship; however, ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a sea wall in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway {{opened in}} late 1853, {{and the effects}} on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite {{petitions}} from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was maintained for drain purposes only. Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until {{the early years of}} the 20th century. There is still a public right of navigation as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of <b>moorings</b> along its route.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination {{declared}} a rain pre-emergency for {{the province of}} Castellón in the anticipation that Hurricane Vince would bring rains capable of flooding. The Instituto Nacional de Meteorología (INM) issued a bulletin that warned of a 40% chance of flooding. Four Spanish autonomous communities (Asturias, Catalonia, Castile and León, and Galicia) issued flood warnings, and Canarias issued a wind warning. Spanish fishing fleets off the Andalusian coast returned to port and weathered the storm on their <b>moorings</b> {{rather than in the}} open ocean.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began when}} the large and {{unwieldy}} CSS Virginia steamed into Hampton Roads {{on the morning of}} March 8, 1862. Captain Buchanan intended to attack as soon as possible. Virginia was accompanied from her <b>moorings</b> on the Elizabeth River by Raleigh and Beaufort, and was joined at Hampton Roads by the James River Squadron, Patrick Henry, Jamestown, and Teaser. When they were passing the Union batteries at Newport News, Patrick Henry was temporarily disabled by a shot in her boiler that killed four of her crew. After repairs, she returned and rejoined the others.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} Admiral's {{flagship}} {{threw the}} Swedish forces into disorder, and soon Svärdet, next in line as fleet flagship, was surrounded by the allied admirals and set ablaze by a Dutch fireship after an extended artillery duel. Only 50 of the 650-strong crew escaped the gun battle and the inferno, and among the dead was the acting Admiral Claes Uggla. After losing two of its highest ranking commanders {{as well as its}} two largest ships, the Swedish fleet fled in disarray. Solen later ran aground; Järnvågen, Neptunus and three smaller vessels were captured. Äpplet later sank after breaking her <b>moorings</b> off Dalarö.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} the wider arm is {{referred}} to as the Northwest Arm, while the eastern arm is known as the Northeast Arm. The two arms connect just below Church Point, southeast of where West River meets the Northwest Arm. The harbour continues southeast-ward, then southward toward the Atlantic Ocean. The Northwest Arm extends northwest until it meets the mouth of West River at the West River Falls. The Northeast Arm extends north, then curves northeast under the East River Bridge, until it meets the mouth of the East River. There is a very small island in the arm, named Hen Island. <b>Moorings</b> were installed in the arm in Spring 2017.|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide <b>moorings</b> for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944, {{the ship}} was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had {{advanced}} so far, however, {{that it was necessary}} to move the ship farther away from the front, {{despite the fact that she}} had only one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen, arriving in Kiel on 2 February. She entered the Germaniawerft shipyard for refitting. On 3 May, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and severely damaged the ship. Her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her <b>moorings</b> at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, after the end of the war, Admiral Hipper was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since been returned to Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed by {{the failure}} to sink {{merchant}} ships in that battle, Adolf Hitler ordered {{the majority of the}} surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her <b>moorings,</b> and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952 and her bell is currently on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juan's maximum {{sustained}} {{wind speed}} at landfall in Nova Scotia was measured at 100mph (155km/h). The urban concentration surrounding Halifax Harbour bore {{the brunt of}} the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145mph (230km/h). Wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of Halifax Harbour snapped their <b>moorings</b> after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65ft (20m). Significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour, particularly in the Bedford Basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action. Storm surges of 5 to 7feet (1.5 to 2m) were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in Halifax Harbour. Rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm. There were no rainfall reports greater than 2inches (52mm).|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor <b>moorings</b> and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Nairana had {{her final}} {{overhaul}} at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured {{a significant portion}} of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana broke her <b>moorings</b> during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.|$|E
5|$|Six {{days after}} the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war was signed, Mikasa sank at her <b>moorings</b> after a fire and {{magazine}} explosion at Sasebo {{on the night of}} 11/12 September 1905 that killed 251 crewmen. She was refloated on 7 August 1906, reconstructed and repaired at Sasebo Naval Arsenal. The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her existing armament with more powerful 45-calibre twelve-inch and six-inch guns during the two years it took to repair the ship. Mikasa was restored to active service on 24 August 1908. During World War I, she served on coast-defence duties, based at Maizuru, during 1914–15 and was then assigned to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, {{for the rest of the}} war. The ship supported the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War during 1921 and was reclassified on 1 September 1921 as a first-class coast-defence ship. On 17 September, Mikasa ran aground near Askold Island off Vladivostok, but was not seriously damaged.|$|E
