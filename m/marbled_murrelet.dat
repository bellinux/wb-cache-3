5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in riparian forest strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
25|$|Seabirds {{spend most}} of their lives at sea and are adapted to ocean life. Some even sleep in the water, though they must all return to land to lay their eggs. Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the common murre, tufted puffin, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet,</b> the black oystercatcher, auklets, many {{varieties}} of cormorants, the western gull, and glaucous-winged gull. Many seabird species are endemic and found nowhere else.|$|E
25|$|The San Juan Islands {{host the}} {{greatest}} concentration of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the contiguous United States. Great blue herons (Ardea herodias), black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachman), and numerous shorebirds are found {{along the shore}} and in winter, the islands are home to trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and other waterfowl. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), northern harriers (Circus cyaneus), barred owls (Strix varia) and other birds of prey are found. In addition diving birds such as rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), pigeon guillemots (Cepphus columba) and endangered <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> (Brachyramphus marmoratus) frequent the surrounding seas. Western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), which were eliminated from the islands 50 years ago because of competition for nesting sites by non-native European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), were recently restored to San Juan Island thanks {{to the efforts of}} volunteers and conservation organizations.|$|E
50|$|Stand size is also {{important}} in nest sites. Marbled murrelets more commonly occupy stands greater than 500 acres (202 ha) than stands less than 100 acres (40 ha). However, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> may nest in remnant old-growth trees or groves that are surrounded by younger trees. In California, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> are usually absent from stands less than 60 acres (24 ha) in size. In Washington, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> are found more often when old-growth and mature forests make up over 30% of the landscape. Fewer <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> are found when clearcut and meadow areas {{make up more than}} 25% of the landscape. Concentrations of <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> offshore are almost always adjacent to old-growth or mature forests onshore, although <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> may not use the interior of dense stands.|$|R
50|$|In {{northern}} {{regions where}} coniferous forests nest sites are unavailable, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> occupy alpine or tundra near the ocean. In Washington and Oregon, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> commonly nest in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) dominated stands. They also select stands dominated by mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) for nesting. In California, nests {{are most often}} located in redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) dominated stands with scattered Sitka spruce, western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Douglas-fir. Marbled murrelets also occur in stands dominated by Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana).|$|R
50|$|Clayoquot Sound {{is home to}} wolves, black bears, cougars, grey whales, orcas, porpoises, seals, sea lions, river otters, bald eagles, osprey, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets,</b> Pacific loons, Roosevelt elk, martens, and raccoons.|$|R
500|$|While the {{definition}} of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend {{their lives on the}} ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the snow petrel, the nests of which have been found [...] inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites. The <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> nests inland in old growth forest, seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on. Other species, such as the California gull, nest and feed inland on lakes, and then move to the coasts in the winter. Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, swamps and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and agricultural land. In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors. Some seabirds, principally those that nest in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes do, will migrate over land as well.|$|E
2500|$|This native area {{provides}} a unique environment with heavy seasonal rains up to [...] annually. Cool coastal air and fog drip keep this forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, {{causing them to}} depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, especially complete recycling of the trees when dead. This forest community includes coast Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, tanoak, western hemlock, and other trees, along {{with a wide variety}} of ferns, mosses, mushrooms, and redwood sorrel. Redwood forests provide habitat for a variety of amphibians, bird, mammals, and reptiles. Old-growth redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened spotted owl and the California-endangered <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scientists at Redwood National Park have {{established}} a connection between human presence in <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> territory and corvid predation of <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> chicks. Corvid populations, such as Steller's jays, crows, and ravens, are expanding into old-growth forests. Lured by food scraps left by campers and hikers, with increased access aggravated by the patchwork forests created by industrial logging, corvids more frequently discover <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> nests in areas where these predator species were not previously found.|$|E
50|$|Birds that nest in {{this park}} include bald eagle, the Peale's {{subspecies}} of peregrine falcon, black-billed magpie, and Steller's jay. Maine birds include tufted and horned puffin, common and thick-billed murre, and <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nestlings fledge in 28 days. Young <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> {{remain in}} the nest longer than other alcids and molt into their {{juvenile}} plumage before leaving the nest. Fledglings fly directly from the nest to the ocean.|$|R
50|$|From {{southeast}} Alaska southward, <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> use mature or {{old-growth forest}} stands near the coastline for nesting. These forests are generally characterized by large trees (>32 inches cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.)), a multistoried canopy, moderate to high canopy closure or an open crown canopy, large snags, and numerous downed snags in {{all stages of}} decay. Marbled murrelets tend to nest in the oldest trees in the stand. In Oregon, forests begin to exhibit old-growth characteristics at about 175 to 250 years of age. Moss, on which <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> nest, forms on the limbs of Douglas-fir that are more than 150 years old.|$|R

50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> {{is a small}} (25 cm), chunky auk with {{a slender}} black bill. It has pointed wings and plumage that varies by season. The non-breeding plumage is {{typically}} white underneath with a black crown, nape, wings and back. The bird closely resembles its closest relative, the Long-billed murrelet; in fact, these species were considered conspecific up until 1998. In breeding plumage, both have a brown mottled body and face. The Long-billed has a pale white throat, lacking in the Marbled. In winter plumage, the <b>Marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> has a white neck collar, absent in Long-billed. The <b>Marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> is shorter-billed and slightly smaller than the Long-billed murrelet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> is {{considered}} globally endangered, with {{some evidence of}} decline across its range {{over the last few}} decades.

50|$|Cape Meares National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge of the Oregon Coast. It {{is one of}} six National Wildlife Refuges in the Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Located on Cape Meares, {{the refuge}} was {{established}} in 1938 to protect a remnant of coastal old-growth forest and the surrounding habitat used by breeding seabirds. The area provides a home for a threatened bird species, the <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets.</b> Peregrine falcons, once at the brink of extinction, have nested here since 1987. The refuge, {{with the exception of}} the Oregon Coast Trail, was designated a Research Natural Area in 1987.|$|R
50|$|The Kittlitz's murrelet, (Brachyramphus brevirostris) {{is a small}} alcid {{found in}} the waters off Alaska and Eastern Siberia. This near {{threatened}} species is, like the closely related <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet,</b> unusual for seabirds in not being colonial, nesting instead in isolated locations on mountain tops, where the nests were known to Native Americans for many years before skeptical ornithologists described and photographed them. It is a poorly known and little studied species, although concern over its status {{and that of the}} closely related <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> has led to a recent increase in research.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> (Brachyramphus marmoratus) {{is a small}} seabird {{from the}} North Pacific. It {{is a member of}} the auk family. It nests in old-growth forests or on the ground at higher latitudes where trees cannot grow. Its habit of nesting in trees was {{suspected}} but not documented until a tree-climber found a chick in 1974, making it one of the last North American bird species to have its nest described. The <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> has declined in number since humans began logging its nest trees in the latter half of the 19th century. The decline of the <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet</b> and its association with old-growth forests, at least in the southern part of its range, have made it a flagship species in the forest preservation movement. In Canada (north of 50° North Latitude) and Alaska, the declines are not so obvious because populations are much larger and the survey techniques have not had sufficient power to detect changes.|$|E
50|$|It {{closely resembles}} the <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelet,</b> {{of which it}} was {{considered}} a subspecies until 1998, when Friesen et al. showed that the mtDNA variation was greater between these two forms than between marbled and Kittlitz's murrelets.|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms of {{population}} differentiation in highly vagile {{species such as}} seabirds are poorly understood. Previous studies of <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> (Brachyramphus marmoratus; Charadriiformes: Alcidae) found significant pop- ulation genetic structure, but could not determine whether this structure is due to historical vicariance (e. g., due to Pleistocene glaciers), isolation by distance, drift or selection in peripheral populations, or nesting habitat selection. To discriminate among these possibilities, we analyzed sequence variation in nine nuclear introns from 120 <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> sampled from British Columbia to the western Aleutian Islands. Mismatch distributions indicated that murrelets underwent at least one population expansion during the Pleistocene and probably are not in genetic equilibrium. Maximum-likelihood analysis of allele frequencies suggested that murrelets from "mainland" sites (from the Alaskan Peninsula east) are genetically different {{from those in the}} Aleutians and that these two lineages diverged prior to the last glaciation. Analyses of molecular variance, as well as estimates of gene flow derived using coalescent theory, indicate that population genetic structure is best explained by peripheral isolation of murrelets in the Aleutian Islands, rather than by selection associated with different nesting habitats. No isolation-by-distance effects could be detected. Our results are consistent with a rapid expansion of murrelets from a single refugium during the early-mid Pleistocene, subsequent isolation and divergence in two or more refugia during the final Pleistocene glacial advance, and secondary contact following retreat of the ice sheets. Population genetic structure now appears to be maintained by distance effects combined with small populations and a highly fragmented habitat in the Aleutian Islands...|$|R
40|$|Managers {{of marine}} {{protected}} areas (MPAs) must often seek ways {{to allow for}} visitation while minimizing impacts to the resources {{they are intended to}} protect. Using shipboard observers, we quantified the "zone of disturbance" for Kittlitz's and <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> (Brachyramphus brevirostris and B. marmoratus) exposed to large cruise ships traveling through Glacier Bay National Park, one of the largest MPAs in North America. In the upper reaches of Glacier Bay, where Kittlitz's murrelets predominated, binary logistic regression models predicted that 61 % of all murrelets within 850 m perpendicular distance of a cruise ship were disturbed (defined as flushing or diving), whereas in the lower reaches, where <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets</b> predominated, this percentage increased to 72 %. Using survival analysis, murrelets in both reaches were found to react at greater distances when ships approached indirectly, presumably because of the ship's larger profile, suggesting murrelets responded to visual rather than audio cues. No management-relevant covariates (e. g., ship velocity, route distance from shore) were found to be important predictors of disturbance, as distance from ship to murrelet accounted for > 90 % of the explained variation in murrelet response. Utilizing previously published murrelet density estimates from Glacier Bay, and applying an average empirical disturbance probability (68 %) out to 850 m from a cruise ship's typical route, we estimated that a minimum of 9. 8 - 19. 6 % of all murrelets in Glacier Bay are disturbed per ship entry. Whether these disturbance levels are inconsistent with Park management objectives, which include conserving wildlife as well as providing opportunities for visitation, depends in large part on whether disturbance events caused by cruise ships have impacts on murrelet fitness, which remains uncertain...|$|R
25|$|Since crows and magpies {{have benefited}} and even {{increased}} in numbers due to human development, {{it was suggested}} that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined American crows, which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened <b>marbled</b> <b>murrelets.</b> However, Steller's jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds' nests than American crows and common ravens. Therefore, the human relationship with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation, compared to other factors such as habitat destruction. Similarly a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between Eurasian magpie numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.|$|R
