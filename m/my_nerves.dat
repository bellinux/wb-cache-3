500|$|In April 2004, {{producers}} {{were concerned}} that the family were losing popularity with viewers, and {{a decision was made}} to write Pooja Shah out of the show for a while, but to bring her back with a sexier image to rival Michelle Ryan, who played Zoe Slater. Shah expressed a dislike of her character, saying [...] "I'm fed up with it now. Kareena's too dowdy. I wanted Kareena to be different, to stand out. If I'm completely honest, I can't stand her – she just grates on <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> She hasn't got many friends, but then I wouldn’t be her friend if I met her." [...] The family had failed and rumours began that the entire family would be killed off in a house fire. A further attempt to [...] "spice up" [...] the family was made in July 2004 by bringing back character Sasha Perkins, played by Jemma Walker, and having her move in with the Ferreiras.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 July 1943, Frankl {{organized}} a closed {{event for the}} Scientific Society at Theresienstadt, {{and with the help}} of Leo Baeck, offered a series of open lectures, including [...] "Sleep and Sleep Disturbances", [...] "Body and Soul", [...] "Medical Care of the Soul", [...] "Psychology of Mountaineering", [...] "How to keep <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> healthy?", [...] "Medical ministry", [...] "Existential Problems in Psychotherapy", and [...] "Social Psychotherapy". His father Gabriel died of pulmonary edema and pneumonia at Theresienstadt.|$|E

2500|$|Although Mauresmo {{had been}} one of the top singles players for several years, she did not have success in winning Grand Slam tournaments until 2006. Her talents were never questioned, but Mauresmo was criticized for her mental {{strength}} after succumbing to nerves in those events. In consecutive Wimbledon semifinals, she lost to Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport after leading comfortably. Before her 2006 Australian Open title, Mauresmo was often touted as [...] "the greatest women's player never to win a Grand Slam." [...] After winning the 2006 Wimbledon title, Mauresmo openly joked, [...] "I don’t want anyone to talk about <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carothers {{hated the}} public {{speaking}} {{that was necessary}} to maintain his high-profile. In a letter to Frances Spencer in January 1932, he related, [...] "I did go up to New Haven during the holidays and made {{a speech at the}} organic symposium. It was pretty well received but the prospect of having to make it ruined the preceding weeks and it was necessary to resort to considerable amounts of alcohol to quiet <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> for the occasion. … My nervousness, moroseness and vacillation get worse as time goes on, and the frequent resort to drinking doesn't bring about any permanent improvement. 1932 looks pretty black to me just now." ...|$|E
2500|$|He drinks whiskey or brandy {{frequently}} and in relatively large quantities. For example, in The High Window, {{he gets out}} a bottle of Four Roses, and pours glasses for himself, for Det. Lt. Breeze and for Spangler. At other times he is drinking Old Forester, a Kentucky bourbon: [...] "I hung up and fed myself a slug of Old Forester to brace <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> for the interview. As I was inhaling it I heard her steps tripping along the corridor." [...] (The Little Sister) However, in Playback he orders a double Gibson at a bar while tailing Betty Mayfield. Also, in The Long Goodbye, he and Terry Lennox drink Gimlets.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's cheerful," [...] I remarked, and {{wheeling}} round, asked Ragnall {{straight out}} if he wished to persevere in this business, for {{to tell the truth}} <b>my</b> <b>nerve</b> was shaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes I doubt, too," [...] said Slone. [...] "But I {{only have}} to look at Wildfire to get back <b>my</b> <b>nerve....</b> Lucy, that will be the grandest race ever run!" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I didn't trust myself, you see; I've lost <b>my</b> <b>nerve,</b> so I {{applied for}} short leave. I'm sailing for Vancouver on the Empress. I leave here {{the day after}} to-morrow.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Amanda Root for The Musical Express magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show 'non-sexist humour.' Did it exist? [...] "Not unless it’s cleverly done. When we did Three of a Kind we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a traffic warden, or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls are stupid. Sketches beginning like that used to really get on <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> But {{as soon as we}} found the right team of writers, they weren’t into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK." [...] She went on to win her first BAFTA Award in the category of Best Light Entertainment Performance for Three of a Kind in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|While Rieber's {{personal}} connection to Tim gave the character {{a sense of}} realism, it also {{was a source of}} frustration for the writer: he later said, [...] "I've found it difficult to like Tim now and then. [...] Of course he gets on <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> [...] He's a lot like someone I spent years learning not to be." [...] This dislike led to a perceived decline in the quality of the book as Rieber wrote his final batch of issues, with the character of Tim often sidelined in the stories in favor of his girlfriend, Molly. This preference also affected Tim's character in other ways, as Rieber requested that Molly not be used in the book after his departure to allow him to develop his own projects using her — causing the in-story break up of the two young lovers that led to them not seeing each other for many years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Grey {{became friends}} with a fellow Midwestern architect, Myron Hunt. [...] The two rode horses {{together}} on Sunday mornings in Pasadena and formed a partnership in that city as Hunt and Grey. [...] Grey later wrote that he began by working {{only a short time}} each day [...] "until <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> got in better shape." [...] Grey's health again failed {{during the early years of}} his partnership with Hunt, and he took a long trip to the South Sea Islands. [...] Yet, it was during his partnership with Hunt that Grey produced some of his finest work. [...] The two designed fine residences for the wealthy of Pasadena and also worked on larger projects, including schools, churches and hotels. [...] In 1905, The Architectural Record published articles on both Grey and Hunt, noting: [...] "Both Mr. Hunt and Mr. Grey stand for the attempt to naturalize in this country the best traditions of European architecture. [...] Mr. Grey, for instance, believes that a very genuine American style is in the process of making; but that as yet it is only in its infancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he won't let me escape," [...] Starling protested. [...] "He doesn't {{understand}} danger. I am {{not made}} like him. <b>My</b> <b>nerve</b> has gone. I {{came into this}} too late in life." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>my</b> <b>nerve</b> broke, {{the cold}} sweat poured {{from my face}} and I fled from the hut as a man might from a scene in hell, {{followed}} by the low mocking laugh of Zikali.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. That {{was where}} <b>my</b> <b>nerve</b> broke down. I only made one bad break--I think. I said I couldn't see why hiring land to men to farm wasn't {{as much a}} {{business}} proposition as anything else." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{smiled at}} the idea of this courteous, little, mincing {{creature}} ruffling <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|E

60|$|NAPOLEON. Ouf! One cannot {{always be}} at one's best. Twice {{before in my}} life I have lost <b>my</b> <b>nerve</b> and behaved like a poltroon. But I warn you not to judge my quality by these {{involuntary}} moments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore she's almost gone," [...] he said, dismally. [...] "It took <b>my</b> <b>nerve,</b> but I felt of her face.... Thet orful wail is {{her breath}} chokin' in her throat.... Like a death-rattle, only long instead of short." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Holley, I reckon you see--clearer 'n me," [...] said Bostil, plaintively. [...] "'Pears as if I {{never had}} a hard knock before. Fer <b>my</b> <b>nerve's</b> broke. I can't hope.... Lucy's gone! ... Ain't there anythin' to do but wait?" ...|$|R

60|$|RUTH. He used me {{worse than}} ever. He couldn't break <b>my</b> <b>nerve,</b> but I lost my health; {{and then he}} began {{knocking}} the children about. I couldn't stand that. I wouldn't go back now, if he were dying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You've {{been told}} that he raves. But you didn't know how. Why, it gets even <b>my</b> <b>nerve!</b> It fascinated me, but once was enough. I couldn't stand to see his face when his Huns come back to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} taken her to save the fuss--I really would--it's not my fault the thing's come out. I'm on a risky job. To have her with me might ruin the whole thing; it would affect <b>my</b> <b>nerve.</b> It isn't safe for her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hell, no!" [...] {{spat out}} his father, losing his pipe in his vehemence. [...] "Son, I lost my cattle, my ranch. An' then <b>my</b> <b>nerve.</b> I'm not makin' excuses. I just fell down ... but I'm not {{too old to}} make another start with you to steer me." ...|$|R

60|$|Consider, if you please. For {{six days}} I had been {{oscillating}} within a pretty complete circumference of alarms.
