25|$|Empedocles {{noted the}} {{limitation}} and narrowness of human perceptions. We see {{only a part}} but fancy that we have grasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection <b>must</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the thing from every side. It is the business of a philosopher, while laying bare the fundamental difference of elements, to show the identity that exists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Because the Histeridae {{family can}} be found on carrion, they have proven to be {{important}} in certain forensic investigations. The predacious Hister beetles will feed on the various insects on the body, primarily Diptera. To estimate a person's time of death, forensic investigators <b>must</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the insects on the body and determine time of colonization. If the Histeridae beetles are present, the investigator can assume that some of the other insects have been eaten by the Hister beetles. Due to their importance in forensic entomology, research is continually being conducted on this family's life cycle and development, their prevalence in specific locations, and their geographical distribution.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach {{to the study of}} history that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact that}} it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one <b>must</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E

Still less <b>must</b> you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the pines, oaks, beeches, of an English park, where each tree has had space to develop itself freely into {{a more or less}} rounded form. You <b>must</b> not even <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the tropic forests. For there, from the immense diversity of forms, twenty varieties of tree will grow beneath each other, forming a close-packed heap of boughs and leaves, from the ground to a hundred feet and more aloft.|$|R

2500|$|Though {{he agrees}} with Bernhard in that the poem seems to create two themes, one which argues for devotion from a younger lover to one who will not be around much longer, and another which urges the young lover to enjoy his {{fleeting}} youth, James Schiffer asserts that the final couplet, instead of being unneeded and unimportant, brings the two interpretations together. [...] In order to understand this, he explains that the reader <b>must</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the preceding sonnets, 71 and 72, and the subsequent sonnet, 74. [...] He explains: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of his opinion in this case, Marshall began the careful work of {{determining}} what the phrase [...] "commerce...among the several states" [...] means in the Constitution. He stressed that one <b>must</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> whether the commerce in question has wide-ranging effects, suggesting that commerce which does [...] "affect other states" [...] may be interstate commerce, even if it does not cross state lines. Of course, the steamboats in this case did cross a state line, but Marshall suggested that his opinion had a broader scope than that. Indeed, Marshall's opinion in Gibbons would be cited by the Supreme Court much later when it upheld aspects of the New Deal in cases like Wickard v. Filburn in 1942. But, the opinion in Gibbons can also be read more narrowly. After all, Marshall also wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl D. Atkins {{argues that}} readers are misinterpreting {{the type of}} love {{depicted}} in the sonnets as homosexual. He believes that we <b>must</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it with an eye that considers the concepts of love in Shakespeare's time. He sees {{the relationship between the}} speaker and the young man as a passionate friendship that is more pure than heterosexual relationships and in some cases can even take precedence over marriage. [...] He puts an emphasis in distinguishing between intellectual lover, or love of the mind, and animal love, or love of the body. The sonnets are writing about a pure platonic form of love and modern readers are injecting too much sexual politics into his or her criticism. Atkins sees the sonnets more as a chronicle of underlying emotions experienced by lovers of all kinds whether it is heterosexual, homosexual or passionate friendship: adoration, longing, jealousy, disappointment, grief, reconciliation, and understanding.|$|E
