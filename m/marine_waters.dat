40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} losses of weight and length in specimens of Atherinella brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1825) after fixation in formalin 10 % during ten days, and posterior preservation in ethanol 70 % for 45 days, in two solvents: freshwater and <b>marine</b> <b>water.</b> Additionally, correction factors were proposed {{to calculate the}} correction for weight and length from preserved specimens. The specimens were weighted and measured after collection (fresh), and with 10, 20, 27, 34, 41 and 55 days of fixation plus preservation. The largest losses in weight occurred during the first 20 days (10. 35 ± 0. 31 % - freshwater; 11. 29 ± 0. 44 % - <b>marine</b> <b>water),</b> continuing with lesser intensity up to the 27 th day in freshwater dilution, {{and up to the}} 34 th day in <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> dilution. Weight losses stabilized by the 34 th day for both freshwater (11. 77 ± 0. 33 %) and <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> (13. 62 ± 0. 41 %). The largest losses in the total length for the two methods were also observed in the first 20 days (7. 42 ± 0. 27 % - freshwater; 9. 76 ± 0. 26 - <b>marine</b> <b>water),</b> stabilizing after the 27 th day in freshwater (8. 60 ± 0. 26 %) and 20 th day in <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> (9. 76 ± 0. 26 %). The losses of weight and total length were significantly dependent on fish size, with smaller individuals suffering the most significant losses. Complete regression equations were proposed for the retro-calculation of fresh weight and total length from the preserved specimens for freshwater (Wfresh = 1. 0536 W P + 0. 0416; TLfresh = 0. 9588 TL P + 5. 8437) and <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> (Wfresh = 1. 0868 W P + 0. 0451; TLfresh = 0. 8621 TL P + 10. 425) ...|$|R
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal <b>marine</b> <b>waters,</b> swamps and marine wetlands.

Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae.

Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E

5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal <b>marine</b> <b>waters.</b> The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E

5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore <b>marine</b> <b>waters.</b> Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died {{out at the end of}} the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully <b>marine</b> <b>waters.</b> Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E

40|$|Aquaculture is {{currently}} {{one of the}} fastest growing food production sectors in the world. Increase in nutrients and organic wastes lead to general deterioration of water quality. The problem of water quality is associated with both physical and chemical factors, as well as microbiological water quality. Heterotrophic bacteria play an important role in the process of decomposition of organic matter in water environment and indicate eutrophication process. Here we present our experience and knowledge on bacterial properties of <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> in the Adriatic fish farms with European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L., 1758), with an emphasis on enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria in <b>marine</b> <b>water.</b> We applied two temperatures of incubation, as well as two methods for enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria: substrate SimPlate® test and spread plate method on conventional artificial media (Marine agar and Tryptic Soy agar with added NaCl). The results of analysis of bacteriological properties of <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> in the Adriatic fish farms showed that enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria in <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> depends on the applied incubation temperature and media for enumeration. At the same time, the incubation temperature of 22 C favours more intense growth of marine heterotrophic bacteria, whereas a SimPlate test gives higher values of heterotrophic bacteria.
