She was also less talented than Olga, but worked harder and was more dedicated to seeing projects through to completion than her elder sister. Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky, the family's guard at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk, felt Tatiana [...] "had no liking for art. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been better}} for her had she been a man." [...] Others felt Tatiana's artistic talents were better expressed in handiwork and in her talent for choosing attractive fashions and creating elegant hair styles. Her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova later wrote that Tatiana had a great talent for making clothing, embroidery and crochet and that she dressed her mother's long hair {{as well as any}} professional hair stylist.|$|E

[...] "I wasn't embarrassed because we all learned something from it.

If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health."

40|$|Abstract: Trust {{establishment}} {{seems to}} be the most difficult problem in mobility and multi-homing management. Many protocol proposals assume the presence of some security infrastructure (e. g. a Public-Key Infrastructure). However, building such a global infrastructure has not taken place, <b>maybe</b> because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be too expensive and difficult to deploy. In this paper, we introduce a security context establishment procedure that utilizes reverse hash chains, and does not require pre-existing security information. The procedure is known to be vulnerable to an active Man-in-the-Middle attack in the first message exchange, however, the procedure is efficient, and does not have inherent scalability problems. Key words: security, mobility management, multi-homing management, and trust establishment 1...|$|R
500|$|Many reviewers {{and writers}} were {{critical}} of {{the manner in which}} Patrick Hemingway edited the work. Paul Gray [...] titled his review of the book [...] "Where's Papa?", answering with the opening sentence, [...] "He's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work", pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway's editing of the manuscript. Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been [...] "outraged by his sons' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication" [...] and was outraged that [...] "Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers, Jack and Gregory, share his belief that 'this job was worth doing'". [...] Burwell also wonders [...] whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published, pointing to [...] his statement, [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better to wait until I'm dead to publish it", although she concedes that works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Kafka were unfinished and published posthumously. During the final two decades of his life, Hemingway had published two novels but since his death, works continue to be published. Writing in The New Yorker in 1998, Joan Didion was extremely {{critical of the}} Hemingway family and estate for [...] commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy. [...] "The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in his or her work is to make it", she wrote, adding that True at First Light should not have been [...] "molded" [...] and published.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted. Interviewed in 2006, Tony Rundle, Premier of Tasmania from 1996 to 1998, admitted that, {{because there was no}} trial, the evidence made public was possibly insufficient to support that Bryant had been the gunman: [...] "At the time, the view was that a trial could do no good for the victims and their families. Now I think maybe that wasn't the case. If all the evidence was heard, then <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely.

I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to ask myself if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role.

2500|$|On July 26, 1976, Gacy {{employed}} an 18-year-old named David Cram. On August 21, Cram {{moved into}} his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was inebriated. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then {{informed him that}} he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the Army, kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: [...] "Dave, you really don't know who I am. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be good if you give me what I want." [...] Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom. After this incident, Cram moved out of Gacy's home and subsequently left PDM Contractors, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years. Shortly after Cram had vacated Gacy's residence, another employee of PDM Contractors, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved into Gacy's house.|$|E

By this time, {{each member}} of the group {{increasingly}} began taking time off from SNL: Taccone for television work, Schaffer for directorial efforts (The Watch), and Samberg with leading film roles. The trio found it increasingly difficult to get together and work, as they all lived in different cities.

Linda Stasi of the New York Post gave the show one and a half stars, saying, [...] "They tried for the tried and true, hoping they'd get The Sopranos meets Grey's Anatomy while filling the hole House left in the schedule.
