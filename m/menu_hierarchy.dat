40|$|One of {{the ways}} of {{decreasing}} selection times in displayed menus is {{through the use of}} radial layouts which shorten distances to the items and increase the item sizes. Previous work on radial menus does not demonstrate that radial layouts are beneficial for <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchies.</b> The paper focuses on this topic. We compare two main characteristics of radial and linear layouts: a) {{the time it takes to}} find an item (i. e. visual search time), b) the time it takes to navigate to an item (i. e. pointing time). We use objective and subjective measures, two menu sizes, three menu levels, one linear and three radial layout variations.

Borland, a method of operation refers to the means by which a person operates something, whether it is a car, food processor, or computer. In that case, Lotus claimed copyright in its computer <b>menu</b> command <b>hierarchy.</b> The court held that even though the menu developer made some expressive choices in choosing and arranging the Lotus command terms, the menu was a method of operation. The menu did not just explain and present the functional capabilities; it also served as the method by which the program was operated and controlled. In fact, Lotus wrote its <b>menu</b> command <b>hierarchy</b> so that people could learn it and use it.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on non-speech audio messages called earcons showed {{that they could}} provide powerful navigation cues in <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchies.</b> This work used hierarchical earcons. In this paper we suggest compound earcons can provide a more flexible method for presenting this information. A set of sounds was created to represent the numbers 0 - 4 and dot. Sounds could then be created for any node in a hierarchy by concatenating these simple sounds. A hierarchy of four levels and 27 nodes was constructed. An experiment was conducted in which participants had to identify their location in the hierarchy by listening to an earcon. Results showed that participants could identify their location with over 97 % accuracy, significantly better than with hierarchical earcons. Participants were also able to recognise previously unheard earcons with over 97 % accuracy. These results showed that compound earcons are an effective way of representing hierarchies in sound.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new command selection method that provides {{an alternative to}} pull-down menus in pen-based mobile interfaces. Its primary advantage is the ability for users to directly select commands from a very large set without the need to traverse <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchies.</b> The proposed method maps the character strings representing the commands onto continuous pen-traces on a stylus keyboard. The user enters a command by stroking part of its character string. We call this method “command strokes. ” We present the results of three experiments assessing {{the usefulness of the}} technique. The first experiment shows that command strokes are 1. 6 times faster than the de-facto standard pull-down menus and that users find command strokes more fun to use. The second and third experiments investigate the effect of displaying a visual preview of the currently recognized command while the user is still articulating the command stroke. These experiments show that visual preview does not slow users down and leads to significantly lower error rates and shorter gestures when users enter new unpracticed commands.

40|$|Abstract. Web-menu {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and widely used modalities in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The design and construction of navigation menus for websites, however, have traditionally been left to the intuition of a web developer. This paper proposes the use of a mathematical theory called Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) [5, 9, 14, 16, 17] to assist in the design and automatic generation of a navigation hierarchy for a set of web documents. We demonstrate how multi-layered menu models can be devised and automatically generated by an adaptation and application of the principle of FCA and its associated algorithms. Our approach, FcAWN (pronounced fawn) – Formal concepts Applied to Web Navigation – reveals a fundamental difference between existing web-menu layouts and the ones generated using FCA: many of today’s web-menu hierarchies are tree structures in which submenus do not overlap, while menu-hierarchies obtained using FCA are part of a lattice structure in which sub-menus are not required to be mutually exclusive. FcAWN {{is one of the}} few semi-automated web-menu design methods with which one can construct consistent and logical <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchies</b> for web navigation. ...|$|R

The results showed {{that they were able to}} do this very reliably. This indicates that earcons are a robust method of communicating complex hierarchy information in sound...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High communicability of the {{menu-based}} {{system is}} {{on the basis of}} consistent vision and clear policy in designing the system of menus, and then they should be perceivable to the users. In this light, failures in menu-based in-teractions can be explained that they might emerge from lack of information in the users ’ available cues to identify the design vision. This study focuses on communicative breakdowns in menu-based human-computer interactions from this perspective, and investigates their causes in ill-organized structures of <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchy</b> in terms of the user’s interpretation of the menu items.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an input}} {{system that is}} based on bidirectional strokes that are segmented by tactile landmarks. By giving the user tactile feedback about the length of a stroke during input, we decrease the dependence of the GUI on the visual display. By concatenating separate strokes into multi-strokes, complex commands may be entered, which may encode commands, data content, or both simultaneously. To demonstrate their power, we show how multi-strokes can be used to traverse a <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchy</b> quickly. In addition, we show how inter-landmark segments of the sensor may be used for continuous and discrete parameter entry, resulting in a multifunctional interaction paradigm. We also introduce multi–widgets, which allow the direct control of multiple virtual widgets without the need to change the state of the device or use modifier buttons. This approach to input does not depend on material displayed visually to the user, and, thanks to tactile guidance, may be used by expert users as an eyes-free user interface. We believe that these benefits make this interaction system especially suitable for wearable computer systems that use a head-worn display and wrist-worn watch-style devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of the Wavelet menu and its implementation on the iPhone. The Wavelet menu consists of a concentric hierarchical Marking menu using simple gestures. The novice mode, i. e. when the menu is displayed, is well adapted to the limited screen space of handheld devices because {{the representation of the}} <b>menu</b> <b>hierarchy</b> is inverted, the deeper submenu being always displayed {{at the center of the}} screen. The visual design is based on a stacking metaphor to reinforce the perception of the hierarchy and to help users to quickly understand how the technique works. The menu also supports submenu previsualization, a key property to navigate efficiently in a hierarchy of commands. The quantitative evaluation shows that the Wavelet menu provides an intuitive way for supporting efficient gesture-based navigation. The expert mode, i. e. gesture without waiting for the menu to pop-up, is another key property of the Wavelet menu: By providing stroke shortcuts, the Wavelet favors the selection of frequent commands in expert mode and makes eyes-free selection possible. A user experiment shows that participants are able to select commands, eyes-free, while walking...|$|E

40|$|A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) {{can be used}} {{by people}} with severe {{physical}} disabilities such as Locked-in Syndrome (LiS) as a channel of input to a computer. The time-consuming nature of setting up and using a BCI, together with individual variation in performance and limited access to end users makes it difficult to employ techniques such as rapid prototyping and user centred design (UCD) in the design and development of applications. This thesis proposes a design process which incorporates the use of simulation tools and techniques to improve the speed and quality of designing BCI applications for the target user group. Two different forms of simulation can be distinguished: offline simulation aims to make predictions about a user’s performance in a given application interface given measures of their baseline control characteristics, while online simulation abstracts properties of interaction with a BCI system which can be shown to, or used by, a stakeholder in real time. Simulators that abstract properties of BCI control at different levels are useful for different purposes.
