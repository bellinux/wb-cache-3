25|$|Some audiophiles use horn {{loudspeakers}} for audio reproduction, {{while others}} eschew horn systems for their harmonic resonances, finding in them an unpleasant form of distortion. Since {{there are a}} variety of horn designs (of differing length, material, and taper, as well as different drivers) it is, to some extent, impossible to give such blanket characterizations to horn loudspeakers. Audiophiles using low power amplifiers, sometimes in the five to twenty-five watt range, <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> typically high efficiency of horn loudspeakers an especially attractive feature because it makes it possible to reach playable music levels. Conversely, greater care must be taken in selection of ones audio gear, the high sensitivity can also make any background noise present at the amplifier outputs noticeably worse at the distances of a typical living room.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2013, a {{poll was}} opened {{allowing}} players {{to decide whether}} Jagex should open a separate incarnation of RuneScape from August 2007. Old School RuneScape was opened to paying subscribers on 22 February 2013 after the poll received 50,000 votes, and a free-to-play version was later released on 19 February 2015. It was originally created as an exact copy of RuneScape from August 2007 and receives regular content additions. Old School RuneScape is entirely community based; for any proposed update or idea to pass into the game, it needs at least 75% {{of the community to}} vote Yes for it, and if it does not pass it will either be dropped or reconstructed and re-polled so that the players <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> update more acceptable.

Madison finds the identity of the killer, Scott Shelby, and investigates his apartment. There, she <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> address where Shaun Mars, Ethan's son, is being held. Shelby eventually arrives, and sets the place ablaze while Madison is still there. Madison may die in the blaze, or the player may manage to have her escape. If she escapes and has found Shaun's location, the player may have her phone and tell either Norman or Ethan it, or have her go there alone. If the player fails to find the address and/or dies, she will be removed from play for the final level where the killer is confronted.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{conversion}} of nonexempt assets into exempt assets {{on the eve}} of bankruptcy would not be indicia of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> conversion to be a fraudulent transfer. This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. The cases that held a {{conversion of}} nonexempt into exempt assets to be a fraudulent transfer tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a homestead exemption with the intent to reside in such residence that would be an allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their available funds, leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a fraudulent transfer. The courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.|$|E
25|$|Short-period {{planets in}} close orbits around their stars will undergo {{reflected}} light variations because, like the Moon, {{they will go}} through phases from full to new and back again. In addition, as these planets receive a lot of starlight, it heats them, making thermal emissions potentially detectable. Since telescopes cannot resolve the planet from the star, they see only the combined light, and {{the brightness of the}} host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small — the photometric precision required is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star – such Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days are detectable by space telescopes such as the Kepler Space Observatory. Like with the transit method, it is easier to detect large planets orbiting close to their parent star than other planets as these planets catch more light from their parent star. When a planet has a high albedo and is situated around a relatively luminous star, its light variations are easier to detect in visible light while darker planets or planets around low-temperature stars are more easily detectable with infrared light with this method. In the long run, this method <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> most planets that will be discovered by that mission because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of orbital inclination and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. It still cannot detect planets with circular face-on orbits from Earth's viewpoint as the amount of reflected light does not change during its orbit.|$|E

[...] Ruth Cox of Emergency Librarian observed [...] "a flicker of the love/hate relationship often found in adult romance novels between Meliara and Shevraeth." [...] Contributing to Brigham Young's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson called the second part [...] "fast paced and intriguing," [...] and said it could [...] "stand on its own as an enthralling story." [...] Jo Walton believed that the second story's changing fashions and fan customs were [...] "done very well," [...] and added that the court's culture of terror felt real. She opined that [...] "Mel's eruption into their midst has in it something of the stranger coming to Versailles, and it's fascinating," [...] but called [...] "Mel's continued obliviousness to the identity of her mysterious Unknown correspondent" [...] "slightly implausible." [...] Walton concluded that the combined volume Crown Duel is [...] "a charming book with a solid background and a great first person voice. Give it to your twelve year old friends, and read it with your inner twelve-year-old eyes." [...] The publication Voice of Youth Advocates included Crown Duel in its list of [...] "fantasy for people who don't like fantasy," [...] and wrote that the novel [...] "ha few fantastical creatures, and readers will relate easily to the main characters." ...|$|E
