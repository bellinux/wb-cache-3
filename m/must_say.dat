5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

5000|$|Against the {{widespread}} resignation to addressing politics solely at the ontic or empirical level - that is, {{a concern with}} the [...] "facts of politics" [...] or with politics as 'the exercise of power or the deciding of common affairs' - this re-envisioning <b>must,</b> they <b>say,</b> concern itself with the ontological dimension of politics: that is, with {{the essence of the}} political. While each conceptualises the properly political in different ways, all agree upon its irreducibly and inherently antagonistic dimension: a radical-progressive position <b>must,</b> <b>says</b> Žižek, 'insist on the unconditional primacy of the inherent antagonism as constitutive of the political'. Hence the charge that post-politics, with consensus as its defining logic, forecloses the properly political.|$|R

25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E
25|$|I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> {{that in all}} my {{conversations with}} you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record.

25|$|This {{flexibility}} allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, {{much more}} than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren ("they recommended me to him"), whereas in French one <b>must</b> <b>say</b> ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).|$|E

25|$|Francis {{says that}} we <b>must</b> <b>say</b> “no to a {{financial}} system which rules rather than serves. Behind this attitude lurks a rejection of ethics and a rejection of God” (EG 57). He calls it “increasingly intolerable that financial markets are shaping the destiny of peoples rather than serving their needs, or that the few derive immense wealth from financial speculation while the many are deeply burdened by the consequences”. He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food {{on the part of}} the poorest members of our human family”.|$|E
25|$|One blessing over a {{particular}} food {{is sufficient for}} the entire meal and {{does not need to}} be repeated. A communal meal only needs one set of blessings for the entire group, but individuals dining together (albeit not as a group) <b>must</b> <b>say</b> the blessings individually. The food of primary importance is the one which a blessing is said for. However, if one is eating a sandwich, the blessing for the bread would be said rather than the blessing for the sandwich's contents, since bread is never considered being of secondary importance. One who drinks water should make a blessing over the water with the pie blessing.|$|E
25|$|Courtesy {{is highly}} valued in South Africa, and is {{perceived}} {{a sign of}} honor. Different cultures such as the Tamil, Urdu, Bantu and others express their courtesy for others through their language and customs vary with culture. Social status and gender is marked through individual's etiquette practices. The older one is or depending upon their position within society (politics especially) and the family comes from projects respect from others and dignity for one's culture. Families in rural areas have special customs in which they greet each other and show appreciation. In more urbanized areas, these same customs are not present, however, social status are nevertheless defined. Those who enter {{the house of a}} family <b>must</b> <b>say</b> hello to the parents of the household using the name of the couple's eldest sibling. (i.e. Hello, Mother of...) The youngest children must make way for their elders around the home allowing them to come through. If one is said to be rude it is considered a big deal.|$|E

25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he <b>must</b> <b>say</b> a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E
