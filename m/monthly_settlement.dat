5000|$|Further Dior boutiques {{were opened}} in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo {{shopping}} districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%. Another collection of watches named [...] "Bagheera" [...] - {{inspired by the}} round design of the [...] "Black Moon" [...] watches - was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon Marché president Phillipe Vindry at the post. In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market {{and then on the}} Paris Stock Exchange's <b>monthly</b> <b>settlement</b> market, and the perfume [...] "Dune" [...] was launched. Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500. 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3 million, with a net income of $22 million. Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted [...] "for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility." [...] Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Cannes, and Waikiki, adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and Geneva. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations." [...] In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the [...] "Miss Dior" [...] perfume was relaunched. Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.The production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named Christian Dior Couture in 1995. Also, the [...] "La Parisienne" [...] watch model was released - embodied in the watch [...] "Parisian Chic". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9 million. Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer John Galliano to replace Gianfranco Ferré in 1997 (Galliano on CBS News: [...] "without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior"). This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have [...] "ruffled some French feathers". Arnault himself stated that he [...] "would have preferred a Frenchman", but that [...] "talent has no nationality". He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that [...] "Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations - his suits, his dresses - one finds similarities to the Dior style." [...] Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as [...] "Homeless Show" [...] (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or [...] "S&M Show". Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano. On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened -it had been closed and remodeled by Peter Marino - in a celebrity-studded event including Nicole Kidman, Demi Moore and Jacques Chirac. That year, Christian Dior Couture also took over all thirteen boutique franchises from Japan's Kanebo.|$|E
40|$|In the Paris Bourse some {{stocks are}} traded on a spot basis, {{while others are}} traded on a <b>monthly</b> <b>settlement</b> basis. The latter {{are likely to be}} less subject to {{leverage}} and short sales constraints. We empirically analyze the consequences of this difference on the order flow and the return process. Consistent with the theoretical analysis of Diamond and Verrechia (1987), we find that market sell orders are less frequent on the spot market than on the <b>monthly</b> <b>settlement</b> market (although not very significantly) and that the spot market reflects good news (significantly) faster than bad news.

50|$|Before 2004, yuan was {{not allowed}} outside of China. In 2004, China started to allow border trading in yuan {{especially}} in the Southern and Western border. HKMA first raised with the PBoC the idea of introducing personal renminbi business in Hong Kong as early as November 2001, to facilitate economic and social exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland and to channel renminbi cashnotes in Hong Kong back to the Mainland orderly through the banking system. In November 2003, the State Council approved the introduction of personal renminbi business in Hong Kong, which followed by the appointment of the Clearing Bank, establishment of payment system linkages and arrangements for cross-border renminbi cashnote delivery. Banks in Hong Kong started to offer renminbi deposit-taking, currency exchange, remittance and debit and credit card services to personal accounts on 25 February 2004. , 1.47% of world payments was settled in RMB, which ranked RMB as the 7th most traded currency in the world.

40|$|This paper uncovers strong return {{reversals}} in the US value weighted {{stock market}} index around the last <b>monthly</b> <b>settlement</b> day, T- 3, which guarantees liquidity for month-end cash distributions. Similar reversals in market returns around T- 3 are documented internationally. The return reversals are stronger in countries where the mutual fund ownership is large, and in the US they have become stronger over time as the mutual fund ownership of stocks has increased. Using data that contains all trades of a subset of institutional investors, we show direct evidence that institutional trading contributes to the market reversals. Finally, we find that in the cross-section of stocks, return reversals {{around the turn of}} the month are stronger for stocks more commonly held by mutual funds and for liquid stocks. These market reversals help explain the previously documented abnormally high market returns {{around the turn of the}} month...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} and compared 17 yr of <b>monthly</b> <b>settlement</b> indices of postlarvae of the Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, at two locations on the Mexican Caribbean coast. Along this coast, the shelf is very narrow {{and the local}} circulation is driven by waves overtopping subtidal coral reef crests. Settlement occurred year-round, but both locations showed annual rhythmicity, average seasonal maxima during the autumn, and similar interannual variation, reflecting the influence of mesoscale oceanographic processes on settlement. Significant correlations between settlement indices {{and a number of}} interrelated physical factors indicate that sea-level variation is the main factor influencing settlement. There was further association between extreme settlement pulses and extreme weather events (tropical storms and hurricanes) during the late summer–autumn. The autumn settlement peak indicates that large hurricane waves enhance the onshore transport of postlarvae that originated during the spring spawning peak. The geographic range of potential sources of larvae that settle along this coast during the periods of March–April and September–October, 5 – 9 months after hatching (the estimated larval duration for P. argus), was investigated by stochastic simulations integrating passive trajectories backward in time using 6 yr of stable outputs from a well-established numerical model for the entire Atlantic Ocean. Trajectories from the model indicate that the local population of P. argus depends to a large extent on larval supply from many potentia...|$|E
40|$|Species {{composition}} and {{some aspects of}} the biology of the fouling community in Neendakara port (southwest coast of India) has been examined for a period of one year. Fouling organisms were collected with a system of glass panels exposed for varying durations and during different months in the port. One species of sponge, nine species of coelenterates, thirteen species of polyzoans, four species of mud-tube dwelling polychaetes, four species of serpulids, one species each of mud-tube forming amphipod and tanaid, two species of oysters, six species of mussels and not less than eight species of tunicates were the macro fouler which settled over the panels. <b>Monthly</b> and seasonal <b>settlement</b> of the different species has been recorded. Fouling has been a continuous process occurring throughout the year in Neendakara port with slightly fluctuating biomass and considerably varying species composition. Alternate species dominance of marine and brackish water forms has been an important feature of fouling in the area. Number of species of the sedentary fouling animals represented on test panels has been high during the highly saline pre-monsoon period and low during the monsoon period...|$|R
