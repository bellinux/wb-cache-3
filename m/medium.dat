Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E

25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting <b>medium</b> is {{an important}} component in any high-pressure experiment. The <b>medium</b> fills the space within the sample 'chamber' and applies the pressure being transmitted to the <b>medium</b> onto to the sample. In a good high-pressure experiment, the <b>medium</b> should maintain a homogeneous distribution of pressure on the sample. In other words, the <b>medium</b> must stay hydrostatic to ensure uniform compressibility of the sample. Once a pressure transmitting <b>medium</b> has lost its hydrostaticity, a pressure gradient forms in the chamber that increases with increasing pressure. This gradient can greatly affect the sample, compromising results. The <b>medium</b> must also be inert, as to not interact with the sample, and stable under high pressures. For experiments with laser heating, the <b>medium</b> should have low thermal conductivity. If an optical technique is being employed, the <b>medium</b> should be optically transparent and for x-ray diffraction, the <b>medium</b> should be a poor x-ray scatterer – as to not contribute to the signal.|$|E
