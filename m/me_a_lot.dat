25|$|As the President of India, I {{had lots}} of {{experiences}} that were full of pain and helplessness. There were occasions when I could do nothing for people and for the nation. These experiences have pained <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> They have depressed <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> I have agonised because {{of the limitations of}} power. Power and the helplessness surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact.|$|E
25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{confidence}} to know that if I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E

500|$|Como's {{comments}} {{during a}} 1949 interview were prophetic, {{as far as}} his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the Chesterfield Supper Club on both radio and television, [...] "Television is going to do <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more personal good than the movies ever have... The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo." [...] Como was offered some movie roles [...] that interested him after he began appearing on the weekly TV shows, but there was just never enough time to pursue any film work.|$|E

She revealed, [...] "I think going through what I went through {{at a young age}} [...] the abuse that went on in my {{household}} [...] did affect <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> Domestic violence is a topic that is very hush-hush in society". Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E

500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come".|$|E
500|$|In his 1978 {{biography}} of Victor Trumper, Fingleton accused Bradman of relating Woodfull's {{words to the}} press. Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him. In Fingleton's version of events, Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting. Bradman wrote for Corbett's paper, Sydney's Sun. Sitting in Corbett's car, Bradman told the journalist about the Warner–Woodfull incident. Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself, so shared it with other journalists. Fingleton later added that [...] "Bradman would have saved <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of backlash... had {{he admitted that he}} had given the leak. Part of his job was writing for the Sydney Sun and he had every right to leak such a vital story." ...|$|E

[...] Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, explaining that she had received an e-mail from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for [...] "Born This Way". CNN later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation. AllMusic also note a [...] "striking similarity" [...] between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and Kylie Minogue's 1991 single [...] "What Do I Have to Do", writing that [...] "Kylie Minogue has always displayed a strong Madonna influence—something she’s readily admitted to in interviews." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2011, Horsfield {{stepped down}} as {{assistant}} manager to concentrate on his coaching qualifications, remaining at Port Vale as a coach. Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing. He has shown <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things that I haven't done in the past. In seven years, I have been so many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that with anyone else, so I just feel it was a good dedication for him." [...] Horsfield retired completely from football in May 2012 to pursue business interests.|$|E
500|$|Joel Torre, who portrays Mario [...] "Tatang" [...] Maghari in the film, {{had already}} been cast before Matti's script revision; Angel Aquino plays his wife Lulette and Empress Schuck portrays his {{daughter}} Tina. Of the role, Torre said, [...] " [...] stuck with me, fought for me. And that gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of confidence, a Bushido Blade samurai." [...] Matti asked Piolo Pascual {{to play the role}} of Attorney Francis Coronel Jr; Shaina Magdayao plays his wife Nicky and Michael de Mesa portrays his father-in-law Congressman Manrique. The role of Daniel was originally written for John Lloyd Cruz, who was interested but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts; it went instead to Gerald Anderson. After a discussion between Pascual and Anderson about the film, Anderson signed on for the role. Anderson had only two weeks to film his scenes as he was occupied with a soap opera shoot at the time. Dawn Jimenez appeared in her acting debut as Anderson's girlfriend Diane.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming {{to the tune of}} [...] "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present [...] "another final" [...] song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've {{gotten to the point where}} I understand the raw stuff is usually better." ...|$|E

500|$|Sutton was {{diagnosed}} with stage 3B colorectal cancer {{at the age of}} 15, and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments. He was declared cancer-free, but a tumour returned behind his knee, which was treated by further chemotherapy. Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton's left leg, but the tumour had already spread to other parts of his lower body. In December 2012, two years after the initial diagnosis, the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver. Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive, choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make, rather than in time. On 24 January 2014, in a speech at London's O2 Arena, he called his first diagnosis [...] "a good thing. It was a huge kick up the backside, it taught me to take nothing for granted, and gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of motivation for life".|$|E

Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
