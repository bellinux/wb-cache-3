[...] According to Arthur C. Clarke, [...] "After attending , Gene introduced himself and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> series was being cancelled because the television executives, in their inscrutable wisdom, had decided that there was no audience for it. Poor Gene was broke and about to mortgage his home. I introduced him to my lecture agent, who was skeptical but booked him into a small hall -- which couldn't hold the audience he attracted." [...] Although the geographical distance imposed by Clarke's residence in Sri Lanka resulted in only a handful of physical meetings, Roddenberry would later characterize their friendship as [...] "the most significant of my professional life.” ...|$|E

In addition, he was concerned about who would sing the tenor role when he had been unable to obtain Rubini's release from his Naples contract. [...] Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as [...] "one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> voice is beautiful, and that he has all the acting and spirit one could wish for." ...|$|E
2500|$|But Edmunds {{also had}} admirers. One Democrat with {{no reason to}} {{appreciate}} him wrote a colleague that among all the Republicans, [...] "Edmunds made the most impression upon me. [...] I couldn't help admiring his clear and incisive way of putting a question, although it appeared to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> manner is occasionally very irritating. [...] This manner of his is very much that of a lawyer employed as counsel in a case, who therefore makes ex parte statements, and thinks it fair to make all manner of allegations." [...] His closest friend in the chamber for many years was the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio.|$|E

Berardo Calvari (known as Winter) was rejected because audiences had disliked him the previous July when he appeared in both a Pacini and a Donizetti opera at La Scala. Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as [...] "one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> voice is beautiful, and that he has all the acting and spirit one could wish for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. He told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
2500|$|Salman Ahmed {{while talking}} about his latest project at Asia Talk on BBC said, [...] "For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or {{to ask him to}} sing. When you are friends with {{somebody}} you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid once told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all." [...] and further added [...] "it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israeli novelist Irit Linur {{set off a}} wave of {{subscription}} cancellations to Haaretz in 2002, {{when she}} wrote {{an open letter to}} the paper cancelling her own subscription.Translation: it is a person's right to be a radical leftist, and publish a newspaper in accordance with this world view.... However Haaretz reached a stage where its anti-Zionism turns too frequently to silly and mean journalism. Original:Translation: When Gideon Levy accuses Israel of turning Marwan Barghouti from a peace seeker to an impresario of suicide bombings, it is as logical an interpretation, just as the claim that the wave of attacks on 11 September were a plot by Mossad. In a private conversation with him, he told me one time that he would not travel a hundred meters {{to save the life of}} a settler, and it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> loves and hates have been long tainting his heart-rending reports from the occupied Palestinian territories. Original: [...] "It is a person's right to be a radical leftist, and publish a newspaper in accordance with his world view... However Haaretz has reached the point where its anti-Zionism has become stupid and evil", she wrote. She also accused Levy of amateurism because he does not speak Arabic.|$|E

Dement to rally them were unavailing (for at the time the men commenced retreating before the Indians Maj. Dement came up with a reinforcement from the garrison The Maj. stated to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> force on the field was equal in numbers to that of the enemy After the men retreated to the fort the Indians surrounded the house & commenced killing the Horses, they kept up a constant fire on the House & Horses for 2 or 3 hours.

2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. [...] We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. [...] Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. [...] he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton ...|$|E
