40|$|Translation studies {{researchers}} {{have for a}} long time critically engaged with the idea of translation being a mode of creative rewriting across media and cultural or temporal divides.

The paper suggests a model for the close reading of creative transfer based on LefÃ¨vreâs (2011; 2012) typology of formal properties of comics and Attardoâs (2002) General Theory of Verbal Humour. As is shown, visual rhythm and text-image relations create a rich environment for anachronism, parody, comic characterisation and ideological comments, all of which serve a condensed plot.

40|$|International audienceTrophic {{indicators}} {{were used}} to compare two Malian freshwater reservoirs whose main differences are based on their different fishing pressures. Data were collected from a scientific survey of small-scale fishery landings conducted in 2002 / 2003. The trophic levels of fish species caught by artisanal fisheries are estimated from observations of scientific fishing or from the <b>metabase</b> Fishbase. Important differences exist in the trophic structure of both reservoirs. In Selingue (with high fishing pressure), very few top predators {{are found in the}} catches while the low trophic level fishes increase in total catches. In Manantali (with low fishing pressure), the top predators contribute twice as much to catches compared to Selingue. Hence, the mean trophic level of catches in Selingue (2. 80) is lower than in Manantali (2. 97). When comparing these results with those of study made in 1994 / 1995, it clearly appears that the effects of the fishing pressure in Selingue are obvious through a decrease of 0. 12 in the mean trophic level while in Manantali this mean level has increased by 0. 33 due to a recent strategic targeting of top predators. Trophic spectra seem to be relevant tools to characterize exploited fish communities from multi-specific and multi-gear small-scale fisheries catch dat...|$|E

The soil profile database can be utilised regardless of scale, at regional, national or local level, in soil monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The main characteristics of this database are the following: i) software development for WINDOWS platforms; ii) multilingual function and automatic translation from English, as source language, to other target languages (so far Spanish, French and German); iii) detailed soil profile characterisation following the conventional procedures of soil survey, making use of âassist menusâ in the selected language which greatly facilitates data storage; iv) possibility of monitoring the temporal variability of analytical, physical and hydraulic soil properties; v) <b>metabase</b> facility to describe the methods used in the laboratory analysis; and vi) interface facility to automatize the linkage of soil data to computerised information systems.

40|$|The study {{analysed}} existing databases {{for agricultural}} market data on errors and discrepancies and to elaborate {{the possibilities to}} harmonise datasets for policy modelling. The study supports DG AGRI in improving quality and timely availability of data for market modelling and ensuring that data from different sources are consistent. This study aims to provide a structure for a consolidated database for policy modelling which does not alter existing databases. Within this report, existing databases are analysed to derive key insights for setting-up a harmonised <b>metabase.</b> As available databases comprise statistical databases as well as scientific model databases, both groups are studied. For {{the purpose of this}} study, statistical databases are defined as providers of the information that international institutes receive from their reporters, while the reporters are required to provide harmonised, complete, consistent, and where possible, timely data series for establishing models or other quantitative methods. Nevertheless, a statistical database can also serve as a model database, such as e. g. PS&D. Statistical databases from international institutions (FAO, USDA, Eurostat), as well as model databases (AGLINK/COSIMO, AGMEMOD, CAPRI/CAPSIM, ESIM, FAPRI, GTAP, FARM, IMPACT), were studied to find ways of consolidating data and providing insights that allow for a better comparison of model results. For this reason, various classification schemes used in agricultural statistics were reviewed (country, product, balance item, year, unit), as was {{the manner in which the}} different modelling groups have dealt with these classifications in their databases. Besides a common classification, a harmonised database for market modelling purposes will require further efforts to be applied to a consolidation effort for the original data. Such a procedure must be supplemented by methods dealing with completion and balancing. JRC. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
