40|$|Kelantan state, {{regarded}} as the cradle of Malay culture is not only known for her unique cultural heritage, but also a land blessed with both metallic and non-metallic minerals. These include enormous clay deposits discovered in six (6) districts with estimated total reserve of 29. 4 million tonnes of ball clay and 51. 5 million tonnes of <b>mottled</b> <b>clay.</b> Hence, this paper investigates the physiochemical and mineralogical properties of the clay deposits. This was achieved by reviewing existing literatures and reports at the Mineral and Geoscience Department, Malaysia. The properties investigated were green and fired clay colour, plasticity, green strength, dry and fired shrinkage, porosity, chemical and mineral composition. The properties of the clay revealed that they have geographical IP potential; particularly, the predominantly off-white fired colour of the ball clay at temperature range of 900 - 11000 C can secure an identity for Kelantan ceramics in the local, national or international market. Based on these properties, the ball clay is applicable for table ware, earthenware and local tile production while the <b>mottled</b> <b>clay</b> has a potential use for vitrified clay pipe, local tile and brick production...|$|E

However, Atterberg’s consistency limit tests indicate that the samples are moderate to high plastic soils with moderate swelling potential. Hence, their use as base and sub-base construction materials for heavy traffic roads require pre-treatment with non-plastic soils, bitumen, cement and/or lime.

40|$|AbstractArmoured {{mud balls}} were {{observed}} after rainfall {{and a short}} flood in the otherwise dry Xiaohe (small river) valley of Guanling County, Guizhou Province, South China, approximately 30 km southwest of Guanling City. Armoured mud balls are most common in semiarid climates, but rather unusual in a humid climate as in Guizhou. A number of well-rounded mud balls, 2 – 20 cm in diameter, were found lying on the gravel of the Xiaohe gully floor. The mud balls consist of sticky, light brown and slightly <b>mottled</b> <b>clay</b> without carbonate content. The surfaces of the mud balls were studded with rims of sand- or gravel-size limestone clasts, collected during bedload transport, as is typical for armoured mud balls. The mud balls originated from alluvial mudstone deposits of the valley floor and cliff that are most likely derived from the weathering and karstification of bedrock limestones. Such mudstones with high clay content seem to be especially well suited for forming armoured mud balls. As flood events are rather common in the area, the formation of armoured mud balls should be very frequent in the Xiaohe valley and similar valleys nearby, giving the possibility for further and more detailed studies. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first description of armoured mud balls in China...|$|E

40|$|A simple geochemical {{balance of}} lateritization {{processes}} governing {{the development of}} several tens of meters of weathering profiles overlain by ferricretes is estimated {{on the basis of}} detailed mineralogical and geochemical data. The lateritic weathering mantle of the "Haut-Mbomou" area in Central Africa is composed of different weathering layers described from the base to the top of vertical profiles as a saprolite, a <b>mottled</b> <b>clay</b> layer, a soft nodular layer, a soft ferricrete, and a ferricrete in which kaolinite, gibbsite, goethite, and hematite occur in various quantities. Incongruent dissolution of kaolinite leads to the formation of gibbsite according to an incongruent dissolution under hydrated and reducing conditions induced by a relatively humid climatic pattern. The respective relations of the silica, iron, and aluminum balances and the Al substitution rate of the hematite on the one hand, and of RHG (RHG = 100 (hematite/hematite + goethite)) and the kaolinite on the other hand, to the consumption or release of protons H+ permit differentiation of aggrading ferruginization and degradation processes operating in the different lateritic weathering profiles. The Al substitution rate of the Fe-oxyhydroxides varies according to the nature of lateritization processes, e. g., saprolitic weathering and aggradng ferruginization vs. degradation. The observations and results indicate that the ferruginization process of the weathering materials of parent rocks is not a simple ongoing process as often thought. This suggests that the actual lateritic weathering mantle of the Haut-Mbomou area may result from different stages of weathering and erosion during climatic changes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

During the first 2000 s, numerous researches were conducted in different continents in order to validate thisnew concept of stratiform hardrock aquifer linked to weathering processes. Commonly, the term of " lateritic profile " is used for subtractive weathering profiles developed on metamorphic, plutonic or volcanic rocks. They are the only rocks that are able to develop a fractured layer atdepth. Figure 1 –Structure of a lateritic profilepartially eroded by the present topography A lateritic profile usually shows, from top to bottom (Figure 1) :-A ferraliticduricrust, 1 to 10 m thick, resulting from recrystallization of goethite (iron hydroxide) to hematite (iron oxide) due to seasonal desiccation of the top of the profile. Where preserved from later erosion and recharged by heavy rainfall this duricrust can give rise to seasonal perched aquifers, particularly in tropical humid areas. -Loose alterites (saprolite), made up of a mixing of clays, hydroxides, oxides and residual minerals (quartz). At the top of saprolite, <b>mottled</b> <b>clay</b> (meter-thick) is a transition horizon to iron crust.

In this study, detailed morphological and mineralogical investigations conducted in a representative 25 -ha site were combined with hydro-geochemical data to relate the vertical and lateral soil differentiations observed to the hydro-geological history of that part of the basin. As a result of the uplift of the Andes, several cuts in the extensive Tertiary marshlands have formed, at first, slightly incised plateaux of low elevation. There, weathering under hot and humid climates would have generated a reddish, freely drained and bioturbated topsoil layer and the vertical differentiation in subsoil sediments of a plinthite over an iron-depleted <b>mottled</b> <b>clay.</b> The second episode of soil differentiation is linked to the replacement of the forest by a savannah under the drier climates of the late Pleistocene, which favours surface runoff and the infill of the incisions by fine particles.

Nowadays, ferrous iron is released from the partly iron-depleted topsoil weathering front at high water levels during the rainy seasons. It moves from footslope to low-lying positions and from top to bottom in the soil profile according to the groundwater dynamics.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} the differentiation of ferruginous accumulations and the variable water saturation of footslope soil patterns. An analysis of the slope morphology of a typical hill in the forest zone of southern Cameroon and a seasonal survey of the levels of groundwaters, springs and rivers were considered in relation to the petrology of different soil patterns. The study site is a tabular hillock whose slopes present a progressive development from steep to gentle slopes. The variable residence time of water within the soil, creating an alternation of reducing and oxidizing conditions, affects oil chemistry, structure and lateral extension of the soil patterns. The ferruginous soil patterns, being formed on the footslopes, gradually increase in extent with decreasing slope angle and the relative rise of the groundwater level. The steep footslopes, where groundwater has a shorter residence time, show a soft <b>mottled</b> <b>clay</b> pattern, restricted to the bottom part of the slope. The moderate footslopes exhibit a deep permanent and a temporary perched groundwater table. The latter, with its regular capillary fringe, contributes to more reducing conditions within isolated domains in the soil patterns, and thus to the alternation with oxidizing conditions, generating a continuous hard soil pattern (massive carapace). The more gently dipping footslopes exhibit groundwater levels near the surface and also a significant amplitude of groundwater fluctuation. Iron, previously accumulated in moderate footslope patterns, is reduced, remobilized, and leached. The soil patterns formed develop into a variegated carapace, more extended along the slope, containing less iron, but nevertheless more hardened, due to the important fluctuations of the groundwater table. These patterns are limited to the zone of groundwater fluctuation and deteriorate as the water fluctuation zone recedes. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|A high {{resolution}} study of sediments, microfaunas (ostracods and foraminifers), and stable isotopes of ostracod shells from core PRD 05, sampled from the Da'ao plain of the Pearl River Delta, provides new data about palaeoenvironmental changes during the Late Quaternary. The basal fluvial gravelly sediments of the core, representing the lowest deposits of the Quaternary {{at the core}} site, were possibly formed prior to the transgression associated with the last interglacial stage. This fluvial setting changed into a marginal marine setting during the last interglacial stage, any record of calcareous fossils were destroyed by subsequent dissolution during the last glacial phase, when {{the upper part of}} the deltaic sediments experienced subaerial oxidation, indicated by a <b>mottled</b> <b>clay</b> layer in the core.

This timing was earlier than in other parts of the Pearl River Delta. Since then, a semi-enclosed estuarine environment developed and was maintained until ~ 5560 cal yr B. P.

For more healthy and order development of marine sand extraction activities, about 518 km of initial seismic exploration and marine drilling of 5 validation boreholes with total footage of 176. 7 m were carried out in 2001 and 2002 respectively, and the preliminary overall situation of marine sand resources in the Pearl River estuary waters was clarified. Based on geological interpretation of GeoPulse seismic profiles and core sample analyses of boreholes, the Quaternary stratigraphic sequence in the Pearl River estuary was divided into four depositional units: the upper marine unit of Holocene marine mud, and other three late Pleistocene units: the upper terrestrial unit of weathered <b>mottled</b> <b>clay,</b> the lower marine unit of silty clay, and the lower terrestrial unit of alluvial sand. The main type of marine sand occurrence and the main exploration targets for marine sand resources are identified in the late Pleistocene paleo-Pearl River channel sand at the lower terrestrial unit. The most valuable marine sand resources are located in Holocene tidal channel which coincide with late Pleistocene paleo-channels where the Holocene marine mud overburden is thinner. Sustainable development and scientific management of marine sand resources in the Pearl River estuary waters must strengthen legal system construction, work out scientific exploitation planning, strengthen environmental impact research, and strictly enforce pertinent laws. In about 3000 km(2) Pearl River estuary waters tentative estimation of reserves of buried marine sand is 12. 5 x 10 (8) m(3) in 20 sites, of which 10 sites with 5. 38 x 10 (8) m(3) were suggested to be suitable for current exploitation, other part of these reserves were put aside for exploitation as their thick cover in 4 sites with 2. 75 x 10 (8) m(3), seriously contaminated cover in 1 site with 2. 5 x 10 (8) m(3) or ecological or environmental sensitivity in 5 sites with 5. 38 x 10 (8) m(3). This research results can give some overall description of marine sand resources in the Pearl River estuary waters and provide scientific base for macroscopic management.

The 4 m thick sequence shows ten distinct horizons, reflecting differing environmental conditions. The Quaternary cover shows evidence of Holocene sea-level changes in the form of stranded shingle beach ridges, aeolianite wave-cut platforms and undersea calcrete reefs. These also record palaeoclimatic changes, as do the fossil soils, calcretes and aeolianite dunes. The geochemistry of the calcretes reflects that of the underlying bedrock, and places constraints on the calcrete-formation model postulated. A salt-marsh-prograding barrier beach couplet shows the classic features of such an environment.

Os perfis dêstes solos apresentam um horizonte A 3 normalmente adensado e um B friável. Compreendem as séries monotipicas: Borda, Cajuru, Feital, Gleba, Guatemala, Pinda, Pinhão, Polêmica, Ponte Alta, Rapadura e Ronco. The Taubaté Basin {{represents}} a > where sediments were deposited during the terciary period, {{and the present}} configuration is set-up by the Paraíba river and its tributaries. The flood plain occupies large areas of economical significance for the State of São Paulo. This work may be classified as a reconnaissance soil survey, whose main objetives were to determine the physical and chemical soil characteristics, the area occupied by soil units {{in such a way}} that it would be usefull for a general drainage and irrigation program of the basin. At same time the identification of soil types (as monotype-series) was done looking to a detailed soil survey which is in development. The unit identified in the field was a mono-type-series but for mapping they were grouped into series associations, whose boundaries were plotted in maps on the scale 1 : 100, 000. The series association includes soils belonging to the same great soil group, same geological formation, and same distribution of textural classes in the profile. Some soils because of small occurrence and relative intricacy of soil pattern, did not follow the last criterion. The area studied by this survey is about 222, 980 hectares, including the flood-plain, tlie terciary sediments and small strip of the pre-Cambriam formation. Data are presented for identification of the units on the ground (48 soil types or mono-type series), and the chemical and physics craracteristics for 151 profiles. The soil types were grouped into 18 series associations. The series association A groups soil belonging to the sub-order Latosol, with clay texture in profile, derived from the terciary sediments. They have dense A horizon and friable B, and they include 11 soil types. The series association B is classified as red-yellow podzolic soil, with origin in Terciary sediments, having nonclay texture in the A horizon and clay one in the B. Three soil types were identified. The series association C. with the same origin and texture distribution in the profile as the B are characteristic Latosol. It also has three soil types. As representative of an intergrarle (latosol and red-yellow podzolic soil) is the Tumirim soil type. It {{represents a}}n unique monotype series of the soil association D, but it is expected that other soil types will be defined in the detailed soil survey. Its profile is less than 1 meter deep, and clayey throughout. The Tumirim soil type is derived from Terciary <b>mottled</b> <b>clays.</b> The series associations E includes soils with poor drainage. Three soil types were determined representing Latosol imperfectly drained. Low Humic Glei and Humic Glei. The Terraces are represented by three soil types, forming the series association F. The texture goes from medium to sandy. The clay alluvial soils are in the series association (j, representing five soil types. According the topography position, some color layers and the kind of texture below 60 cm deep they have phases. The series associations H, I and J were plotted in a map but after mapping was done, the criterion for alluvial non-clay soils was changed and now the scries associations represent seven soil types. Bog and half bog are grouped in the soil association M. representing muck and peat-muck soils. Four soil types were identified. In Pre-cambrian area two series associations, N and O, were studied without soil type definitions. The former includes latosols with clay texture and the latter belongs to red-yellow podzolic soils with the same texture as the N. South of the town São José dos Campos a wide sandy soil area is represented by the serie association P, and it developed from sand deposits of Terciary, The soil type Putins may be considered as representative of the area. The serie association Q, is a group of mono-type-series belonging to the serie associations A and N in a intricate pattern only showed in detailed maps. When the alluvial soils are in a topographic position above the flood and the water table is almost permanently below one meter deep the soil types are grouped in the associations R and S. The lormer are non-clayed soil and the latter, clayey soils. Other soils considered as local occurrance are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} aspartic acid racemisation {{measured}} in radiocarbon dated specimens of fossil molluscs collected from Holocene barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia is evaluated {{in the context}} of results of laboratory-induced racemisation established in heating (simulated ageing) experiments. The general kinetic trend of aspartic acid racemisation, in both heating experiments, and at ambient temperatures during diagenesis in the fossil molluscs Anadara trapezia and Notospisula trigonella conforms to a model of apparent parabolic kinetics. Using the apparent parabolic kinetic model, numeric ages based on the degree of aspartic acid racemisation in fossil specimens of A. trapezia and N. trigonella have been determined. Aspartic acid D/L ratios in Holocene specimens of A. trapezia and N. trigonella range from 0. 049 ± 0. 005 to 0. 510 ± 0. 009, representing an age range from 8, 000 yr. Accordingly, the Holocene amino- and chronostratigraphies of the wavedominated barrier estuaries Lake Illawarra, St Georges Basin, Swan Lake and Burrill Lake have been established based on the extent of aspartic acid racemisation measured in 290 specimens of fossil molluscs. For fossil material beyond the time span of the radiocarbon dating method (ca 3 ̆e 50 ka) and the calibration range of aspartic acid, relative ages have been determined based on the slower racemising acids alanine, valine, leucine and proline. The relative age determinations on older fossils indicate that Last Interglacial successions have been preserved at depth within the incised valleys on the southeast coast of Australia. Aminostratigraphy, in conjunction with thermoluminescence dating, additional radiocarbon ages, and the litho- and biostratigraphic analysis of 141 vibracores, allowed the detailed assessment of the geomorphological evolution of wave-dominated barrier estuaries that formed in both broad, and narrow, incised valleys on the southeast coast of Australia. Results from the stratigraphic and geochronological analysis show that the estuaries investigated in this thesis have an evolutionary pathway that is different to previous models of barrier estuary evolution. In contrast to the earlier models of barrier estuary evolution, this thesis places a greater emphasis on the influence of the antecedent Late Pleistocene landsurface on hegeomorphological evolution of barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia. The Late Pleistocene sediments are represented by dense, <b>mottled</b> estuarine <b>clays</b> and/or by remnant barrier systems comprising medium-grained quartz sand with a clay matrix. The Late Pleistocene sediments preserved within the incised bedrock valleys represent sedimentary successions deposited during previous high-stands in sea-level that have undergone minor diagenetic alteration during subsequent sea-level lowstands. Therefore, the Late Pleistocene sediments now represent low-stand weathering profiles and provided the substrate over which Holocene sedimentary successions have been deposited. In particular, the preservation of remnant Last Interglacial barrier systems are found underlying the Holocene barrier systems and provide a core over which Holocene barrier sediments have accumulated. Results from this study have also shown that Holocene transgressive sands are more extensive than previously anticipated and form a basal, near basin-wide shell-rich deposit that extends almost up to present sea-level. The transgressive sandsheet facies lies unconformably over the Late Pleistocene antecedent landsurface and was deposited during the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT) when rising sea-levels breached Last Interglacial remnant barriers and inundated shallow incised valleys causing more open marine conditions to persist between 8, 000 and ca 5, 500 years ago. This contrasts with established models for barrier estuary evolution on the southeast coast of Australia where Holocene PMT sandsheets were restricted to the mouths of incised valleys and back-barrier central basin muds lie directly over the antecedent Pleistocene landsurface. This study also presents a database of 121 previously published radiocarbon ages obtained from fossil molluscs, organic material and fixed biological indicators from back-barrier sedimentary successions and the marginal marine environment on the southeast coast of Australia that have been used to constrain Holocene sea-level fluctuations. The database has been limited to fossil materials that have an accurate description of facies association and stratigraphic relationship to present mean sea-level (PMSL). An assessment of the uncertainty terms associated with the various proxy sea-level indicators is made and radiocarbon ages are calibrated to sidereal years. Additional radiocarbon ages and aspartic acid racemisationderived ages obtained on fossils preserved in the Holocene PMT sandsheets deposited inshallow incised valleys are presented in this thesis. A synthesis of the previously published radiocarbon ages and new data presented in this thesis has permitted a revised Holocene sealevel curve for the southeast coast of Australia to be delineated. Results show that rising sea levels during the most recent PMT attained an elevation of around - 10 m by 10, 000 cal yr BP and continued to rise to ca - 5 m by 8, 500 cal yr BP. Between 8, 300 and 8, 000 cal yr BP sealevel had risen to at least 3 m below PMSL and inundated shallow incised valleys, resulting in the deposition of shell-rich transgressive sandsheets. The most recent PMT sea-levels attained present levels around 7, 700 cal yr BP, slightly earlier than a previously proposed culmination of ca 7, 000 cal yr BP. Results indicate that sea-level continued to rise to between 1 and 1. 5 m above PMSL by 7, 400 cal yr BP during the culmination of the most recent PMT and was followed by a sea-level highstand that lasted to some time between 3, 000 and 2, 000 years ago. This was followed by a relatively slow and smooth regression of sea-level from ca + 1. 5 m to present levels. A series of minor negative and positive oscillations in relative sealevel associated with variations in ocean topography and/or climate change during the mid to late Holocene appear to be superimposed over the Holocene sea-level highstand and subsequent smooth sea-level regression. This study highlights the potential of aspartic acid racemisation as an important supplement for dating of fossils preserved in Holocene marginal marine deposits. This thesis also represents the most rigorous application of the aspartic acid racemisation dating method to the investigation of Holocene sedimentary infill of incised valley systems, and sea-level change during the most recent PMT. The evolutionary models of barrier estuary evolution developed in this thesis show that both the antecedent Late Pleistocene substrate and fluctuating Holocene sea levels have had a greater influence on the geomorphological evolution of barrier estuaries than previously anticipated. These revised models of estuary evolution can be applied to other shallow incised valley systems on tectonically stable, wavedominated coastlines, and provide a template for future studies in wave-dominated barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia...|$|R
