5000|$|The 807 {{is fully}} rated to 60 MHz, derated to 55% at 125 MHz in Class C, Plate-modulated operation, thus they were popular with amateur radio {{operators}} (radio hams). In this application a single 807 could be run in class-C as an oscillator or amplifier {{which could be}} keyed on and off to transmit Morse Code in CW mode. For voice transmission on AM a final amplifier {{with one or more}} 807s, up to about four, could be connected in parallel running class-C. Connecting multiple 807s in parallel produced more power to feed to the antenna. Often the <b>modulator</b> <b>stage</b> (simply a transformer-coupled audio amplifier for A.M., with the secondary of its output transformer in series with the anode supply of the final amplifier), was also constructed using 807s. Many hams found multiple paralleled 807s a cheaper alternative to a single larger valve, such as a single 813, as many military surplus 807s became available cheaply after World War II. In Australia 807s are affectionately referred to as [...] "stubbies" [...] because they are almost as ubiquitous as that common Australian beer container.The class C operational values in the info box at the right are for anode modulated A.M. operation; for CW operation a maximum anode voltage of 600 is permissible, whereby the anode current increases to 100 mA and the anode/plate dissipation rises to 25 watts. The screen voltage is the same, at 300, but its dissipation rises to 3.5 watts.37 watts of R.F. power is produced from 220 mW of drive but only a 50% duty cycle is allowed. The maximum allowable negative control grid, g1 excursion allowable is -200 volts and average control grid current is 5mA in both A.M. and CW modes.Later versions could be used on CW with a supply voltage up to 750 V and a current of 100 mA to produce 50-55 watts of output power.|$|E

Both waveforms implement a satellite modem using QPSK modulation at 1 M BPS data rates with one half rate convolutional encoding. Both waveforms are partitioned the same across the general purpose processor (GPP) and the {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA). Both waveforms implement the same equivalent set of radio functions on the GPP and FPGA. The GPP implements the majority of the radio functions and the FPGA implements the final digital RF <b>modulator</b> <b>stage.</b> One waveform is implemented directly on the SDR development system and the second waveform is implemented using the JTRS/SCA model. This paper contrasts the amount of resources to implement both waveforms and demonstrates the importance of waveform partitioning across the SDR development system...|$|E
30|$|The {{single port}} version {{provided}} {{is similar to}} the software implementation of the MT 19937 algorithm as it does not provide any significant parallelization in the generation of the seeds. The only parallelism that is exploited is in the concurrent execution of seed value <b>modulator</b> (<b>stage</b> 2) and output generator (stage 3). It was also found that {{it was not possible to}} pipeline the output generator to more than 3 stages as it was tied to the seed value modulator. Significant improvements in throughput could be achieved by the parallelization of the stages 2 and 3 in addition to executing them in parallel as shown above. However, the problem with parallelizing stages 2 and 3 is that currently the seeds are all stored in a single dual port BRAM. It is not possible to carry out multiple reads and multiple writes to a single BRAM in one clock cycle. Previously in [7] parallelization of both these stages was achieved by dividing the seeds into multiple BRAMs. This however significantly increased the area requirements of the design. In the next section we study this problem in more detail and present our new design that has a high throughput and is area efficient.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{effectively}} analyze particulate matter (PM 2. 5) in air {{is becoming increasingly}} pertinent. Allen Goldstein of the University of California in Berkeley is studying the semi-volatile fraction of organic compounds in PM 2. 5 {{through the use of}} the thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph (TAG) system. However, as conventional GC does not provide adequate separation power, the development of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) was required. GC × GC works more effectively by utilizing a modulator that periodically traps and focuses analytes from a primary column onto a secondary column. This allows for the primary and secondary columns to separate the analytes based on two different properties. This report focuses on the continuing study and enhancement of a modulator designed by Ognjen Panić during his Masters project. Improving and testing the robustness of this dual <b>stage</b> <b>modulator</b> was originally the focus of this project. However, this study {{led to the development of}} a single <b>stage</b> <b>modulator.</b> In addition to that, the effect of modulator characteristics such as length of the restriction, total length of the modulator and wall thickness on the modulator performance were studied. A robustness test of the single <b>stage</b> <b>modulator</b> was also completed. Experiments conducted tested the characteristics of the new modulator to ensure it performed effectively and would satisfy the requirements of the TAG system. A study comparing the sensitivity of conventional gas chromatography and GC × GC was also preformed. The sensitivity of GC × GC was on average an order of magnitude better than that of 1 D GC...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 There is a {{significant}} need in recent mobile communication and wireless broadband systems for high-performance analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that have wide bandwidth (BW> 5 -MHz) and high data rate (> 100 -Mbps). A delta-sigma ADC is recognized as a power-efficient ADC architecture when high resolution (> 12 -b) is required. This is due to several advantages of the delta-sigma ADC including relaxed anti-aliasing filter requirements, high signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and most importantly, reduced sensitivity to analog imperfections. In this thesis, several structures and design techniques are developed {{for the implementation of}} continuoustime (CT) and discrete-time (DT) delta-sigma ADCs. These techniques save the total power consumption, reduce the design complexity, and decrease the chip die area of delta-sigma modulators. First a 4 th-order single stage CT delta-sigma ADC with a novel single-amplifier-biquad (SAB) based loop filter is presented. By utilizing the SAB networks in the loop filter of an Nth-order CT delta-sigma modulator, it requires only half the number of active amplifiers and feed-forward branches used in the conventional modulator architecture, thus decreasing the power consumption and area by reducing the number of amplifiers. The proposed scheme also enables the modulator to use a switch-capacitor (SC) adder due to the reduced number of feedforward branches to its summing block. As a sequence, it consumes less power compared to a conventional CT adder. With a 130 -nm CMOS technology, the fabricated prototype IC achieves a dynamic range of 80 dB with 10 MHz signal bandwidth and analog power dissipation lower than 12 mW. Presented as the second scheme to save power consumption and chip die area in ΔΣ modulators is a new stage-sharing technique in a discrete-time 2 - 2 MASH ΔΣ ADC. The proposed technique shares all the active blocks of the <b>modulator</b> second <b>stage</b> with its first stage during the two non-overlapping clock phases. Measurement results show that the modulator designed in a 0. 13 -um CMOS technology achieves 76 dB SNDR over a 10 MHz conversion bandwidth dissipating less than 9 mW analog power...|$|R
40|$|Although in {{developing}} countries an apolipoprotein E 4 (apoE 4) genotype may offer an evolutionary advantage, {{as it has been}} shown to offer protection against certain infectious disease, in Westernised societies it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and represents a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, late-onset Alzheimer's disease and other chronic disorders. ApoE is an important <b>modulator</b> of many <b>stages</b> of lipoprotein metabolism and traditionally the increased risk was attributed to higher lipid levels in E 4 carriers. However, more recent evidence demonstrates the multifunctional nature of the apoE protein {{and the fact that the}} impact of genotype on disease risk may be in large part due to an impact on oxidative status or the immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties of apoE. An increasing number of studies in cell lines, targeted replacement rodents and human volunteers indicate higher oxidative stress and a more pro-inflammatory state associated with the F, 4 allele. The impact of genotype on the antioxidant and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties of apoE is the focus of the current review. Furthermore, current information on the impact of environment (diet, exercise, smoking status, alcohol) on apoE genotype-phenotype associations are discussed with a view to identifying particular lifestyle strategies that could be adapted to counteract the 'at-risk' E 4 genotype...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} multi-standard and {{software-defined}} radio (SDR) receivers calls for high {{flexibility in the}} receiver building-blocks so that to accommodate several wireless services using a single receiver chain in mobile handsets. A potential approach to achieve flexibility in the receiver is to move the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) closer to the antenna so that to exploit the enormous advances in digital signal processing, in terms of technology scaling, speed, and programmability. In this context, continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma (??) ADCs show up as an attractive option. CT ?? ADCs have gained significant attention in wideband receivers, owing to their amenability to operate at a higher-speed with lower power consumption compared to discrete-time (DT) implementations, inherent anti-aliasing, and robustness to sampling errors in the loop quantizer. However, as the ADC moves closer to the antenna, several blockers and interferers are present at the ADC input. Thus, {{it is important to}} investigate the sensitivities of CT ?? ADCs to out-of-band (OOB) blockers and find the design considerations and solutions needed to maintain the performance of CT ?? modulators in presence of OOB blockers. Also, CT ?? modulators suffer from a critical limitation due to their high sensitivity to the clock-jitter in the feedback digital-to-analog converter (DAC) sampling-clock. In this context, the research work presented in this thesis is divided into two main parts. First, the effects of OOB blockers on the performance of CT ?? modulators are investigated and analyzed through a detailed study. A potential solution is proposed to alleviate the effect of noise folding caused by intermodulation between OOB blockers and shaped quantization noise at the <b>modulator</b> input <b>stage</b> through current-mode integration. Second, a novel DAC solution that achieves tolerance to pulse-width jitter by spectrally shaping the jitter induced errors is presented. This jitter-tolerant DAC doesn?t add extra requirements on the slew-rate or the gain-bandwidth product of the loop filter amplifiers. The proposed DAC was implemented in a 90 nm CMOS prototype chip and provided a measured attenuation for in-band jitter induced noise by 26. 7 dB and in-band DAC noise by 5 dB, compared to conventional current-steering DAC, and consumes 719 ?watts from 1. 3 V supply...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prostate cancer (PCa) incidences {{vary with}} genetic, {{geographical}} and ethnic dietary background of patients while angiogenesis is modulated through exquisite interplay of tumor-stromal interactions of biological macromolecules. We hypothesized that comprehensive analysis of four biomarkers modulating angiogenesis in PCa progression in two diverse populations might explain {{the variance in}} the incidence rates. Results Immunohistochemical analysis of 42 PCa biopsies reveals that though Anx-II expression is lost in both the Indian and American population with Gleason scores (GS) ranging between 6 and 10, up to 25 % of cells in the entire high grade (GS > 8) PD PCa samples from US show intense focal membrane staining for Anx-II unlike similarly graded specimens from India. Consistent with this observation, the prostate cancer cell lines PC- 3, DU- 145 and MDA PCa 2 A, but not LNCaP-R, LNCAP-UR or MDA PCa 2 B cell lines, express Anx-II. Transcriptional reactivation of Anx-II gene with Aza-dC could not entirely account for loss of Anx-II protein in primary PCa. Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) was moderately expressed in most of high grade PIN and some MD PCa and surrounding stroma. COX- 2 was not expressed in PD PCa (GS ~ 7 – 10), while adjacent smooth muscles cells stained weakly positive. Decorin expression was observed only in high grade PIN but not in any of the prostate cancers, atrophy or BPH while stromal areas of BPH stained intensively for DCN and decreased with advancing stages of PCa. Versican expression was weak in most of the MD PCa, moderate in all of BPH, moderately focal in PD PC, weak and focal in PIN, atrophy and adjacent stroma. Conclusions Expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic <b>modulators</b> changes with <b>stage</b> of PCa but correlates with angiogenic status. Focal membrane staining of Anx-II reappears in high grade PCa specimens only from US indicating differential expression of Anx-II. COX- 2 stained stronger in American specimens compared to Indian specimens. The sequential expression of DCN and VCN in progressive stages was similar in specimens from India and USA indicating no population-based differences. The mechanistic and regulatory role of Anx-II in PCa progression warrants further investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Conventional pulse-code and differential pulse-code modulators for encoding video signals are difficult to realise economically. To alleviate this problem, a technique which divides the <b>modulators</b> into two <b>stages</b> is proposed. The first stage is a two-bit instantaneously adaptive delta modulator operating at a high clock rate and using low-precision components. Two-bit signals conveying polarity and magnitude information are produced by this delta modulator and used as the input to the second stage, a code converter. The code converter transforms, digitally, delta modulated signals into Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) or Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) signals. The resolution of the final PCM or DPCM encoder depends {{on the performance of}} the delta modulator used as the input stage. For that reason, the performance of the two-bit Instantaneously Adaptive Delta Modulation (2 BIADM) encoder is evaluated. This evaluation is made in two steps. First, a semi-empirical anaysis of the High Information Delta Modulation (HIDM) is made, because the 2 BIADM system is derived from the HIDM. Then the performance of the 2 BIADM is derived considering the HIDM as a reference. For the HIDM and 2 BIADM modulators operating at the same sampling frequency, the 2 BIADM presents an improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Of 6 to 8 dB. Expressions are established to enable SNR to be calculated for the HIDM {{as a function of the}} encoding parameters. The expressions also apply to Constant Factor Delta Modulation, and represent the only known method of estimating numerically the SNR for instantaneously adaptive delta modulators. The 2 BIADM was tested, built and operated at a low sampling rate. This gave an insight into the operation of the proposed system, and complemented the computer simuLation analyses. The principles for the code conversion from the 2 BIADM to PCM or DPCM are fully discussed. The 2 BIADM does not impose restrictions on the values that the coefficients of the digital low-pass filter required in the code converter can assume. For low bandwidth expansion rates, it was verified that a 2 BIADM-to-PCM conversion filter with 5 stages performs better than a HIDM-to-PCM conversion with a filter having 256 stages (both encoders operating at the same word-rate). A generalization of the 2 -bit encoder to a N-bit adaptive DPCM system is outlined...|$|R
