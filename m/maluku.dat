5|$|Sarumpaet {{released}} her first written {{work of fiction}} on 10 December 2010, in commemoration of Human Rights Day. Entitled <b>Maluku,</b> Kobaran Cintaku (<b>Maluku,</b> Flame of My Love), the novel is about {{the love of a}} Christian woman and Muslim man set amidst the <b>Maluku</b> sectarian conflict; it delves into the causes of the conflict, including poverty and provocation by the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|The owlet-nightjars are a {{distinctive}} group of small nocturnal birds related to swifts found from the <b>Maluku</b> Islands and New Guinea to Australia and New Caledonia. There are eleven species, {{one of which}} is found in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, <b>Maluku,</b> Kobaran Cintaku (<b>Maluku,</b> Flame of My Love).|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{instrument}} has uses {{other than}} public performances. It also {{is used to}} accompany healing ceremonies/rituals (pagipat)/animistic religious ceremonies. Though this practice has died out among the Maranao due to its non-Islamic nature, some areas in Mindanao, Sabah and <b>Maluku</b> still practice this ancient tradition.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music is}} {{considered}} an ancient tradition that predates the influences of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and the West. In the Philippines, it represents the highest form of gong music attained by Filipinos and in North <b>Maluku,</b> {{it is said to}} have existed for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Technically, kulintang is the Maguindanao, Ternate and Timor {{term for}} the idiophone of metal gong kettles which are laid {{horizontally}} upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the kulintang is also called kolintang by the Maranao and those in Sulawesi, kulintangan, gulintangan by those in Sabah and the Sulu Archipelago and totobuang by those in central <b>Maluku.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang {{music has been}} waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central <b>Maluku</b> have also come to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long ago but that has all but disappeared, replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern <b>Maluku</b> Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1950s, the KWI met several times to discuss the need for a self-determined Indonesian Roman Catholic hierarchy. At these annual meetings, they touched on {{administrative}} and pastoral issues, including the translation of songs into Indonesian languages. In 1959 Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian visited the country to see the Church's preparations. The KWI formally requested their own hierarchy in a May 1960 letter; this letter received a reply from Pope JohnXXIII dated 20March 1961, which divided the archipelago into six ecclesiastical provinces: two in Java, one in Sumatra, one in Flores, one in Sulawesi and <b>Maluku,</b> and one in Borneo. Semarang became the seat of the province of Semarang, and Soegijapranata its archbishop. He was elevated on 3January 1961.|$|E
5|$|Morotai is a {{small island}} located in the Halmahera group of eastern Indonesia's <b>Maluku</b> Islands. Most of the island's {{interior}} is rugged and covered in thick jungle. The Doroeba Plain in Morotai's south-west corner is {{the largest of the}} island's few lowland areas. Prior to the outbreak of war, Morotai had a population of 9,000 and had not been commercially developed. It formed part of the Netherlands East Indies and was ruled by the Dutch through the Sultanate of Ternate. The Japanese occupied Morotai in early 1942 during the Netherlands East Indies campaign but did not garrison or develop it.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the end of the war, the Republic of South <b>Maluku</b> (RMS) {{declared}} its independence from the nascent Indonesia. Rijadi was sent to the frontline on 10 July 1950 as part of Operation Senopati. To retake the island of Ambon, Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other half was tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take to the beach in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.|$|E
5|$|Because kulintang-like {{ensembles}} {{extended over}} various groups with various languages, the term {{used for the}} horizontal set of gongs varied widely. Along with it begin called kulintang, it is also called kolintang, kolintan, kulintangan, kwintangan, k’lintang, gong sembilan, gong duablas, momo, totobuang, nekara, engkromong, kromong/enkromong and recently kakula/kakula nuada. Kulintang-like instruments are played by the Maguindanao, Maranao, Iranun, Kalagan, Kalibugan and more recently the Tboli, Blaan and Subanao of Mindanao, the Tausug, Samal, Sama/Badjao, Yakan and the Sangir/Sangil of the Sulu, the Ambon, Banda, Seram, Ternate, Tidore, and Kei of <b>Maluku,</b> the Bajau, Suluk, Murut, Kadazan-Dusun, Kadayah and Paitanic Peoples of Sabah, the Malays of Brunei, the Bidayuh and Iban/Sea Dayak of Sarawak, the Bolaang Mongondow and Kailinese/Toli-Toli of Sulawesi and other groups in Banjarmasin and Tanjung in Kalimantan and Timor.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands, however, was {{critically}} weakened from World War II in Europe and did {{not return}} as a significant military force until early 1946. The Japanese {{and members of the}} Allied forces reluctantly agreed to act as caretakers. As US forces were focusing on the Japanese home islands, the archipelago was put under the jurisdiction of British Admiral Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command. Allied enclaves already existed in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), Morotai (<b>Maluku)</b> and parts of Irian Jaya; Dutch administrators had already returned to these areas. In the Japanese navy areas, the arrival of Allied troops quickly prevented revolutionary activities where Australian troops, followed by Dutch troops and administrators, took the Japanese surrender (except for Bali and Lombok). Due to the lack of strong resistance, two Australian Army divisions succeeded in occupying eastern Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra {{together}} {{formed a}} single state in the sixteen-state RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These states were dissolved into the Republic over {{the first half of}} 1950. An abortive anti-Republic coup in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous Pasundan state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in Makassar during the Makassar Uprising in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent Republic of South <b>Maluku</b> (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia as a unitary state.|$|E
25|$|The {{practitioners}} mostly live in North Sumatra, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, North <b>Maluku,</b> <b>Maluku</b> (province), West Papua (province), Papua (province).|$|E
25|$|The Ambonese {{people of}} the <b>Maluku</b> Islands have family names such as Lawalata, Matulessy and Latumahina.|$|E
25|$|British {{subjects}} {{to be given}} trade access with the <b>Maluku</b> Islands, in particular with Ambon, Banda and Ternate.|$|E
25|$|Sago flour is {{made into}} {{porridge}} in eastern Indonesia, as the staple food of <b>Maluku</b> and Papuan people. The sago congee is called papeda, and usually is eaten with yellow soup made from tuna or mubara fish spiced with turmeric and lime.|$|E
25|$|Although Indonesian rebellions broke out, direct {{colonial rule}} was {{extended}} {{throughout the rest}} of the archipelago from 1901 to 1910 and control taken from the remaining independent local rulers. Southwestern Sulawesi was occupied in 1905–06, the island of Bali was subjugated with military conquests in 1906 and 1908, as were the remaining independent kingdoms in <b>Maluku,</b> Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Nusa Tenggara. Other rulers including the Sultans of Tidore in <b>Maluku,</b> Pontianak (Kalimantan), and Palembang in Sumatra, requested Dutch protection from independent neighbours thereby avoiding Dutch military conquest and were able to negotiate better conditions under colonial rule. The Bird's Head Peninsula (Western New Guinea), was brought under Dutch administration in 1920. This final territorial range would form the territory of the Republic of Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Catholicism {{arrived in}} Indonesia during the Portuguese arrival with spice trading. Many Portuguese had {{the goal of}} {{spreading}} Roman Catholicism in Indonesia, starting with Moluccas (<b>Maluku)</b> in 1534. Between 1546 and 1547, the pioneer Christian missionary, Saint Francis Xavier, visited the islands and baptised several thousand locals.|$|E
25|$|In 1667 the Treaty of Breda {{ended the}} conflict. The Dutch did not press their claims on New Netherland. In return, they were granted the tiny Island of Run in North <b>Maluku,</b> rich in nutmegs, and a {{guarantee}} for their {{de facto possession}} of Suriname, captured by them that year.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as {{information}} minister, several regions in Indonesia were rocked by rebellious uprisings including in West Java (Legion of Ratu Adil), South Sulawesi (by Andi Aziz), and <b>Maluku</b> (by Chris Soumokil). Mononutu along with Sukarno visited these regions and in large open-air meetings promoted the ideal of a unified nation.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Japanese occupation in 1942, Mononutu was sought by the Japanese because of his nationalistic stance and relationship with nationalist organizations. With the help of a sympathetic Japanese named Yamanishi, Mononutu fled to the island of Ternate (the northern part of the <b>Maluku</b> Islands) and remained there {{until the end of the}} occupation.|$|E
25|$|By {{agreement}} between the administration of Buru district and local military authorities, the military airfield at Namlea (runway 750 meters) is used for air transportation. Aircraft CASA C-212 Aviocar make 96 passenger flights a year between Namlea and several towns of <b>Maluku.</b> In 2007, construction began of a civil airport near the villages of Suva and Namrole, about 30km south-west of Namlea.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major threat}} to the tourism {{industry}} are sectarian and separatist conflicts in Indonesia. Papua is still affected by Papuan separatism, while <b>Maluku</b> and Central Sulawesi have suffered in recent years from serious sectarian conflicts. Conversely, decades of separatism-related violence in Aceh ended in 2005 with the signing of a peace agreement between the Indonesia Government and the Free Aceh Movement.|$|E
25|$|Western {{influence}} {{started to}} enter in the 16th century, {{with the arrival}} of the Portuguese in Malacca, <b>Maluku</b> and the Philippines, the latter being settled by the Spanish years later. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies; the French Indochina; and the British Strait Settlements. By the 19th century, all Southeast Asian countries were colonised except for Thailand.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the Indonesian army {{evacuated}} {{hundreds of}} Christian {{refugees from the}} remote Kesui and Teor islands in <b>Maluku</b> after the refugees stated {{that they had been}} forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion.|$|E
25|$|When the VOC went bankrupt, the {{possessions}} of VOC {{were transferred}} under {{the administration of}} the government of <b>Maluku</b> in 1800. Most of the possessions of the former VOC were subsequently occupied by Great Britain during the Napoleonic wars, including Fort Oranje in 1810. After the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by the Congress of Vienna, Fort Oranje was restored to the Dutch in 1817.|$|E
25|$|The great {{prosperity}} of Majapahit was {{probably due to}} two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice cultivation, and during Majapahit's prime numerous irrigation projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of <b>Maluku,</b> and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided {{an important source of}} income for Majapahit.|$|E
25|$|Nusantara, areas {{which do}} not reflect Javanese culture, but are {{included}} as colonies {{and they had to}} pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in Malay peninsula, Borneo, Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi and <b>Maluku.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first regular {{contact between}} Europeans and {{the peoples of}} Indonesia began in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in <b>Maluku.</b> Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch {{established}} the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and in following decades, the Dutch gained a foothold in Batavia and Amboina. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the company became the dominant European power in the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The Darul Islam rebels under Kartosuwirjo in West Java {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} Sukarno's authority and declared a NII (Negara Islam Indonesia – Islamic State of Indonesia) in August 1949. Rebellions in support of Darul Islam also broke out in South Sulawesi in 1951, and in Aceh in 1953. Meanwhile, pro-federalism members of the disbanded KNIL launched failed rebellion in Bandung (APRA rebellion of 1950), in Makassar in 1950, and in Ambon (Republic of South <b>Maluku</b> revolt of 1950).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} letters written in Malay is a letter from Sultan Abu Hayat of Ternate, <b>Maluku</b> Islands in present-day Indonesia, dated around 1521–1522. The letter is addressed to the king of Portugal, following contact with Portuguese explorer Francisco Serrão. The letters show sign of non-native usage; the Ternateans used (and still use) the unrelated Ternate language, a West Papuan language, as their first language. Malay was used solely as a lingua franca for inter-ethnic communications.|$|E
25|$|Portugal {{established}} trading ports at far-flung locations like Goa, Ormuz, Malacca, Kochi, the <b>Maluku</b> Islands, Macau, and Nagasaki. Guarding {{its trade}} from both European and Asian competitors, Portugal dominated {{not only the}} trade between Asia and Europe, but also much of the trade between different regions of Asia, such as India, Indonesia, China, and Japan. Jesuit missionaries, such as the Basque Francis Xavier, followed the Portuguese to spread Roman Catholic Christianity to Asia with mixed success.|$|E
25|$|After 1487, Jakob Fugger was the {{de facto}} head of the Fugger {{business}} operations which soon had an almost monopolistic hold on the European copper market. Copper from Slovakia was transported through Antwerp to Lisbon, and from there shipped to India. Jakob Fugger {{also contributed to the}} first and only trade expedition to India that German merchants cooperated in, a Portuguese fleet to the Indian west coast (1505/06) as well as a failed Spanish trade expedition to the <b>Maluku</b> Islands.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese {{rushed to}} seize the {{surviving}} crew and built a fort in Ternate. In 1525, Charles I of Spain sent another expedition westward to colonize the <b>Maluku</b> Islands, claiming {{that they were in}} his zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by García Jofre de Loaísa and included the most notable Spanish navigators: Juan Sebastián Elcano and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young Andrés de Urdaneta.|$|E
