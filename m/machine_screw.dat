5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach.

50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} tap and dies and urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws.|$|E

5000|$|ASME {{standards}} {{specify a}} variety of [...] "Machine Screws" [...] in diameters ranging up to 0.75 in. These fasteners are often used with nuts but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts). They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction. In practice, {{they tend to be}} mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> can be referred to as stove bolts.|$|E

50|$|The name <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is {{somewhat}} of a , because <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> {{spend much of their}} time making things that are not screws and that in many cases are not even threaded.

5000|$|The two editions have {{completely}} different covers. The Y edition uses a graphic of a comical anthropomorphic <b>machine</b> <b>screw,</b> which some have interpreted as either an accusation {{that the group}} [...] "screwed" [...] the label by leaving (even though their departure {{may have been a}} result of the label folding), or a declaration that the label was [...] "screwing" [...] the group by releasing the album without their approval. Neither interpretation has been officially acknowledged, and there is no conclusive evidence that any sinister message was intended.|$|E
50|$|After {{failing to}} {{interest}} manufacturers, Thompson sold his self-centering design to Phillips in 1935. Phillips formed the Phillips Screw Company in 1934. After refining the design himself (U.S. Patent #2,046,343, U.S. Patents #2,046,837 to 2,046,840) for the American Screw Company of Providence, Rhode Island, Phillips succeeded {{in bringing the}} design to industrial manufacturing and promoting its rapid adoption as a <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> standard. One of the first customers was General Motors who used the innovative design in 1936 for its Cadillac assembly-lines. By 1940, 85% of U.S. screw manufacturers had a license for the design. Due to failing health, Phillips retired in 1945. He died in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|A {{self-tapping}} screw is a screw that can tap its own hole {{as it is}} driven into the material. For hard [...] such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting {{a gap in the}} continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a [...] and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied, and the term hand <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> or manual <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|R
50|$|A clevis bracket {{generally}} {{takes the}} form of a solid metal piece with a flat rectangular base, fitted with holes for bolts or <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> and two rounded wings in parallel forming a clevis.

50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a barrel nut, barrel bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally threaded. The boss sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|E
5000|$|Counterbores {{are made}} with {{standard}} dimensions for a certain size of screw or are produced in sizes that {{are not related to}} any particular screw size. In either case, the tip of the counterbore has a reduced diameter section referred to as the pilot, a feature essential to assuring concentricity between the counterbore and the hole being counterbored. Counterbores matched to specific screw sizes generally have integral pilots that fit the clearance hole diameter associated with a particular screw size (e.g., [...]191 inches for a number 10 <b>machine</b> <b>screw).</b> Counterbores that are not related to a specific screw size are designed to accept a removable pilot, allowing any given counterbore size to be adapted to a variety of hole sizes. The pilot matters little when running the cutter in a milling setup where rigidity is assured and hole center location is already achieved via X-Y positioning.|$|E

The basic tenets of the style (toneless screaming and staccato riffs layered over a foundation of tight, dry, double kick drum pedal bursts) are well represented on Lost Boy, but the <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> production and tone-deaf melodic structures that often accompany those parameters are not. Guitarists Robert Bloomfield and Daniel Alvarado know how to grind out basic jackhammer riffs, but they also {{know how to take}} those riffs and bend them into something real, melodic, and surprisingly progressive. Standout cuts like “Hooligans” and “Redeemer” benefit from the old-school punk gang vocals, and producer Matt Goldman (Underoath, the Chariot) allots vocalist Matthew Hasting's voice (which is surprisingly effective and utterly devoid of Cookie Monster posturing) the room it needs to be heard, resulting in another strong outing for both the band and the increasingly “solid” Solid State Records.|$|E
