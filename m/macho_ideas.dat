40|$|Governments issue {{restrictive}} {{immigration policies}} in their eagerness to protect their nations from the entrance of undesired' migrants. However, by toughening policies, individuals without immigrant background and their families may be also affected. For instance, this thesis illustrates how family reunification policies transform {{the right to have}} a family into a privilege, generating elitism and restricting the freedom of Norwegians in choosing a non-European partner. This situation, can also increase the number of immigrants with irregular status and intensify the idea of the undesired poor". Furthermore, this thesis also shows that more women than men from Latin America migrate to Norway under the grounds of family reunification. I suggest two possible explanations for this phenomenon: On the one hand, it {{may be the result of}} rooted <b>macho</b> <b>ideas</b> which prevent Latin American men from moving to a more egalitarian society. On the other hand, it may be the consequence of the relationship between a higher income requirement and the still present gender gap in Norway...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{these small}} roles, Abraham {{continued}} to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated {{with the lack of}} substantial roles, Abraham said, [...] "No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had." [...] His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a [...] "house husband". He described, [...] "I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my <b>macho</b> <b>idea</b> of life. But {{it was the best thing}} that ever happened to me." [...] Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear.|$|R
50|$|He is {{the author}} of The Male Machine (1974). The book argues that the overly <b>macho,</b> John Wayne <b>idea</b> of masculinity is {{destructive}} in both personal and public life. It makes the case specifically that the US remained in the Vietnam War longer than it otherwise would because this paradigm led US leaders to fail to examine and overestimate the international and domestic political costs of losing the war.|$|R
40|$|On the surface, Dennis Lehane’s novel Mystic River appears quite fascinated and {{occupied}} with <b>macho</b> ideals and <b>ideas</b> of heroism, vengeance, vigilantism, violence, and blind loyalty. The novel {{might even be}} said to {{paint a picture of}} a world ultimately ruled and controlled by men, who are expected to set the terms and encouraged to take charge. This points to an overt message stating that attributes such as strength, cold practicality, efficiency, action, decisiveness, and rationality – all stereo-typically masculine values – ultimately pay off and are rewarded. However, such an initial analysis may be meaningfully countered, overturned, and distrusted. Making use of feminist deconstruction, this essay argues that Mystic River’s superficial praise of stereotypical gender ideals is in fact undermined by tensions and contradictions {{beneath the surface of the}} text. This undermining in turn serves to criticize binary hierarchies at the very core of patriarchal ideology...|$|R
