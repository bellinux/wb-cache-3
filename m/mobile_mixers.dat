50|$|A Syrian {{defector}} {{who worked}} inside the chemical weapons network alleged that in January 2012 two senior Syrian officers moved about 100 kg. {{of chemical weapons}} materials from a secret military base in Nasiriyah. The Syrian source also described construction of special trucks, which could transport and mix the weapons. These <b>mobile</b> <b>mixers</b> were constructed inside Mercedes or Volvo trucks that were similar to refrigerator trucks. Inside were storage tanks, pipes and a motor to drive the mixing machinery, the defector said.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to centralized batch plant system is the volumetric <b>mobile</b> <b>mixers.</b> Often referred to as On Site Concrete, Site Mixed Concrete or Mobile Mix Concrete. This is a mobile miniaturized version of the large stationary batch plant. They are used to provide Ready Mix Concrete utilizing a continuous batching process or metered concrete system. The volumetric mobile mixer is a truck that holds sand, rock, cement, water, fiber, and some add mixtures and color {{depending on how the}} batch plant is outfitted. These trucks mix or batch the ready mix on the job site it's self. This type of truck can mix as much or as little amount of concrete as needed. The on site mixing eliminates the travel time hydration that can cause the transit mixed concrete to become unusable, These trucks are just as precise as the centralized batch plant system, since the trucks are scaled and tested using the same ASTM (American standard test method) like all other ready mix manufactures. This is a hybrid approach between centralized batch plants and traditional on-site mixing. Each type of system has it's advantages and disadvantages, depending on the location, size of the job, and mix design set forth by the engineer.|$|E

50|$|A <b>mobile</b> {{concrete}} <b>mixer,</b> or <b>mobile</b> concrete dispenser as it {{is sometimes}} also called, is an on-demand concrete production solution. A <b>mobile</b> concrete <b>mixer</b> is a batch plant mounted on a chassis-usually a truck or trailer-and carries unmixed material (sand, cement, coarse aggregates, water and any other materials or chemicals needed for more specialty applications) to a job site and mixed on a continuous or intermittent basis as required for fresh maximum strength concrete.|$|R
50|$|Measuring (or proportioning) {{by volume}} not weight {{is at the}} heart of the {{volumetric}} <b>mobile</b> <b>mixer</b> and the final product is capable of accuracies better than +/- 1%. Materials are stored in separate bins and based on the mix design are proportioned into the mix; this enables the operator to mix on-site exactly what is needed eliminating overages and shortages. Proportioning gives the operator control over the mix design and how much is mixed.|$|R

50|$|Engineer Mission Modules. Engineer Mission Modules (EMM) {{components}} are flatrack-based {{and designed to}} be used on M1075 PLS trucks fitted with the Universal Power Interface Kit (UPIK). Three EMMs were procured under the initial FHTV contract, the M4 Bituminous Distributor (EMM-BD), the M5 Concrete <b>Mobile</b> <b>Mixer</b> (EMM-CMM), and the M6 Dump Body (EMM-DB). The M4 EMM-BD provides the capability to spread measured amounts of bituminous material for road preparation, repair, and other engineer applications. The M5 EMM CMM transports raw concrete materials, mixes concrete as needed, and emplaces the mixed concrete. The M6 EMM-DB transports and spreads engineering construction material such as rocks, gravel, sand, and soil. A water Distributor also now in service, this placed under contract in 2009.|$|R

40|$|The {{convergence}} of inexpensive video-enabled mobile phones, high-speed mobile data networks and ubiquitous sensing devices {{opens up a}} new design space called “live mobile video interaction”. It {{gives rise to a}} new genre of applications concerning live mobile video production, which can be seen as an instance of the said space. In this work we are particularly interested to explore potential technical challenges and opportunities presented by “live mobile video interaction”. We started our investigation by studying two existing prototypes from the said genre i. e. the Instant Broadcasting System (IBS) and the <b>Mobile</b> Vision <b>Mixer</b> (MVM). We studied their applicability for amateur users of collaborative mobile video production tools and the problems caused by inherent communication delays in the Internet. We acquired initial user feedback and conducted technical tests on Instant Broadcasting System (IBS) and <b>Mobile</b> Vision <b>Mixer</b> (MVM). Our results indicate that lack of synchronisation among video streams causes problems for directors in such systems that were not present in professional systems. We also identified two distinct video production modes depending on visual access of the director to the event that is being filmed. Based on our study we proposed technical design suggestions and indications on how to solve the synchronisation problems in respective mixing modes. We also proposed an algorithm for frame-rate exclusive synchronisation management of live streams in a collaborative mobile production environment. We further probed the design space using the research through design method, which resulted in a fully functional prototype system called “Livenature” that would incite an emotional connection that exists between people and the places they cherish. Further investigation of Livenature allowed us to produce detailed studies about experiential and technical aspects of the system, thus revealing phenomenological and technical dimensions of the design space...|$|R

40|$|In {{constructing}} or rebuilding a dairy barn, it’s normally {{only the}} cost of investment for the building (climatic barrier, foundation, floor and installations) that is evaluated in the capital investment estimate. Indirect costs as labour, forage, maintenance or animal health that occur because of differences in the building function are not considered. A simple and cheap building may lead to higher operating costs. Low costs for mechanization may lead to high labour costs and that’s why it’s important to include all building related costs when comparing construction and installations alternatives. This report shows results from manual work time studies from 13 farms with dairy cows in loose housing, representing different herd sizes (80 to 450 cows) and levels of mechanization (Automatic milking system, AMS, fixed and rotary parlour and level of mechanisation of feed distribution). The farms were visited both afternoon and morning during season with no grazing. The farmers and the cattle employees answered a questionnaire about work routines and herd information. Following type of work procedures were investigated: dairy cows (milking cleaning of parlour, feeding, littering, and cleaning of cubicles and other work), heifers (feeding, littering, cleaning and other work) and calves (milk feeding, feeding, littering, cleaning and other work). All figures are given as minutes per milking cow and day. There were big time differences between equal milking systems. The AMS barns had the shortest work time for milking (0. 27 to 0. 80 min/cow and day). The various milking time in the AMS stables depended on the numbers of alarms and cows needed to be caught for milking. Work time in the milking parlours (1. 84 to 3. 96 min/cow and day) depended on use of automatic cow gate or herd dog that pushed the cows. For calves, work time varied from 0 min (suckling cows) to 0. 57 min/cow and day. Work time for the young stock varied considerable (0. 32 to 1. 05 min/cow and day). Five model farms were constructed to show the effect of number of cows {{and the level of}} mechanization on the working time. With AMS in a 140 head herd and {{with a high degree of}} mechanization, the work time became 2. 1 min/cow and day. The work time became three times higher (6. 28 min/cow and day) in a herd of the same size using 2 x 8 herringbone parlour and with a low tech mechanisation. The effect of both herd size and level of mechanization was shown in the 400 head herd with a rotary parlour and a <b>mobile</b> <b>mixer</b> wagon where the work time became 3. 87 min/cow and day...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A unified {{receiver}} front-end (RFE) for mobile TV {{covering the}} VHF-III, UHF and L bands is described. Perfor-mance, power and area efficiencies are advanced in threefold: 1) a gain-boosting current-balancing balun-LNA exhibits high lin-earity, wideband output balancing and adequate against gain control; 2) a current-reuse mixer-low-pass-filter merges quadra-ture-/harmonic-rejection mixing and third-order current-mode post-filtering in one block, enhancing linearity and noise just where both are demanding, while saving power and area for its simplicity; 3) a direct injection-locked 4 -/ 8 -phase LO generator relaxes the master LO frequency by avoiding frequency division. Fabricated in 65 -nm CMOS the RFE measures 4 -dB noise figure, 17 -to- 35 -dB gain range, and 32 3. 4 -dBm IIP 2 /IIP 3 with no tuning. The power consumption ranges from 43 (170 MHz) to 55 mW (1. 7 GHz) at 1. 2 -/ 2. 5 -V supplies. The die size is 0. 46 mm.
