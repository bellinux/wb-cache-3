Besides giving a natural interpretation of the wavefunction and the Born rule, the model accommodates the collapse of the wave packet and other quantum paradoxes such as EPR and the Ahanorov-Bohm effect. The model also gives a new perspective on the 'relational' nature of quantum mechanics: that is, whether the wave function of a physical system is "real" or simply reflects the observer's partial knowledge of the system. We simulate the model for a 2 -slit experiment, and indicate possible deviations of the model's predictions from conventional quantum mechanics.

40|$|In {{frequency}} modulation (FM) systems, a continuous-time information signal is modulated onto a sinusoidal carrier wave {{by using the}} information signal to modulate {{the frequency of the}} carrier wave. In this thesis, a more general type of modulation is developed, of which FM is a special case, that we refer to as rate modulation. A rate modulation system consists of a dynamical system whose rate of evolution is varied in proportion to an information signal. The rate-modulated carrier wave is a scalar function of the state variables of the modulator. The thesis is focused on three aspects of rate modulation and demodulation systems. First, explicit expressions are derived for the power density spectrum of the rate <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> for sinusoidal modulation. Second, a systematic procedure is derived for constructing demodulators. This procedure requires that the dynamical system used in the modulator has a known exponentially convergent observer. Assuming such an observer is known, a systematic procedure for constructing demodulators is given that depends on the underlying dynamical system in a simple manner. Finally, the quasi-moment neglect closure technique is used to approximate the signal-to-noise ratio when the carrier wave is corrupted by additive white-noise. by Wade P. Torres. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Torsional {{vibration}} can {{be characterized}} as the cyclic variation of shaft speed, which can cause various failures in rotating machines, such as: gear-tooth breakage, blade-off due to blade fatigue in steam turbines, break-off of shafts, and overloading of components fitted onto the shaft. Commercially, {{there are only a few}} systems available that measure this type of vibration as compared to lateral vibration measurement systems. Most of these systems required modifications to the rotating machine, which in some cases are unacceptable. Therefore, it has become common practice to develop in-house torsional vibration measurement systems. A common measurement technique, called Time Interval Measurement (TIMS), calculates the instantaneous speed of the shaft from a frequency <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b> Since torsional vibration is the cyclic variation of shaft speed, the shaft speed can be used to determine torsional vibration. Noise can be easily introduced into this type of system masking the torsional vibration; this was apparent in the measurement system developed by Kar, which was used as a baseline for the experiments conducted in this thesis. Various techniques were employed to reduce the effects of the noise in the measurement system, such as (1) created an algorithm, different than the one used by Kar, to calculate shaft speed, (2) increased the sampling rate of the data acquisition boards, (3) resampled the shaft speed into the order domain in order to remove harmonic noise, and (4) created an algorithm that corrects the shaft speed calculation to account for unequal spacing of encoder segments. These noise reducing techniques were compiled into a LabVIEW? program in order to develop a robust measurement system. Each technique was tested individually on two test rigs constructed at the Turbomachinery Laboratory. Each technique proved to reduce the noise introduced into the system, but the geometric compensation algorithm proved to be the most effective in reducing the noise. This thesis proved that an in-house measurement system could be developed at a relatively low cost and with relative ease...|$|E

Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.

The most efficient and most common circuit for radiofrequency selection and amplification used in radio receivers is the superheterodyne. In that system, incoming signals are mixed with a signal from a local oscillator to produce intermediate frequencies (IF) that are equal to the arithmetical sum and difference of the incoming and local frequencies.

The idea of using continuous-wave radio signals was in direct conflict with the current orthodoxy that the abrupt [...] "whiplash" [...] effect produced by large electrical sparks was needed in order to create adequately strong signals. John Ambrose Fleming, a Marconi associate, was particularly dismissive in his book The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy, a detailed review {{of the state of the}} art as he saw it that was published in 1906.
