Donati's publications of his observations (in 1862) were the first disclosure of the prism doubling idea, and because the prism was practical to build and much more compact than <b>multiple</b> <b>prism</b> arrangements typical of that period for producing high spectral dispersion, Amici's invention quickly {{caught the attention of}} researchers throughout Europe. However, the dispersion of Amici prisms can be accurately calculated using the multiple-prism dispersion theory assuming no spatial separation between the prism components.|$|E

The real {{number of different}} shapes is lower since some configurations are spatially impossible (because they would require <b>multiple</b> <b>prisms</b> to occupy the same region of space).

40|$|In this paper, I {{engage with}} Roland Barthes' The {{grain of the}} voice (1985) {{to move into a}} {{discussion}} of the apophatic or liminal unknowable voice of the scriptor. The narrative of self claims a reality rather than a fictionality. Yet in a text proclaimed as an autobiography, there are multiple authorial voices available for the reader to obtain, just as there are <b>multiple</b> <b>prisms</b> that readers bring to the text itself. Critical elements emerge in the writing and the reading of an autobiographer. This paper does not accept the contention that a 'subject writer' engages an 'object reader' in the recorded life that aims to seduce the reader. Rather, it proposes the production of a liminal voice that is apparent to the reader, but unknowable for the writer. It looks at how the subjective self reveals itself through performance rather than self-analysis that is a type of translation of self on to the page. The Greek words 'apophasis' and 'liminal' are investigated in relationship to the proclaimed autobiographic text. The apophatic is shown as a way of indicating what is both said and kept away from saying yet indicated in the text, the liminal as being on the threshold of the expressed text. Both challenge views of textuality and discourse to deal with Roland Barthes' idea of the 'death of the author as god' that enlivens the role of the reader. The subjective academic narrative is the methodology I describe, apply and exemplify...|$|R
40|$|Silicon and {{germanium}} {{are perhaps}} the two most well-understood semiconductor materials {{in the context of}} solid state device technologies and more recently micromachining and nanotechnology. Meanwhile, these two materials are also important in the field of infrared lens design. Optical instruments designed for the wavelength range where these two materials are transmissive achieve best performance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures to enhance signal from the scene over instrument background radiation. In order to enable high quality lens designs using silicon and germanium at cryogenic temperatures, we have measured the absolute refractive index of <b>multiple</b> <b>prisms</b> of these two materials using the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as a function of both wavelength and temperature. For silicon, we report absolute refractive index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K at wavelengths from 1. 1 to 5. 6 microns, while for germanium, we cover temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K and wavelengths from 1. 9 to 5. 5 microns. We compare our measurements with others in the literature and provide temperature-dependent Sellmeier coefficients based on our data to allow accurate interpolation of index to other wavelengths and temperatures. Citing the wide variety of values for the refractive indices of these two materials found in the literature, we reiterate the importance of measuring the refractive index of a sample from the same batch of raw material from which final optical components are cut when absolute accuracy greater than +/- 5 x 10 ^- 3 is desired.

30|$|First, we {{calculated}} pixel-wise z-scores for TMAX, PPT, and SCPDSI for each {{month in the}} study period to reduce autocorrelation and remove the effects of spatial and seasonal variation in absolute values. These standardized values can be directly compared across datasets and between months, allowing the different variables and fires to be analyzed together. The PPT required an additional log 10 transformation prior to z-score calculation to correct its generally skewed distribution. For each fire, values from each climate variable were extracted for the 24 {{months prior to the}} date of fire ignition. Some larger fires encompassed <b>multiple</b> 2.5 minute <b>PRISM</b> pixels; the pixels covering these larger fires were averaged, yielding one set of climate variables per fire.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical cyclic potentiodynamic {{polarization}} {{experiments were}} conducted to assess crevice corrosion of Alloy 22 in de-aerated aqueous solutions of chloride and nitrate salts of potassium and sodium in the temperature range 110 - 150 C. The tests were run in neutral and slightly acidic aqueous solutions. The Alloy 22 specimens were <b>multiple</b> creviced weld <b>prisms.</b> No evidence of crevice corrosion was observed in the range 125 - 150 C. In the 120 to 160 C temperature range, the anionic concentration of stable aqueous solutions is dominated by nitrate relative to chloride. At nominally 120 C, the minimum nitrate to chloride ratio is about 4. 5, and it increases to about 22 at nominally 155 C. The absence of localized corrosion susceptibility in these solutions is attributed to the known inhibiting effect of the nitrate anion. Aqueous solution chemistry studies indicate that nitrate to chloride ratios of less than 0. 5 are possible for temperatures up to nominally 116 C. At 110 C, aqueous solutions can have dissolved chloride well in excess of nitrate. Localized corrosion was observed at nitrate to chloride ratios up to 1. 0, the highest ratio tested. The extent of localized corrosion was confined to the crevice region of the samples, and was limited for nitrate to chloride ratios {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 3...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale free-surface ocean models {{designed}} {{to run over}} climatic time scales are required to globally conserve the volume and any tracer up to machine precision. In addition, local consistency is critical and requires that the discrete tracer equation preserve constants in a closed domain {{and if there is}} no tracer source or sink. Local consistency, together with monotonicity, will ensure that no spurious tracer extrema occur. A three-dimensional, finite-element, shallow-water model is presented. The mesh is unstructured in the horizontal, extruded in the third dimension, and made up of <b>multiple</b> layers of <b>prisms.</b> In addition, the mesh is allowed to move in the vertical and adapts itself to the free-surface motions. It is shown that achieving consistency requires a discrete compatibility between the tracer and continuity equations. In addition, to ensure global tracer conservation in a consistent way, a discrete compatibility between the tracer, continuity, and free-surface elevation equations must be fulfilled. It is suggested that this compat-ibility constraint, together {{with the use of a}} numerically stable scheme, severely restricts the choice of usable finite-element spatial discretizations. A consistent and conservative time-stepping algorithm is described for which a unique time step is used. It is suggested that future research is needed in order to design a consistent and conservative split-explicit algorithm. Some illustrative test cases are presented in which the method is shown to satisfy all conservation properties. A few experiments in which consistency breaks down are carried out, and the consequences of this breakdown process are investigated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Suppose filesystems {{supported}} cloning of any {{subset of}} directories, even those containing gigabytes of data, almost instantaneously, while guaranteeing isolation between the original copy and the cloned copy. We {{show that this}} simple abstraction can greatly simplify many routine tasks, both for a single operating system and for clusters of similar virtual machines in a virtual server farm. In this paper, we describe the design of Prism, a file server that supports lightweight cloning and centralized file management of multiple filesystems. Unlike copying in standard file systems or cloning operations on virtual disks, the Prism filesystem supports high-level operations to create fast clones of any part of a filesystem. After cloning, each cloned file system can evolve independently, providing similar read/write semantics as if the file systems were copied from each other. This abstraction is useful for supporting virtual server farms. It is possible to create filesystems for new virtual machines interactively, while protecting private home directories, log files, and password files. Furthermore, when cloned systems have {{a high degree of}} similarity, Prism makes centralized scanning operations (e. g., for malware checking) for multiple cloned file systems significantly faster than scanning each file system individually. Prism’s capabilities are also applicable to individual operating systems. Prism can help provide lightweight file system isolation between processes to prevent untrusted code from damaging the filesystem. Prism is currently implemented by extending the ext 3 filesystem. On the Postmark benchmark and the Apache build workload, Prism’s performance is comparable to that of a standard ext 3 filesystem. For applications that require scanning or comparing <b>multiple,</b> cloned filesystems, <b>Prism</b> is significantly faster. This paper describes the design and evaluation of the Prism filesystem. ...|$|R
40|$|The Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) paleoenvironmental {{reconstruction}} is an internally {{consistent and}} comprehensive global synthesis {{of a past}} interval of relatively warm and stable climate. It is regularly used in model studies that aim to better understand Pliocene climate, to improve model performance in future climate scenarios, and to distinguish model-dependent climate effects. The PRISM reconstruction is constantly evolving in order to incorporate additional geographic sites and environmental parameters, and is continuously refined by independent research findings. The new PRISM three dimensional (3 D) reconstruction differs from previous PRISM reconstructions in that it includes a subsurface ocean temperature reconstruction, integrates geochemical sea surface temperature proxies to supplement the faunal-based temperature estimates, and uses numerical models {{for the first time}} to augment fossil data. Here we describe the components of PRISM 3 D and describe new findings specific to the new reconstruction. Highlights of the new PRISM 3 D reconstruction include removal of Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes and creation of open waterways in locations where the current bedrock elevation is less than 25 m above modem sea level, due lathe removal of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the reduction of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The mid-Piacenzian oceans were characterized by a reduced east-west temperature gradient in the equatorial Pacific, but PRISM 3 D data do not imply permanent El Nino conditions. The reduced equator-to-pole temperature gradient that characterized previous PRISM reconstructions is supported by significant displacement of vegetation belts toward the poles, is extended into the Arctic Ocean, and is confirmed by <b>multiple</b> proxies in <b>PRISM</b> 3 D. Arctic warmth coupled with increased dryness suggests the formation of warm and salty paleo North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and a more vigorous thermohaline circulation system that may have provided the enhanced ocean heat transport necessary to move warm surface water to the Arctic. New deep,ocean temperature data also suggests greater warmth and further southward penetration of paleo NADW...|$|R
