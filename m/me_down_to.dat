500|$|Hidden Treasures is a rarities {{compilation}} {{that features}} songs that Megadeth had recorded {{for a number}} of projects, but had not released on one of the band's studio albums. Most of these were contributions to film soundtracks. In 1989, Megadeth recorded a version of Alice Cooper's [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy" [...] for the soundtrack to the Wes Craven-directed horror film Shocker. It marks drummer Nick Menza's recording debut with the band. The recording was released as a single and peaked at number13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1990. [...] "Go to Hell" [...] appeared on the [...] in 1991. The song features the same prayer, [...] "Now I Lay <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> Sleep", used in [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] by Metallica, and can be heard {{at the beginning of the}} track.|$|E
500|$|By 1933 Terry-Thomas {{had moved}} out of Finchley and into a friend's flat; the friend was a film extra who {{introduced}} him to the idea of working in the industry. Terry-Thomas made his uncredited film debut in the 1933 film, The Private Life of Henry VIII, which starred Charles Laughton in the title role. Between 1933 and 1941 Terry-Thomas appeared in 16films, as an uncredited extra in all but one; he later said that [...] "this work suited <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ground. It wasn't really like work to me. I got an enormous kick out of it". His first speaking role came in the 1935 Buddy Rogers comedy Once in a Million where he shouted [...] "A thousand!" [...] during an auction. During the 1936 musical comedy This'll Make You Whistle, starring Jack Buchanan, he permanently damaged his hearing as a result of jumping into a water tank. In between his film work, he developed his cabaret act and was employed as a dance teacher at the Aida Foster School of Dancing in Golders Green.|$|E

500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] was {{acclaimed}} by critics. Chris True of Allmusic {{declared it}} [...] "one of Metallica’s best moments" [...] and a [...] "burst of stadium level metal that, once {{away from the}} buildup intro, never lets up". According to him, the song's breakdown [...] "brilliantly utilizes that 'Now I Lay <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> Sleep' bedtime prayer {{in such a way}} as to add to the scary movie aspect of the song". Steve Huey, in Allmusic review of Metallica, described it as one of the album's best songs, with [...] "crushing, stripped-down grooves". Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone described [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] as [...] "possibly the first metal lullaby" [...] and wrote that the song [...] "tell the tale" [...] of the album's [...] "detail and dynamic, [...] song structures and impact of individual tracks". [...] Sid Smith from the BBC called the song [...] "psycho-dramatic" [...] and noted that the [...] "terse motifs served notice that things were changing" [...] with Metallica's new album. Blender magazine's Tim Grierson says that the lyrics [...] "juxtapose childhood bedtime rituals and nightmarish imagery" [...] and praises the [...] "thick bottom end and propulsive riff".|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove my head against the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] moves at a {{tempo of}} 123 {{beats per minute}} for 5:32, running {{slightly}} above the average song length of the album. It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". Just a few seconds before the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay <b>Me</b> <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't say a word, and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, in your closet, in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E
