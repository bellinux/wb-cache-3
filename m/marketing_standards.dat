2500|$|Free-range {{poultry farming}} allows {{chickens}} to roam freely {{for a period}} of the day, although they are usually confined in sheds at night to protect them from predators or kept indoors if the weather is particularly bad. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that a free-range chicken must have day-time access to open-air runs during at least half of its life. Unlike in the United States, this definition also applies to free-range egg laying hens. The European Union regulates <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> for egg farming which specifies a minimum condition for free-range eggs that [...] "hens have continuous daytime access to open-air runs, except in the case of temporary restrictions imposed by veterinary authorities". The RSPCA [...] "Welfare standards for laying hens and pullets" [...] indicates that the stocking rate must not exceed 1,000 birds per hectare (10 m2 per hen) of range available and a minimum area of overhead shade/shelter of 8 m2 per 1,000 hens must be provided.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} existing work {{on building}} design through {{a focus on}} one important yet understudied form of regulation: <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> <b>Market</b> <b>standards</b> are agreed upon definitions of ‘necessary’ provision in buildings and are fundamental in ‘formatting’ markets and determining {{the value of a}} building in the market. The paper presents a case study of the design of ten commercial offices in London, UK, the effects of <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> on the designs and on the potential for the development of lower energy buildings. Theoretically, the paper integrates literatures on <b>standards,</b> institutions and <b>markets</b> to argue that <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> do important ‘work’ in design processes that requires closer scrutiny. In particular, we show that market standards: are an important form of normative and cultural regulation in the field of commercial office design; format and act as calculative devices in property markets; and result in forms of knowledge diminution that break the relationship between building design and occupiers’ practices. Together, these effects result in particular designs being legitimised and valued, and lower energy designs being delegitimised, devalued and pushed to the periphery of the attention of commercial office designers...|$|R

40|$|What {{explains}} {{the creation and}} strengthening of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> through the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) ? This thesis addresses this question by analyzing the creation and strengthening of four of IOSCO’s international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> between 1991 and 2010 relating to the following issues: the governance of cross-border financial crime, the objectives and principles of domestic securities market regulation, the regulation of credit rating agencies, and the regulation of hedge funds. This thesis argues that the creation and strengthening of these standards {{is derived from the}} role and influence of three different political actors: the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators, domestic legislatures, and states. The role and influence of these different political actors differs across issue areas and across time. To account for the differentiated sources of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards,</b> this thesis proposes a Principal-Agent (PA) analytical framework. Domestic legislatures (the principal) delegate to securities regulators (the agent) the authority to oversee and regulate domestic securities markets by granting regulators specific forms of statutory authority. Exercising discretion within this act of delegation, domestic securities regulators act together in a transgovernmental network to create and strengthen international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> They are prompted to act by threats to the integrity and stability of developed financial centers from under-regulated or ineffectively regulated foreign financial centers, as well as by new policy preferences of domestic legislatures seeking to regulate previously unregulated financial market actors. Domestic legislatures also use multiple agents to ensure that agents act consistent with their policy preferences: their concerns about the costs of under-regulated foreign jurisdictions can generate direct pressure from states on international financial regulatory institutions to strengthen the implementation of international financial standards. This thesis makes an empirical contribution to existing literature by analyzing previously understudied international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> This thesis also makes a theoretical contribution to both IPE literature and PA theory within International Organization (IO) literature. For IPE literature, this thesis establishes a theoretical framework that accounts for the differentiated role and influence of the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators, domestic legislatures, and states in the creation and strengthening of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> For PA theory within IO literature, this thesis highlights the role of the principled professional interests of the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators in creating and strengthening international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

50|$|The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) of 1916(P.L. 64-190), {{as amended}} (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq.), authorizes the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration to {{establish}} official <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> (not {{health and safety}} standards) for grains and oilseeds, and requires that exported grains and oilseeds be officially weighed and inspected. Domestically marketed grain and oilseeds may be, but {{are not required to}} be, officially inspected. Export inspections are carried out by federal inspectors or by federally supervised state inspection agencies, called delegated official inspection agencies. Official inspections of domestically traded grain is done by federally supervised state agencies and private companies, called designated official inspection agencies. Typically, <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> describe the physical characteristics (such as weight, damaged kernels, foreign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and defects) of the commodity and serve as contract language to facilitate marketing. Official weighing and inspection is paid for on a fee-for service basis, not with federal funds. Major changes to the law were adopted in the USGSA Amendments of 1968, the USGSA of 1976 (P.L. 94-582), and the Grain Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-641).|$|E
