It's very infectious." [...] The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, the same technique which was used for Rihanna's previous single's artwork, [...] "We Found Love". [...] "You da Ones artwork displays the singer with her head tilted back and her eyes closed holding a cigarette between her lips. It prompted a mixed reaction from Sarah Anne Hughes for The Washington Post; while she noted that Rihanna looks [...] "perfectly coiffed," [...] she criticized the inclusion of the cigarette, and called it a [...] "social taboo." ...|$|E

I {{was the one}} who always [...] off choir, but I had an incredible music teacher who managed to convince <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything." [...] However, she felt that she [...] "stuck out" [...] by being from a lower-income family than the other girls at the school. At the age of 16, she moved to Greece with her father [...] "to connect with my heritage and learn to speak the language", and sang Greek folk songs with her grandmother. Having earned an International Baccalaureate at St. Catherine's British Embassy School in Athens, she returned to Wales two years later. She and her mother then moved to Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. Obsessed with becoming a singer, [...] "almost {{as if it was a}} disease", she worked at a petrol station for two months in order to earn money to move to London.|$|E

He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo.

500|$|In 1993, Beckinsale {{landed the}} role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen {{adaptation}} of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. [...] "Nobody even told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak." [...] The film earned over $22million at the box office. She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered. In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language [...]|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the film}} would stand alone; {{producer}} Kevin Feige said [...] "about half" [...] the movie {{would be set}} during World War II before moving into the modern day. Producer Avi Arad said, [...] "The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world {{through the eyes of}} someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?" [...] He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had [...] "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director". In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date. Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead. In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script. He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because [...] "my dad told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> one day be Captain America".

500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to hear those songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without telling <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have strangled him." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E

They taught her to ride, and she performed in her first 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show in St. Louis in April 1910. [...] Said Helen: [...] "(I) was already practicing picking up a handkerchief from the ground at full gallop. When veteran riders told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get kicked in the head, I paid no heed. Such things might happen to others, but could never happen to me, I believed. We barnstormed all over the US and the season ended all too soon. I was sorry when I had to go home, and could hardly wait to open in Boston in the spring of 1911." ...|$|E

As he was riding up Putney Hill he was overtaken {{by one of the}} royal chamberlains who presented him with a ring as a token of the continuance of his majesty's favour. When the Cardinal had heard these words of the king, he quickly lighted from his mule and knelt down in the dirt upon both knees, holding up his hands for joy, and said [...] "When I consider the joyful news that you have brought to <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do no less than greatly rejoice. Every word pierces so my heart, that the sudden joy surmounted my memory, having no regard or respect to the place; but I thought it my duty, that in the same place where I received this comfort, to laud and praise God upon my knees, and most humbly to render unto my sovereign lord my most hearty thanks for the same." ...|$|E

[...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse {{was taught}} at home {{until she was}} eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Thérèse, taught well and {{carefully}} by Marie and Pauline, found herself {{at the top of}} the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Thérèse suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. [...] "The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not been with <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill." [...] Céline informs us, [...] "She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior." [...] On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. [...] "Fortunately I could go home every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks I had, and when he kissed me all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much." [...] Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Thérèse. Going to school became more and more difficult.|$|E
