5|$|Although a ferry {{had almost}} {{certainly}} {{existed at the}} site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.|$|E

25|$|By 1961 Spencer's {{days as a}} {{first-class}} player were drawing to a close, and he appeared only twice that season, although he continued to turn out regularly for the Second XI.

25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation. Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care {{needs to be taken}} to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E

25|$|Inserts: Table saws have a {{changeable}} insert in {{the table}} through which the blade projects. Purchasable inserts are usually made out of metal. Zero-Clearance inserts can be made of a sawable material such as plastic or wood. When a Zero-Clearance insert is initially inserted, the blade is raised through the insert creating the slot. This creates a slot with no gaps around the blade. The zero clearance insert helps prevent tearout by providing support for wood fibers {{right next to the}} blade thus helping to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clean cut. Other inserts can be bought or created in the same manner, such as a dado insert.|$|E

Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground.

Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets.

500|$|The {{music for}} Myst and Riven was {{composed}} by Robyn Miller; Jack Wall created the {{score for the}} third installment. Irish stated that developing the music {{was one of the}} hardest aspects of Exile: [...] "We had to match or exceed the surrealistic style of music that Robyn [...] had pioneered. It had to be recognizable as Myst, but unique and distinctive." [...] Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games as an opportunity to give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score. Wall also echoed Irish's opinion that he wanted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different score from the [...] "wonderful sonic pastiche" [...] of Myst and Riven, yet still recognizable as a sequel to the earlier games; Wall considered copying Miller's style as the [...] "safe" [...] yet unappealing route that was expected of him.|$|E

[...] She again expressed her dislike for Karen, but thought it [...] "was a fun episode for my two favorite Dunder Mifflin couples: Ryan & Kelly and Dwight & Angela." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed the Dwight-Angela scenes, asserting that [...] "some of the best moments on screen are when those two let their freak flags fly." [...] For his work on this episode, Michael Schur received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but lost to Greg Daniels for his work on [...] "Gay Witch Hunt".|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about the things that happened, and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the spotlight on the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said Jolie {{was more}} {{affecting}} than in A Mighty Heart(2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted {{a surfeit of}} good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular. Oliver Séguret of Libération said the cast was the film's best feature. He praised the supporting actors and said Jolie's performance was forceful yet understated. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said Jolie shunned her [...] "movie star" [...] persona to appear vulnerable and resolute. He perceived the supporting characters—Amy Ryan's excepted—as having few shades of gray. David Ansen, writing in Newsweek, echoed the sentiment, but said that [...] "some stories really are about the good guys and the bad". He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing, and David Denby of The New Yorker said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, [...] "The two of them <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> proper and dull pair of collaborators." ...|$|E
500|$|First {{hinted at}} in early December 1999, Devil May Cry {{started out as}} the {{earliest}} incarnation of Resident Evil 4. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the game was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him {{to create a new}} entry in the Resident Evil series. Around the turn of the millennium, regular series writer Noboru Sugimura created a scenario for the title, based on Kamiya's idea to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> cool and stylized action game. The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of protagonist Tony, an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology. As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous Resident Evil installments and instead opted for a dynamic camera system. This new direction required the team to make a trip to Europe where they spent eleven days in the United Kingdom and Spain photographing things like Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures. Though the developers tried to make the [...] "coolness" [...] theme fit into the world of Resident Evil, Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series' survival horror roots and gradually convinced all of the staff members to make the game independent from it. Kamiya eventually rewrote the story to be set in a world full of demons and changed the hero's name to [...] "Dante". The cast of characters remained largely identical to that in Sugimura's scenario, although appearances of the hero's mother and father were written out of the story. The game's new title was revealed as Devil May Cry in November 2000. Hideki Kamiya, director of the hit video game, Devil May Cry in 2005 revealed that he chose John Taylor from the very popular English rock band, Duran Duran as the model for the game's main character, Dante. He modeled the character's looks, style, charisma and attitude after John Taylor's.|$|E
