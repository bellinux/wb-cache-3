It is cheaper than the bark of Cinchona, another source of quinine. Because of its intense flavor, the bark of Remijia is used in making tonic water.|$|R
5000|$|Nutmeg {{is known}} to have been a prized and costly spice in European medieval cuisine as a <b>flavouring,</b> <b>medicinal,</b> and {{preservative}} agent. Saint Theodore the Studite (c. 758 - 826) allowed his monks to sprinkle nutmeg on their pease pudding when required to eat it. In Elizabethan times, because nutmeg was believed to ward off the plague, demand increased and its price skyrocketed.8 ...|$|R

This paper outlines some {{of the highlights of}} secondary metabolite R&D accomplished in the 25 years since the essential oil research unit was transferred from the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Sydney to NSW Agriculture’s Wollongbar Agricultural Institute on the NSW north coast. The essential oil survey was continued, typing the Australian flora as a suitable source of isolates such as myrtenal (Astartea), myrtenol (Agonis), methyl chavicol (Ochrosperma), α-phellandren- 8 -ol (Prostanthera), methyl myrtenate (Darwinia), methyl geranate (Darwinia), kessane (Acacia), cis-dihydroagarofuran (Prosthanthera), protoanemonin (Clematis), isoamyl isovalerate (Micromyrtus), methyl cinnamate (Eucalyptus) and bornyl acetate (Boronia).

5000|$|Hops are {{the female}} flower {{clusters}} or seed cones of the hop vine Humulus lupulus, {{which are used}} as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. [...] Hops had been used for <b>medicinal</b> and food <b>flavouring</b> purposes since Roman times; by the 7th century in Carolingian monasteries {{in what is now}} Germany, beer was being made with hops, though it isn't until the thirteenth century that widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is recorded. Before the thirteenth century, beer was flavoured with plants such as yarrow, wild rosemary, and bog myrtle, and other ingredients such as juniper berries, aniseed and ginger, which would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used; between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer flavoured with gruit was known as ale, while beer flavoured with hops was known as beer. Some beers today, such as Fraoch by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|R
40|$|Plants {{and plant}} parts are {{frequently}} being used {{due to their}} <b>medicinal</b> properties, <b>flavour</b> or fragrance. The application of herbal medicines in the treatment/management of several diseases {{is as old as}} mankind. Nevertheless, majority of the world’s population solely depends on herbal medicines for the treatment and/or management of health-related issues. Statistics have revealed that approximately four billion people worldwide rely on plants as source of therapy (1). This figure demonstrates that, herbal medicines have metamorphosed to a widely accepted therapy for diver’s ailments. Apart from being widely accepted, herbal medicines have also proven to be the bedrock of modern medicine. My research associates and I have previously published a paper to therapy the significance of herbal plants to new drug discovery (2). The use of herbal medicines in the future years appears to be in doubt, even though statistics have unveiled the wide acceptance of them. This is due to the threats currently being posed by deforestation. In fact, deforestation poses a clear threat to the future of herbal medicines, as statistics by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) indicated that about 53 000 square miles of tropical forests each year during the 1980 ’s were destroyed. This statistic has by far increased in recent years and led to the postulation that if nothing is done to arrest the current high deforestation rate; the world’s rainforest may rapidly disappear (3). A conservative estimate has recently disclosed that there are about 250 000 species of higher plants in the world, with only a relatively small proportion of them being currently used for medicinal purposes (4). However, it is uncertain how many of the medicinal plants will still be in existence in years to come. This is because quite a number of them may likely go into extinction, majorly due to deforestation. The effect it may elicit to global health cannot be fathomed; as it will leave majority of the world’s population (who can’t access modern treatment) no other option than to live with their ailments. Seeing that herbal plants are a major source for new drug discovery, it will also significantly decrease the rate of new drug discovery and development. In conclusion, the best way to preserve herbal medicine practice is for all (i. e., governments, researchers, economists, farmers etc) probably is to initiate and support programs aimed at reducing deforestation to the barest minimum...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from the}} diverse uses of bamboo, the tender shoots, being low in fat, high in dietary fiber and rich in mineral content (good source of potassium) have been {{consumed}} traditionally by the people. The shoots are consumed {{due to their}} exotic taste, <b>flavour,</b> <b>medicinal</b> and nutritive value. Bamboo shoots are available for a limited period and have a short shelf-life, thus, {{they need to be}} processed and utilized immediately after harvest. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine the nutritional value and develop value added edible products from different bamboo species viz., Dendrocalamus strictus, Bambusa bambos and Bambusa tulda, found in central India and Dendrocalamus asper (known edible bamboo species of Thailand) grown in central India. Nutritional analysis revealed that the nutritive value of D. strictus, B. bamboos and B. tulda is at par with D. asper. Thus, these species have a potential for edible shoot production in central India. Different value added products viz., nuggets (bari), pickle and papad (cracker) were made from fresh bamboo shoots. Organoleptic, sensory and chemical evaluation done at monthly intervals, to determine the shelf-life of product, revealed that the products were good in taste, texture and quality for 6 months from the date of processing at ambient conditions (25 - 40 °C) in poly propylene and glass containers. Value addition (by making different edible products) will increase the utilization of bamboo shoots and provide livelihood opportunities to the local population. Present study will be useful in optimum utilization of bamboo shoots...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Pharmaceutics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Dosage forms {{have been}} {{developed}} over the years for various applications. The dosage form consists of the active drug in combination with pharmaceutical excipients. The pharmaceutical excipients solubilise, suspend, thicken, dilute, emulsify, stabilise, preserve, colour and <b>flavour</b> <b>medicinal</b> agents into efficacious and appealing dosage forms. The dosage form under investigation {{in this study is}} of the oral type. The Pheroid® is a unique drug delivery system which consists of an oil-in-water emulsion system. Emulsion based drug systems provide a suitable medium for the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs which can be incorporated into its oil or water phase for delivery to the site of action. These advantages make them more efficient as dosage form. Emulgels are either emulsion of oil-in-water or water-in-oil type, which is gelled by mixing with gelling agents. Incorporation of emulsion into gel increases its stability and makes it a dual control release system. The presence of the gel phase makes it a non-greasy formulation which favours good patient compliance. A strategy followed to improve the stability of the emulgel system is the packaging of the formula into single dose sachets to protect the product against physical and chemical breakdown during patient usage. All factors such as selection of gelling agent, preservatives and formulation methods influencing the stability and efficacy of Pheroid® emulgel are discussed. In this study, three different emulsifiers were added to the formula and the analysis of visual appearance, pH measurements, rheological studies, light microscopy and confocol laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) will provide an insight to the potential usage of emulgel as drug delivery system. A range of para-hydroxybenzoate esters was tested in the Pheroid® emulgel and the most suitable candidate chosen for further accelerated stability testing. It was thus possible to prepare a single dose emulgel with Carbopol® 934 P (0. 2 % w/v) as an emulsifier, with Nipastat® (0. 175 % w/v) and PG (10 % v/v) as preservatives into a stable dosage form suitable for further product development.

40|$|India {{is known}} as “The Home of Spices”. There are over 54 kinds of spices grown across the India. The spices that India offers in {{abundance}} are pepper, ginger, turmeric, chilli, cardamom, celery, fenugreek, fennel, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ajwain (bishop's weed), cassia, clove, nutmeg and mace etc. Interestingly, each of the spice has its own <b>flavour,</b> <b>medicinal</b> value and other interesting facts to go with it. In fact, the very commonly used word ‘AROMA’ is the ancient Greek word for spice. India dominates the global market for spice oleoresin, which is in big demand from processed food and fragrance industries that now mostly prefer natural colouring and flavouring agents to artificial ones as consumers become increasingly health conscious. India controls 60 per cent of the (13, 500 tonne) global spice oleoresins market even as China {{has emerged as a}} strong contender in paprika oleoresin, the most in-demand spice oil. India is rated as the highest pepper consuming country in the world. Though demand for pepper exists throughout the year, a surge is noticeable during the winter months. The share of India in global pepper export has declined to less than 10 per cent during last three year. The share of Indian raw pepper export has declined, India is major producer of pepper oil and pepper oleoresin in the world. 90 per cent of global pepper oleoresin is produced in India. The advantages of using oleoresins in flavours and seasonings are manifold. They enhance the visual appeal and flavour, and increase the shelf life of the products the largest oleoresin extraction firm in India. They are more economical than whole or ground spices as less quantity can give the same effect. The study is based on secondary data. The secondary data has been collected from Spices Board and International Pepper Community. And also necessary information will be gathered from various Books, Journals, Seminar Volumes, Food and Agriculture Organization statistics and Reports, Market reviews etc. The data analyzed by adopting Compound Annual Growth Rate analysis. The tables and graphs are generated from the analysis of secondary data were collected from the year 2001 to 2010...|$|R

This paper outlines some {{of the highlights of}} secondary metabolite R&D accomplished in the 25 years since the essential oil research unit was transferred from the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Sydney to NSW AgricultureÃ¢Â€Â™s Wollongbar Agricultural Institute on the NSW north coast. The essential oil survey was continued, typing the Australian flora as a suitable source of isolates such as myrtenal (Astartea), myrtenol (Agonis), methyl chavicol (Ochrosperma), ÃŽÂ±-phellandren- 8 -ol (Prostanthera), methyl myrtenate (Darwinia), methyl geranate (Darwinia), kessane (Acacia), cis-dihydroagarofuran (Prosthanthera), protoanemonin (Clematis), isoamyl isovalerate (Micromyrtus), methyl cinnamate (Eucalyptus) and bornyl acetate (Boronia). Many of these components are used, or have potential use in the fragrance, <b>flavour,</b> <b>medicinal</b> plant or insect attraction fields. Two weeds toxic to livestock in the Central West of the State are also harvested commercially as medicinal plants. Measurement of hypericin concentrations in the various plant parts of St JohnÃ¢Â€Â™s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) over two seasons has shown that the weed can be effectively managed by grazing sheep during the winter months when toxin levels are low. Syntheses of ÃŽÂ²-carbolines tribulusterine and perlolyrine have shown that the former alkaloid was misidentified in the literature and hence not the toxic principle responsible for Tribulus staggers in sheep. Poor quality (high 1, 8 -cineole Ã¢Â€Â“ low terpinen- 4 -ol) oil bearing tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) plantations have been established to the detriment of many a tea tree farmer. Analytical methods developed to check leaf quality at an early age indicated precursor sabinene constituents that convert to the active terpinen- 4 -ol both as the leaf matures or as the precursors are distilled for oil production. Tea treeÃ¢Â€Â™s major insect pest, pyrgo beetle (Paropsisterna tigrina), was seen to selectively metabolize only 1, 8 -cineole from itÃ¢Â€Â™s monoterpenoid-rich diet. Characterization of these and other metabolites from myrtaceous herbivores showed a species specific production of predominately ring hydroxylated products, some of which were attractive when bioassayed against adult beetles...|$|R
