5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object <b>made</b> <b>from</b> a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

25|$|Cabernet d'Anjou AOC The first rosé wine to be <b>made</b> entirely <b>from</b> Cabernet grapes was in 1905 but {{for most}} of the 20th century, this style of rosé took a {{backseat}} to the popularity of Rosé d'Anjou <b>made</b> predominantly <b>from</b> Grolleau. <b>Made</b> entirely <b>from</b> Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon, these rosés tend to be drier than Rosé d'Anjou with higher alcohol and potentially more character.|$|R

5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the satellite communications. The first deduction that can be <b>made</b> <b>from</b> the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
50|$|Red wine is <b>made</b> {{predominantly}} <b>from</b> Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, {{with small}} quantities of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carménère. White wine under the label Côtes de Blaye is <b>made</b> predominantly <b>from</b> Colombard and Ugni blanc, whereas white wine under the label Côtes de Bordeaux (Blaye) is <b>made</b> predominantly <b>from</b> Sauvignon blanc, Semillon and Muscadelle. The red wines are fresh and fruity, {{and should be}} drunk relatively young, while the whites (which are usually dry) are light and softly fruity.|$|R

5|$|Additional collections, then still {{believed}} to be T.toomansis, were <b>made</b> <b>from</b> South Australia in 1952, again on dead cones of unspecified Banksia, and also in 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates. Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described, various collections <b>made</b> <b>from</b> Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection.|$|E

5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to {{any group of}} stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are <b>made</b> <b>from</b> indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are <b>made</b> <b>from</b> tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.|$|E
