25|$|Internet {{linguistics}} is {{a domain}} of linguistics {{advocated by the}} English linguist David Crystal. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen {{under the influence of}} the Internet and other new media, such as Short <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> (SMS) text messaging. Since the beginning of human-computer interaction (HCI) leading to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. This study is intended to benefit both linguists and web users.|$|E

25|$|Several Nintendo 64 {{games have}} been {{released}} for the Wii's and Wii U's Virtual Console service and are playable with either the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, Wii U Pro Controller, or Wii U GamePad. There are some differences between these versions and the original cartridge versions. For example, the games run in a higher resolution and at a more consistent framerate than their Nintendo 64 counterparts. However, some features, such as Rumble Pak functionality, are not available in the Wii versions. Some features are also altered for the Virtual Console releases. For example, the VC version of Pokémon Snap allows players to send photos through the Wii's <b>message</b> <b>service,</b> while Wave Race 64s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the Kawasaki license. Several games from Rare have seen release on Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade service, including Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie and Perfect Dark, the reason being that Rareware was purchased by Microsoft in 2002. However one exception was Donkey Kong 64, which was released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console since Nintendo owns the rights to that game.|$|E

500|$|Comverse {{became a}} market leader in voice {{messaging}} software and boomed {{during the late}} 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use. [...] Much of its market focus was on wireless operators and overseas companies, and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market. The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box. [...] Comverse expanded this application into a full-blown short <b>message</b> <b>service</b> center (SMSC), which receives, buffers, processes, and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network. [...] Comverse branded and productised this as the Intelligent Short <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> Center, or ISMSC. [...] Typical of telecomm software, it ran on Unix-based platforms, such as UnixWare and later Linux. [...] Comverse's ISMSC found success as a lower-price solution for lower-traffic networks, where it competed with Logica's Telepath solution. [...] Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and Openwave. [...] ISMSC found considerable market penetration, exemplified by all six of Hong Kong's wireless carriers using it.|$|E

[...] Some of Comverse's products were still viewed highly; a Yankee Group survey ranked them first {{in the world in}} their type of billing services, and they were the worldwide market-share leaders in providing multimedia <b>message</b> <b>service</b> centers to wireless carriers. [...] However, the rise in popularity of smartphones and of sending e-mail eroded the carrier market for some of Comverse's products and services. [...] By 2009, the company's upper management was now largely American rather than Israeli, Dahan was under internal criticism, and there were frequent clashes regarding company culture.|$|E

[...] Starting in the late 1990s, Comverse's voice messaging software became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use, passing the $1 billion mark in revenues. [...] It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short <b>message</b> <b>service</b> center (SMSC) product. [...] While headquartered in the US, most of the company's research and development was done in Israel; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel's hi-tech industry.
