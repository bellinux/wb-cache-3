This health education CD was created as a self-study module for students in grades four through six. It is a supplement to the traditional classroom health education curriculum. The <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> is designed to enhance learning about nutrition and physical activity by means of an interactive and fun computer-based approach. It will enable students to learn in an independent manner, while practicing their math, reading, comprehension, science and computer skills. The goal of this <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> is to motivate children to take an active part in living a healthy lifestyle. The <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> is based on the health belief model and the National Health Education Standards. Technology advances, such as this <b>compact</b> <b>disc,</b> provide educators another way to incorporate health education into the classroom...|$|R
