Palin's daughter Bristol publicly stated on her mother's Facebook profile on February 16, 2010, that she took offense to the episode, feeling that it mocked her brother, Trig, who has Down syndrome, commenting, [...] "If the writers of a particularly pathetic cartoon show thought they were being clever in mocking <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> my family yesterday, they failed. All they proved is that they're heartless jerks." [...] Sarah Palin also criticized the episode in an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, calling those who made the show [...] "cruel, cold-hearted people." [...] The writer of the episode, Steve Callaghan, addressed Palin's criticism of the episode at the San Diego Comic-Con International on July 24, 2010, in talking about the upcoming ninth season of the show, stating, [...] "This season, I decided that I'd even things out and write something that would offend smart people." ...|$|E

[...] Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to [...] "Kings and Queens", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's the story of <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land."

Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian.

Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{started in}} 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a {{collaboration}} between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood. The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up. Additional guitarist Kevin Drake, who first auditioned for the position of bassist, also joined the band as a touring musician. The band played its first concerts under different names, before finally settling on the name [...] "Thirty Seconds to Mars", which was taken from a rare manuscript titled Argus Apocraphex. Jared Leto spoke of the name as [...] "a reference, a rough translation from the book. I think the idea is interesting, it's {{a metaphor for the}} future," [...] he explained. [...] "Thirty seconds to Mars—the fact that we're so close to something that's not a tangible idea. Also Mars being the God of War makes it really interesting, as well. You could substitute that in there, but what's important for <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> I, is that it be imaginative and really represent the sound of our music in as unique a way as possible." [...] He described it as a name that [...] "works on several different levels, a phrase that is lyrical, suggestive, cinematic, and filled with immediacy." [...] When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started, Jared Leto did not allow his vocation as a Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band.|$|E
500|$|Hitchens writes [...] "the biggest fake miracle {{staged in}} human history was {{the claim that the}} Soviet Union was a new {{civilisation}} of equality, peace, love, truth, science and progress. Everyone knows that it was a prison, a slum, a return to primitive barbarism, a kingdom of lies where scientists and doctors feared offending the secret police, and that its elite were corrupt and lived in secret luxury". He then cites Walter Duranty's denying the existence of the great Ukrainian famine, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb's [...] acceptance that the 1937 Moscow show trials were [...] "genuine criminal prosecutions". Hitchens then examines Lenin's suppression of religion in the Soviet Union, which included making the teaching of religion to children punishable by the death penalty and the creation of an antireligious organisation of Soviet workers. Hitchens begins Chapter 13 by quoting William Henry Chamberlin: [...] "In Russia, the world is witnessing the first effort to destroy completely any belief in supernatural interpretation of life", and then examines some consequences of this, including intolerance of religion, terror, and the persecution of priests and bishops at the Solovetsky concentration camp. Hitchens asserts that in the Soviet Union [...] "the regime's institutional loathing for the teaching of religion, and its desire to eradicate it, survived every doctrinal detour and swerve". In the final chapter, Hitchens analyses a number of his brother's arguments, and contends that [...] "the coincidence in instinct, taste, and thought between <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> the Bolsheviks and their sympathisers is striking and undeniable". He then records how his brother nominated the [...] "apostle of revolutionary terror" [...] Leon Trotsky for an edition of the BBC radio series Great Lives; praised Trotsky for his [...] "moral courage"; and declared that one of Lenin's great achievements was [...] "to create a secular Russia". Hitchens speculates that his brother remained sympathetic towards Bolshevism and is still hostile towards the things it extirpated, including monarchy, tradition, and faith. He ends the chapter by claiming a form of militant secularism is becoming established in Britain, and that [...] "The Rage Against God is loose".|$|E
