25|$|After {{my return}} from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given me <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> challenges and <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> rewards. I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E

500|$|At age 25, Vettel {{became the}} {{youngest}} triple world champion of the sport, six years younger than Ayrton Senna had been in 1991. On drawing level with Senna, Vettel commented: [...] "To win that third title here, where one of <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> idols, Ayrton Senna, was from, {{it is very difficult}} to imagine I join him and other great names by winning three successive titles". Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner praised his driver, saying [...] "Sebastian has driven better than ever this season and has fought his way back into this championship, he's never given up and you saw that in today's race".|$|E

500|$|Lovering {{became part}} of The Unholy Three, a trio of magicians that resides at the Magic Castle, and {{performs}} [...] "a new wave, alternative, avant-garde kind of magic". He toured his act across the United States as the opener for Frank Black (the new stage name of former Pixies band-mate Thompson), Grant-Lee Phillips, The Breeders and Camper Van Beethoven. He performed his act at the Shellac-curated All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in 2002. He later commented that his performance at the festival was [...] "perhaps <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> achievement". Lovering resumed drumming, appearing at some Frank Black and the Catholics shows. He also appeared on one track of The Martinis' 2004 album The Smitten Sessions.|$|E
500|$|Captain Flowers was {{selected}} as a third-team All-American by the United Press and the International News Service. Records conflict as to his rushing totals during the 1920 season. According to one account, which acknowledged {{it was based on}} incomplete records, Flowers rushed 80 times for 819 yards (10.2 yards per carry), and had 290 punt return yards (16.5 yards per return), in six games. According to another account, published by the United Press in 1958, Flowers rushed for 1,425 yards in 1920. He also led the country with an average of 49.4 yards per punt; and had a school record for number of drop kicked field goals. Coach Alexander said Flowers was the best punter Tech ever had and the best back he ever coached, calling him [...] "pound for pound, <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> player".|$|E
500|$|In May 1846, {{the family}} (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) {{moved to a}} small cottage in Fordham, about {{fourteen}} miles outside the city, a home which is still standing today. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: [...] "Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer." [...] Of his recent loss of the Broadway Journal, the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, [...] "I should have lost my courage but for youmy darling little wife you are <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> and only stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life." [...] But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless. Her symptoms included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing and spitting up blood.|$|E

I can remember my fears and doubts, and sad months, with comfort; they are {{as the head of}} Goliah in my hand: there was nothing to David like Goliah's sword, even that sword that should have been sheathed in his bowels; for the very sight and remembrance of that did preach forth God's deliverance to him. Oh! the remembrance of <b>my</b> <b>great</b> sins, of <b>my</b> <b>great</b> temptations, and of <b>my</b> <b>great</b> fear of perishing for ever!

500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than {{wait to see what}} other offers of work would come in from the Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't really a great success—even my mother said it was rotten, and she was <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as Over to You. Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
500|$|Writer David McIntee {{has also}} noted {{similarities}} to the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Ark in Space" [...] (1975), {{in which an}} insectoid queen alien lays larvae inside humans which later eat their way out, a life cycle inspired by that of the ichneumon wasp. He has also noted similarities between {{the first half of}} the film, particularly in early versions of the script, to H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, [...] "not in storyline, but in dread-building mystery", and calls the finished film [...] "the best Lovecraftian movie ever made, without being a Lovecraft adaptation", due to its similarities in tone and atmosphere to Lovecraft's works. In 2009, O'Bannon said the film was [...] "strongly influenced, tone-wise, by Lovecraft, and one of the things it proved is that you can't adapt Lovecraft effectively without an extremely strong visual style ... What you need is a cinematic equivalent of Lovecraft's prose." [...] H. R. Giger has said he liked O'Bannon's initial Alien storyline [...] "because I found it was in the vein of Lovecraft, one of <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> sources of inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|In any case, Biden {{would not}} run {{again for the}} {{presidency}} until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time {{he made it to}} the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. [...] Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: “Hey, you people! Do you know this guy? He used to be <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> speechwriter.” [...] Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin; Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. Additionally, Biden also won the Delaware Senate election the same year, and would've been the longest serving Senator in Delaware history, had the McCain/Palin ticket been elected. In 2015, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid, but declined it on October 21, 2015, the same year his son Beau died of brain cancer. As his term expired in 2017, he is currently considering a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election.|$|E
500|$|The awards {{have been}} {{described}} by book critics such as The Guardian as a [...] "prestigious fantasy prize", {{and one of the}} three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). In 2010 multiple winner George R. R. Martin described winning the Hugo, Nebula, and [...] "the prestigious World Fantasy Award" [...] as the [...] "triple crown". Others have also noted the award's prestige in the field, such as Tachyon Publications and 2014 Best Anthology winner Gardner Dozois. Stephen Jones of the Best New Horror series has said that winning the anthology award for their first volume in 1991 helped [...] "establish the series among readers and some publishers" [...] in multiple countries. Winners such as Nnedi Okorafor—Best Novel in 2011—have described the award as [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> honors as a writer". Editor and bookseller Rick Klaw in 2007, however, noted that the consensus at the time [...] "in the bookselling community" [...] was that winning the novel category did not have any effect on sales and did not help keep the book in print, with 57 percent of prior winners out of print, compared to 23 percent of Hugo Award winners from the same time period.|$|E
500|$|In 1911, Chaplain Groves {{was ordered}} {{to return to the}} 14th Infantry, which was now {{stationed}} at Fort William Henry Harrison, Montana. Here young Dick Groves met Grace (Boo) Wilson, the daughter of Colonel Richard Hulbert Wilson, a career Army officer who had served with Chaplain Groves with the 8th Infantry in Cuba. In 1913, the 14th Infantry moved once more, this time to Fort Lawton, Washington. Dick Groves entered Queen Anne High School in nearby Seattle in 1913. In September of that year, he commenced his final year of high school, and also enrolled at the University of Washington. He attempted to secure an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1914, earning a nomination from the president, which allowed him to compete for a vacancy, but did not score a sufficiently high enough mark on the examination. Charles W. Bell from California's 9th congressional district accepted Groves as an alternate for one of his appointments, but the principal nominee accepted. Instead, Groves enrolled at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1916, Groves took the examinations for admission to West Point again and this time he was accepted. [...] "Entering West Point fulfilled <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> ambition. I had been brought up in the Army, and in the main had lived on Army posts all my life," [...] Groves said after the fact.|$|E

It was not known at the time what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions, since his publicist had recently issued a statement claiming that he had left Two Seas. In November 2006, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and MSNBC reported that {{he was working on}} a new album, produced by will.i.am. Jackson performed at the World Music Awards in London on November 15, 2006, and accepted a Diamond Award for selling over [...] records. During his period in Ireland he sought Dr. Patrick Treacy for cosmetic treatment after reading about his experience with HLA fillers and his charitable work in Africa. Treacy became his only doctor when he lived in Ireland in 2006. He started as Jackson's personal dermatologist and developed a friendship with the singer. Jackson returned to the United States after Christmas 2006 to attend James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave one of the eulogies, saying that [...] "James Brown is <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> inspiration." [...] In 2011, Treacy appeared on the Dr. Drew show on CNN and said that he had gave propofol to Michael Jackson on two occasions but the singer always requested an anaesthetist to be present.|$|E

On 9 August 2009, while commentating on the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley that season, he was invited to take part in an on-field ceremony to induct him into the Hall of Fame along with Ian Botham and the Yorkshire greats Wilfred Rhodes and Fred Trueman. Botham was also in attendance, along with Trueman's widow, Veronica, and Colin Graves who, as Yorkshire County Cricket Club chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Rhodes. Boycott said: [...] "I {{would like to thank the}} ICC for awarding me this great honour and for also choosing Headingley as the venue. This ground holds so many wonderful memories for me and the Yorkshire public have always been <b>my</b> <b>greatest</b> supporters, so having this award on home soil in front of them makes it more special". Colin Graves included Boycott in his tribute to Rhodes when he said: [...] "It is a great honour to accept the cap on behalf of a Yorkshire legend. Wilfred Rhodes was an exceedingly gifted player and is rightly regarded as one of England's greatest all-rounders. I am also delighted to see two other great Yorkshiremen and another great all-rounder inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame today".|$|E
