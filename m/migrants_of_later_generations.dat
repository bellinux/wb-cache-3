5000|$|Francis Fox of St Germans was the {{progenitor}} {{of a vast}} clan {{of people}} called [...] "Fox", notable in many fields of enterprise, science and the arts. He was an early convert to the Quaker faith, to which many <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> were also true.|$|R

50|$|Japanese poets {{also contributed}} to Buddhist poetic {{tradition}} in classical Chinese (e.g. the poetic genius of Kūkai inspired many poets <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations.)</b> Kūkai, in turn was influenced by Jiao Ran's Shi shi 詩式, as the latter is included in Kūkai's magnum opus of poetics, the Bunkyō hifuron 文鏡秘府論.|$|R
50|$|His legacy {{lives on}} {{in the form of}} {{gramophone}} recordings of songs and arias, some of which have been reissued on CD. He also paved the way for such outstanding American baritones <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> as Clarence Whitehill, Richard Bonelli, Arthur Endreze, John Charles Thomas, Lawrence Tibbett, Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill.|$|R
50|$|As {{a philosopher}} Guthrie {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} Cornford in believing that ancient philosophers should be read and interpreted against their own historical background, rather than engaged with, as has been the practice <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> classical philosophers, {{in the context of the}} whole canon of philosophy both ancient and modern.|$|R
2500|$|His {{image was}} held in esteem by radical <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations,</b> and often offered {{as an example of}} {{nationalist}} revival. Alecu Russo, who wrote his memoirs in the 1850s, described Tăutu as [...] "the revived Romanianness, carried along by all patriotic sentiments, and having the same role as the one Vladimirescu [...] had with a peasant rifle".|$|R
5|$|David's {{influence}} on British cooking extended to professional {{as well as}} domestic cooks, and chefs and restaurateurs <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> such as Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson, Prue Leith, Jamie Oliver, Tom Parker Bowles and Rick Stein have acknowledged her importance to them. In the US cooks and writers including Julia Child, Richard Olney and Alice Waters have written of her influence.|$|R
50|$|Women of Algiers, {{along with}} Delacroix's other Orientalist paintings, has {{inspired}} many artists <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations.</b> In 1888 both Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin travelled to Montpellier to view Delacroix's 1849 version of Women of Algiers. The painting {{served as a}} source of inspiration to the later impressionists, and a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings by Pablo Picasso in 1954.|$|R

5000|$|In {{respect to}} his actual {{exploits}} and his actual character, however, Carson was not overrated. If history has {{to single out}} one person from among the Mountain Men to receive the admiration <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations,</b> Carson is the best choice.

25|$|Mozart's {{most famous}} pupil, whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home {{for two years}} as a child, was {{probably}} Johann Nepomuk Hummel, a transitional figure between Classical and Romantic eras. More important is the influence Mozart had on composers <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations.</b> Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of classical musicians' training.|$|R
2500|$|Most first-generation {{cephalosporins}} {{were originally}} spelled [...] "ceph-" [...] in English-speaking countries.

50|$|From the 1970s onwards, British {{critical}} opinion {{began to}} revise this lukewarm assessment, {{with their first}} BFI retrospective in 1970 and another in 1978.

50|$|Apollodorus Skiagraphos (Ἀπολλόδωρος ὁ σκιαγράφος) was an {{influential}} Ancient Greek painter of the 5th century BC whose work {{has since been}} entirely lost. Apollodorus left a technique behind known as skiagraphia, a way to easily produce shadow, that affected the works not only of his contemporaries but also <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations.</b> This shading technique uses hatched areas to give the illusion of both shadow and volume.|$|R
50|$|Inevitably, Kitto's encyclopedic {{works have}} been {{superseded}} by the researches <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> scholars.

50|$|Han painted many {{portraits and}} Buddhistic themed {{paintings}} during his career; however, {{he is most}} widely remembered for his paintings of horses. He was reputed {{to be able to}} not only portray the physical body of the horse, but also its spirit. His reputation rose and surpassed that of his teacher. Horse painters <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> studied Han. He is honored with a crater named for him on Mercury.|$|R
50|$|In his own lifetime, Otto {{does not}} appear in any {{document}} with the margravial title, but he appears in the documents <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> cited as such. He appears in a confirmation of the possessions of the abbacy of Fruttuaria with the title in a patronymic. He probably never used the title in life, but his descendents retroactively applied it to him, as he held the same post as they.|$|R
5000|$|In architecture, a Stalinist style (essentially updated neoclassicism on a {{very large}} scale, {{exemplified}} by the Seven Sisters of Moscow) replaced the constructivism of the 1920s. The government's policies {{during the period of}} Stalin had a largely disruptive effect on indigenous cultures within the Soviet Union, however the earlier politics of Korenizatsiya or [...] "indigenisation" [...] were potentially beneficial to the integration <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> indigenous cultures.|$|R

5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations.</b> Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located {{at the entrance to the}} stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|R
50|$|Hemion {{began working}} in live {{television}} in New York City in the 1950s, {{particularly for the}} original The Tonight Show starring Steve Allen. In the 1960s, Hemion began concentrating on musical-variety shows, working with producer Gary Smith on a popular series of Kraft Music Hall specials for NBC-TV. Smith-Hemion Productions arguably defined the fast-paced look and glamorous style of the American comedy-variety genre, and influenced scores <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> working in television.|$|R
5000|$|Armenia would {{henceforth}} {{be ruled}} by an Parthian dynasty, and despite its nominal allegiance to Rome, {{it would come}} under increasing Parthian influence. In the judgment <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations,</b> [...] "Romans had lost Armenia", and although the Peace of Rhandeia ushered {{in a period of}} relatively peaceful relations that would last for 50 years, Armenia would continue to be a constant bone of contention between the Romans, the Parthians, and their Sassanid successors.|$|R
5000|$|Bartolus de Saxoferrato (Italian: Bartolo da Sassoferrato) (131313 July 1357) was an Italian law {{professor}} {{and one of the}} most prominent continental jurists of Medieval Roman Law. He belonged to the school known as the commentators or postglossators. The admiration <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> civil lawyers is shown by the adage nemo bonus íurista nisi bartolista [...] - [...] no one is a good jurist unless he is a Bartolist (i.e. a follower of Bartolus).|$|R
5000|$|... ==Background== Son House {{recorded}} nine {{songs for}} Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin, in 1930, released as 78-RPM records. These recordings were sought by blues historians <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations,</b> as House was a seminal influence on later blues greats, particularly Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. Seven of these recordings were rediscovered (see below), but the [...] "Clarksdale Moan" [...] 78 continued to elude collectors and was dubbed the [...] "holy grail" [...] of lost blues recordings.|$|R
5000|$|The warriors in the Heike Monogatari {{served as}} models for the educated warriors <b>of</b> <b>later</b> <b>generations,</b> and the ideals {{depicted}} by them were not assumed to be beyond reach.
