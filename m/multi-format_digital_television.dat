Nelson Old Dominion University, 1997 Co-Chairs of Advisory Committee: Dr. Kurt Maly Dr. Stewart N. T. Shen Our {{objective}} was to study the feasibility of extending the Dienst protocol to enable a multi-discipline, <b>multi-format</b> <b>digital</b> library. We implemented two new technologies: cluster functionality and publishing buckets. We have designed a possible implementation of clusters and buckets, and have prototyped {{some aspects of the}} resultant digital library. Currently, digital libraries are segregated by the disciplines they serve (computer science, aeronautics, etc.), and by the format of their holdings (reports, software, datasets, etc.).

40|$|Currently, {{the number}} of non-PC devices used for {{interactive}} applications is increasing. <b>Digital</b> <b>television</b> set-top boxes, PDAs, and mobile phones are typical examples. Interactive applications are controlled via a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Consequently, a GUI framework is required. The objective is a unified GUI framework for all these new devices. Since {{one of the new}} devices is <b>digital</b> <b>television,</b> an implementation of a <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> GUI framework is presented. It has been developed following the HAVi specifications. Its main characteristics are use of Java, separation of look and feel, and lightweight widgets. The implementation is tested with a <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> application. The main conclusion proposed is that new devices should use a device-oriented GUI framework implementation. Moreover, specific implementations can be obtained by modifying the look or feel of the widgets. Keywords: <b>Digital</b> <b>television,</b> DVB-MHP, GUI, HAVi, Java. 1...|$|R

The firm panned the commission on its incompetence in supporting its initial pronouncement to implement Japanese <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> standard, the Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial (ISDB-T). In 2010, the commission officially led the <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> {{period in the}} Philippines and releases a memorandum circular agreeing {{to the use of}} ISDB-T as the standard digital platform. But in recent developments, the commission is considering the European <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> platform, the European Digital Video Broadcast-Terrestrial (DVB-T).

The Republic of China Cabinet approved a measure mandating that all new televisions are to be equipped with a <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> tuner from 2006. The rule will apply to TVs measuring between 21 and 29 inches in 2007, and to sets of all sizes in 2008, the Cabinet said in a statement. To assist lower-income families with the switch to <b>digital</b> <b>television,</b> the government plans to provide NT$300 million in aid to purchase converters or {{for the purchase of}} new <b>digital</b> <b>televisions.</b> [...] In February 2009, the National Communications Commission proposed amendments to the Cable Television Act; they include mandating cable companies to provide free set-top boxes.|$|R
