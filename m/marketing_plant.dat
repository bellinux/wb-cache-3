50|$|The Florida Constitution of 1868 {{provided}} {{for the creation of}} the Office of Commissioner of Immigration, whose duties consisted of attracting settlers to engage in agriculture. The Florida Constitution was amended in 1871 to consolidate the offices of Surveyor General and Commissioner of Immigration as the new Commissioner of Lands and Immigration. In 1885, the Constitution was revised and the Commissioner of Lands and Immigration post was renamed Commissioner of Agriculture. The duties of the Commissioner of Agriculture were revised to include supervision of the state prisons. (A Division of Corrections was created in 1957 and state prisons were removed from the list of Commissioner of Agriculture responsibilities). The Agricultural Services Reorganization Act (ASRA) was passed in 1959 and became effective January 15, 1961. This state law abolished some independent boards and bureaus, which were assigned to the Department of Agriculture's divisions. These included: Administration, Animal Industry, Dairy Industry, Fruit and Vegetable Inspection, <b>Marketing,</b> <b>Plant</b> Industry, Inspection and Standards. The State Chemist, a position that existed since 1891, was moved to the new Division of Chemistry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the agricultural diversification trends in South Asia. In the first part food consumption and crop production patterns in the region during the last twenty years are reviewed. Next, the agronomic and economic options for and constraints to diversification in the main agricultural systems are discussed based on a framework for assessing the flexibility of ricelands and rice farmers to respond to the commercialisation trends through seasonal or permanent diversification out of various farming systems. The principal contribution {{of this paper is to}} draw attention to some neglected aspects of diversification, especially the biophysical and economic constraints to the process in different farming systems. The flexibility of farmers in responding to diversification opportunities is constrained by the size of markets and price risks, soil suitability and land rights, the availability and quality of irrigation infrastructure, and the availability and cost of labour. Long term strategies to facilitate a smooth transition to commercialisation are recommended.

40|$|Generally, it is {{accepted}} that impact assessment {{is a critical}} element in further improving community development initiatives and promoting intervention. Also existing impact assessments have made {{an important contribution to}} understanding some of the complex interactions between community development interventions, livelihoods and different dimensions of poverty reduction and empowerment (Linda Myoux, 2003). This research project on the social-economic impact of farmers' milk marketing plants in OPkalou Division, Nyandarua District was conducted in the month of March 2007. The main aim of the research was to determine the effectiveness of collective marketing initiatives of the farmers, in partnership with Heifer International - Kenya. The results were envisaged to enhance the collaboration of farmers and Heifer International in its bid to achieve its vision of poverty alleviation and improving nutrition. The study was done for the purpose of examining how collective marketing though the establishment of a milk <b>marketing</b> <b>plant</b> has impacted on the smallholder dairy farmer, effect on their livelihoods and addresses the challenges that are being experienced so as to make recommendations on the way forward in replication of such projects. The study also intended to establish the employment created through direct involvement in milk production and through several support services tied to dairy production. By using questionnaires, interviews and observation 156 respondents were contacted and the data revealed that collective marketing of milk products has greatly benefited the farmers who now, no longer experience serious price fluctuation and inability to sell their produce. This initiative has also rejuvenated their participation in milk production to earn higher incomes to better their lives as most of the earnings from milk sales is used for daily sustenance. The buyers also appreciated such arrangement as it led to a reduction in their costs because they would find the produce ready in bulk unlike if they had to go collecting it all over the locations. However it has been learnt that, a lot {{more needs to be done}} to create a buy in to many more farmers so that they would enjoy the economies of scale. Community mobilization in this respect is important for the success of such initiatives. Also to be included in the programs is access to credit to enable the farmers re-stocking their lost herd. The establishment of milk marketing plants has therefore, provided the farmers opportunity to sell their milk, participate in the management of the plant and create window for sustainable rural development.

In an effort to do so, it's become a common practice to supplement basic proportional-pIus-integral-plus derivative (PID) control with more sophisticated control strategies intended to increase energy efficiency, unit throughput, and/or product yield. Process computers provided the first efficient, cost-effective means of implementing advanced control. However, at a substantially lower cost and 99 + percent operational availability, today' s microprocessor-based unit controllers can execute most of the complex control requirements once exclusively allocated to process computers. Examples demonstrating their ability to achieve better control for less cost are given in this paper...|$|R
