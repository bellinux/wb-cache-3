40|$|In the {{previous}} study (Dabas et al. in Solar Phys. 250, 171, 2008), {{to predict the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>sunspot</b> number of the current solar cycle 24 based on the geomagnetic activity of the preceding sunspot minimum, the Ap index was used which {{is available from the}} last six to seven solar cycles. Since a longer series of the aa index is available for more than the last 10 [*]–[*] 12 cycles, the present study utilizes aa to validate the earlier prediction. Based on the same methodology, the disturbance index (DI), which is the 12 -month moving average of the number of disturbed days (aa≥ 50), is computed at thirteen selected times (called variate blocks 1, 2,…, 13; each of them in six-month duration) during the declining portion of the ongoing sunspot cycle. Then its correlation with the <b>maximum</b> <b>sunspot</b> number of the following cycle is evaluated. As in the case of Ap, variate block 9, which occurs exactly 48 months after the current cycle maximum, gives the best correlation (R= 0. 96) with a minimum standard error of estimation (SEE) of ±[*] 9. As applied to cycle 24, the aa index as precursor yields the <b>maximum</b> <b>sunspot</b> number of about 120 ± 16 (the 90 % prediction interval), which is within the 90 % prediction interval of the earlier prediction (124 ± 23 using Ap). Furthermore, the same method is applied to an expanded range of cycles 11 [*]–[*] 23, and once again variate block 9 gives the best correlation (R= 0. 95) with a minimum SEE of ±[*] 13. The relation yields the modified maximum amplitude for cycle 24 of about 131 ± 20, which is also close to our earlier prediction and is likely to occur at about 43 ± 4 months after its minimum (December 2008), probably in July 2012 (±[*] 4 months) ...|$|E
40|$|The solar dynamo is {{the exotic}} {{dance of the}} sun’s two major {{magnetic}} field components, the poloidal and the toroidal, interacting in anti-phase. On the basis of new data on the geomagnetic aa index, we improve our previous forecast of {{the properties of the}} current Schwabe cycle # 24. Its maximum will occur in 2013. 5 and the <b>maximum</b> <b>sunspot</b> number Rmax will then be 62 ± 12, which is within the bounds of our earlier forecasts. The subsequent analysis, based on a phase diagram, which is a diagram showing the relation between <b>maximum</b> <b>sunspot</b> numbers and minimum geomagnetic aa index values leads to the conclusion that a new Grand Episode in solar activity has started in 2008. From the study of the natural oscillations in the sunspot number time series, as found by an analysis based on suitable wavelet base functions, we predict that this Grand Episode will be of the Regular Oscillations type, which is the kind of oscillations that also occurred between 1724 and 1924. Previous expectations of a Grand (Maunder-type) Minimum of solar activity cannot be supported. We stress the significance of the Hallstatt periodicity for determining the character of the forthcoming Grand Episodes.

In Christchurch, New Zealand the population is too small so the monthly SIDS and sunspot relationship was studied to determine if the links between solar activity and SIDS rates, through the Schumann Resonance mechanism, were identifiable. Solar activity through the Schumann Resonance mechanism reduces melatonin in human populations. Reduced melatonin is associated with increased risk of SIDS.

Also, a clear bimodal variation of annual integrated flux with solar cycle phase but no statistically significant tendency for the large events to avoid sunspot maximum is found.
