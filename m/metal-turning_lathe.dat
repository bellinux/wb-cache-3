50|$|In diamond turning, a {{computer-controlled}} lathe with a diamond-tipped tool {{is used to}} make precision optical {{surfaces in}} glass or other optical materials. Unlike conventional optical grinding, complex aspheric surfaces can be machined easily. Instead of the dovetailed ways used on the tool slide of a <b>metal-turning</b> <b>lathe,</b> the ways typically float on air bearings, and {{the position of the}} tool is measured by optical interferometry to achieve the necessary standard of precision for optical work. The finished work piece usually requires a small amount of subsequent polishing by conventional techniques to achieve a finished surface suitably smooth for use in a lens, but the rough grinding time is significantly reduced for complex lenses.|$|E
