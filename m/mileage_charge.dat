At {{the heart of}} the system is an optimization model that finds the fixed charge, <b>mileage</b> <b>charge,</b> and transfer charge that maximize gross revenue subject to constraints on ridership and the form of the fare equation. A linear approximation to the demand curve at the base case values results in a quadratic programming problem. Three alternative modes of using the model system are demonstrated using selected data from the Chicago Transit Authority. Model extensions and proposed future work are outlined. ...|$|E

40|$|The private motor {{vehicles}} are significantly important {{means of transportation}} in modern lifestyle, however, these also contribute to {{a large proportion of}} the total air pollution and primary energy consumption. In order to develop green transportation system, it becomes imperative to use integrated technologies to achieve reduced emissions and utilize renewable energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been considered as one of these technologies to transform the traditional vehicle mix. However, the uptake of EV has been debated on factors like cost, performance (autonomous <b>mileage),</b> <b>charging</b> point infrastructure construction, energy saving, policy and end users’ adaptation. Present study investigates the technology feasibility (which usually refer to EVs’ cost, EV charging, supplier’s customer services quality, EV travel performance) and users’ adaptation of EV in Beijing, which is a key driver for the EV uptake into the Beijing transportation system. The relevant data have been collected and analyzed in the form of questionnaire survey around all of these factors. While considering the user perception and satisfaction, safety of charging and energy bills have also been investigated. According to the data analysis, it has been found the policy of ‘No traffic restrictions for EVs’ (the traffic restrictions means for certain date, from Monday to Friday the {{motor vehicles}} with the last register number of 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9, 5 and 0, are restricted to travel, respectively), the availability of the charging infrastructure and technical support are the most significant factors affecting the users’ opinions on using EVs...|$|R

5000|$|The N&C stated they {{regarded}} the NBR (and by extension the Silloth system) as hostile, but denied that a reduction (in 1858) of the <b>mileage</b> rates <b>charged</b> for coal if the coal travelled more than 28 miles beyond the N&C {{was intended to}} discriminate in favour of Maryport and against Silloth. They similarly denied accusations that the charge of 11d per ton {{for the use of}} their one-and-a-half-mile Canal branch (the only connection the Silloth companies then had with other railways) were deliberately set so high as to choke off goods traffic onto the Silloth system. In 1857 the Caledonian Railway announced its intention to introduce a Bill to make a branch connecting to the Port Carlisle Railway, to allow it and/or the Lancaster and Carlisle to negotiate running powers over the Port Carlisle and Silloth railways (and vice versa), and to allow it to enter into an agreement with the Port Carlisle and Silloth railways to work those lines. The Port Carlisle and Silloth railways objected to the provision for the Caledonian to work them; once this was removed the Bill passed (28 June 1858): the Caledonian then offered to prioritise construction of the branch (and do the Port Carlisle & Silloth railways other good turns), provided only that they should cease to oppose the Caledonian's Carlisle-Hawick branch. This failed to detach the Silloth Bay railways from their allegiance to the North British Railway, but the Caledonian went ahead with the construction of the branch ( [...] a sharply curved single-track line from the Caledonian main line three-quarters of a mile north of Citadel station to Canal Junction, immediately north of Canal station), judging it cheaper to build it than to seek parliamentary powers to abandon it.|$|R
5000|$|The Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway {{sought a}} {{parliamentary}} Act in 1863 {{to extend its}} line from Lamplugh to a junction with the C&W near Bridgefoot: its [...] "Marron extension". The Marron extension gave a route northwards for haematite ore independent of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway's tunnel at Whitehaven, which was a traffic bottleneck (and one for which a heavy toll of 9d per ton was charged). Objectors to the bill {{drew attention to the}} high <b>mileage</b> rates <b>charged</b> by the WC&ER and claimed the extension was being promoted primarily to protect the WC&ER's monopoly by preventing other companies (such as the C&W) accessing the orefield, but the WC&ER got its act. The C&W then gained two directors associated with the WC&ER, added against the wishes of the board by proxies held by the solicitor of the WC&ER (already a director of the C&W). This election was accompanied by a renewal of previous rhetoric on the undue influence on the affairs of the C&W of directors associated with the Clifton Colliery (one of the new directors had been proprietor of the Cumberland Pacquet whilst it had been outspoken on this). However this led to counter-charges of hypocrisy: the WC&ER was similarly dominated by its major customer, the Parkside mine at Frizington, with which the new directors (and the WC&ER's solicitor) were associated. There were obvious motives for the WC&E seeking C&W directorships; the C&W's Act allowed it to charge tolls at up to 5d/ton-mile, so an uncooperative C&W could choke off traffic over the WC&E's Marron extension. However the new directors were also closely associated with the 'Castle' (pro-Lowther) faction in Whitehaven politics, and with the Solway Junction Railway; it was later suggested that their election had been intended {{to pave the way for}} the lease of the C&W by the WJR (which they supported and the WC&E opposed). Mineral traffic over the Marron extension began 15 January 1866, it being claimed that it reduced carriage costs by 1s. 6d. per ton, compared to the route via Whitehaven:.|$|R
50|$|In 1844, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OWWR) {{announced}} {{their intention to}} build a line which would partly run parallel to both the canal and the Dudley Canal. Despite opposition by the canal company, the line was built and opened in 1852 and 1853. However, its effect was not immediately significant, and a proposed reduction in tolls was not deemed to be necessary. Some goods were transferred to the railway from a private basin, which ultimately led to an agreement on tolls for such transfers and the construction in 1858 of a transhipment siding on Stourbridge wharf. Trade held up well, derived from six ironworks and a tinplate works situated on the canal above the Stourbridge flight, traffic from the collieries on the Extension Canal, and various other industrial concerns, including fire-brick manufacturers and glassworks. In 1865, a new Act of Parliament introduced powers to <b>charge</b> <b>mileage</b> tolls for traffic using the upper level, but not passing through any locks. Income gradually dropped, and the dividend was below 8 per cent {{for the first time}} in 1873. For many canal companies, the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, which became law in 1888, had a detrimental effect on revenue, but the Stourbridge tolls increased significantly, from £1,695 in 1894 to £2,718 in 1896.|$|R
40|$|This article investigates {{charging}} {{strategies for}} plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) {{as part of}} the energy system. The objective was to increase the combined all-electric mileage (total distance driven using only the traction batteries in each PHEV) when the total charging power at each workplace is subject to severe limitations imposed by the energy system. In order to allocate this power optimally, different input variables, such as state-of-charge, battery size, travel distance, and parking time, were considered. The required vehicle mobility was generated using a novel agent-based model that describes the spatiotemporal movement of individual PHEVs. The results show that, in the case of Helsinki (Finland), smart control strategies could lead to an increase of over 5 % in the all-electric mileage compared to a no-control strategy. With a high prediction error, or with a particularly small or large battery, the benefits of smart charging fade off. Smart PHEV charging strategies, when applied to the optimal allocation of limited charging power between the cars of a vehicle fleet, seem counterintuitively to provide only a modest increase in the all-electric <b>mileage.</b> A simple <b>charging</b> strategy based on allocating power to PHEVs equally could thus perform sufficiently well. This finding may be important for the future planning of smart grids as limiting the charging power of larger PHEV fleets will sometimes be necessary as a result of grid restrictions.

40|$|Firms {{commonly}} offer three-part tariffs, or menus of three-part tariffs, in {{a variety}} of con-texts. A three-part tariff consists of a fixed fee, an included allowance of units for which the mar-ginal price is zero, and a positive marginal price for additional usage beyond the allowance. A prime example is the US cellular phone services market in which firms typically offer consumers plans consisting of a fixed monthly fee, an allowance of minutes, and an overage rate for minutes beyond the allowance. Pricing of Internet service is similar in many European countries, where usage is billed per megabyte (Anja Lambrecht and Bernd Skiera 2006). Other examples of three-part tariffs include car leasing contracts, which often include a <b>mileage</b> allowance and <b>charge</b> per mile thereafter. 1 In a variety of rental markets, contracts charge a flat rate for a specified period followed by steep late fees. Finally, introductory credit card offers may also be three-part tariffs. For instance a $ 1, 000 balance might be charged an initial balance transfer fee, zero marginal charge per month for the first six months, and a high marginal charge per month thereafter. The existing literature on nonlinear pricing does not provide a compelling explanation for such pricing patterns. For perfect competition, one expects prices to be driven down to cost, while standard nonlinear pricing models suggest the highest-demand consumer will pay the low-est marginal price. Instead, a tendency of consumers to underestimate the variance of their future demand when choosing a tariff provides a more plausible explanation of observed menus of three-part tariffs. Two important biases lead to this tendency: forecasting overconfidence, which has been well documented in the psychology literature, and projection bias, which is describe...|$|R
