5000|$|The installation, {{known as}} a 200 Series, fixed ground [...] "high flying" [...] radar station {{was one of only}} two of this type located in north Queensland (the other being No 220 at Bones Knob, Tolga). The 211 Radar Station {{utilised}} British Advanced Chain Overseas (ACO) equipment, operated in the HF band at 42.05 <b>megacycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> which is a wave length of about 7 metres, and had height finding capabilities. Two 186 foot wooden towers, which were assembled in kit form, stood approximately 100 metres apart, and supported the transmitting and receiving aerials. The equipment was housed in two above ground semi-circular bomb-proof igloos constructed of reinforced concrete. The eastern igloo housed the receiving equipment whilst the western igloo housed the transmitting equipment. It is believed that these igloos were designed to be built underground, with a short access tower at the end, although the tower would have also provided much needed ventilation.

On fertilization, the low frequency membrane capacity increased to 3. 1 /~f. /cm. 2 and at intermediate frequencies there was evidence of another capacity element. It was suggested that the fertilization data could be interpreted either by an increased plasma membrane capacity which varied with frequency or by an added high capacity of the fertilization membrane.

An objection to conventional forms of heating is that only small specimens can be used, as heat conduction is poor in biological materials.

Microwave energy is part of the electro-magnetic spectrum, of similar frequency to radar beam energy, and at a frequency of 2, 450 <b>megacycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> penetrates several centimetres into biological material (Schwan, 1960). This energy is absorbed and converted into heat within the tissue.

Received for publication 24 April 1969. 2, 450, 000, 000 times every second. Dipolar molecules, such as water, present in the field, are forced to oscillate at this frequency and this increases their thermal agitation and generates heat. The amount of heat produced within the tissue can be controlled by adjustment of the energy level and the duration of exposure. In recent years the development of the magnetron has made available a source of micro-wave energy that is sturdy, reliable, and relatively inexpensive. Microwave ovens are widely used for the rapid and uniform cooking of steaks and whole chickens. Other applications include food sterilization, grain drying, and the splitting of concrete (Puschner, 1966).
