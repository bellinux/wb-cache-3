40|$|This {{paper is}} {{oriented}} on development of flywheels mobile robots. There are described three construction applications of undercarriage for mobile robot and possibilities of their practical use. The first version is three-flywheel frame with differential control. In the second version <b>mobile</b> <b>undercarriage</b> is hanging {{up on the}} board. The third version has four-flywheel <b>mobile</b> <b>undercarriage</b> with more degree of freedom. There were developed also mobile robot moving control, driving system and gearing mechanism...|$|E
50|$|In Cordova, {{numerous}} {{homes and}} manufactured houses were either {{damaged or destroyed}} in this area along with many trees being downed. Some unanchored homes in town were swept from their foundations. Buildings in downtown Cordova had already been damaged by an EF3 tornado earlier that morning and received further damage from this tornado. East of Cordova, the tornado crossed the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River three times (along with the Sipsey Fork once, just north of its confluence with the Mulberry Fork). It intensified further into a violent EF4 in northeastern Walker County, as it completely leveled a site-built home and obliterated two nearby mobile homes. One of the <b>mobile</b> home <b>undercarriages</b> was tossed at least 500 yd. A 5-ton bulldozer was flipped over, a pickup truck was tossed 200 yd, and a dump truck was tossed 50 yd and destroyed. A two-ton trailer was thrown 1 mi and left a 2.5 foot deep crater where it impacted the ground. Two double-wide mobile homes were tossed at least 100 yd, and a third mobile home was tossed 100 yd up a 50 foot m embankment and destroyed along this segment of the path as well. South of Sipsey, multiple additional homes and mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 to EF3 strength and numerous trees were snapped.|$|R
