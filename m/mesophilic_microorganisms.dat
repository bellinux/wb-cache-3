The {{comparison to the}} known 2.0 A structure of PRAI from Escherichia coli (ePRAI) shows that tPRAI has a TIM-barrel fold, whereas helix alpha5 in ePRAI {{is replaced by a}} loop. The subunits of tPRAI associate via the N-terminal faces of their central beta-barrels. Two long, symmetry-related loops that protrude reciprocally into cavities of the other subunit provide for multiple hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the side chains of the N-terminal methionines and the C-terminal leucines of both subunits are immobilized in a hydrophobic cluster, and the number of salt bridges is increased in tPRAI. These features appear to be mainly responsible for the high thermostability of tPRAI.|$|E

40|$|A process {{aimed at}} {{producing}} energy needs {{to produce more}} energy than the energy necessary to run the process itself {{in order to be}} energetically sustainable. In this paper, an energy balance of a batch anaerobic bioreactor has been defined and calculated, both for different operative conditions and for different reactor scales, in order to analyze the sustainability of hydrogen production through dark anaerobic fermentation. Energy production in the form of hydrogen and methane, energy to warm up the fermentation broth, energy loss during fermentation and energy for mixing and pumping have been considered in the energy balance. Experimental data and literature data for <b>mesophilic</b> <b>microorganism</b> consortia have been used to calculate the energy balance. The energy production of a <b>mesophilic</b> <b>microorganism</b> consortium in a batch reactor has been studied in the 16 e 50 C temperature range. The hydrogen batch dark fermentation resulted to only have a positive net production of energy over a minimal reactor dimension in summer conditions with an energy recovery strategy. The best working temperature resulted to be 20 C with 20 % of available energy. Hydrogen batch dark fermentation may be coupled with other processes to obtain a positive net energy by recovering energy from the end products of hydrogen dark fermentation. As an example, methane fermentation has been considered to energetically valorize the end products of hydrogen fermentation. The combined process resulted in a positive net energy over the whole range of tested reactor dimension with 45 e 90 % of available energy...|$|R

Volumetric air samplings showed that there were significantly higher numbers of airborne viable particles per cubic foot of air in operating rooms than in industrial clean rooms. In contrast to clean rooms, where most of the airborne contaminants were those associated with human hair, skin, and respiratory tract, the hospital operating rooms showed a very high level of microorganisms associated with dust and soil...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption by {{microorganisms}} {{can play}} a significant role in the fate and transport of metals in natural systems. Surface complexation models (SCMs) have been applied extensively to describe metal adsorption by mesophilic bacteria, and several recent studies have extended this framework to thermophilic bacteria. We conduct acid-base titrations and batch experiments to characterise proton and Cd adsorption onto the thermophilic archaeon Thermococcus zilligii. The experimental data and the derived SCMs indicate that the archaeon displays significantly lower overall sorption site density compared to previously studied thermophilic bacteria such Anoxybacillus flavithermus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, G. thermocatenulatus, and Thermus thermophilus. The thermophilic bacteria and archaea display lower sorption site densities than the <b>mesophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> that have been studied to date, which points to a general pattern of total concentration of cell wall adsorption sites per unit biomass being inversely correlated to growth temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was the evaluation of the effectiveness of High Pressure Carbon Dioxide (HPCO 2) as a non-thermal technology for the pasteurization of porcine raw meat. The inactivation kinetics of mesophilic bacteria were determined at 25, 35 and 40 °C, from 6 to 16 MPa and from 5 to 60 min. The effects of HPCO 2 on the colour parameters in terms of L∗, a∗, b∗ and ΔE during and after the treatment were investigated by means of a spectroscopic apparatus. Data demonstrated that HPCO 2 treatment assured at least 2 Log (CFU/cm 2) reduction of <b>mesophilic</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> but induced significant colours alterations: lightness increased and redness decreased and the samples turned whitish and looked like “cooked”. The technology could hardly be exploited at industrial scale for raw meat pasteurization due to the colour modifications induced to the product...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} paper is to investigate the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand in 5 days (BOD 5), suspended solids (SS) denoted as “food ” (F) to biomass (M; microorganism) ratio (F/M), by targeting varying rate of influent stream. The experiment initially consisted of two acrylic cylinders with coneshape bottom with an inner diameter of 20 cm and 65 cm, respectively. The setup is fitted with a heater and aeration system. Temperature of wastewater range is maintained at 30 – 36 degree Celsius to promote the growth <b>mesophilic</b> <b>microorganism.</b> COD had its highest elimination rate on day 39 at 83 % at an influent rate of 13. 96 litres per day. COD mf result showed the highest elimination rate on day 39 at 78 % with influent rate of 13. 96 litres per day. Biological oxygen demand in 5 days (BOD 5; BSB 5) result showed the highest elimination rate on day 43 at 94 % with influent rate of 19. 98 litres per day. The suspended solids (AFS; SS) result showed the highest elimination rate on day 39 at 98 % with influent rate of 13. 96 litres per day. The results attained from absorbance denoted as DFZ 436, DFZ 525, DFZ 620 exhibits the highest elimination rate on day 44 at 72 %, 78 % and 59 % respectively with a constant influent rate of 19. 98 liters per da...|$|R
30|$|Composting is a {{rigorous}} process of aerobic degradation of organic waste by the metabolic {{activities of the}} microorganisms, therefore it serves for the abundance of metabolically active microbes (Anastasi et al. 2005; Bhatia et al. 2013; Hassen et al. 2001; Pan and Sen 2013; Ryckeboer et al. 2003). The microbes are dependent on the surrounding conditions such as the temperature, availability of organic waste, pH, species diversity and availability of heavy metals. A large variety of <b>mesophilic,</b> thermo-tolerant <b>microorganisms</b> {{have been reported in}} composting of different types of waste materials, it includes bacteria, actinomycetes, streptomycetes and fungi (Hassen et al. 2001; Ryckeboer et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the trade and microbiological quality of boiled quail eggs on the waterfront of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, from the child labor perspective. METHODS: This cross-sectional study administered semi-structured questionnaires to 40 underage vendors and performed the microbiological assessment of 40 quail egg samples as follows: <b>mesophilic</b> aerobic <b>microorganism</b> count, coagulase-positive staphylococcus count, estimation of the most probable number of total and thermotolerant coliforms/Escherichia coli, and testing for Salmonella spp [...] The results were compared with the standards provided by the Resolution RDC nº 12 / 2001, National Sanitary Surveillance Agency. RESULTS: The vendors were mostly female (57. 5 %) students (95. 0 %) aged 8 to 17 years. The most common reason for working was supplementation of the family income (57. 5 %). The mean gross income was R$ 38. 31 /day. Most of them presented inadequate personal hygiene but they recognized that foods could cause diseases. Many (47. 5 %) vendors reported washing their hands up to twice daily. Mean <b>mesophilic</b> aerobic <b>microorganism</b> and coagulase-positive staphylococcus counts were 2. 43 and 2. 01 log colony-forming unit/g, respectively, and the estimated thermotolerant coliform contamination was 0. 98 log most probable number/g. Escherichia coli was found in 15. 0 % of the samples and none contained Salmonella spp. Most (55. 0 %) samples were noncompliant with the legislation. CONCLUSION: The results evidenced the presence of minors selling quail eggs on beaches of Salvador and suggest risk to consumers' health because of the detected contamination and vendors' ignorance of principles of hygiene...|$|R
