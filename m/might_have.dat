5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism <b>might</b> <b>have</b> resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians <b>might</b> <b>have</b> joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E

5|$|Although {{only a small}} affray, it {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been targeted by York, the latter too <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.|$|E

5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E

25|$|The plague theory, which {{suggests}} a severe epidemic outbreak <b>might</b> <b>had</b> hit the heavily populated Angkor, {{contributed to the}} fall of the empire, has been reconsidered. By the 14th century, the Black Death had affected Asia, as the plague first appeared in China around 1330 and reached Europe around 1345. Most seaports along the line of travel from China to Europe felt the impact of the disease, which <b>might</b> <b>had</b> a severe impact on life throughout Southeast Asia. Possible disease include bubonic plague, smallpox or malaria.|$|R

5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been targets because their genes <b>might</b> <b>have</b> influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been responsible for}} the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Other dinosaurs {{from these}} {{formations}} include the genasaur Lesothosaurus, the basal sauropodomorph Massospondylus, and the theropod Megapnosaurus. The Lower Elliot Formation shows the largest known heterodontosaurid diversity of any rock unit; besides Heterodontosaurus, it contained Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, and Pegomastax. Yet {{another member of}} the family, Geranosaurus, is known from the Clarens Formation. The high heterodontosaurid diversity have led researchers to conclude that different species <b>might</b> <b>have</b> fed on separate food sources in order to avoid competition (niche partitioning). With its highly specialised dentition, Heterodontosaurus <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been specialised for tough plant material, while the less specialised Abrictosaurus <b>might</b> <b>have</b> predominantly consumed softer vegetation. The position of the individual heterodontosaurid specimens within the rock succession is poorly known, making it difficult to determine how many of these species really were conspecific, and which species existed at separate times.|$|E
