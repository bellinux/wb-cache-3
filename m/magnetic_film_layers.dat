40|$|Electrochemical {{deposition}} of thin magnetic layers Thin magnetic layers {{are widely used}} as functional materials for different applications. The electrochemical deposition technique has been increasingly established as efficient preparation route. The quality and properties of Co layers could be considerably improved by the superimposition of external magnetic fields during the deposition process. Composition, structure and microstructure of FePt alloys have been optimised for applications requiring hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>films.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>layers</b> and layered structures with defined physical properties are of high interest for magnetoelectronic and magnetoelectromechanical applications {{as well as for}} magnetic data storage. New deposition technologies become more important in industrial branches for magnetic applications. Electrochemical deposition methods are favoured due to their low costs compared to physical deposition methods. Due to the increasing miniaturisation of microelectronic components the thickness of such layers is only some nm. This is a challenge for electrochemical processes and requires new approaches. Here the superimposition of magnetic fields during the electrochemical deposition process is used to optimize film growth. Dependent on the orientation, strength and homogeneity of the magnetic field the deposition process of Co is influenced and therefore, the structure and morphology of the layers can be changed specifically. In recent years, the FePt alloy has attracted growing interest as a hard magnetic material competing with the well established NdFeB. This is due to the excellent hard magnetic properties of the ordered FePt L 10 phase. It exhibits a saturation magnetization of 1. 4 T and a very high magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 107 J/m 3. With a proceeding miniaturization of devices, materials costs become less important compared to processing costs and therefore, FePt films are expected to compete with rare earth based hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>films.</b> Potential applications of FePt films are as media in high density magnetic storage and as micromagnets in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Up to now, most FePt films are produced using physical vapour deposition techniques like Sputtering, Pulse...|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as [...] "being in the living presence of the orchestra" [...] by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still {{based on the principle}} of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>film</b> instead of -inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35mm <b>magnetic</b> <b>film</b> prevented tape <b>layer</b> print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of three-to-two mix directly to the master recorder.|$|R
40|$|B 2 -ordered FeRh {{thin films}} undergo a first-order {{magnetic}} transition from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at low temperature to a ferromagnetic (FM) state above 350 K and reverse back on cooling with a finite hysteresis. This property makes them very attractive {{for use in}} temperature-controlled exchange coupling layers for heat-assisted magnetic recording. In order {{to be used as}} an exchange coupling layer, the goal is to fabricate ultra-thin films of FeRh that show reversible AFM-FM switching. For thinner films grown on MgO substrates, there exists an FM signal below the AFM-FM transition temperature. It is demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between the low-temperature FM fraction and the extent of atomic ordering. Based on this observation, the enhanced atomic order in FeRh grown on NiAl underlayers is shown to result in bulk-like AFM-FM switching, especially for the thinner films.

40|$|First {{measurements}} on Barkhausen - noise from magnetic tunnel junctions are presented. A low frequency magnetic field {{was applied to}} the <b>magnetic</b> thin <b>film</b> <b>layers</b> and then the temporary changes in the voltage signal of the junction were measured as spectral noise density. The alternating magnetic field causes a temporary change of the magnetization in the ferromagnetic layers. These changes influence the behavior of the resistance directly and the TMR - effect, respectively. With this method it was possible to draw conclusions on the switching behavior of the magnetic domains in each magnetic layer. Magnetic tunnel junctions with a tri-layer system made of Co/Al_ 2 O_ 3 /NiFe have been fabricated. The aluminum oxide barrier was fabricated using a mercury - low pressure lamp which was able to produce oxygen radicals as well as ozone from pure oxygen gas. This successful preparation method is concerned to be an alternative to the commonly used plasma oxidation. All of the tunnel junctions showed a clear tunneling behavior based on the nonlinear current - voltage characteristics. The tunneling magnetoresistance effect of the junctions made with the UV-light were in the range of 10 - 20 % at room temperature. The magnetic switching fields have been measured to 0, 5 and 2 kA/m for the soft- and hard magnetic layers respectively. In order to characterize the tunnel barrier, noise measurements at different applied magnetic fields were made. No significant changes were observed in the spectra of the UV - light oxidized and the plasma oxidized tunnel junctions. (orig.)
