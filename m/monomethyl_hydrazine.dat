25|$|On 14 October 2010, {{engineers}} at {{the launch pad}} first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for Discoverys orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines. The leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle, {{thought of as a}} sign of fuel vapor in the air. Upon inspection, the leak was found at a flange located at the interface where two propellant lines met in Discoverys aft compartment. The line carried <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> (MMH) propellant, one of two chemicals (the other is an oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide) used to ignite the OMS engines. Engineers replaced an Air Half Coupling (AHC) flight cap. However, the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak. An aspirator was activated to collect the vapor at the leak-site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of Discovery.|$|E

This research was undertaken to determine the toxicity of hydrazine (H), <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> (MMH) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) to four enriched bacterial cultures: Nitrobacter, Nitrosomonas- Nitrobacter, anaerobic bacteria and denitrifying bac-teria at concentrations of about 15, 165, 100 and 100 mg/ 1, respective-ly; <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> at 14, < 1, 75 and 10 mg/ 1, respectively; and UDMH at 1800, 35, 2300, and 12, 500 mg/ 1, respectively.

40|$|A two-part {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate ignition of hypergolic propellants. The first part focused upon {{development and implementation}} of fundamental and phenomenological sub-models to describe system-level processes that lead to ignition. Propellant injection, jet formation, atomization, vaporization, and chemical reaction were considered. Sub-models were completed to handle the propellant feed system hydraulics, the vaporization of the injected droplets, and predicting ignition. The second part involved the development of an experiment to isolate and study the effect of liquid-liquid contact on hypergolic ignition under a controlled environment. The hypergolic ignition of droplets of <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine,</b> 2 -Azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine, N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethylethylene- 1, 2 -diamine, a blend of 2 -Azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine and N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethylethylene- 1, 2 -diamine, 1 -Butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium dicyanamide, and a solution of sodium borohydride and triglyme with approximately 600 µL of red fuming nitric acid that formed a convex meniscus in a quartz tube were investigated using a controlled descent under a nitrogen environment. Ignition was only observed for <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> and the solution of sodium borohydride and triglyme. Thin filament pyrometry with an infrared camera was employed as a novel technique to measure the temperature of the near flame field of <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> and red fuming nitric acid combustion with maximum temperatures recorded around 1600 K. Using an unrestrained, approximately 100 µL pool of red fuming nitric acid, the influence of <b>monomethyl</b> <b>hydrazine</b> fuel droplet size and fuel droplet impact velocity on explosion delay time, ignition delay time, and radiation energy released prior to ignition was explored. For the parameters explored (fuel droplet diameters on the order of 2 to 5 mm, impact velocities on the order of 10 to 300 m/s, and Weber numbers on the order of 0. 01 to 10), impact velocity and Weber number were statistically significant predictors of explosion and ignition delays. The radiation energy released from an explosion prior to ignition was determined to be independent of fuel droplet size and impact velocity. Although many more tests need to be run to better determine trends of the highly stochastic droplet impact and hypergolic ignition events, it is obvious that liquid-liquid reactions {{play an important role in}} hypergolic ignition. ...|$|E

The Cyranose E-nose has detected hydrazine of 52 ppm and 18 ppm with a good response. The response of the E-Nose for 1. 1 ppm hydrazine was insignificant. The response of E-Nose for 14 ppm MMH was significant and 1 ppm MMH was reasonably identifiable.

A derivatizing agent, pentafluorobenzoyl chloride (PFBCI), is known to react readily with MMH and Hz. The SPME fiber can either be coated with PFBCl and introduced into a gaseous stream containing MMH, or PFBCl and MMH can react first in a syringe barrel and after a short equilibration period a SPME is used to sample the resulting solution. These methods were optimized and compared. Because Hz and MMH can degrade the SPME, letting the reaction occur first gave better results. Only MMH could be detected using either of these methods.

40|$|A low toxicity, high performance, hyperbolic, bipropelkmt {{system is}} desired to replace {{conventional}} nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and hydrazine propulsion systems. High-test hydrogen peroxide exothermically decomposes to water, and oxygen, {{making it an}} ideal oxidizer for more environmentally fi-iendly propulsion systems. Unfortunately, the choice of fuel for such systems is not as clear. Many factors such as ignition delay, performance, toxicity, storability, and cost must be considered. Numerous candidate fuels and fbel/catalyst mixtures were screened using a simple laboratory setup and visual observation. A mixture of ethanolamine and 1 ‘A copper 11 chloride was found to rapidly ignite with 90 °/ 0 hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide and ethanolamine are much less toxic than NTO and hydrazine.
