40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of Durban-Westville, 1991. Tertiary institutions, in striving towards {{achieving}} academic excellence, have realised {{the need}} for the professional development of human resources. Staff development thus now features in most institutions' strategic plans. In this study, which has as its context the M L Sultan Technikon, an attempt was made to develop and implement an <b>evaluation</b> <b>programme</b> for academic staff to determine relevant staff needs. Adopting a 'grass-roots' approach to staff <b>evaluation,</b> the <b>evaluation</b> <b>programme</b> was initiated and launched by the Staff Development Unit. Phase 1 of the programme was experimental and voluntary and consisted of student-feedback, a self-evaluation form and a head's evaluation form. Staff response to the programme and their input to a revised <b>evaluation</b> <b>programme</b> occurred as a result of meetings with staff, the administration of feedback questionnaires and a survey of all heads of department. One of the goals of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>programme</b> was to contribute to a relevant staff development programme based on academic staff needs, generated as a result of engaging in the self-evaluation, resulting in needs as indicated in staff's personal development plans. Although the <b>evaluation</b> <b>programme</b> was developed with formative intentions, it has been adapted by the Management for summative purposes, the outcomes of which are also focused upon in the study...|$|R

40|$|Final Report to Welsh Government, {{prepared}} by CEH {{on behalf of}} the Glastir Monitoring & <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Programme</b> Team. The Glastir Monitoring and <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Programme</b> (GMEP) provides a comprehensive programme to establish a baseline against which future assessments of Glastir can be made. GMEP also contributes national trend data which supports a range of national and international biodiversity and environmental targets. GMEP fulfils a commitment by the Welsh Government to establish a monitoring programme concurrently with the launch of the Glastir scheme. The use of models and farmer surveys provides early indicators of the likely direction, magnitude and timing of future outcomes. The programme ensures compliance with the rigorous requirements of the European Commission’s Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) through the Rural Development Plan (RDP) for Wales.

The article focuses on a particular topic of the external evaluation the participation of social actors in school life, {{as well as on}} school principals’ perceptions of the process. Our research is based on a content analysis of schools’ evaluation reports conducted in three different regions (Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Alentejo and Algarve) and a series of semi-directive interviews with the principals and chairpersons of the General Councils of 20 schools. While {{it is important to consider}} the <b>evaluation</b> <b>programme</b> in the light of international political tendencies (e. g. New Public Management), it is also relevant to understand the impact of such policy on schools. We highlight the contributions of this approach to a wider reflection on evaluation processes.
