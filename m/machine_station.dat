50|$|The {{government}} began {{to allow the}} co-operatives to purchase limited amounts of machinery for their own use. Until this point, all farm machinery had been kept in special state-run <b>machine</b> <b>stations,</b> but new regulations encouraged co-operatives to buy most forms of light machinery. By {{the end of the}} year, the 2557 existing agricultural co-operatives had purchased over 1000 light tractors. In March 1958, Khrushchev suggested that <b>machine</b> <b>stations</b> had outlived their usefulness, and they were soon abolished. More purchasing of machinery was allowed the following year, and in 1961, a number of <b>machine</b> <b>stations</b> were allowed to sell off their obsolete machines. Furthermore, the <b>machine</b> <b>stations</b> in Turkeve and Székesfehérvár were converted into repair shops. Out of 235 <b>machine</b> <b>stations</b> in use in 1961, only 63 were open in 1964 {{and by the end of}} the decade, only a few remained in poor areas. Most of the stations were transformed into repair shops to service the machinery quickly being acquired by the co-operatives.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Silica is an {{inorganic}} material {{that found in}} the nature in various forms. The hazards of crystal of silica or α-quartz (free silica) is greater than other forms. Exposure to dust that contains free silica result to pulmonary injury and result to silicosis and death finally. The present research was conducted in order to evaluate the level of workers exposure to free silica in air of Khaf Iron stone quarries. "nMaterials and methods: The exposure level to total and respiratory dust measured based on personal and environmental sampling methods and concentration of dust determined based on gravimetric method. For determination of amounts of free silica, dust samples analyses based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, and results compared with standard levels. "nResults: The maximum amount of total dust and free silica measured in stone breaking station (800 ± 155 mg/m 3 and 26. 11 ± 6. 7 mg/m 3) and minimum of them measured in official and safeguarding station (8. 28 ± 2. 2 mg/m 3 and 0. 012 ± 0. 0019 mg/m 3). The maximum amount of respiratory dust and free silica measured in red mound digging number 1 (66. 14 ± 13. 45 mg/m 3 and 1. 48 ± 0. 39 mg/m 3) and minimum of them measured in air hammer <b>machine</b> <b>station</b> (5. 26 ± 2. 62 mg/m 3 and 0. 01 ± 0. 005 mg/m 3). "nConclusion: Amount of total dust only in official and safeguarding station was lower than standard levels of Iran. Amount of respiratory dust in all stations was greater than Iran standard levels. Furthermore the level of respiratory free silica only in airy hammer <b>machine</b> <b>station</b> was lower than standard level of Iran.

Two types of FMS as “In line layout” and “Loop layout” have been used examining parts’ and their work pieces 3 D CAD models. The modeling is based on created mechanical parts’ design features (DF) classifier, DFMA method and mathematical dependences for machining time versus removed material volume from the part’s work piece during machining operation. This methodology for FMS operations forecasting of the manufacturing time has been applied. Developed virtual FMS model has been tested applying piloting procedure in Lithuanian OHMS Company X...|$|E

In the 1950s, the hay-making <b>machine</b> <b>stations</b> were reorganized as livestock <b>machine</b> <b>stations.</b> In 1955 negdels replaced the arad producers' associations. By 1959 the state had accomplished the collectivization of agriculture. [...] In ten years, agricultural cooperatives had more than doubled, from 139 in 1950 to 354 by 1960. Ownership of livestock and sown areas changed dramatically as a result of collectivization. In 1950, according to Mongolian government statistics, state farms and other state organizations owned approximately 0.9 percent of livestock and 37.8 percent of sown areas; negdels had about 0.5 percent of livestock and no sown lands; and private owners some held 98.3 percent of livestock and 62.2 percent of sown areas. In 1960 state farms and other state organizations owned 2.7 percent of livestock; negdels, 73.8 percent; and individual negdel members, 23.5 percent.

Process modeller practices DES modelling to incorporate these breakdowns and corresponding mainte-nances up-to the machine level.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the free drawing process of PE pipes in the aspect of timecharacteristics of the viscoelastic return. Design/methodology/approach: To determine the properties, drawing tests were conducted on chosen PE pipes, usinga testing <b>machine</b> <b>station.</b> Pipe samples were preheated to a set temperature and drawn by a fixed drawing die. Changesin the pipe diameter and length of the test section were recorded for the further analysis of the pipe sample. Findings: Obtained dependencies were assumed to be the basis for formulation of conclusions as to the choiceof essential process conditions for the technological sequence of PE lining deposition in the outer coating ofinstallation pipes or reconstruction of a transmission channel. Research limitations/implications: Conducted research and their conclusions have a methodological value. They factually correspond to chosen spatial parameters of pipes and dies. Together with parallel tribologicalresearch on the conditions in the drawing die zone, they give a basis for building a model of the reverse drawingprocess with its all complexity. Practical implications: From a practical point of view, the obtained results allow to optimize the expansivedeposition process of PE pipes in production of new and renovation of damaged elements of transmissionnetworks – in the latter case, mainly in digless conditions. Originality/value: Original input of these works is determination of simultaneous influence of geometricalproperties – the degree of inner diameter reduction of the pipe and the approach angle of the drawing die – andthe temperature of the examined material on the time characteristics and participation of plastic strain in theprocess of viscoelastic after-deformation return...|$|E
