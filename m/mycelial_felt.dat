5000|$|A. clavatus colonies grow rapidly on Czapek's {{solution}} agar, reaching 3.0-3.5 cm, in 10 days at 24-26 °C. Growth {{is usually}} plane or moderately furrowed, with occasional appearance of floccose strains. But generally a comparatively thin surface layer of <b>mycelial</b> <b>felt</b> is observed, which produces a copious amount of erect conidiophores. The reverse is usually uncoloured but becomes brown with passing time in some strains. While odor is not prominent in some strains, {{it can be}} extremely unpleasant in others. Large conidial heads extend from 300 to 400 μm by 150 to 200 μm when young. However with time, they split into two or more divergent and compressed cordial chains reaching 1.00 mm portraying a colour consisting of artemesia green to slate olive. The observed conidiophores grow up to 1.5-3.00 mm in length with 20-30 μm in diameter. They slowly and ultimately enlarge at the apex into a clavate vesicle, which consists of a fertile area, 200 to 250 μm in length and 40-60 μm wide. The sterigmata usually ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 μm by 2.0 to 3.0 μm {{at the base of}} the vesicle, to 7.0 or 8.0 and occasionally 10 μm to 2.5 to 3.0 μm at the apex. The conidia are comparatively thick-walled and measures 3.0 to 4.5 μm by 2.5 to 3.5 μm. While they can be larger in some strains, in others their appearance may be irregular.|$|E
40|$|Spicules morphologically {{similar to}} those present on the spores oE Pithomyces chartarurn invest the spores of several other Pithoinyces species. Depsipeptides are quantitatively removed from dried <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> by brief {{chloroform}} washing, and their amount {{is proportional to the}} number of spores present. Three pure spore-coat depsipeptides have no demon-strable antibiotic activity...|$|R
40|$|An {{inducible}} benzoate- 4 -hydroxylase {{has been}} partially purified from crude extracts of the <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> of Aspergillus niger. This enzyme catalyzes {{the transformation of}} benzoate to p-hydroxybenzoate with equimolar consumption of NADPH and O 2. It requires tetrahydropteridine as a prosthetic group. The optimum activity was found at pH 6. 2 with a Km value at 30 °C of 1. 6 · 10 − 4 M for NADPH and 1. 3 · 10 − 4 M for benzoate. Fe 2 + (iron) {{is required for the}} enzyme activity. The enzyme is stabilized by the inclusion of benzoate, EDTA and glutathione in the extracting buffer. The enzyme is specific for benzoate as substrate. Sulfhydryl group(s) are essential for enzyme activity as indicated by p-chloromercuri-benzoate and N-ethylmaleimide inactivation. Benzoate- 4 -hydroxylase activity is decreased in the <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> of Aspergillus niger grown in the presence of higher concentrations of benzoate. Maximum activity of the enzyme was observed at 36 h after inoculation...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{conversion}} of radioactive tryptophan to anthranilic acid and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid by submerged cultures of Claviceps paspali was shown by Groeger {{and his co-workers}} (1965). More recently, Subba Rao et al. (1967 a) reported that washed <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> of Aspergillus niger incorporate the radioactivity from DL-tryptophan-C 14 (benzene ring-labeled) into anthranilic acid, 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid, 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and catechol. However, the {{conversion of}} anthranilic acid to 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid by cell-free preparations has not been demonstrated. In the present paper we report the demonstration of a soluble anthranilic acid hydroxylase from Aspergillus niger which {{is different from the}} anthranilic acid hydroxylases reported so far from microbes and higher plants...|$|R
40|$|Washed <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> of an Alternaria sp. {{isolated}} from soil, when grown on a malt extract medium, rapidly metabolized various cinnamic and benzoic acids. The intermediates in {{the degradation of}} trans-cinnamic, m-coumaric, p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids have been identified. In vivo studies with ^ 1 ^ 4 C-labelled cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid and benzoic acid have shown that these compounds are converted to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and protocatechuic acid. When the organism was fed with cinnamic acid- 2 -^ 1 ^ 4 C, {{a part of the}} radioactivity after 6 hr was trapped in glutamic and aspartic acids. These results strongly suggest that Alternaria shortens the cinnamic acid side-chain by β-oxidation. The organism did not have any detectable levels of phenylalanine and tryosine ammonia-lyase activities...|$|R
40|$|Maximal {{levels of}} L-henylalanine ammonia-lyase {{activity}} were observed when the <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> of Rhizoctonia solani were grown for 4. 5 days on Byrde synthetic medium containing 3. 5 % glucose and 0. 3 % L-phenylalanine, Differential centrifugation {{studies have indicated}} that the enzyme is localized in the soluble fraction. The time course of induction of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity by L-phenylalanine showed a lag period of 1 to 1. 5 h and reached a maximum around 4 to 6 h after the addition of the inducer to the medium. L-Phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan were nearly equally efficient inducers of the enzyme. D-Phenylalanine was as efficient as the L-isomer, whereas D-tyrosine was a poor inducer. Light, gibberellic acid, indole 3 -acetic acid, and kinetin had no effect on the induction of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Cycloheximide did not inhibit the uptake of amino acids by the mycelia but completely blocked the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into soluble proteins and the development of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Actinomycin D inhibited both the incorporation of 32 P into ribonucleic acid and the enzyme activity. Conclusive evidence for de novo synthesis of L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was obtained by the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into the enzyme. Electrophoretic analysis of the purified preparation showed a single protein band that coincided with radioactivity and L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Glucose and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, like citric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and succinic acid, and the metabolites of L-phenylalanine, like o-coumaric acid, o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and protocatechuic acid, significantly repressed L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. The observed repression was not relieved by cyclic adenosine 5 '-triphosphate...|$|R
40|$|Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4. 3. 1. 5) was {{purified}} to homogeneity {{from the}} acetone-dried powders of the <b>mycelial</b> <b>felts</b> {{of the plant}} pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani. 2. A useful modification in protamine sulphate treatment to get substantial purification of the enzyme in a single-step is described. 3. The purified enzyme shows bisubstrate activity towards L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. 4. It is sensitive to carbonyl reagents and the inhibition is not reversed by gel filtration. 5. The molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by Sephadex G- 200 chromatography and sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation is around 330000. 6. The enzyme {{is made up of}} two pairs of unidentical subunits, with a molecular weight of 70000 (alpha) and 90000 (beta) respectively. 7. Studies on initial velocity versus substrate concentration have shown significant deviations from Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 8. The double-reciprocal plots are biphasic (concave downwards) and Hofstee plots show a curvilinear pattern. 9. The apparent Km value increases from 0. 18 mM to as high as 5. 0 mM with the increase in the concentration of the substrate and during this process the Vmax, increases by 2 - 2. 5 -fold. 10. The value of Hill coefficient is 0. 5. 11. Steady-state rates of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase reaction in the presence of inhibitors like D-phenylalanine, cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, dihydrocaffeic and phenylpyruvic acid have shown that only one molecule of each type of inhibitor binds to a molecule of the enzyme. These observations suggest the involvement of negative homotropic interactions in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. 12. The enzyme could not be desensitized by treatment with HgCl 2, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid or by repeated freezing and thawing...|$|R
