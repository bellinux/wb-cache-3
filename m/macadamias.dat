40|$|<b>Macadamia</b> is {{the only}} native Australian food plant in {{large-scale}} cultivation in Australia and overseas. Annual Australian <b>macadamia</b> production is worth AUD$ 150 million, but the husk spot disease caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora <b>macadamiae</b> can result in production losses worth AUD$ 10 million annually without adequate disease control. Yield losses in orchards result from premature abscission of diseased fruit. Paucity of knowledge of the biology of P. <b>macadamiae</b> has led to difficulty in husk spot management in orchards. An understanding of the factors associated with the growth and spread of the pathogen and infection of the fruit pericarp (husk) will {{provide the basis for}} effective disease control. Specifically, this study provides information on: (i) identification and culture of P. <b>macadamiae</b> in vitro; (ii) the process of infection, colonisation and sporulation of P. <b>macadamiae</b> on fruit; (iii) timing of infection of fruit by P. <b>macadamiae</b> and climatic effects on the pathogen and disease; (iv) the source of P. <b>macadamiae</b> inoculum in orchards and methods to characterise husk spot susceptibility in the field; and (v) the level of genetic diversity among P. <b>macadamiae</b> populations in relation to the presence and the possible influence a teleomorphic stage may have on the husk spot disease cycle in orchards.

40|$|Ability {{to detect}} Pseudocercospora <b>macadamiae</b> {{infection}} in <b>macadamia</b> husk {{at least four}} months before symptoms become visible will aid the development of disease control measures. This study examined the distinctness of P. <b>macadamiae</b> within the phylogenetic lineages of the genus Pseudocercospora. In addition, we developed two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, as rapid diagnostic tools, for early detection and quantification of P. <b>macadamiae</b> in planta. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of four gene loci (large subunits, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (TEF- 1 alpha) and actin of 47 P. <b>macadamiae</b> isolates showed that P. <b>macadamiae</b> is a distinct species in the genus Pseudocercospora. P. <b>macadamiae</b> isolates were partitioned into subunits in the cluster but the grouping of the isolates was regardless of location. Nucleotide diversity (0. 02) and the coefficient of genetic differentiation (0. 07) were low in the P. <b>macadamiae</b> population. Two qPCR primer sets, based on ITS (PMI) and TEF- 1 alpha (PME) were designed that consistently amplified P. <b>macadamiae</b> in fungal cultures (Ct = 16. 93 +/- 0. 11 and Ct = 21. 20 +/- 0. 11, respectively) and in planta (Ct = 32. 36 +/- 0. 28 and Ct = 38. 07 +/- 1. 20, respectively). The PMI primers also detected species in the genus Pseudocercospora, while PME was more specific and robust for quantification of P. <b>macadamiae.</b> Both primer sets detected P. <b>macadamiae</b> in asymptomatic tissue samples and strongly differentiated various stages of disease progression, which revealed approximately 10 -fold increase in fungal biomass between each consecutive stage of symptom development...|$|R

40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of cultivated <b>macadamia</b> (<b>Macadamia</b> integrifolia, <b>Macadamia</b> tetraphylla {{and their}} hybrids) worldwide. The susceptibility of the two non-edible <b>Macadamia</b> species (<b>Macadamia</b> ternifolia and <b>Macadamia</b> jansenii) to P. cinnamomi is not well-understood. Commercial <b>macadamia</b> trees are established on grafted seedling (seed propagation) or own-rooted cutting (vegetative propagation) rootstocks of hybrids of the cultivated species. There is little information to support the preferential use of rootstock propagated by either seedling or own-rooted cutting methods in <b>macadamia.</b> In this study we assessed roots of <b>macadamia</b> plants of the four species and their hybrids, derived from the two methods of propagation, for their susceptibility to P. cinnamomi infection. The roots of inoculated plant from which P. cinnamomi was recovered showed blackening symptoms. The non-cultivated species, M. ternifolia and M. jansenii and their hybrids were the most susceptible germplasm compared with M. tetraphylla and M. integrifolia. Of these two species, M. tetraphylla was less susceptible than M. integrifolia. Significant differences were observed among the accessions of their hybrids. A strong association (R > 0. 75) was recorded between symptomatic roots and disease severity. Root density reduced with increasing disease severity rating in both own-rooted cuttings (R = 0. 65) and germinated seedlings (R = 0. 55). P. cinnamomi severity data were not significantly (P > 0. 05) different between the two methods of plant propagation.

40|$|<b>Macadamia</b> nut is {{considered}} a priority food allergen and undeclared <b>macadamia</b> nut residues pose a potential food safety risk to individuals with <b>macadamia</b> nut allergies. To date, there are {{a limited number of}} immunochemical methods that are available for detection of processed <b>macadamia</b> nut residues. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} develop a reliable and robust sandwich ELISA for detection of <b>macadamia</b> nut residues. Raw and roasted <b>macadamia</b> nuts were used for immunization in three different species of animals (sheep, goat, and rabbits). <b>Macadamia</b> nut specific IgG antibodies produced by each animal were tested for their specificity and monitored by determining their titer values. Rabbit antiserum was used as the capture reagent while goat antiserum was used as the detector reagent in the optimized sandwich ELISA. These antisera recognized both raw and roasted <b>macadamia</b> protein equivalently. Potential matrix interference was evaluated in sugar cookies, vanilla ice cream, and dark chocolate to assess the overall sensitivity of the ELISA. The cookie and ice cream matrices did not significantly affect the sensitivity of the developed ELISA (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The dark chocolate matrix decreased <b>macadamia</b> nut protein extraction and overall ELISA sensitivity; however, the addition of NFDM or fish gelatin into the extraction buffer enhanced the extraction efficiency which allowed for an estimated limit of quantification of 1 ppm <b>macadamia</b> nut in three matrices. Potential cross-reactivity was assessed in 86 food ingredients. Pure extracts from a few ingredients (all-spice, cinnamon, cloves, paprika, Brazil nut, poppy seeds, oregano, nutmeg, and cherries) showed low level binding but would not significantly affect the accuracy of the ELISA. The sensitivity and efficiency of the developed ELISA was evaluated further through <b>macadamia</b> incurred sugar cookies and vanilla ice cream. The overall high percentage recovery of <b>macadamia</b> nut residues in both model foods shows that the developed ELISA can sufficiently and reliably detect <b>macadamia</b> nut proteins in processed foods, and will provide a useful tool to support the validation of allergen control procedures within food companies or regulatory compliance.
