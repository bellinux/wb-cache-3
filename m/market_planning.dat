Businesses can create unlimited users who can use the same account of the platform.Users can create four types of iStickers i.e.: Product iSticker, Service iSticker, Design iSticker and Knowledge iSticker, each with an image and a description. These iStickers can be saved by the user for his own use {{as a part of}} his personal cloud library (only accessible to him) or showcased. In workbench module, the users like architects/designers can create their projects and pin different types of iStickers on their projects either from their own cloud library or from the iSticker library. As soon as they pin any iSticker, the presentations in the form of mood boards, cost estimates and many other reports get ready. When they pin any product/service iSticker published by other registered users, the respective user gets a hot lead which can be viewed in his hot lead module.Technology wise, iSticker platform is developed in PHP with CAN JS as front-end and YII framework as back-end.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. The fluctuations in the demand for construction work have often resulted in skills shortages. This {{has led to the}} need for effective construction labour <b>market</b> <b>planning</b> strategies, which enable the construction industry to meet its skills requirements, particularly in periods of peak demand. Existing approaches to construction labour <b>market</b> <b>planning</b> have several limitations. They do not shed light on the socio-economic and spatially influenced issues within which the industry’s skills shortages are rooted. There is, therefore, a need for more appropriate decision-support mechanisms that can take account of spatial problems in terms of skills demand and supply influences. Through industry involvement, this research has explored how GIS can enhance the labour <b>market</b> <b>planning</b> process in construction. The research briefly reviews the nature of labour <b>market</b> <b>planning</b> in construction, introduces geographic information systems, and highlights the opportunities they offer for overcoming the limitations of existing approaches. The implementation of the GIS-based system and its application to a specific labour <b>market</b> <b>planning</b> initiative is then presented. The evaluation of the system by prospective end-users reveals the enablers, barriers and benefits of the system implementation. Organisational issues that had a bearing on the implementation are also examined and recommendations made for further research...|$|E
