Racemic random polylactide (PDLLA) is completely amorphous in nature and was mainly prepared to be of spherical form {{for the use of}} sustained drug release. In this paper, we observed novel lath-, sheaf-like morphologies of PDLLA <b>microarchitectures</b> fabricated by the double emulsion-solvent evaporation method in the presence of glycerol or epirubicin. These non-spherical <b>microarchitectures</b> coexisted with amorphous PDLLA microspheres and crystallized poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanoparticles. On the basis of our experiments, the formation of lath-like <b>microarchitectures</b> is due to glycerol, while the formation of sheaf-like <b>microarchitectures</b> is owing to both glycerol and epirubicin. Therefore, novel assemblies of PDLLA have been developed and the formation mechanism is different from those of well-defined amphiphilic or crystalline polymers. These PDLLA non-spherical <b>microarchitectures</b> might have potential application as non-spherical carriers in drug delivery system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

It implements double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory errors. Tukwila also implements Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus-based architecture. It has a peak interprocessor bandwidth of 96GB/s and a peak memory bandwidth of 34GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly, using QPI interfaces to directly connect to other processors and I/O hubs.

5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and <b>microarchitecture</b> still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
25|$|The Intel Core <b>microarchitecture</b> (previously {{known as}} the Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a {{multi-core}} processor <b>microarchitecture</b> unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It {{is based on the}} Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 <b>microarchitecture,</b> introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. The high power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as the inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons for which Intel abandoned the NetBurst <b>microarchitecture</b> and switched to completely different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core <b>microarchitecture</b> never reached the clock speeds of the Netburst <b>microarchitecture,</b> even after moving to 45nm lithography; however, after many generations of successor microarchitectures which are developed with the Core as the basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more) Intel managed to surpass the clock speeds of Netburst using the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) <b>microarchitecture</b> which reached a base frequency of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22nm lithography and ultimately derives from the P6 <b>microarchitecture</b> through the Core <b>microarchitecture</b> and many other succeeding improvements.|$|E

40|$|Researchers have {{proposed}} clustered <b>microarchitectures</b> {{to capture the}} benefits of high 	performance and high energy efficiency. Typically, clustered <b>microarchitectures</b> 	offer fast local bypasses (i. e., value forwarding between instructions) within 	clusters and require global bypasses to take longer, more than one cycle. With communication locality (i. e., 	most communication is within the clusters) the clustered designs capture the benefits of both 	improved instructions per cycle and increased clock-frequency. Traditional clustered 	<b>microarchitectures</b> are implemented by partitioning the register file and associated 	functional units to clusters. In this work, an alternate technique is demonstrated 	 [...] Incomplete bypassing [...] to achieve similar clustering. Incomplete bypass based 	clustering is similar to traditional clustering in that it creates groups of 	functional units where intra-group communication occurs within a single cycle 	over fast bypass wires and inter-group communication takes longer, more than one cycle. 	One key difference is that in traditional clustered <b>microarchitectures,</b> inter-cluster communication 	takes place over the global buses whereas incomplete bypass designs achieve inter-group 	communication via the register file. It is demonstrated that incomplete bypass based 	clustered micro-architecture achieves higher performance (10 % speedup) and better 	energy efficiency than traditional clustered <b>microarchitectures...</b>|$|R

25|$|The first Pentium {{microprocessor}} {{was introduced}} by Intel on March 22, 1993.

In 1996, the Pentium with MMX Technology (often simply referred to as Pentium MMX) was introduced with the same basic <b>microarchitecture</b> complemented with an MMX instruction set, larger caches, and some other enhancements.|$|E

The core is specifically aimed at 10–125W TDP computing products. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were very high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance competitive with archrival Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing.
