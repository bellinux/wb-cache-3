While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, nearly 2million <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{access to}} water in the four {{principal}} urban centres in the country; the company has kept the quality of infrastructure high (less than 18% of the water is lost through leaks – {{one of the lowest}} in sub-Saharan Africa), improved financial reporting, and increased its annual revenue by an average of 12% (well above inflation). Challenges remain, including difficulties among some customers in paying for services, with the need to rely on international aid to expand its infrastructure. The state-owned, commercially run venture has helped the nation reach its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in water-related areas, and has grown as a viable company.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reported}} that roughly 2 million dogs are slaughtered and consumed {{every year in}} South Korea. In recent years the number of dog meat has gone down as <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been adopting dogs as pets. Dog restaurants are also closing down, with reports saying the country’s 1,500 dog meat restaurants have almost halved in recent years. A poll conducted by Gallup Korea in 2015 showed that only 20 percent of men in their 20s consumed dog meat, compared to half of those in their 50s and 60s. However, there are still approximately 17,000 dog farms operating across the country, often in inhumane conditions.|$|E
25|$|Continuity {{of water}} supply is poor in most Yemeni cities. For example, in Taiz, the {{frequency}} of the public piped water delivery is only once about every 40days. More and <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> to rely on more costly water provided by private wells supplying water tankers. The quality of this water is questionable because these tankers have often been used for other purposes without appropriate cleaning. According to the Ministry of Water and Environment, 15 of 23 urban water utilities provided water every day for between 12 and 24 hours in 2007. These data do not differentiate between utilities with continuous supply and those with intermittent supply of a “moderate” sort (more than 12 hours daily water supply). The 15 cities thus include Sana’a and Aden that provide intermittent water supply. Four other towns provided water on a daily basis, but less than 12 hours per day. The city of Ibb and the town of Bajil provide water only once a week. And the utilities in Taiz and Mahwit provided water only less than once a week in 2007. However, there are potentially conflicting reports about the continuity of supply. For example, the Ministry reported that water was being provided on a daily basis in Amran in 2007. However, 100% of the respondents to a household survey in the same town in 2008 indicated that they received water only once a week or even once a month.|$|E

Back in Shepherd's Glen, Alex allies himself with Deputy Wheeler in the police department. Alex eventually learns that his father was involved in the secrets of the town and had left to attempt to resolve the town's problems, but before he is able to get answers from his mother at home, he is knocked unconscious when The Order—a religious cult from Silent Hill which has been taking people from the town— kidnaps his mother.|$|E

2500|$|Interpersonal {{communication}} {{has been}} a growing issue as more and <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> turned to social networking {{as a means of}} communication. [...] "Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts". Many teens and social networking users may be harming their interpersonal communication by using sites such as Facebook and MySpace. Stated by Baroness Greenfield, an Oxford University neuroscientist, [...] "My fear is that these technologies are infantilizing the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights, who have a small attention span and who live for the moment".|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the highest}} peaks, only Mount Temple (...) has an {{established}} scrambling route. All other mountains (including other routes up Mount Temple), require more mountaineering skills and experience. Despite {{the fact that}} it is only a moderate scramble, even Mount Temple should not be attempted by novices. According to the Alpine Club of Canada, <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> died on Mount Temple than any other Canadian mountain, including seven youths in an unsupervised American school group in 1955. The upper slopes are usually covered with snow and there is a glacier on top.

[...] They [...] "applied Rotter's theory to explain why <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> died in tornados in Alabama than in Illinois". [...] They explain that after giving surveys to residents of four counties in both Alabama and Illinois, Alabama residents were shown to be more external in their {{way of thinking about}} events that occur in their lives. [...] Illinois residents, however, were more internal. [...] Because Alabama residents had a more external way of processing information, they took fewer precautions prior to the appearance of a tornado. [...] Those in Illinois, however, were more prepared, thus leading to fewer casualties.|$|E
