Pitfour was one of 15 advocates acting in a case raised by Alexander Fraser against Lord Fraser claiming the liferents to the Lovat estates.

5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a great movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E

Washington Journal premiered on January 4, 1995 and has been broadcast every weekday morning since then, with guests including elected officials, government administrators, and journalists. The program covers current events, with guests answering questions on topics provided by the hosts {{as well as from}} members of the general public. On the weekend schedule, C-SPAN's main programs are: America and the Courts, which is shown each Saturday at 7:00p.m. Eastern Time, Newsmakers, a Sunday morning interview program with newsworthy guests; Q, a Sunday evening interview program hosted by Brian Lamb, with guests including journalists, politicians, authors, and other public figures; and The Communicators, which features interviews with journalists, government officials, and businesspeople involved with the communications industry and related legislation.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E

25|$|Thus primary {{production}} – {{the conversion of}} sunlight into organic biomass, {{the foundation of the}} food chain – has an annual carbon fixation of 1–2g/m2 in the open ocean. Close to the ice it can reach 30–50g/m2. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the North Sea or upwelling regions, but the area over which it takes place is enormous, even compared to other large primary producers such as rainforests. In addition, during the Austral summer there are <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> daylight to fuel the process.

25|$|Bitumen {{was used}} in early {{photographic}} technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. <b>Many</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist {{in the production of}} printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.|$|E

In 1869, along with William Norman and John Twentyman, the ‘dauntless three’ as they became known, he organised the annual Aspatria Agricultural Show. In the following year the trio founded the Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society and in 1874 they established the Aspatria Agricultural and Commercial School, later renamed the Aspatria Agricultural College.

25|$|Until 1993, {{there was}} no formal {{training}} in place for Indiana reserve police officers. Local Sheriffs and/or chiefs of police could appoint a person with no training as a reserve with full police authority. In 1993, the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) created a condensed version of the basic police academy for reserves. Keeping in mind that reserves often have other full-time employment, it would be nearly impossible for a reserve officer to attend the regular 15-week live-in basic training. Therefore, ILEA created a 40-hour pre-basic course, including physical tactics, pepper spray exposure, Emergency Vehicle Operations, and a heavy emphasis on criminal law. Any officer appointed must now complete (and pass) this training {{in order to have}} statewide arrest authority, on and off duty (IC 5-2-1-9(f)).
