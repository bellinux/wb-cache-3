5|$|Gravity {{received}} ten nominations at the 86th Academy Awards; {{together with}} American Hustle it received {{the greatest number}} of nominations for the 2014 ceremony, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Bullock, and Best Production Design. The film won the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> with seven Academy Awards: for Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. The film is second only to Cabaret (1972) to receive the most Academy Awards in its year without achieving the award for Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E
5|$|Smalls Paradise had {{no cover}} charge and stayed open longer {{than most of the}} others, {{including}} the Cotton Club. At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve a seat at the club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} {{fire spread}} rapidly throughout {{the complex and}} developed into the biggest conflagration to occur in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of the Second World War; the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> and destroyed {{a large part of}} the palace, including the converted St Stephen's Chapel—the meeting place of the House of Commons—the Lords Chamber, the Painted Chamber and the official residences of the Speaker and the Clerk of the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The Allied advance quickly {{ran into}} trouble. The {{reconnaissance}} squadron was ambushed by the northern flank of Krafft's blocking line and withdrew. The 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions were also stalled by Krafft's defences {{and spent the}} rest of the day skirting his line. The 3rd Parachute Battalion went south and halted in Oosterbeek for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> while 1st Parachute Battalion went further north but hit Spindler's forces and was unable to reach the Arnhem-Ede road of Leopard route. Instead Dobie decided to abandon his plan and help Frost at the bridge and the battalion headed south into Oosterbeek overnight. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion was largely unopposed, bypassing the defences that did not as yet reach down as far as the river. They were slowed by cheering Dutch civilians and did not reach the bridges until late in the day. The railway bridge was blown by German engineers as the Allies approached it and the pontoon bridge was missing its central section. At dusk, the men of A Company under Major Digby Tatham-Warter observed Gräbner's force cross the bridge. Most of the battalion and various other supporting units—including two jeeps of Gough's squadron, four 6-pounder anti-tank guns, Brigade HQ (but without Lathbury), and Royal Engineers (in total numbering about 740 men)— moved into Arnhem centre as night fell and owing to the oversight in German orders were able to secure the undefended northern end of the road bridge. Brigade HQ was being led by Brigade Major Tony Hibbert.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch {{after about}} three weeks and the young are {{attended}} by both parents. Males are present around the nest {{for most of the}} day, and females <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings {{as a result of the}} parents' inability to meet its greater nutritional needs. However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.|$|E

30|$|In general, people follow daily {{routines}} where they spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> at home, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hourly days {{at work in}} business days. This enables to infer these important locations in several ways, such as heuristics [22] or pattern recognition [23]. Given that we seek for interpretability in all stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipeline, we implemented the heuristics defined in [22]: home is the most frequent area with stays at night, and work is a frequent area with stays at work hours that is more distant than others. This procedure allows to add an additional label to each trip {{in a set of}} activities J_u: whether it is a commuting trip or not.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> season 9, Leonard and Penny marry, {{although not}} without some initial problems. They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying to sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other. After an aborted attempt for Leonard to move into Penny's apartment and live with his wife, Sheldon forces them to spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> a week in Leonard's old room. Although CBS now refers to the character with the married name Penny Hofstadter, {{it has not been}} explicitly indicated in series whether she took Leonard's surname. In season 10, Sheldon moves into Penny's old apartment with Amy allowing Penny and Leonard to live on their own as man and wife.|$|R
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} of our intra-night optical flux {{monitoring}} observations of S 5 0716 + 714 done simultaneously in gRI filters. The observations were done using Multicolor Imaging Telescopes for Survey and Monstrous Explosions (MITSuME) instrument on the 50 cm telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory over 30 nights between 11 March 2008 and 8 May 2008. Of these 30 nights, 22 nights have continuous (without any break) observations with duration ranging from 1 to 6 hours and hence were considered for intra-night optical variability (INOV). In total we have 4888 datapoints which were simultaneous in gR and I filters. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 22 <b>nights</b> considered for INOV, the object showed flux variability on 19 <b>nights</b> with <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> variability in <b>the</b> I-band ranging from ~ 4 % to ~ 55 %. The duty cycle for INOV was thus found to be 83 %. No time lag between different bands was noticed on <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights,</b> except for 3 <b>nights</b> where <b>the</b> variation in g was found to lead that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I band by 0. 3 to 1. 5 hrs. On inter-night timescales, no lag was found between g and I bands. On inter-night timescales as well as intra-night timescales on <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights,</b> <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> variability was found to increase toward shorter wavelengths. The flux variations in the different bands were not achromatic, with the blazar tending to become bluer when brighter both on inter-night and intra-night timescales; and this might {{be attributed to the}} larger amplitude variation at shorter wavelengths. A clear periodic variation of 3. 3 hrs was found on 1 April 2008 and a hint for another possible periodic variability of 4 hrs was found on 31 March 2008. During our 30 days of observations over a 2 month period the source has varied with an amplitude of variability as large as ~ 80 %. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures and 5 tables, Accepted in MNRA...|$|R

25|$|The first {{track was}} {{completed}} in 1835, and freight service began immediately. The solid granite roadbed proved to be much too rigid, jolting the engine and cars nearly to pieces.

The much poorer Boston and Worcester Railroad could not afford a granite bed and so was built with modern wooden ties. This turned out to be far superior, so the owners of the Boston and Lowell decided they would upgrade their entire roadbed to wood when they added a second track.|$|E
25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.|$|E
25|$|After the EEF {{victory at}} the Battle of Beersheba, the Beersheba to Gaza line was broken in {{consequence}} {{of a series of}} attacks, at Tel el Khuweilfe, Hareira and Sheria and Gaza. The Ottoman 7th Division, one of the retreating Ottoman Army units, established a defensive line on the northern side of the Wadi el Hesi which included Sausage Ridge. After the wadi was fairly quickly crossed late on 7 November, Sausage Ridge protecting the road and railway along which the retreating Ottoman columns were traveling, was attacked on 8 November by the EEF's 52nd (Lowland) Division. However, supported by an Ottoman cavalry attack on the British infantry's northern flank, the Ottoman rearguard strongly defended the ridge all day and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> until it was finally captured early on 9 November.
