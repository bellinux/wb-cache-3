40|$|<b>Category</b> <b>3,</b> Class C/D {{missions}} {{have the}} benefit of delivering worthwhile science at minimal cost which is increasingly important in NASA's constrained budget environment. Although higher cost Category 1 and 2 missions are necessary to achieve NASA's science objectives, <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> missions are shown to be an effective way to provide significant science return at a low cost. <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> missions, however, are often reviewed the same as the more risk averse Category 1 and 2 missions. Acknowledging that reviews are not the only aspect of a total engineering effort, reviews are still a significant concern for NASA programs. This can unnecessarily increase the cost and schedule of <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> missions. This paper quantifies the benefit and performance of <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> missions by looking at the cost vs. capability relative to Category 1 and 2 missions. Lessons learned from successful organizations that develop low cost <b>Category</b> <b>3,</b> Class C/D missions are also investigated to help provide the basis for suggestions to streamline the review of NASA <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> missions...|$|R

30|$|<b>Category</b> <b>3</b> {{particles}} {{are defined as}} having predominantly carbon signatures based on their chemical composition using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with energy dispersion spectrometer (EDS) at Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center (ESCuC) in JAXA. In contrast to the category 4 particles defined as man-made artifacts (aluminum flakes, quartz glass, and stainless steel) from the sample catcher or micromanipulator, the origins of <b>category</b> <b>3</b> {{particles are}} not clear. Currently, 58 particles have been classified into <b>category</b> <b>3</b> from the 459 particles categorized at ESCuC/JAXA (Uesugi et al. 2014). Apart from the dominant carbon (C), the <b>category</b> <b>3</b> particles often show small nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) peaks with trace amounts of fluorine and sulfur peaks by SEM/EDS.|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the other}} {{environmental}} practices found in <b>category</b> <b>3</b> could (or are) part of category 2 as well. However, when found in <b>category</b> <b>3,</b> the complexity increases. One example is the emission data, which can easily be a precondition set by shippers, but if part of <b>category</b> <b>3,</b> more specific work {{as to how the}} emissions are measured and reported is required. Thus, it is argued here that on a general level, the environmental practices that are included in <b>category</b> <b>3</b> are more complex and require more commitment from one or both parties of the LSP–shipper relationship than those in category 2. The environmental practices in category 2 are on the other hand one-sided, in that they are required by shippers but conducted solely by LSPs.|$|R
50|$|The best track {{intensity}} of Celeste largely varies between the HURDAT and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). The best track on HURDAT lists Celeste as strengthening in intensity from tropical storm to its Category 4 peak and then weakening to dissipation in a straightforward manner, skipping <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> intensity while strengthening. The CPHC track, however, varies {{in that it}} shows a weakening to Category 1 shortly after entering the basin, followed by reintensification into a <b>Category</b> <b>3.</b> Another {{difference is that the}} CPHC shows Celeste as having reached <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> a second time on August 18 after prior weakening, during which it reached its peak intensity. Finally, the CPHC best track gives a peak {{intensity of}} <b>Category</b> <b>3</b> rather than <b>Category</b> 4.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the negative predictive value (NPV) of ultrasound (US) elastography for non-palpable Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions on ultrasonography {{and to determine}} whether US elastography is helpful in {{reducing the number of}} BI-RADS <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions on ultrasonography. Methods: Two hundred seventy-six consecutive, non-palpable BI-RADS <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions in 256 women who underwent US elastography and US-guided core biopsy, and who had at least 12 months of follow-up data, comprised our study group. The BI-RADS final assessment category and elasticity score were prospectively and independently classified. The rate of malignancy and NPV according to the elasticity score were analysed. We also investigated whether there was a subset of BI-RADS <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions that were of benign histology but negative on elastography. Results: Of the 276 non-palpable BI-RADS <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions, three lesions (1. 0 %) were finally confirmed as ductal carcinomas in situ. No cancers were found in the remaining 273 lesions with benign biopsy histology at a mean follow-up of 39. 4 months (range, 12 to 72 months). The NPV of a negative elasticity score (elasticity score of 1) was 99. 3 % (165 of 166). If BI-RADS <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions showing a negative elasticity score were downgraded to BI-RADS category 2, 60. 4 % (165 of 273) of them with benign histology could have been safely followed without biopsy with an increased malignancy rate from 1 % (3 of 276) to 1. 8 % (2 of 110), which is not significantly higher (P= 0. 626). Conclusion: US elastography has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} BI-RADS <b>category</b> <b>3</b> lesions on ultrasonography...|$|R
