2500|$|Optional {{equipment}} on all passenger cars (except wagons) included metallic brake linings {{and a heavy}} duty suspension consisting of a front anti-roll bar, rear axle limit straps, revised spring rates and recalibrated shock absorbers. These provided a major handling improvement by reducing the potentially violent camber change of the rear wheels when making sharp turns at high speeds. [...] The Turbocharged Spyder equipment group featured a <b>multi-gauge</b> instrument cluster which included a tachometer, cylinder head temperature and intake manifold pressure gauges, Spyder fender script and Turbo logo deck emblems {{in addition to the}} high performance engine.|$|E
50|$|The Orchid Line is a <b>multi-gauge</b> {{miniature}} railway {{operating within}} the Curraghs Wildlife Park {{in the north}} of the Isle of Man and is operated by the Manx Model Engineering Society. It was established in 1992 and has expanded considerably since this time to cover {{a large part of the}} park's perimeter.|$|E
50|$|The EMD {{locomotive}} {{plant in}} McCook, Illinois maintained {{a small amount}} of <b>multi-gauge</b> track with up to seven parallel rails in the 1960s and 70s to support the wide variety of export locomotives they produced. This track did include a turnout splitting a standard gauge track off of the seven-rail track, requiring 8 frogs in a row.|$|E
5000|$|At gauges of [...] and less, {{the track}} is {{commonly}} raised above ground level. Flat cars are arranged with foot boards so that driver and passengers sit astride the track. The track is often <b>multi-gauged,</b> to accommodate , , and sometimes [...] gauge locomotives.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of {{artificial neural network}} models for simulating the hydrologic behaviour of catchments is presented in this paper. The main purpose is the modeling of river flow in a <b>multi-gauging</b> station catchment and real time prediction of peak flow downstream. The study area covers the Upper Derwent River catchment located in River Trent basin. The river flow has been predicted (at Whatstandwell gauging station) using upstream measured data. Three types of ANN were used for this application: Multi-layer perceptron, Recurrent and Time lag recurrent neural networks. Data with different lengths (1 month, 6 months and 3 years) have been used, and flow with 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours lead-time has been predicted. In general, although ANN shows a good capability to model river flow and predict downstream discharge by using only upstream flow data, however, the type of ANN {{as well as the}} characteristics of the training data was found as very important factors affecting the efficiency of the results...|$|R
50|$|Key {{features}} of BR are the coexistence of several gauges, broad gauge, metre gauge and dual gauge, and {{the separation of}} the system by the Jamuna River (Brahmaputra) into a Western and Eastern Zone of operations with only one bridge, the 2003 Jamuna Bridge, connecting the two zones. Bangladesh Railway covers a length of 2,855 route kilometres and as of 2009 employs 34,168 people. BR operates international, inter-city and suburban rail systems on its <b>multi-gauge</b> network. It also owns coach production facilities. In 2014 it carried 65.00 million passengers and 2.52 million tonnes of freight making 8,135 million passenger-kilometer and 677 million tonne-kilometer.|$|E
5000|$|The Curragh's {{wetlands}} were traditionally an {{area for}} growing hay for grazing including attempts in the 1930s to grow New Zealand flax. The area was purchased in 1963 by the Isle of Man Forestry, Lands and Mines Board and the Curraghs Wildlife Park of 211 Acres (85 ha) at Quarry Bends was opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Ronald Garvey on 23 July 1965. [...] The Curragh's Wildlife Park {{is now part}} of the Isle of Man Department of Community, Culture & Leisure and the park includes from 1992 The Orchid Line, a <b>multi-gauge</b> miniature railway of 1,750 feet in length operated by the Manx Model Engineering Society.|$|E
50|$|Mound House grew in {{importance}} with the Comstock silver strike and the famed Virginia and Truckee Railroad (V&T) {{passed through the}} community. It grew in population during the mining boom with a railroad station (1871) and post office (1877) {{as the center of}} the community. Upon construction of the narrow gauge Carson and Colorado Railway (C&C) in 1880, Mound House became an important <b>multi-gauge</b> transfer depot for both freight and passengers. The original community suffered the fate of many of the Comstock tied communities, population and commerce fading with the demise of the silver boom. Completion of the Hazen branch (1905) of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had purchased the C&C the previous year, allowed traffic bound for the transcontinental railroad to bypass the V&T entirely, and Mound House suffered as a result.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 Chevrolet {{introduced}} the Corvairs with few {{changes at the}} beginning of the year. The bottom line 500 series station wagon was dropped and the 700 became the base station wagon. The [...] "Lakewood" [...] name was dropped. The ever-popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line. In Spring of 1962 Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version, then offering a high performance [...] turbocharged [...] "Spyder" [...] option for Monza coupes and convertibles, making the Corvair the second production automobile supplied with a turbocharger as a factory option, with the Oldsmobile F-85 Turbo Jetfire having been released earlier in 1962. Corvair station wagons were discontinued at that point in favor the new Corvair Convertible and Chevy II (built at the same assembly plant). The slow selling Loadside pickup was discontinued at the end of the model year. The rest of the Corvair 95 line of Forward Control vehicles continued.Optional equipment on all passenger cars (except wagons) included metallic brake linings and a heavy duty suspension consisting of a front anti-roll bar, rear axle limit straps, revised spring rates and recalibrated shock absorbers.

5000|$|The TI Super's 1,570 cc {{engine was}} the same {{installed}} on the Giulia Sprint Speciale coupé—though bearing a different type code. It was fitted with two twin-choke horizontal Weber 45 DCOE 14 carburettors and, as on the Sprint Speciale, produced [...] or 129 SAE-rated PS at 6,500 rpm, pushing top speed to over 185 km/h.Dry weight was 910 kg compared to 1000 kg of the standard Giulia TI. Parts contributing to the weight reduction were mesh grilles replacing the inner pair of head lamps, bumpers without overriders, fixed front quarter windows, Plexiglas rear windows, and magnesium alloy wheels with hubcaps, very similar in appearance to the standard steel wheels of the TI. Braking was by discs all around, although the first cars used drums. Cars built from August 1964 used the bodyshell of the TI with mounting points for the brake servo, but were never fitted with one.On the inside both the gear shifter and the handbrake lever were moved to the floor. The TI's instrument cluster with its strip speedometer {{was replaced by a}} three-instrument binnacle comprising speedometer, tachometer and a <b>multi-gauge</b> instrument (fuel level, water temperature, oil temperature and oil pressure). The steering wheel was a three-spoke aluminium lightweight item with centre horn button. Front racing-type bucket seats and safety belts were standard, while the heater, door armrests, the grab handle in front of the passenger, the glove box lid, and ashtrays were deleted.Visually the Giulia TI Super was made immediately recognizable by green quadrifoglios (four-leaf clovers) on the front wings and tail panel, and [...] "Giulia TI Super" [...] scripts on the engine bonnet and tail. All cars produced were painted white, save for two examples—one red and one grey.|$|E

40|$|This memo {{estimates}} the frequency stability requirement {{imposed by the}} delays inherent in <b>multi-gauge</b> comparisons, emphasizing delays that are present {{even in the absence}} of cyclic averaging. Imagine a version of SIM that is perfectly stable mechanically, but that is measured by gauges based on a single laser whose wavelength l fluctuates. The gauges measure L 1 and L 2, the fixed "external" interferometric baseline and the adjustable "internal" path. Although the L's are constant in our hypothetical stable observatory, wavelength fluctuations Dl cause fluctuating gauge outputs DL 1; 2. The astrometrically relevant quantity is P...|$|E
40|$|This review covers {{results on}} the {{production}} of all possible electroweak boson pairs and 2 -to- 1 vector boson fusion at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV. The data were taken between 2010 and 2012. Limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGCs) then follow. In addition, data on electroweak triple gauge boson production and 2 -to- 2 vector boson scattering yield limits on anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings (aQGCs). The LHC hosts two general purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS, which have both reported limits on aTGCs and aQGCs which are herein summarized. The interpretation of these limits {{in terms of an}} effective field theory is reviewed, and recommendations are made for testing other types of new physics using <b>multi-gauge</b> boson production.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1) (aka G 221) models could provide us a 750 GeV scalar {{resonance}} that {{may account for the}} diphoton excess observed at the LHC while satisfying present collider constraints. The neutral component of the $SU(2) _R$ scalar multiplet can be identified as the 750 GeV scalar. In the lepto-phobic and fermio-phobic G 221 models the new charged gauge boson W' could be light, and we find that the diphoton decay width could be dominated by the loop contribution from the $W'$. To initiate gluon fusion production, it is necessary to extend the G 221 symmetry to the Pati-Salam and SO(10) symmetry. We investigate the possibilities that the light colored scalars or vectorlike fermions survive in the SO(10) theory and provide large gluon fusion rate for the diphoton signature. It is possible to test the G 221 interpretation by direct searches of W' using the <b>multi-gauge</b> boson production channel at the Run 2 LHC. Comment: 26 pages, 3 figures, 2 table...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Higgsless {{models with}} fermions whose SU(2) {{properties}} are “ideally delocalized,” {{such that the}} fermion’s probability distribution is appropriately related to the W boson wavefunction, {{have been shown to}} minimize deviations in precision electroweak parameters. As contributions to the S parameter vanish to leading order, current constraints on these models arise from limits on deviations in multi-gauge-boson vertices. We compute the form of the triple and quartic gauge boson vertices in these models and show that these constraints provide lower bounds only of order a few hundred GeV on the masses of the lightest KK resonances. Higgsless models with ideal fermion delocalization provide an example of extended electroweak gauge interactions with suppressed couplings of fermions to extra gauge-bosons, and these are the only models for which triple-gauge-vertex measurements provide meaningful constraints. We relate the <b>multi-gauge</b> couplings to parameters of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian, and the parameters obtained in these SU(2) × SU(2) models apply equally to the corresponding five dimensional gauge theory models of QCD. We also discuss the collider phenomenology of the KK resonances in models with ideal delocalization. These resonances are found to be fermiophobic, therefore traditional direct collider searches are not sensitive to them and measurements of gauge-boson scattering will be needed to find them...|$|E
