40|$|The author, Director of the Max Planck Institute for International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law in Munich {{considers}} {{the influence of}} full uniformization of the EEC market after 1992 on the protection of industrial property and on free flow of goods within the Community. He pays {{much attention to the}} relations between the internal legal systems regulating the protection of patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights to the law of the Community. Both in the present {{as well as in the}} past — 1992 prospective regulation of the EEC law a departure from the protection granted by internal (national) legal systems seems not only undesirable but also impossible. Much time is needed for common European protection laws to supersede the coexisting protection provided by internal systems. The analysis of particular industrial property rights allows the author to formulate the conclusion that the greatest progress in that respect has been achieved in the EEC patent law; European patents granted on the strength of the <b>Munich</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1973 are much in demand. It should be stressed that the creation by the end of 1992 of uniform internal EEC market is a strong incentive for intensifying the works on the uniformization of industrial property protection. The author also analyses the decisions of the EEC Court with respect to the law on industrial property and free flow of goods on the EEC market, paying special attention to decisions based on Art. 36 of the Treaty of Rome. As to the relation between the principle of free flow of goods and the restrictions resulting from internal systems of industrial property law hitherto existing decisions of the EEC Court will fully remain in force also after 1992. The Court adopted a principle, well known in German law since long, of exhaustion of a right to trademark. This principle allows neither to divide the Common Market by means of national trademarks nor to isolate it from goods produced or reimported from the outside of the Common Market as long as such goods have been provided with a trademark by an authorized person. Circulation restrictions are to maintain arificially high prices for trademarked goods. Towards the end of his article the author points out that there is a danger of changing that situation once the European trademark law comes into force. Recently, under the pressure of industrial lobbies, views have been expressed that this law should regulate only the institution of „European" and not „exterritorial" exhaustion of a right. Such a short-sighted and economically unjustified regulation could lead to the protectionistic isolation of the Community from the rest of the world. The author is strongly for retaining the conception of exterritorial exhaustion of a right to a trademark...|$|E

40|$|Title: Patentability of biotechnological inventions under European Patent Convention The {{topic of}} thesis is the {{patentability}} of biotechnological inventions under the European Patent <b>Convention</b> (<b>Munich,</b> 1973) (hereinafter the "EPC") with {{special emphasis on}} decision making practices of the European Patent Office. At the beginning, the author deals with general patent law, in particular with fundamental substantive conditions of patentability of inventions, both positive and negative. A brief explanation is then devoted {{to the definition of}} biotechnological science and biotechnological invention. In the subsequent part of the thesis, the author discusses the sources of patent law in general and in relation to biotechnological inventions. The chapter is divided into three parts - international, European and national sources. Discussion regarding European sources is split into two subsections dealing with EPC and EU law. The author examines in particular the complicated legislative procedure for the adoption of the Directive 98 / 44 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 6 th July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions and its impact on European patent law. National sources address primarily imperfect transposition of Directive 98 / 44 /EC into the Czech law. The next chapter is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In 1826 {{audiences in}} Vienna were entertained by {{the premiere of}} native-son Ferdinand Raimund's Der Bauer als Milliondr (The Millionaire Farmer). Raimund, a playwright, director, and actor (who played the title role in the {{original}} performance), enjoyed relative success during his lifetime, both in his native Austria and what is today Germany. Deeply immersed {{in the world of}} Romanticism, Raimund's works are grand in scale yet simple in essence. They feature extravagant spectacle, merry music, and all the magic, fairies, and ghosts one could possibly ever wish for. In 2004 I came across Der Bauer als Milliondr during a German language study-abroad program in <b>Munich.</b> While many <b>conventions</b> of Raimund's original are no longer as effective as they were in his time, I discovered that the humor and heart of the piece have retained their appeal. I could easily imagine modern American audiences enjoying it as much as I did. That's when the idea struck me. I had been looking for a project I could undertake for my Honors Thesis requirement, and was hoping to find something that would well fit the second German study-abroad program I was going to be participating in during the following school year. After conducting some informal research and finding that no English-language version of this play had ever been produced, I knew what I would do. By translating and adapting Raimund's original work I had not only discovered a way to combine the skills and experiences I have developed through my two majors-German and Theatre, but also to introduce an entirely new audience to a classic and truly entertaining play. While I have made some changes, I have striven to always remain true to the spirit of the original. I hope that through my efforts many people who otherwise would never have heard of Ferdinand Raimund's Der Bauer als Milliondr will come to be enchanted by The Millionaire Fanner.
