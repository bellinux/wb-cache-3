50|$|As {{stated above}} <b>market</b> <b>definition</b> {{is arguably the}} most {{important}} part of any competition case brought under Article 102. However, it is also one of the most complex areas. If the market is defined too widely then it will contain more firms and substitutable products making a finding of a dominant position for one firm unlikely. Likewise if it is defined too narrowly then there will be a presumption that the defendant company will be found to be dominant. In practice, <b>market</b> <b>definition</b> will be left to economists, rather than lawyers to decide.|$|E

50|$|In early cases, it {{was easier}} for plaintiffs to show market relationship, or dominance, by {{tailoring}} <b>market</b> <b>definition,</b> even if it ignored fundamental principles of economics. In U.S. v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. 563 (1966), the trial judge, Charles Wyzanski, composed the market only of alarm companies with services in every state, tailoring out any local competitors; the defendant stood alone in this market, but had the court added up the entire national market, it would have had a much smaller share of the national market for alarm services that the court purportedly used. The appellate courts affirmed this finding; however, today, an appellate court would likely find this definition to be flawed. Modern courts use a more sophisticated <b>market</b> <b>definition</b> that does not permit as manipulative a definition.|$|E
