50|$|It is {{considered}} a tropical hardwood with a clear, cylindrical bole to 80 ft. It can grow to heights of 180 ft with typical trunk diameters ranging from 36 to 48 in. Anigre has a medium texture with closed pores similar to maple. Growth rings arenâ€™t always well-defined, and the wood can be rather plain-looking; though certain figure is occasionally present, such as curly or <b>mottled</b> <b>grain.</b> The sapwood and the heartwood are not usually distinguishable. The heartwood is a light yellowish-brown, sometimes with a pinkish hue. Color tends to darken with age. The quarter figured veneer has become a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, and decorative architectural applications. It {{is said to have}} a faint odor similar to Cedar. In its untreated form Anigre is susceptible to termite and fungi attacks and generally has low durability. Anigre is usually considered easy to work with hand and power tools, although depending on the origin of the wood it can have a high silica content which can dull wood working tools quickly.|$|E
40|$|Sucrose is the {{dominant}} accumulated carbohydrate in the wheat plant until approximately 4 weeks before harvesting, when starch takes this position. Starch is {{the dominant}} carbohydrate in the grain. Total reducing sugars are never accumulated in large amounts in any portion of the plant. The mature <b>mottled</b> <b>grain</b> contains signifi cantly more starch and less protein than the unmottled. The developing grain from an area known to produce mottled wheat is always higher in starch and lower in protein when compared with grain from an unmottled area. Irrespective of variety and whether the grain is mottled or not, starch extracted from the mature grain contains 22. 4 per cent, amylose, and {{there appear to be}} no major differences between the starches extracted from the respective grains. It is probable that while the ratio of amylose to amylopectin is set by heredity, the molecular size of these components varies as starch is laid down in the developing grain...|$|E
40|$|The olivine {{crystals}} of the 77005 achondrite are brown {{except for}} colorless shock lamellae, <b>mottled</b> patches, and <b>grains</b> adjacent to pools of impact melt. Sporadic dark alteration patches in brown olivine and Cr-rich spinel gave the following average electron-microprobe analyses: (olivine) P 2 O 5 0. 9, SiO 2 57. 9, TiO 2 0, Al 2 O 3 0. 7, Cr 2 O 3 0. 4, V 2 O 3 0, Fe 2 O 3 (assumed oxidation state) 17. 0, MgO 1. 6, CaO 0. 2, Na 2 O 0, K 2 O 1. 8, SO 3 (assumed oxidation state) 9. 2, Cl 0. 1, sum 89. 8 wt pct; (spinel) P 2 O 5 3. 5, SiO 2 2. 1, TiO 2 2. 2, Al 2 O 3 2. 1, Cr 2 O 3 13. 4, V 2 O 3 0. 8, Fe 2 O 3 40. 7, MgO 0. 9, CaO 0. 1, Na 2 O 0, K 2 O 2. 0, SO 3 11. 1, Cl 0. 1, sum 79. 0 wt pct. Ion-microprobe analyses revealed H in both. Rare orange patches in brown olivine from another area gave SiO 2 33 - 35, FeO 30 - 28, MgO 28 - 32, sum 93 wt pct. Thermal metamorphism under dry oxidizing conditions is discussed {{as a possible}} alternative to shock-induced oxidation for generation of the brown olivine (McSween and Stoeffler, 1980). Because alteration patches transgress shock lamellae, and because sulfatic alteration occurs in fusion crusts of Antarctic meteorites (Gibson et al., 1983), alteration of the 77005 achondrite at the Antarctic surface is preferred to a complex series of processes needed for preterrestrial alteration...|$|R
40|$|Pedogenic calcrete {{profiles}} from temperate, semi-arid and arid {{regions of}} southern Australia show {{a diversity of}} forms, both in large-scale structure and texture determined in the field, and microstructures as determined by thin-section and scanning electron microscopy. Accumulations of microcrystalline calcite {{with varying degrees of}} cementation are typical of the majority of samples regardless of texture or form. Calcified filaments are prevalent at a micro-scale in the upper sections of most profiles, occurring as laminated coatings and channel infillings in hardpan calcrete, pisoliths and nodules. Organic matter occurring as filamentous and dendritic masses is commonly found associated with the calcified filaments and the formation and growth of the filaments are considered to cause the brecciated and pisolitic textures common in mature pedogenic calcrete. Rhizogenic calcrete occurs in various host materials as taproot fragments with either dense grey micritic cement and microspar crystals which are larger adjacent to enclosed quartz <b>grains,</b> <b>mottled</b> dense micritic and microsparitic calcrete or alveolarlike fabrics. Root-formed channels are also prevalent in many indurated nodular and hardpan samples. Discrete and incipient calcrete nodules containing alveolar fabrics and microcodium grains and platy pedogenic calcrete containing fenestral microfabric were also observed. Needle-fibre calcite is present as the dominant component in some profiles, occurring as discontinuous semi-indurated channel fillings and sheets. The morphology of their occurrence suggests rhizogenic influence in their formation. The collected samples are analysed for stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition in order to determine if there are detectable differences across regions of different climate and host material. Many samples show within-sample variability with biogenic or rhizogenic features co-existing with micritic overgrowths and cements. In order {{to examine the relationship between}} pedogenic calcrete type and method of formation, carbon and oxygen isotopic measurements were taken from numerous sub samples within each sample to determine the extent of variation in isotopic composition within individual samples. The total spread of values is - 1. 0 to - 12. 5 % and 2. 0 to - 10 % (standard delta notation versus PDB) for carbon and oxygen isotopic composition, respectively, for all samples with large sample variation and positive covariation as displayed by multiple sample aliquots commonly observed. The results suggest within-sample variation caused by different and coexisting cement types, with contribution of heavy carbon by calcified filaments and carbonate precipitated through carbon dioxide degassing, and light carbon contributed by rhizogenic influences. The positive co-variation in carbon and oxygen is not depth related and indicates a simple mixing line between two end-members with differing isotopic compositions, possibly due to concomitant evaporative enrichment and carbon dioxide degassing in different carbonate cement phases. Soil organic matter carbon analysed for isotopic composition shows relative little variation across the climatic zones and no correlation with coexisting carbonate carbon isotopic composition. Selected pedogenic calcrete samples developed in soils overlying radiogenic basement rocks from sites in arid and semi-arid western South Australia and Western Australia are analysed for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in order to evaluate the contribution of calcium derived from silicate weathering to pedogenic calcrete. Fresh parent materials collected at the sites show 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios ranging from 0. 7100 to 0. 7993 and pedogenic calcrete 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios ranging from 0. 7106 to 0. 7198. Samples from sites in coastal and inland South Australia have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios close to marine values (0. 8093) indicating low calcium contribution from bedrock. Samples fromWestern Australia have variable and higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios indicating considerable calcium input for parent material and bedrock. Whole rock pedogenic calcrete and host material sampled in profiles were analysed by X-ray diffraction to determine mineralogical composition and then determine relative changes in carbonate composition within the profile. Samples were further analysed by instrumental neutron activation analysis for a suite of major and trace elements and subjected to a variety of statistical tests to determine the phase relationships of the elements to each other and, in particular, calcium within the pedogenic calcrete profile. Most elements are found to be associated with residual phases such as clay, feldspar and iron oxide correlation to calcium, in some samples, and therefore are of possible interest in geochemical exploration as pathfinder elements in the search for buried ore deposits...|$|R
