5|$|Ellen {{attempts}} to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws {{her around the}} cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce's mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. A large amount of blood is expended by Bruce, who lies motionless for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce's body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.|$|E
500|$|On October 9, {{the day of}} Poe's burial, an {{obituary}} {{appeared in}} the [...] "New York Tribune". Signed only [...] "Ludwig", the obituary floridly alternated between praising the dead author's abilities and eloquence and damning his temperament and ambition. [...] "Ludwig" [...] said that [...] "literary art lost {{one of its most}} brilliant, but erratic stars" [...] but also claimed Poe was known for walking the streets in delirium, <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself and claimed Poe was excessively arrogant, that he assumed all men were villains, and that he was quick to anger. [...] "Ludwig" [...] was later revealed to be Rufus Wilmot Griswold, a former colleague and acquaintance of Poe. Even while Poe was still alive, Griswold had engaged in character assassination. Much of his characterization in the obituary was lifted almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in The Caxtons by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The Ludwig obituary quickly became the standard characterization of Poe.|$|E
500|$|Kelpies {{have the}} ability to {{transform}} themselves into non-equine forms, and can take on the outward appearance of human figures, in which guise they may betray themselves by the presence of water weeds in their hair. In their human form, kelpies are almost invariably male. One of the few stories describing the creature in female form is set at Conon House in Ross and Cromarty. It tells of a [...] "tall woman dressed in green", with a [...] "withered, meagre countenance, ever distorted by a malignant scowl", who overpowered and drowned a man and a boy after she jumped out of a stream. Gregor described a kelpie adopting the guise of a wizened old man continually <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself while sitting on a bridge stitching a pair of trousers. Believing it to be a kelpie, a passing local struck it on the head, causing it to revert to its equine form and scamper back to its lair in a nearby pond. Other accounts describe the kelpie when appearing in human form as a [...] "rough, shaggy man who leaps behind a solitary rider, gripping and crushing him", or as tearing apart and devouring humans.|$|E

500|$|Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, {{authors of}} What Made Thunderbirds Go! The Authorised Biography of Gerry Anderson (2002), {{register}} a divergence from earlier Supermarionation productions that stems from The Secret Service being less [...] "American-orientated" [...] and comprising fewer action sequences. They consider it the [...] "most eccentric" [...] {{of all the}} Supermarionation series up to 1969, and the fusion of puppets and live actors the [...] "natural conclusion" [...] to the filming technique. The writers bestow particular praise on the characterisation of Mrs Appleby, whose ignorance of Unwin and Harding's involvement with British Intelligence adds to the comedy: for example, when Father Unwin speaks into his communications device that is disguised as a hearing aid, the housekeeper thinks that the apparently senile vicar is <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself. The episodes [...] "A Question of Miracles", in which the miniaturised Matthew is dwarfed by articles of food and drink from a picnic basket, and [...] "Last Train to Bufflers Halt", whose plot concerns an unstoppable runaway train, are also well received. Stephen La Rivière, author of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, favours [...] "More Haste Less Speed": describing the series finale as [...] "wonderfully quirky" [...] and [...] "glorious", he sees the counterfeiting plot as being reminiscent of the [...] "gentler, earlier days of Supercar", also praising Keith Alexander for his voice acting of {{the part of the}} elderly Lady Hazlewell.|$|E
500|$|As {{she arrived}} at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd {{gathered}} outside the building. [...] Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men [...] "to the prisoner Wells's house" [...] at about 4am on the morning of 2January. [...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] {{video game}} by Surreal Software, also {{based only on}} the book, Gollum appears in a cutscene when the Fellowship of the Ring is within Moria, and is shown half hidden behind debris <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself. He also appears during the final level at Amon Hen; when the user is playing as Aragorn, Gollum appears on a cliff edge <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself and walks away, and then does the same on another cliff edge. Then the player heads to a small island and a cutscene can be shown with a {{conversation}} between Aragorn and Gollum, in which Gollum throws a fish at him; it becomes his weapon for the final mission, {{as well as the}} most powerful weapon in the game.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{the oldest}} of the Five Families, with roots going back to the Morello crime family. The current [...] "family" [...] was founded by Charles [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano, and was known as the [...] "Luciano crime family" [...] from 1931 to 1957, when it was renamed after boss Vito Genovese. Originally in control of the {{waterfront}} on the West Side of Manhattan and the Fulton Fish Market, the family was run for years by [...] "the Oddfather", Vincent [...] "the Chin" [...] Gigante, who feigned insanity by shuffling unshaven through New York's Greenwich Village wearing a tattered bath robe and <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself incoherently.|$|E
2500|$|After Stalin's {{death from}} {{pulmonary}} edema {{brought on by}} the stroke, Beria's ambitions sprang into full force. In the uneasy silence following the cessation of Stalin's last agonies, Beria was the first to dart forward to kiss his lifeless form (a move likened by Sebag-Montefiore to [...] "wrenching a dead King's ring off his finger"). While the rest of Stalin's inner circle (even Molotov, saved from certain liquidation) stood sobbing unashamedly over the body, Beria reportedly appeared [...] "radiant", [...] "regenerated", and [...] "glistening with ill-concealed relish." [...] When Beria left the room, he broke the somber atmosphere by shouting loudly for his driver, his voice echoing with what Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva called [...] "the ring of triumph unconcealed." [...] Alliluyeva noticed how the Politburo seemed openly frightened of Beria and unnerved by his bold display of ambition. [...] "He's off to take power," [...] Mikoyan recalled <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> Khrushchev. That prompted a [...] "frantic" [...] dash for their own limousines to intercept him at the Kremlin.|$|E
2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 {{as if to make}} amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm going to get this single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't know who it is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket." [...] The operative words in that famous lamentation are, [...] "Ah don't know who it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Australian theatre {{and opera}} {{director}} Barrie Kosky is renowned for {{his use of}} camp in interpreting {{the works of the}} Western canon including Shakespeare, Wagner, Molière, Seneca, Kafka and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company The Lost Echo, based on Ovid's Metamorphoses and Euripides' The Bacchae. In the first act ("The Song of Phaeton"), for instance, the goddess Juno {{takes the form of a}} highly stylized Marlene Dietrich, and the musical arrangements feature Noël Coward and Cole Porter. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban middle class, which is suggestive of the style of Dame Edna Everage. For example, in The Lost Echo Kosky employs a chorus of high school girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> herself in a broad Australian accent, [...] "Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on Australian Idol." [...] See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular [...] "Strictly Ballroom".|$|E
2500|$|Annie {{finally gets}} her {{inheritance}} when she records Jeremy calling Marla a bitch. Liam {{gets into a}} motorcycle accident while trying to find Annie. A blonde woman named Vanessa, who hits Liam with her car, calls 911 and says {{that it was a}} [...] "hit and run". When the winter premiere begins, Liam has been hanging out with Vanessa as she has been trying to transform Liam into a star by managing his career. Annie and Dixon return from Paris after spending Annie's new-found wealth. Silver finds out {{by the end of the}} episode that her boyfriend's adopted daughter might be Adrianna's. Dixon has a mild stroke and is taken to the hospital. The doctor inform him that he need to avoid stress, but he's been under the pressure of hiding his newfound success with his music career without Adrianna. Liam consoles Silver, who learns that she may have the cancer gene that caused her mother's death two years ago. Upon being discharged from the hospital, Dixon notices Ivy's husband Raj has been admitted to the same hospital and learns that Raj's cancer has returned and he's dying. However, Raj tells Dixon not to tell Ivy, but Dixon disobeys his wishes and breaks the bad news to Ivy. Ivy visits the hospital, and along with the support of her friends, makes amends with Raj. As she returns to Raj's room, she learns that he has passed on and died in his sleep. Naomi's sister Jen makes an unexpected visit, and her arrival sparks yet another falling out between the two sisters. This time, the sisters fight over the affections of Preston [...] "P.J." [...] Hillingsbrook, a playboy with a lot of cash to blow as the heir to his family's fortune. When he reveals that it was Naomi that he was originally infatuated with, Jen does another disappearing act and returns to Paris, but not before revealing to Naomi that P.J. was involved in a scandal. At Raj's funeral, the record company calls Dixon's phone, which Adrianna had in her possession, and she finds out that they've signed him but not her. Navid comes back for the funeral, and the gang pays their final respects to Raj at the beach. Meanwhile, Liam and Vanessa break up over her attitude towards Silver. She then steals all the money from the bar. Silver learns that she is positive for the cancer gene and cries on Liam's shoulder. The two kiss and sleep together. Ivy is seen late at night at the beach with her surf board. Caleb who is at the beach warns her about the danger of surfing in the rough waves but Ivy heads on <b>muttering</b> <b>to</b> herself [...] "Nothing lasts forever right" [...] and runs into the water.|$|E
