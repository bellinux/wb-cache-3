25|$|Mack {{noted that}} there was a {{worldwide}} history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.|$|E

25|$|Lighting control tools <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> {{described}} as anything {{that changes the}} quality of the light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state dimmers are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of dimmers or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play back stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia is best {{thought of}} as a {{collection}} of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).|$|E

25|$|One non-trivial {{example is}} the fractal {{dimension}} of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but {{it is by no}} means a rectifiable curve: the length of the curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1885 tension {{had been}} growing between Britain and Russia because of the Penjdeh {{incident}} in Afghanistan. This raised considerable concern in Australia of possible Russian raids on shipping, {{which could not be}} prevented by the small Australian squadron. The effect was to concentrate minds on the formation of a larger squadron financed by the colonies. Following orders from the Admiralty, Tryon argued the case that defence <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> achieved by a single strong squadron free to move around the whole area, rather than smaller squadrons paid for and attached to individual colonies. That local land forces could be provided to defend individual ports against raids, but that the best way of providing trained and up to date crews and ships for a naval force was to give the task to the Royal Navy rather than forming local ones. Colonies differed in their views on what was best, in particular New Zealand was concerned that part of the force ought permanently to be based at Auckland because of its distance from most of the others. Tryon proposed that a system of indemnity should be introduced, so that anyone whose property was destroyed resisting an attack would be compensated by the colonies as a whole, accepting that local resistance wherever it might occur was to the benefit of all. After the Russian scare had subsided, Tryon continued to assist with the development of land fortifications for major towns, emphasising the importance of preparedness in advance of any military situation arising, and of giving the impression of a united defence even if this had not in reality been entirely achieved.|$|E

She sent Warne [...] "several colour illustrations, along {{with a copy of}} her privately printed edition" [...] which Warne then handed to their eminent children's book illustrator L.

2500|$|As has {{recently}} been argued by Michael McKeon, Swift <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> described as a severe sceptic, rather than a Whig, Tory, empiricist, or religious writer. He supported the Classics in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and he supported the established church and the aristocracy, because he felt the alternatives were worse. He argued elsewhere {{that there is nothing}} inherently virtuous about a noble birth, but its advantages of wealth and education made the aristocrat a better ruler than the equally virtuous but unprivileged commoner.

The fact that ERISA had failed to prevent the harm, however, {{and the fact that it}} was ruled by the Supreme Court that neither CIGNA nor Aetna could owe monetary damages for their contribution to the harm done, shows that there is a need for change, either in ERISA itself by Congress or by Supreme Court common law.|$|E

While the killing of this number of whales in two days seems unlikely, historian Kjell-Olav Masdalen suggests that, rather than whales, Ohthere intended the number killed to refer to walrus; Janet Bately suggests that it <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> seen {{as an indication of}} how many whales could be caught in good conditions. Ropes of whale skin were of sufficient value {{to be included in the}} tax paid to Ohthere by the Sami, and Ohthere said that walrus had [...] "very noble bones in their teeth", some of which he brought to King Alfred.|$|E
2500|$|The Report by Andrew C. Kuchins in November 2007 said: [...] "Russia {{today is}} a hybrid regime that <b>might</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> termed “illiberal internationalism,” {{although}} neither word is fully accurate and requires considerable qualification. From being a weakly institutionalized, fragile, {{and in many ways}} distorted proto-democracy in the 1990s, Russia under Vladimir Putin has moved back {{in the direction of a}} highly centralized authoritarianism, which has characterized the state for most of its 1,000-year history. But it is an authoritarian state where the consent of the governed is essential. Given the experience of the 1990s and the Kremlin’s propaganda emphasizing this period as one of chaos, economic collapse, and international humiliation, the Russian people have no great enthusiasm for democracy and remain politically apathetic in light of the extraordinary economic recovery and improvement in lifestyles for so many over the last eight years. The emergent, highly centralized government, combined with a weak and submissive society, is the hallmark of traditional Russian paternalism." ...|$|E
2500|$|After dawn on 27 March {{the first}} Ottoman counterattacks recaptured Ali Muntar and {{a portion of}} Green Hill, but the 1/7th Battalion of the Essex Regiment, (161st Brigade, 54th Division), retook the {{positions}} before consolidating and re-establishing their posts. Meanwhile the Ottoman force, which had attacked the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, appeared on Sheikh Abbas and shelled the rear of Dallas' position, [...] "including his reserves, medical units and transport camels," [...] but made no serious attack on the 54th (East Anglian) Division holding Burjabye Ridge. The hostile artillery batteries at Sheikh Abbas targeted all the tracks across the Wadi Ghuzzeh, employed by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, {{who were at the}} time attempting to supply food, water and ammunition, to the forward units. At 08:00 the 53rd (Welsh) Division came under orders of Eastern Force, and Dobell received an appreciation from Dallas at 09:15. This stated that if the present positions of the 53rd (Welsh) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions were to be maintained, the German and Ottoman occupation of Sheikh Abbas must be ended. This was confirmed by G. P. Dawnay, Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS), Eastern Force.

He began the reading series [...] "Poetry Unbound" [...] in 2013 with Richard Loranger and Harold Adler at Art House Gallery and Cultural Center in Berkeley, which continues today. In 1993 Matson established a small, eight-page quarterly journal, The Scribbler, edited by workshop participants, a role since taken over by Kayla Sussell.
