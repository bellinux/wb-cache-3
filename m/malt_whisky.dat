5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of <b>malt</b> <b>whisky,</b> a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

25|$|Most new-make <b>malt</b> <b>whisky</b> is diluted {{to about}} 60% alcohol by volume (ABV) {{or so before}} it is placed in casks to mature (62.5% is {{specified}} as a maximum in U.S. law for making straight whisky). The aged spirit is then diluted with water to reduce it to bottling strength (typically 40-50% ABV). Since large amounts of water are used {{during the process of}} whisky production, water supplies are a key factor for the location of any distillery.|$|E

25|$|Single <b>malt</b> <b>whisky</b> is whisky from {{a single}} {{distillery}} made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whisky is described as single-cask, it contains whisky from many casks, and different years, so the blender can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear {{the name of the}} distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments such as maturation in a port wine cask.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined {{a design}} {{originally}} created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much {{more efficiently than}} the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the <b>malt</b> <b>whisky</b> with the grain whisky distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market.|$|E
25|$|When the casks used to age Pedro Ximenez Sherry are retired, {{they are}} often sent to Scotland and Ireland, where {{they are used to}} age fine whisky. Single <b>malt</b> <b>whisky</b> aged in sherry casks is {{regarded}} by some as a special category with its own aficionados. The sweet Pedro Ximenez wine infused in the wood of the casks imparts some of the flavor and aroma of the wine to the whisky during the ageing process. In the whisky industry the taste of the Pedro Ximenez is very sweet. Most of the whiskies are just finished after maturation in other casks. The Pedro Ximenez sweetness is often combined with a smoky peat flavor.|$|E
