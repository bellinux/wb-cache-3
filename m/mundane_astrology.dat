2500|$|Ulla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book Mesopotamian Astrology, {{argues that}} this ambivalence between a theistic and {{mechanic}} worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its {{heavy reliance on}} magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment {{with the purpose of}} revenge, and so “shares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations”. [...] Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology,</b> being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare {{of the state and the}} king as the governing head of the nation. [...] <b>Mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology. It was only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of natal astrology.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mundane</b> <b>Astrology</b> (also {{known as}} {{political}} astrology) is {{the application of}} astrology to world affairs and world events, taking {{its name from the}} Roman word Mundus, meaning [...] "the World". <b>Mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> is a branch of Judicial astrology and is widely believed by astrological historians to be the most ancient branch of astrology. Many modern and ancient mundane astrologers also believe correlations exist between geological phenomena (such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc.) and astronomical phenomena (the movement of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth).|$|E
5000|$|Horā (Sanskrit होरा, [...] "hour", {{from the}} word ahorātra [...] ) is {{a branch of the}} {{traditional}} Indian system of astrology known as [...] It deals with the finer points of predictive methods, as distinct from Siddhānta (astronomy proper) and [...] (<b>mundane</b> <b>astrology).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> also figures {{prominently}} in Thai culture, so modern Thai birth certificates include lunar calendar dates {{and the appropriate}} Thai Zodiacal animal year-name for Thai Hora (โหราศาสตร์, [...] ). The Thai Zodiac {{is similar to the}} Chinese, though the Dragon is replaced by the Naga or large snake (งูใหญ่), and in Northern Thailand the Pig is occasionally replaced with an Elephant.|$|E
50|$|Luca Gaurico (in Latin, Lucas Gauricus) (Giffoni March 12, 1475 - March 6, 1558 in Rome) was an Italian astrologer, astronomer, astrological data {{collector}} and mathematician. He {{was born to}} a poor family in the Kingdom of Naples, and studied judicial astrology, a subject he defended in his Oratio de Inventoribus et Astrologiae Laudibus (1508). Judicial astrology concerned the fate of man (astrologia judiciaria; <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology)</b> as influenced by the stars. His most famous work is the Tractatus Astrologicus.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} the LAP, first {{advanced}} in 1998, proposes that the horoscopeplanet that receives the fewest astrological aspects is thekeynote or {{focal point of the}} birth chart. In the analysis ofplanetary lines in astrocartography, the rising, setting, Imum coeli, and midheaven lines of the LAP represent geographic areasof greatest potential for the native. The theory was initiallydeveloped by analyzing accurately recorded horoscopes of historicalpersonalities, and it has also been successfully applied, in <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology,</b> to the study of historical events.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> figures {{prominently}} in Thai culture, so modern Thai birth certificates include lunar calendar dates, {{and the appropriate}} Chinese calendar zodiacal animal year-name for both Thai Hora ( [...] , ho-ra-sat) and Chinese astrology. Thai birth certificates record the date, month and time of birth, followed by {{the day of the}} week, lunar date, and the applicable zodiac animal name. Thai traditionally reckon age by the 12-year animal-cycle names, with the twelfth and sixtieth anniversaries being of special significance; but the official calendar determines age at law.|$|E
50|$|One {{particular}} {{example of}} a Cross, which was not a Grand Cross, came {{during the summer of}} 2010 (July 10), when Pluto (in Capricorn), Uranus and Jupiter (in Aries) and the Moon (in Gemini moving into Cancer) were at 0-3° Capricorn, Aries and Cancer, respectively, with Saturn being out of mode at 29 Virgo. This was assumed by astrologers studying <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> {{that it would be a}} time with many great challenges and dramatic changes. As the Moon moved out of orb, this Cross quickly (within a day) became a T-Square. This aspect resembled a T-Square that occurred during the 1930s.|$|E

5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1940s Palamidessi, as mentioned, {{began to}} teach astrology and yoga. He {{became one of the first}} Italian Astrological authors of the 1900s. In the {{catalogue}} of the National Library Service only six treatise of astrology written by Italian authors appear from 1900 to 1939. For the most these are general introductions and often mixed with chiromancy, physiognomy and occultism. In these years Tommaso Palamidessi wrote six astrological treatise: The Course of Stars and Man's Diseases; Medicine and Sidereal Influences; <b>Mundane</b> <b>Astrology</b> (1941); Cosmic Influences and the Precocious Diagnosis of Cancer (1943) Earthquakes, Eruptions and Cosmic influences (1943) and not forgetting the Perpetual Effemerides (1941) ...|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages {{natural astrology}} was mainly {{focused on the}} {{diagnosis}} and the treatment of medical patients. For more information on this, see the article on medical astrology. An additional use {{would have been the}} application of astrology to determine future weather patterns based on the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic rationale that the planets cause change in the sublunary world by producing an efflux of elements and qualities. Every other branch was lumped together into the heading of 'judicial astrology'. These included natal astrology, <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology,</b> horary astrology, and electional astrology. Judicial astrology is an obsolete category, because since the Middle Ages other sciences have arisen, astrology has ceased to be a tool in medicine and meteorology, and scientifically demonstrable parts of natural astrology such as the moon's effect on tides are considered to be physics not astrology.|$|E
5000|$|The gods {{were also}} {{believed}} to present {{themselves in the}} celestial images of the planets or stars with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented. [...] Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god’s expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king Esarhaddon concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must {{have some kind of}} correlate within the natural world: ... In {{the beginning of the year}} a flood will come and break the dikes. When the Moon has made the eclipse, the king, my lord, should write to me. As a substitute for the king, I will cut through a dike, here in Babylonia, in the middle of the night. No one will know about it. Ulla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book Mesopotamian Astrology, argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so “shares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations”. [...] Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology,</b> being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation. [...] <b>Mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology. It was only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of natal astrology.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to verify}} a proposed {{link between the}} worldwide outbreak of wars since 1700 and the Cyclic Index of Barbault. To make a clearer distinction this has been supplemented by two sub-indexes. The three indexes created in this way are respectively called the Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter wave; {{each has its own}} rhythm, unique to the respective planets after which they are named. A chart of 61 great wars is presented, complete with phase notes for each of these three waves. The result is the ‘Catastrophe Effect ’ i. e. the worse the war, the stronger the link with all three waves. The great wars between 1500 and 1700 have also been included as supplement to this research. Subsequently the Catastrophe Effect is once again illustrated by means of examples from history, commencing {{with the collapse of the}} Assyrian Empire. In conclusion, the material is further examined through a test proposed by Professor Suitbert Ertel. Also the relation of <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> to historicism is discussed...|$|E
40|$|As a {{follow-up}} to my previous studies in astrological representations in the XV-XVI century art of Veneto, I will {{shed light on the}} fil rouge connecting different experiences like the planning of astrological frescoes in Montagnana by Galeottus Martius, the collaboration between Giovan Battista Abioso and Giorgione in the painting of the famous Castelfranco Frieze and the visual prognostication of Giulio Campagnola"s Astrologer, namely the artistic representation of highly complex astral theories applied to world history. This commitment to <b>mundane</b> <b>astrology</b> mixed with prophetic and apocalyptic doctrines emerges from an analysis of the whole catalogue of astral artworks in the Italian territory: 10 out of 240 of them reveal this unmistakable character and all are concentrated in the northeastern territory. There are many additional evidences that the recurring theme of astrological divination was in fact a widespread enterprise among humanists, philosophers, theologians and artists of the “Venetian Terraferma” at the time. Its discussion, reverberated across several generations and in nearby territories, reveals an informal “web” of study and research that goes well beyond the lecture halls of the local University, including poets, physicians, painters, heretics, goliardic secret societies and would-be revolutionary astronomers like Copernicus. In many features of the cited instances we find the typical rationalistic approach of the Aristotelian-Averroistic Paduan school inextricably linked to mysticism, neo-platonic magic and theology, a tradition going back at least to Pietro d"Abano and Biagio Pelacani. The same tradition, reinforced by a growing penchant for mathematical modelling and careful measuring, that will lead to the materialism of Pomponazzi, Telesius and Vanini and ultimately to the mature science of Galileo. Instead of considering this process a slow but glorious liberation from superstition as too many historians still do, I will try to argue that the interest in astrological divination has been a fertile breeding ground for the Scientific Revolution and in particular for the rebirth of Heliocentrism, a controversial thesis in the vein of Dame Frances Yates, akin to that recently advocated by Robert Westman in his debated “The Copernican Question” (2011) ...|$|E
