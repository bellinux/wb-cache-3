5|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} such pre-Code films as Our Betters (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Only Yesterday (1933), Sailor's Luck (1933), and Cavalcade (1933). Although the topic was dealt with much <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> {{than in the}} decades that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of not eating in a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{citizens}} {{were said to}} be shocked by the emotive, evangelical tactics of the Salvation Army when they arrived in the town in 1880, but the reaction from those employed by the breweries or within the Licence trade quickly grew <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> hostile. Violent clashes became a regular occurrence culminating on Sunday 27 March 1881 with troops being called upon to break up the conflict after the Mayor had read the Riot Act. The riot and its causes led to questions in Parliament and a period of notoriety for the town. The town was described as 'Barbarous Basingstoke' by one London newspaper in 1882.|$|E
5000|$|... “Masha, or the Fourth Reich” - a novel which overwhelms {{and makes}} one become <b>more</b> sensitive. <b>Openly</b> written {{and at the}} same time sharp this story will leave {{thousands}} of thoughts in one’s head and will raise the consciousness in every reader" [...] (Planet News, review).|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 {{information}} about the increase in rates of sexual transmission and the decrease in rates of drug-related transmission became more apparent. The Ministry of Health’s discourse then turned <b>more</b> towards <b>openly</b> concentrating on preventing both homo- and heterosexual transmission. [...] This shift towards acknowledgement of homosexual as well as heterosexual activities is reflective {{of a change in}} attitude in Italian society.|$|R

5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes. Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked <b>more</b> <b>openly.</b> Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
5|$|The HIV {{pandemic}} {{has challenged}} communities and brought about social changes throughout the world. Opinions on sexuality are <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> discussed. Advice on sexual practices and drug use– which were once taboo– {{is sponsored by}} many governments and their healthcare providers. Debates on the ethics of provision and cost of anti-retroviral drugs, particularly in poorer countries, have highlighted inequalities in healthcare and stimulated far-reaching legislative changes. In developing countries the impact of HIV/AIDS has been profound; key organisations such as healthcare, defense and civil services have been severely disrupted. Life expectancy has fallen. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years.|$|E
5|$|Florindo {{opens with}} {{celebrations}} to mark Apollo's {{victory over the}} dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him {{to fall in love}} with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E
25|$|The main foreign {{influence}} {{during this}} period was, by and large, the Prussian (and then German) doctrine. Partly because of that, during both World Wars most of the officers supported the Germans, <b>more</b> or less <b>openly,</b> while the Argentine Navy favored the British instead.|$|R
5000|$|A two-part {{episode in}} the fourth season, [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly", {{introduced}} a Mirror Universe version of T'Pol.

50|$|An {{explosive}} church-state conflict developed, {{during which}} the bishops <b>more</b> or less <b>openly</b> allied with the Sandinistas' political enemies and the FSLN struggled vainly to contain {{the influence of the}} institutional church. Throughout the 1980s, pro- and anti-Sandinista forces regularly manipulated religious symbols for political effect.|$|R

25|$|Mikael Sehul had {{compromised}} {{the power}} of the Emperor, and from this point forward it lay ever <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> {{in the hands of the}} great nobles and military commanders. This point of time has been regarded as one start of the Era of the Princes.|$|E
50|$|An unnamed narrator {{recalls how}} {{she became a}} lesbian. At the age of eight, when {{attending}} a party for adults and {{in search of a}} bathroom, she stumbled across a dark room where two women were kissing passionately.

Afterwards she enters into several <b>more</b> relationships, <b>openly</b> admitting her lesbianism, but finds herself branded a deviant.|$|R
40|$|According to {{a growing}} number of {{scientists}} cosmology {{is at the end of}} an era. This era started 100 years ago with the publication of Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity and came to its height in the 1920 s when the theory of relativity was used to develop the big bang model. However, at this moment there is a crisis within cosmology. More and <b>more</b> scientists <b>openly</b> doubt the big bang. There are alternatives for the theory of relativity as well as for the big bang model, but so far most scientists are scared to pass over Einstein. ...|$|R

25|$|Between Ayurbarwada's {{death in}} March 1320 {{and his own}} death in October 1322, Temüder {{attained}} a great power with {{the full support of}} Dagi.

25|$|That same year, {{he joined}} another {{paramilitary}} organization, the Stahlhelm, which primarily {{served as the}} DNVP's armed wing, ostensibly providing security at its meetings. For {{the next five years}} his academic responsibilities included chairing the German University Committee for Physical Education. Over that time, the militarist elements of the German body politic with which Stieve was involved became stronger, and <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> antidemocratic.|$|E
25|$|He led wide-ranging {{reforms in}} social, cultural, and {{economical}} aspects, establishing the new Republic's backbone of legislative, judicial, and economic structures.

50|$|Ever since January, the Unionists {{had been}} taking a <b>more</b> {{threatening}} attitude <b>openly</b> challenging the Government; they had also been annoyed and imprisoned, but they were treated with less severity than had {{been the case with}} former similar attempts. It was whispered, however, that in case of need, the whole country would side with the Unionists.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created {{its first}} soap opera, and {{significantly}} Australia's first teen soap opera, Class of '74. With {{its attempts to}} hint at the sex and sin shown <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> on Number 96 and The Box, its high school setting and early evening timeslot, Class of '74 came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.|$|E
25|$|While at {{university}} Heath became active in Conservative politics. On the key political {{issue of the}} day, foreign policy, he opposed the Conservative-dominated government of the day ever <b>more</b> <b>openly.</b> His first Paper Speech (i.e. a major speech listed on the Order Paper along with the visiting guest speakers) at the Oxford Union, in Michaelmas 1936, was {{in opposition to the}} appeasement of Germany by returning her colonies, confiscated during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Naigu, excited but nervous, sets {{about his}} weekly routines. He is surprised, however, {{to find the}} people he {{encounters}} laughing at him far <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> than they had before. Naigu becomes bitter and harsh, {{to the point where}} one disciple proclaims: “Naigu will be punished for treating us so harshly instead of teaching us Buddha’s Law”. People continue to laugh at Naigu for his vanity, until one day, Naigu wakes up, and to his relief and rejoicing, his nose has returned to its original length.|$|E

50|$|One's social {{relationship}} {{characterized by}} low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement {{are expected to}} be associated with low academic achievement.

25|$|Minogue is an {{ambassador}} for the Terrence Higgins Trust, {{an organization that}} works to increase awareness of AIDS.

In 2005 she appeared on ABC News to recant her previous allegations and defend brother Michael against new charges of child abuse. VH1 described Jackson {{as a role model}} having weathered various successes and setbacks. The perception of Jackson as an underdog and her support for LGBT rights has led her to be declared a gay icon.|$|E
25|$|Huguenot numbers peaked near an {{estimated}} two million by 1562, concentrated {{mainly in the}} southern and western parts of France. As Huguenots gained influence and <b>more</b> <b>openly</b> displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the French Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The Huguenots were led by Jeanne d'Albret, her son, the future Henry IV, and the princes of Condé. The wars ended with the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political, and military autonomy.|$|E
60|$|These records {{inform us}} that, {{so far as}} men have paid {{attention}} to Nature, they have been rewarded for their pains. They have developed the Arts which have furnished the conditions of civilised existence; and the Sciences, which have been a progressive revelation of reality and have afforded the best discipline of the mind in the methods of discovering truth. They have accumulated a vast body of universally accepted knowledge; and the conceptions of man and of society, of morals and of law, based upon that knowledge, are every day more and <b>more,</b> either <b>openly</b> or tacitly, acknowledged to be the foundations of right action.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} health benefits from sharing participant-level clinical research {{data for the}} purpose of secondary analysis or meta-analysis have been widely touted. Although some researchers remain wary about sharing data, recent policies and proposals by funders, scientific journals, research institutions, and international health organizations mean that data sharing, in one form or another, is inevitable. Now is therefore the time to focus on developing practices for data sharing that are effective, efficient, equitable, and ethical. In the process, we may need to question the assumption that more is better. Simply making <b>more</b> data <b>openly</b> available may not lead to analyses that are relevant and that are actually applied to improve health...|$|R
