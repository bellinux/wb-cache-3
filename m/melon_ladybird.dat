Chrysomelina {{is one of}} the major {{phytophagous insect}}s that feed on cucurbit plants. It is considered an economic pest in agriculture and multi-habitat insect widely distributed throughout the world. The insect is abundant in the southern region of Saudi Arabia and choose the most favourable conditions for its life cycle completion. It prefers humid habitats with optimum temperature degrees. The generations of the insect are affected by changes in environmental conditions and its numbers increase or decline according to variation in temperature and relative humidity (RH). These factors play an important role in changing its biological behaviour particularly feeding, breeding, reproduction and development of its generations. There were significant differences between the different developmental stages in the periods of time of their development. </p...|$|E
40|$|The <b>melon</b> <b>ladybird</b> beetle Epilachna chrysomelina F. {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of cucurbits in Saudi Arabia. Seasonal distribution of adults, larvae, and eggs, and the percentage of infested leaves were studied on watermelon Citrullus vulgaris (Thumb) Matsum & Nakai in Agricultural, Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, King Saud University at Deirab for two seasons 1999 and 2000. Five plants were randomly selected weekly from each row and three branches from each selected plant were examined. The total number of leaves, the number of infested leaves, and the number of adult larvae, and eggs were counted per branch. The highest percentage of infested leaves for 1999 and 2000 seasons were 28. 2 % on May 16 and 5. 2 % on May 29, respectively, and the lowest were 5. 4 % on June 19 and 1. 2 % on July 3 rd respectively. Adults and larvae were also high in 1999 season being 18. 6 and 21. 2 /branch, both on June 6 th respectively. On the other hand, the number of adults and larvae were low in 2000 season being 4 /branch on July 10 and 7. 6 /branch on May 15, respectively. The number of eggs were higher in the beginning of 1999 season, they reached 42. 2 eggs/branch on May 9 th then their number dropped. Eggs were found throughout the season 2000 but at low density. The high density of the beetle and the high percentage of infested leaves in 1999 compared to 2000 may probably be due to the high rate of rain fall in 1999 compared to 2000. The high relative humidity because of rain helps the hibernating adults to pass winter more successfully...|$|E
