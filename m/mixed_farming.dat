40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims at {{examining the}} benefits of <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness to strengthen food sustainability of poor farmer households at agro-tourism areas. The research is designed using a case study method based on qualitative and quantitative approach. This research is intentionally conducted in Karangreja Sub-district, Purbalingga Regency of Central Java Province. Â Based on the research results, it shows that <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness may provide the practical and economic benefits to strengthen food sustainability of the 12 adopting farmer households as the research respondents. High practical benefits are directly shown on 83 percent of respondents who {{find it easy to}} provide food materials consisting of vegetable and side dish (cat fish). Furthermore, the development of <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness also directly provides practical benefits to 67 percent of respondents in obtaining several food types, including corn and chicken. The other research results show that all respondents who have been well implemented <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness management may indirectly obtain the economic benefits, especially to the staple food providers of rice since those respondents generally first sell their <b>mix</b> <b>farming</b> agribusiness yields in order to purchase rice. Thus, the farmers should improve their awareness on the functions of practical and economic benefits that food sustainability in agro-tourism village areas may be well implemente...|$|R

25|$|The {{boll weevil}} {{infestation}} has {{been credited with}} bringing about economic diversification in the Southern US, including the expansion of peanut cropping. The citizens of Enterprise, Alabama, erected the Boll Weevil Monument in 1919, perceiving that their economy had been overly dependent on cotton, and that <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> and manufacturing were better alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse flies are {{regarded}} as {{a major cause of}} rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa because they prevent <b>mixed</b> <b>farming.</b> The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because nagana, the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Those cattle that survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available to fertilize the worn-out soils.|$|E
40|$|Most <b>mixed</b> <b>farms</b> in Australia {{are family}} run, {{and so the}} goals of the family and of the farm are closely inter-related. This chapter {{describes}} and discusses social factors which influence decisions made on <b>mixed</b> <b>farms</b> with particular reference to the influence of drought. Decision making on <b>mixed</b> <b>farms</b> is an extremely complex process as many factors must be taken into account, some factors are difficult to quantify and uncertain variables such as climate and commodity prices are important. The factors influencing changes to the farming system and the influence of drought on changing the system are discussed. Some implications for research and extension are described. Two social research projects contribute to the chapter: the Grain and Graze Social Research project and the BCG-Critical Breaking Point research into effects of drought on farming families...|$|R

25|$|The {{land was}} used for <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> and later focused on dairying. This {{produced}} New Zealand's first dairy co-operative, at Springfield on the Highcliff Road, in 1871. The peninsula was made a county in 1876, the administrative centre being Portobello. In the 1880s, following fears of a Russian invasion, Taiaroa Head was extensively fortified. An Armstrong Disappearing gun was installed in 1886. Ferries linked the peninsula's harbour coast with the city and Port Chalmers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more-productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and crop production (<b>mixed</b> <b>farming)</b> through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure to fertilize (in an environment-friendly way) soils for better crop production, and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports. This policy enjoyed some success: the total area under cultivation increased, and farm incomes fell less sharply in Finland than in most other countries. Barriers to grain imports stimulated a return to <b>mixed</b> <b>farming,</b> and by 1938 Finland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90 percent of the domestic demand for grain.|$|E

25|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived and}} cleared the land, cash crops replaced subsistence farming. Gradually, <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> and market gardens became the dominant form of agriculture, {{and in the}} early 20th century the area was declared the Garden of Canada. The first peaches grown in Canada were cultivated in the Grindstone Creek watershed in the city's south-west part. The farming tradition has passed down through the generations. Today over forty percent of the Grindstone Creek watershed is still devoted to farms, orchards and nurseries.|$|E
40|$|Under which {{conditions}} would an organic <b>mixed</b> <b>farm</b> co-operative {{contribute to the}} aesthetic and ecological quality of the landscape? The orientation of people {{in space and time}} is considered an important aspect of aesthetic quality. To facilitate orientation in space and time a landscape should supply information about the natural features, the history of the occupation and about the present meaning. Biodiversity, continuity and connectivity are important aspects of ecological quality. One organic <b>mixed</b> <b>farm</b> contributes to the local diversity. The diversity of land use types, including woodlots and linear planting and crops is larger than on a traditional farm, as is the diversity of landscape elements, ecosystems and species. What would be a good location of several organic <b>mixed</b> <b>farms</b> (25 ha) if an important criterion is that a landscape should reflect its abiotic features? A fine grained landscape, which can be the effect of organic agriculture, fits best into a natural environment with great abiotic diversity per hectare. The landscape of the brook Baaksche Beek is such an area with large abiotic diversity per hectare. Would an organic <b>mixed</b> <b>farm</b> co-operative in this brook valley automatically contribute to ecological and aesthetic qualities of this landscape? There are landscape ecological and aesthetic objectives, which cannot be realised by the sum of planning at farm level. Three interrelated criteria, diversity, continuity and coherence, are used as a basis for planning at different planning levels. They are specified in planning objectives and design principles for the planning of planting elements and natural development in this brook valley landscape. Whether such planning would interfere excessively with the organisation of each individual farmer is open to discussion. The proposal is to use these three criteria also as a basis for the evaluation of the contribution of organic <b>mixed</b> <b>farms</b> to the ecological and aesthetic quality of a particular European landscape...|$|R

25|$|In 1901, when Red Deer was {{incorporated}} as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable <b>mixed</b> <b>farming,</b> Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 {{when it was}} chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway.

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the colonial}} period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the {{agriculture}} economy from tobacco to <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> created less need for slaves' labor. Local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.|$|E
25|$|The Province of Maryland {{developed}} along lines {{very similar}} to those of Virginia. Tobacco was used as money, and the colonial legislature was obliged to pass a law requiring tobacco planters to raise a certain amount of corn as well, {{in order to ensure that}} the colonists would not go hungry. Like Virginia, Maryland's economy quickly became centered around the farming of tobacco for sale in Europe. The need for cheap labor to help with the growth of tobacco, and later with the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> economy that developed when tobacco prices collapsed, led to a rapid expansion of indentured servitude and, later, forcible immigration and enslavement of Africans.|$|E
