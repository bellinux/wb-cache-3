5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein <b>macromolecule</b> can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E

In this work, four different amphiphilic <b>macromolecules</b> (M 12 P 5, M 6 P 5, NC 12 P 5, NC 6 P 5) were evaluated using human primary cell {{lines of the}} vasculature: human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC), umbilical arterial smooth muscle cells (UASM), and normal dermal human fibroblasts (NDHF). The three primary cell types were incubated with culture media containing amphiphilic <b>macromolecules</b> at five concentra-tions ranging from 103 M to 107 M at 24, 48, and 72 h. All cell types treated with both amphiphilic <b>macromolecules</b> showed similar cell viability compared to the vehicle control at all concentrations, except at 103 M, which showed a substantially lower cell viability. Cells treated with amphiphilic <b>macromolecules</b> also exhibited similar characteristic cell morphologies at all concentrations, except for 103 M, which showed distressed cells.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of collagen and charged <b>macromolecules</b> like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the interstitial space limits the space available for plasma proteins and other <b>macromolecules.</b> This phenomenon, known as interstitial exclusion, is {{of importance for}} interstitial fluid volume regulation. Physical/mathematical models are presented for calculating the exclusion of electrically charged and neutral <b>macromolecules</b> that equilibrate in the interstitium under various degrees of hydration. Here, a central hypothesis is that the swelling of highly electrically charged GAGs with increased hydration shields parts of the neutral collagen of the interstitial matrix from interacting with electrically charged <b>macromolecules,</b> such that exclusion of charged <b>macromolecules</b> exhibits change due to steric and charge effects. GAGs are also thought to allow relatively small neutral, but also charged <b>macromolecules</b> neutralized by a very high ionic strength, diffuse into the interior of GAGs, whereas larger <b>macromolecules</b> may not. Thus, in the model, relatively small electrically charged <b>macromolecules,</b> such as human serum albumin, and larger neutral <b>macromolecules</b> such as IgG, will have quite similar total volume exclusion properties in the interstitium. Our results are in agreement with ex vivo and in vivo experiments, and suggest that the charge of GAGs or macromolecular drugs may be targeted to increase the tissue uptake of macromolecular therapeutic agents...|$|R

40|$|Synaptic vesicles dock at active zones on the {{presynaptic}} {{plasma membrane}} of a neuron's axon terminals as {{a precondition for}} fusing with the membrane and releasing their neurotransmitter to mediate synaptic impulse transmission. Typically, docked vesicles are next to aggregates of plasma membrane-bound <b>macromolecules</b> called active zone material (AZM). Electron tomography on tissue sections from fixed and stained axon terminals of active and resting frog neuromuscular junctions {{has led to the}} conclusion that undocked vesicles are directed to and held at the docking sites by the successive formation of stable connections between vesicle membrane proteins and proteins in different classes of AZM <b>macromolecules.</b> Using the same nanometer scale 3 D imaging technology on appropriately stained frog neuromuscular junctions, we found that ∼ 10 % of a vesicle's luminal volume is occupied by a radial assembly of elongate <b>macromolecules</b> attached by narrow projections, nubs, to the vesicle membrane at ∼ 25 sites. The assembly's chiral, bilateral shape is nearly the same vesicle to vesicle, and nubs, at their sites of connection to the vesicle membrane, are linked to <b>macromolecules</b> that span the membrane. For docked vesicles, the orientation of the assembly's shape relative to the AZM and the presynaptic membrane is the same vesicle to vesicle, whereas for undocked vesicles it is not. The connection sites of most nubs on the membrane of docked vesicles are paired with the connection sites of the different classes of AZM <b>macromolecules</b> that regulate docking, and the membrane spanning <b>macromolecules</b> linked to these nubs are also attached to the AZM <b>macromolecules.</b> We conclude that the luminal assembly of <b>macromolecules</b> anchors in a particular arrangement vesicle membrane <b>macromolecules,</b> which contain the proteins that connect the vesicles to AZM <b>macromolecules</b> during docking.

25|$|The {{effects of}} a drug {{are a result of}} their binding {{selectivity}} with <b>macromolecule</b> properties of an organism, or the affinity with which different ligands bind to a substrate. More specifically, the specificity and selectivity of a ligand to its respective receptor provides researchers the opportunity to isolate and produce specific drug effects through the manipulation of ligand concentrations and receptor densities.

Drugs that act upon these receptors are incredibly selective in order to produce required responses from signaling molecules.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{that make}} up organisms may be divided into macromolecules and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of <b>macromolecule</b> are nucleic acids, proteins, {{carbohydrates}} and lipids. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons, {{each of which is}} a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.|$|E

That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can flip over rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from too fast to measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups {{in the center of the}} β sheet, and those values also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dynamics simulations.|$|E

25|$|By definition, {{condensation}} liberates a small molecule, such {{as water}} or alcohol. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger silicon-containing molecules {{by the process of}} polymerization. Thus, a polymer is a huge molecule (or <b>macromolecule)</b> formed from hundreds or thousands of units called monomers. The number of bonds that a monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of silicon alkoxide, for instance, can lead to complex branching of the polymer, because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)4 is tetrafunctional (can branch or bond in 4 different directions). Alternatively, under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration) fewer than 4 of the OR or OH groups (ligands) will be capable of condensation, so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of sol-gel science and technology. This reaction is favored in both basic and acidic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid is a {{molecule}} that carries {{most of the}} genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates, {{they are one of}} the three major types of <b>macromolecule</b> that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase—either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T)—as well as a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037, and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).|$|E
