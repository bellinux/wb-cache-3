5|$|The <b>Montserrat</b> {{national}} football team is the representative association football {{team of the}} small Caribbean island of <b>Montserrat.</b> Football {{is the second most}} popular sport in <b>Montserrat</b> after cricket, and official competitive football on the island is governed by the <b>Montserrat</b> Football Association (MFA). The association is affiliated to the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) and the team has, as of December 2009, entered seven Caribbean Cup competitions and three FIFA World Cup qualification campaigns. <b>Montserrat</b> played their first international fixture in 1991, which ended in a 0–3 defeat by Saint Lucia. In their second match, they secured a 1–1 draw with Anguilla. <b>Montserrat</b> lost their next seven matches before achieving their first ever victory on 26 March 1995, when they defeated Anguilla 3–2 at the Blakes Estate Stadium in Plymouth. <b>Montserrat</b> also went on to win their next match, again defeating Anguilla 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Around 7,000people in Cuba were {{evacuated}} {{to avoid the}} oncoming hurricane. Several shelters were opened by the <b>Montserrat</b> Red Cross on <b>Montserrat,</b> but few people sought refuge in them. Over 40shelters were ready for use in Nassau, Bahamas, even though Debby never affected the island. A total of 889people in the northern coastal plains {{were evacuated}} and placed in shelters out of Debby path. Three shelters were opened for the coming of Debby in Saint Thomas, and another two in Saint John. The total {{number of people in}} all five shelters only reached64.

5|$|At around 1600UTC on August26, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} watches for Dominica, Martinique, St. Martin, Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, <b>Montserrat,</b> and St. Kitts and Nevis. Six hours later, {{the watch}} was upgraded to a hurricane warning for Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, <b>Montserrat,</b> and St. Kitts and Nevis. Local meteorological agencies {{on the islands}} also declared small craft advisories. The local government in <b>Montserrat</b> mobilized the 100 member police force and 50 off-duty volunteer army members. Supermarkets, hardware stores, banks, and pharmacies were specially opened for residents to purchase plywood, canned food, bottled water, and other hurricane kit items. Around 1300UTC on August27, the hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique was discontinued as Gustav no longer posed {{a direct threat to}} the islands. Three hours later, all watches and warnings were discontinued except for Antigua and Barbuda where a tropical storm warning and St. Martin where a tropical storm watch were in place. By 1900UTC, once Hurricane Gustav turned towards the north away from the Lesser Antilles, all watches and warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{worked for}} Francisco de Paula del Villar on the apse of the <b>Montserrat</b> monastery, {{designing}} the niche for {{the image of}} the Black Virgin of <b>Montserrat</b> in 1876. He would later substitute Villar in the works of the Sagrada Família. With Leandre Serrallach, he worked on a tram line project to Villa Arcadia in Montjuïc. Eventually, he collaborated with Joan Martorell on the Jesuit church on Carrer Casp and the Salesian convent in Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as the Villaricos church (Almería). He also carried out a project for Martorell for the competition for a new facade for Barcelona cathedral, which was never accepted. His relationship with Martorell, whom he always considered one of his main and most influential masters, brought him unexpected luck; he later recommended Gaudí for the Sagrada Família.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Erika {{produced}} strong {{waves and}} high low-level winds throughout the Lesser Antilles. Just {{weeks after the}} eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on <b>Montserrat,</b> the storm blew a cloud of falling ash over Antigua. Tropical storm-force winds affected several of the islands in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at <b>Montserrat,</b> where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the <b>Montserrat</b> rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|<b>Montserrat</b> Carulla as Benigna Escobeda, {{a former}} worker at the orphanage who {{identifies}} {{herself as a}} social worker.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, massive {{volcanic}} eruptions destroyed <b>Montserrat’s</b> infrastructure and leveled the island’s capital, Plymouth. Today, <b>Montserrat’s</b> 4, 000 citizens are still {{coming to terms}} with this traumatic event. "Montserrat: Emerald of the Caribbean" explores how shared values—community, hope, faith—and traditions serve as sources of strength and identity for Montserratians as they rebuild their lives together. The film culminates in a portrayal of {{the sights and sounds of}} <b>Montserrat’s</b> annual St. Patrick’s Day Festival, a commemoration of African slaves who rebelled against their Irish slave masters on Saint Patrick’s Day, 1768. A unique blend of African, Caribbean, and Irish traditions, the Saint Patrick’s Day Festival represents the past, present, and future of a resilient people. In recording the events of <b>Montserrat’s</b> Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations and offering a space for Montserratians to speak to outsiders about its meaning, the film functions, in a way, as an intervention into the communication subfields of rhetoric, media studies, and culture. In terms of rhetoric, the film explores various local forums and styles of public address—poem recitations, calypso performance contests and radio public service announcements—to elucidate how Montserratians construct arguments, maintain collective memories, and motivate each other to ways of thinking and action as they struggle to rebuild a nation severely uprooted by volcanic eruptions. As a “media study,” the film offers an intimate portrayal of ZJB Radio, the island’s only local media outlet. Following prominent radio personalities Rose Willock and Basil Chambers, the film shows how ZJB Radio fulfills many roles on the island (much like early radio in the US) : town crier, public forum for debate, repository for local news and concerns. Furthermore, the film examines what one might consider to be non-traditional forms of media—intricately designed kites, cross-cultural “masquerade” dress—and shows how such non-traditional media convey specific messages to community members...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the star}} guest singers during the Davis years were the sopranos <b>Montserrat</b> Caballé and Leontyne Price, the tenors Carlo Bergonzi, Nicolai Gedda and Luciano Pavarotti and the bass Gottlob Frick. British singers {{appearing}} {{with the company}} included Janet Baker, Heather Harper, John Tomlinson and Richard Van Allan. Davis's tenure, {{at that time the}} longest in The Royal Opera's history, closed in July 1986 not with a gala, but, at his insistence, with a promenade performance of Fidelio with cheap admission prices.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall {{across much of}} the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in Martinique further north, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. The threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on <b>Montserrat,</b> which was being threatened by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Irisfour in Martinique, and one in Guadeloupe.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{destroyer}} [...] took a {{large role}} in evacuating <b>Montserrat's</b> population to other islands; this included Antigua and Barbuda, who warned they {{would not be able to}} cope with many more refugees.

50|$|Today, <b>Montserrat’s</b> main {{economic}} activity is in construction and government services which together accounted for about 50 percent of GDP in 2000 when it was EC$76 million. In contrast, banking and insurance together accounted for less than 10 percent of GDP. The unemployment rate in 1998 was estimated at 6 percent. <b>Montserrat’s</b> domestic financial sector is very small and has seen a reduction in offshore finance in recent years with only 11 offshore banks remaining. Real GDP declined from EC$122 million in 1995 to about EC$60 million in 1999, with the rate of decline peaking at -21.5 percent for 1996. The decline in {{economic activity}} reflected in large part the completion of major projects in both {{the private and public}} sectors. However, the rate of decline slowed markedly since 2000 and 2001, when GDP contracted by less than 3 percent. In 2002, the GDP growth rate reverted to a positive 4.6 percent reversing the declining trend {{over the past six years}} and maybe more.|$|R
