5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
25|$|While {{women in}} East Germany were {{encouraged}} {{to participate in the}} workforce, {{this was not the case}} in West Germany, where a woman's primary role was understood to be at home, taking care of her family.

In 2006, Seven percent {{of women in the}} Developed World were unemployed as compared to 6% of men.

25|$|Mary the Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany and {{her sister}} Martha {{have been among the}} women {{identified}} as having been key to the establishment of Christianity. Karen L. King, Harvard Professor of New Testament Studies and the History of Ancient Christianity, writes that the history of women in ancient Christianity has been almost completely revised in the last twenty years. Many <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> being added to the list of women who made very significant contributions in the early history of Christianity. The new history comes primarily from recent discoveries of biblical text that had been neglected through the ages.|$|E
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> {{living in}} poverty due {{to changes in the}} {{traditional}} family structure. The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who earn less than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{statistics}} {{showed that}} of all Swedes aged 25–64, 15% have completed only compulsory education (as {{the highest level of}} attainment), 46% only upper secondary education, 14% only post-secondary education of less than three years, and 22% post-secondary education of three years or <b>more.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>are</b> more educated than men (26% of women vs. 19% of men have post-secondary education of three years or more). The level of education is highest among those aged 25–34, and it decreases with age. Both upper secondary school and university studies are financed by taxes. Some Swedes go straight to work after secondary school. Along with several other European countries, the government used to subsidize tuition of non-EU/EEA students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, but in 2010 they started charging non-EU/EEA students 80,000–100,000 SEK per year. Swedish fifteen year old pupils have the 22nd highest average score in the PISA assessments, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.|$|E

2500|$|With PR, {{there are}} no [...] "swing seats", most votes {{contribute}} to {{the election of a}} candidate so parties need to campaign in all districts, not just those where their support is strongest or where they perceive most advantage.

2500|$|Hair styling in African-American {{culture is}} greatly varied. African-American hair is {{typically}} composed of coiled curls, {{which range from}} tight to wavy. Many women choose to wear their hair in its natural state. [...] Natural hair can be styled {{in a variety of}} ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. [...] It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair). [...] To that end, some women prefer straightening of the hair through the application of heat or chemical processes. [...] Although this can be a matter of personal preference, the choice is often affected by straight hair being a beauty standard in the West and the fact that hair type can affect employment. However, more and <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> wearing their hair in its natural state and receiving positive feedback. Alternatively, the predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one's hair natural.|$|E
2500|$|Historically {{women have}} been {{attended}} and supported by other women during labour and birth. However currently, as <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> giving birth in a hospital rather than at home, continuous support has become {{the exception rather than}} the norm. When women became pregnant any time before the 1950s the husband would not be in the birthing room. It did not matter if it was a home birth; the husband was waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital then the husband was in the waiting room. [...] "Her husband was attentive and kind, but, Kirby concluded, Every good woman needs a companion of her own sex." [...] Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of [...] labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network. [...] There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} twentieth century to present day, more and <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming}} involved in science. [...] However, women often find themselves at odds with expectations held towards them in relation to their scientific studies. [...] For example, in 1968 James Watson questioned scientist Rosalind Franklin's place in the industry. [...] He claimed that [...] "the best place for a feminist was in another person's lab", most often a male's research lab. [...] Women were and still are often critiqued of their overall presentation. [...] In Franklin's situation, she was seen as lacking femininity for she failed to wear lipstick or revealing clothing. [...] Women believed that in order to gain recognition, they needed to hide their feminine qualities, to thus appear more masculine. [...] Women in the sixties were often forced to wear men's clothing, which often did not fit for they were too large or too short within the crotch area. [...] Since most of their colleagues in science are men, women also find themselves left out of opportunities to discuss possible research opportunities. [...] In Londa Scheibinger's book, Has Feminism Changed Science?, she explains how men discuss research outside of the lab, but this conversation is preceded by talk of sports and the like, thus excluding women. [...] This causes women to seek other women in science to converse with, which in turn causes their final work to be looked down upon, for a male scientist was not involved.|$|E

2500|$|Men enjoyed {{having a}} space that was free of women and which in the late 1940s [...] "allowed them to {{continue}} the kind of male companionship and adventure they had enjoyed during the Second World War." [...] In one news article about Antarctica written in 1958, the writer describes the use of dazzlement: [...] "On the womanless continent, {{the purpose of the}} dazzlement is not to catch the eye of a flirtatious blonde, but to attract spotters in the event that the explorers become lost in the frozen waste." [...] Men's spaces in Antarctica resisted change. In the 1980s, there was an attempt by men to memorialize the [...] "Sistine ceiling" [...] of the Weddell hut in Antarctica as an Australian national heritage site of [...] "high significance." [...] The [...] "Sistine ceiline" [...] was covered in 92 different pornographic pinups of women from the 1970s and 1980s. This represented a [...] "male's only club" [...] in which participants believed women would spoil the [...] "purity of a homosocial work--and play--environment." [...] In 1983, the San Bernardino County Sun newspaper published an article about Antarctica stating that it [...] "is still one of the last macho redoubts, where men are men and women are superfluous." [...] One scientist, Lyle McGinnis, who had been going to Antarctica since 1957 resented women in the field, saying that [...] "men never grouse," [...] but he believed that women complained and needed [...] "comfort." [...] Not all men felt that way. Other men felt that women's presence made life in Antarctica better and one male engineer stated that without women around, [...] "men are pigs." [...] Sociologist Charles Moskos stated that as <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> introduced to a group, there is less aggression and a [...] "more civil culture develops." ...|$|E

"I {{know and}} have seen women lying upon laced pillows, under silken curtains, {{who have been}} bullied and {{dominated}} over in the hour of their greatest helplessness by ignorant and vulgar tyrants, {{in a way that}} would scarce be thought possible in civilized society, and children that have been injured or done to death by the same means. A celebrated physician told me of a babe whose eyesight was nearly ruined by its nurse taking a fancy to wash its eyes with camphor,--'to keep it from catching cold,' she said. I knew another infant that was poisoned by the nurse giving it laudanum in some of those patent nostrums which these ignorant creatures carry secretly in their pockets, to secure quiet in their little charges. I knew one delicate woman who never recovered from the effects of being left at her first confinement in the hands of an ill-tempered, drinking nurse, and whose feeble infant was neglected and abused by this woman in a way to cause lasting injury. In the first four weeks of infancy the constitution is peculiarly impressible; and infants of a delicate organization may, if frightened and ill-treated, be the subjects of just such a shock to the nervous system as in mature age comes from the sudden stroke of a great affliction or terror. A bad nurse may affect nerves predisposed to weakness in a manner they never will recover from. I solemnly believe that the constitutions of <b>more</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> broken up by bad nursing in their first confinement than by any other cause whatever. And yet there are at the same time hundreds and thousands of women, wanting the means of support, whose presence in a sick-room would be a benediction. I do trust that Miss Blackwell's band of educated nurses will not be long in coming, and that the number of such may increase till they effect a complete revolution in this vocation. A class of cultivated, well-trained, intelligent nurses would soon elevate the employment of attending on the sick into the noble calling it ought to be, and secure for it its appropriate rewards." ...|$|E
