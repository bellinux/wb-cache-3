5|$|The fifth batch, again {{named after}} cities, {{comprised}} four locomotives, Nos. 6245–6248. These engines were built during 1943 {{and the average}} cost was held to £10,908 due to the incorporation of recycled boilers. During the Second World War, the <b>Materials</b> <b>Committee</b> of the government tried to balance the needs for steel between civilian departments and the War Department when allocating those resources. Despite these constraints, the entire batch was still outshopped in streamlined form.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the claims}} {{made in the}} {{television}} program, California assemblyman Phil Wyman proposed a state law that would require warning labels on records containing backward masking. In April 1982, the Consumer Protection and Toxic <b>Materials</b> <b>Committee</b> of the California State Assembly held a hearing on backward masking in popular music, during which [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] was played backward. During the hearing, William Yarroll, a self-described [...] "neuroscientific researcher", claimed that backward messages could be deciphered by the human brain.|$|E
2500|$|Feuer {{served as}} the Majority Policy Leader of the California Assembly and Chair of the Assembly's Judiciary Committee, writing many public safety, children's health, transportation, {{consumer}} protection and environmental laws.

He also served on the Environmental Safety & Toxic <b>Materials</b> <b>Committee,</b> the Judiciary Committee, the Revenue and Taxation Committee, and the Select Committees on Rail Transportation and Prison Construction and Operation. [...] As a freshman, Feuer introduced more than 20 bills, on topics including transit oriented development, improvements on the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System, reducing DUI ticket masking, nursing home safety and information, and putting a 7% cap on UC fee increases. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger approved Feuer's microstamping bill and his bill on DUI ticket masking on October 14, 2007, but vetoed several of Feuer's other bills, including those on nursing homes, consumer rebates, and court fees.|$|E

2500|$|Assemblyman John Laird, D-Santa Cruz, {{introduced}} Assembly Concurrent Resolution 117, {{calling on}} the Departments of Food and Agriculture and Pesticide Regulation, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and other state agencies to answer unresolved questions. [...] He stated, [...] "It {{is the responsibility of}} our government to demonstrate its LBAM actions are necessary and do not compromise human or environmental health,” Laird said. “It isn’t the responsibility of the people to demonstrate the reverse." [...] The resolution uses a fast track process in the state House and Senate which does not require the Governor's signature. [...] Laird's Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008, AB 2763, passed the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic <b>Materials</b> <b>Committee</b> by a vote of 4–0 on April 2 of 2008. [...] On March 22, 2008, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom wrote a public letter to the Governor urging him to study health consequences before continuing with the spray campaign. [...] He cited relevant state legislation and asked the governor to sign the bills into law immediately.|$|E
2500|$|One {{result of}} the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had {{encouraged}} listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections. A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of Arkansas and California. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that [...] "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist". Involved in the discussion on the bill was a California State Assembly Consumer Protection and Toxic <b>Materials</b> <b>Committee</b> hearing, during which [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified. The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued. The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen and Styx, and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: [...] "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." [...] However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor Bill Clinton and defeated. House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative Bob Dornan (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label; the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed. Government action was also {{called for in the}} legislatures of Texas and Canada.|$|E
