5|$|Brown won the September 1995 Democratic primary for the Masten District Buffalo Common Council seat. He {{then took}} time out from campaigning {{to attend the}} October 16, 1995 Million <b>Man</b> <b>March.</b> Brown ousted 18-year veteran councilmember, David Collins, to win his seat on the Buffalo Common Council. He beat Collins by a 5,391–1,670 (76–24%) margin in the November 7, 1995 general election. In his 1997 {{re-election}} campaign, he won the September 9 Democratic primary handily, and he was unopposed in the November 4 general election. In his 1999 re-election campaign, he again won the Democratic primary easily on September 14, and he won the November 2 general election. Beginning in January 2000, Brown served {{as part of the}} first ever African-American majority {{in the history of the}} Buffalo Common Council.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million <b>Man</b> <b>March</b> that October.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million <b>Man</b> <b>March,</b> Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million <b>Man</b> <b>March,</b> held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E

She said that Louis Farrakhan and other organizers appeared to prefer that women take subordinate roles in society. Together with Kimberlé Crenshaw and others, she formed the African American Agenda 2000, an alliance of Black feminists.|$|E
25|$|Conrad Worrill (born August 15, 1941) is an African American writer, educator, activist, {{and former}} {{talk show host}} for the WVON call-in program On Target. Organizations he has been {{involved}} with include the Million <b>Man</b> <b>March,</b> and the National Black United Front. Worrills activism has centered on the need for greater independence in African-American life, and helping young people better understand the relationships between power and institutions.|$|E
25|$|In October 1995, he {{organized}} {{and led the}} Million <b>Man</b> <b>March</b> in Washington, D.C., calling on black men to renew their commitments to their families and communities. Due to health issues, he reduced his responsibilities with the NOI in 2007. In 2013, however, Farrakhan has been very active, including delivering weekly online sermons throughout the year as well as speaking at large public NOI events as well as smaller venues.|$|E

25|$|That year in October, Farrakhan {{convened a}} broad {{coalition}} {{of what he}} and his supporters claim to have been one-million men in Washington, D.C., for the Million <b>Man</b> <b>March.</b> The count however fell far below the hoped-for numbers. The National Park Service estimated that approximately 440,000 were in attendance. Farrakhan threatened to sue the National Park Service because of the low estimate from the Park Police. Farrakhan and other speakers called for black men to renew their commitments to their families and communities. The event was organized by {{a wide variety of}} civil rights and religious organizations and drew men and their sons from across the United States of America. While Farrakhan was the keynote speaker, many distinguished African American intellectuals addressed the throng including: Maya Angelou; Rosa Parks; Martin Luther King III, Cornel West, Jesse Jackson and Benjamin Chavis. In 2005, together with other prominent African Americans such as the New Black Panther Party leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, the activist Al Sharpton, Addis Daniel and others, Farrakhan marked the 10th anniversary of the Million <b>Man</b> <b>March</b> by holding a second gathering, the Millions More Movement, October 14–17 in Washington D.C.|$|E

The U.S. Park Police, which oversees activities on the National Mall, stopped providing estimates of crowd size after being threatened with lawsuits by {{the organizers of the}} Million <b>Man</b> <b>March,</b> but said that protest organizers only had a permit for 30,000 demonstrators.|$|E
500|$|Angelou recited {{her most}} famous poem, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning", at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. In 1995, she {{delivered}} what Richard Long called her [...] "second 'public' poem", entitled [...] "A Brave and Startling Truth", which commemorated the 50th {{anniversary of the}} United Nations. Also in 1995, she was chosen to recite one of her poems at the Million <b>Man</b> <b>March.</b> Angelou was the first African-American woman and living poet selected by Sterling Publishing, who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their Poetry for Young People series in 2004. In 2009, Angelou wrote [...] "We Had Him", a poem about Michael Jackson, which was read by Queen Latifah at his funeral. [...] She wrote [...] "His Day is Done", a poem honoring Nelson Mandela {{after his death in}} 2013. [...] The poem was released in book form, along with a video of Angelou reciting it, by the U.S. State Department.|$|E

500|$|Angelou explores many of {{the same}} themes {{throughout}} all her writings, in both her autobiographies and poetry. [...] These themes include love, painful loss, music, discrimination and racism, and struggle. Her poetry cannot easily be placed in categories of themes or techniques. [...] It has been compared with music and musical forms, especially the blues, and like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. [...] Many of her poems are about love, relationships, or overcoming hardships, as expressed in poems of hers such as [...] "Still I Rise", I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, and Million <b>Man</b> <b>March</b> Poem. [...] The metaphors in her poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for meanings understood by other Blacks, but her themes and topics apply universally to all races. [...] Angelou uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. [...] As she does throughout her autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, but for her entire gender and race. Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. [...] Tied with Angelou's theme of racism is her treatment of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{estimated}} that {{there were at least}} 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African American community.
