50|$|Rather {{than the}} fast-paced action of Wolfenstein 3D, Nitemare 3D has a {{slightly}} slower, more puzzle-oriented style of gameplay. The four weapons (plasma gun, magic wand, pistol, and auto-repeat plasma gun) have different usages—for example, magic blasts are especially useful against magical creatures such as witches, whereas robots are practically immune to them. Meanwhile, vampires take heavy damage from silver bullets, while shrugging off {{the effects of the}} plasma gun. Each level in the game has numerous secret panels, some of which were purely for bonuses, but others are essential to completing the level. To make this task easier, the player can collect <b>magic</b> <b>eyes,</b> which enable the player to activate a mini-map in the game's HUD and give hints as to the locations of panels, and crystal balls for displaying the location of enemies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> is {{a series}} of books {{published}} by N.E. Thing Enterprises (renamed in 1996 to <b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> Inc.). The books feature autostereograms, which allow some people to see 3D images by focusing on 2D patterns. The viewer must diverge their eyes in order to see a hidden three-dimensional image within the pattern. A [...] "Magic Eye" [...] {{has become something of a}} genericized trademark, often used to refer to autostereograms of any origin. The autostereogram predates the <b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> series by several years. Christopher Tyler created the first black-and-white autostereograms in 1979 with the assistance of computer programmer Maureen Clarke.|$|R

5000|$|Stereopsis, or retinal ({{binocular}}) disparity, or binocular parallax : Animals {{that have}} their eyes placed frontally {{can also use}} information derived from the different projection of objects onto each retina to judge depth. By using two images of the same scene obtained from slightly different angles, {{it is possible to}} triangulate the distance to an object {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Each eye views a slightly different angle of an object seen by the left and right eyes. This happens because of the horizontal separation parallax of the eyes. If an object is far away, the disparity of that image falling on both retinas will be small. If the object is close or near, the disparity will be large. It is stereopsis that tricks people into thinking they perceive depth when viewing <b>Magic</b> <b>Eyes,</b> Autostereograms, 3-D movies, and stereoscopic photos.|$|E

As a teenager she won a beauty contest in an Egyptian teen magazine which widely published her photograph and got her the attention of directors and producers. She studied at the Faculty of Law, Alexandria University. She made her brief first appearance in the 1956 film Dalila alongside stars of the day Shadia and Abdel Halim Hafez. She went on to work in many other films with other famous actors such as Rushdy Abaza, Fatin Abdel Wahab, Youssef Wahbi, Kamal el-Shennawi, Soad Hosny and Omar Sharif. She retired from acting in the late 1980s. During her career, she was given many nicknames such as The Pussycat of Arab Cinema, <b>Magic</b> <b>Eyes</b> and The Queen of Romance.|$|E

Tuning indicator tubes were used in vacuum tube receivers from around 1936 to 1980 before vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors in radios.

5000|$|The {{album cover}} is a {{close-up}} {{shot of a}} <b>Magic</b> <b>eye</b> tube fitted onto vintage radio receivers from the 1930s. The purpose of tuning eyes in these radio sets was to help tune a station in at its strongest point on the dial. So when the perfect frequency was found, the <b>Magic</b> Tuning <b>Eye</b> would be lit {{up all the way}} (like the album cover's). The percentage of light shown signified the strength of the signal. As mentioned to Rolling Stone magazine by James, the album cover depicting the <b>Magic</b> <b>eye</b> tube was inspired by his own experience of getting Lasik eye surgery, saying: [...] "The whole experience of it is so fucked up, it's somebody slicing your eyeball open and shooting you with a laser." [...] It also inspired James to write the song [...] "Victory Dance." ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>magic</b> <b>eye</b> tube or tuning indicator, in {{technical}} literature called an electron-ray indicator tube, is a vacuum tube which gives a visual {{indication of the}} amplitude of an electronic signal, such as an audio output, radio-frequency signal strength, or other functions. The <b>magic</b> <b>eye</b> (also called a cat's eye, or tuning eye in North America) is {{a specific type of}} such a tube with a circular display similar to the EM34 illustrated. Its first broad application was as a tuning indicator in radio receivers, to give an indication of the relative strength of the received radio signal, to show when a radio station was properly tuned in.|$|R

In the 1930s the manufacture of mechanical panel meters were labor-intensive and expensive. <b>Magic</b> <b>eye</b> tubes provided radio designers with a less expensive and more profitable way to add a feature usually found in higher price equipment. The general public reception was a success as customers like the green glow and the seemingly magical way it worked. He released information on his invention the following year.
