5|$|After Harrison's {{preliminary}} studies, {{it became}} clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the <b>main</b> <b>site,</b> with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the <b>main</b> <b>site,</b> aligned east to west, with a tower at the west end; the upper quadrangle, to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle, again aligned east to west, with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle. The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street. The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 – he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.|$|E

This allowed the Heritage Lottery Fund to give a £7.164M grant towards the restoration of the complex. Together with an additional grant from the North West Development Agency, a £10M regeneration project took place between 2004 and 2006. The project included repair and strengthening of the structure, the restoration of the canal basin, a new roof and windows, and the reinstatement of two missing floors from the Murray Street block.|$|E

5|$|The Museum of the Riverina was {{established}} in 1967 by the Wagga Wagga and District Historical Society. Wagga Wagga City Council took over its operations in the late 1990s and it now operates at two sites. The Historic Council Chambers site {{on the corner of}} Baylis and Morrow streets in central Wagga, hosts travelling exhibitions and the <b>main</b> <b>site</b> at the Botanic Gardens is home to the main collection including the Wagga Wagga Sporting Hall of Fame. The museum also has an important collection of memorabilia about the Tichborne Case, including a set of four rare plaster figurines depicting characters from the trial, a complete set of hard-bound court transcripts and a monumental painting entitled The Tichborne Trial painted in 1874 by Nathan Hughes, which hangs in the city's council chambers.|$|E
5|$|Jesus College (in full: Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's Foundation) {{is one of}} {{the colleges}} of the University of Oxford in England. It is in the centre of the city, on a site between Turl Street, Ship Street, Cornmarket Street and Market Street. The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 for the {{education}} of clergy, though students now study a broad range of secular subjects. A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman from Brecon in Wales. The oldest buildings, in the first quadrangle, date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906. Further accommodation was built on the <b>main</b> <b>site</b> to mark the 400th anniversary of the college, in 1971, and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford.|$|E

5|$|Kosara then {{begged her}} father for Vladimir's hand, and the tsar granted her request. He {{restored}} his new son-in-law {{to the throne}} of Duklja. In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir {{would be a more}} loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter. Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the <b>main</b> <b>site</b> of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Raška. His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.|$|E
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the <b>main</b> <b>site</b> at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E
5|$|Several large {{stones are}} set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga. Rulers would stand atop these stones, each {{identified}} by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public. To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest. The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared their rejection of Andrianjafy's rule and their allegiance to his nephew, Andrianampoinimerina. Upon taking the throne, Andrianampoinimerina used this site to first declare new laws and decrees that would later be announced throughout the kingdom. This was also the <b>main</b> <b>site</b> at Ambohimanga for dispensing justice. After Andrianampoinimerina's succession to the throne, he sacrificed a black zebu whose mother had died, named Lemainty ("black one"), with repeated spear thrusts; after its death, the animal was cut into pieces and buried on the site. Lemainty was thereafter regularly invoked in royal speeches and decrees to allude {{to the fate of}} those who misguidedly sought to forsake the protection of their guardian, the sovereign, and his laws.|$|E

5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>site,</b> {{known as}} H1, was {{established}} on Hermite Island. This was {{the location of}} the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with the equipment to monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, from whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E
5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} Chicago 2016 Olympic bid {{placed the}} <b>main</b> <b>site</b> of the $1.1 billion residential complex, {{which would have}} accommodated athletes in an Olympic Village in the 4th Ward. Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions. Since the planned construction was almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents were not offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving {{what would have been}} the Olympic Village from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in voting against a $500 million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid. On September 9, 2009, Preckwinkle voted to authorize Mayor Richard Daley to sign the International Olympic Committee's host city contract that included financial guarantees putting full responsibility for the Olympics and its proposed $4.8 billion operating budget on taxpayers.|$|E
5|$|Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew {{around the}} medieval weaving industry. Street {{developed}} as a centre {{for the production of}} woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C Clark's shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the UK. C Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the <b>main</b> <b>site</b> at Street. Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia.|$|E
