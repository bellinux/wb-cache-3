5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone {{to a depth}} of , the <b>milk</b> <b>shark</b> favors turbid water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonl√© Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the <b>milk</b> <b>shark</b> feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes.

In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
5|$|The <b>milk</b> <b>shark</b> has {{a slender}} build with a long, pointed snout, large, round eyes with nictitating {{membranes}} (protective third eyelids), and no spiracles.

There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws. The tooth rows number 2425 in both jaws. The upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique; the lower teeth have a similar shape, though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward.

During the second phase, which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of , the external gill filaments develop and the yolk sac begins to be resorbed, the embyo ingesting histotroph (a nutritious substance secreted by the mother) in the meantime.

5|$|The <b>milk</b> <b>shark</b> is {{harmless}} {{to humans}} {{because of its}} small size and teeth. Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal.

Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively.

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the <b>milk</b> <b>shark</b> feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the <b>milk</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous; females {{usually have}} a single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman parturition occurs year-round with a peak in spring. Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation {{for the lack of}} reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected (such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E

40|$|The {{project has}} {{provided}} management and other stakeholders with information {{necessary to make}} informed decisions about the management of four of the key exploited shark species caught in the Queensland inshore net fishery and northern New South Wales line fishery. The project has determined that spatial management of <b>milk</b> <b>sharks</b> within Queensland, and scalloped hammerhead, common black tip and Australian black tip sharks within Queensland and New South Wales is appropriate. The project has determined that both black tip shark species are likely to require co-operative management arrangements between Queensland and New South Wales. For scalloped hammerheads separate stocks between the two jurisdictions were identified from the fisheriesdependent samples, however genetic exchange across borders is likely to be facilitated by movement of adult females and perhaps larger males to a lesser extent. This information will greatly assist compliance with the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) for shark fisheries in north-eastern Australia by providing the necessary basis for robust assessment of the status of stocks of the study species, thereby helping to deliver their sustainable harvest. It also helps to achieve objectives of the Australian National Shark Plan. The project provides the appropriate spatial framework for future monitoring and assessment of the study species. This is at a time when shark fisheries are receiving close attention from all sectors and when monitoring programs are being implemented, aimed at better assessment of stock status. This project has provided the crucial information for developing an appropriate monitoring design as well as the necessary basis for making statements about stock status. The project has addressed research priorities identified by the Queensland Fisheries Research Advisory Board, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Queensland Fisheries. Previously management has assumed a single stock for each species on the east coast of Queensland, and management of shark fisheries in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland has been independent of one another. The project has been able to enhance and develop links between research, management and industry. Strong positive relationships with commercial fishers were crucial in the collection of samples throughout the study area and fisheries managers were part of the project team throughout the study period. During the project the study area was extended to include both Queensland and NSW waters, creating mutualistic and positive links between the States‚Äô research and management agencies. Extension of project results included management representatives from NSW and Queensland, as well as the Northern Territory where similar shark fisheries operate and similar species are targeted. The project was able to provide significant human capital development opportunities providing considerable value to the project outcomes. Use of vertebral microchemistry and life history characteristics as stock determination methods provided material for two PhD students based at James Cook University: Ron Schroeder, vertebral chemistry; and Alastair Harry, life history characteristic. The project has developed novel research methods that have great capacity for future application, including: ‚Ä¢ Development of a simple and rapid genetic diagnostic tool (RT-HRM-PCR assay) for differentiating among the black tip shark species, for which no simple morphological identifier exists; and ‚Ä¢ Development of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) methods for analysing and interpreting microchemical composition of shark vertebrae. The study has provided further confirmation of the effectiveness of using a holistic approach in stock structure studies and justifies investment into such studies...|$|R
