25|$|I am here {{ready to}} die. I am {{not allowed to}} vindicate my character; no man shall dare to vindicate my character; and when I am {{prevented}} from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. Let <b>my</b> <b>character</b> and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall <b>my</b> <b>character</b> be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written.|$|E
25|$|Let no man {{write my}} epitaph; for as no {{man who knows}} my motives dare now vindicate them, let not {{prejudice}} or ignorance, asperse them. Let them and me rest in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, and my memory in oblivion, until other times and other men can do justice to <b>my</b> <b>character.</b> When my country takes her place among {{the nations of the}} earth, then and not till then, let my epitaph be written. I have done.|$|E
25|$|I {{thank you}} heartily for the pamphlet, {{and for the}} {{authorities}} you give me for the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since: I know not how long, they have been my creed: I believe, before even my happiness in your acquaintance and friendship, tho' they have certainly been strengthen'd and confirm'd by your conversation and instruction—in support of these principles I trust I shall ever act, and I shall continue to attempt their general propagation;—whether by the best means, is matter of speculation: but by the best, according to my judgement—nothing can make me a disciple of Paine or Priestley, nor any thing induce me to proclaim, that I am not so, but in the mode I myself think the best to resist their mischief—private conversation and private insinuation may best suit the extent of my abilities, the turn of my temper, {{and the nature of}} <b>my</b> <b>character...</b>|$|E
500|$|Colbert's fictional {{history is}} not always rigidly adhered to by the show's writers. The comedian himself says that, [...] "My character's history {{may not always be}} {{perfectly}} consistent ... There's my bio and there's <b>my</b> <b>character's</b> bio, and then there's <b>my</b> <b>character's</b> history, which is slightly different than <b>my</b> <b>character's</b> bio." [...] His early life, prior to becoming host of The Colbert Report, is expanded upon in I Am America (And So Can You!).|$|R

25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve <b>my</b> <b>character,</b> I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|A {{friend of}} Costa's hired to chronicle the party. Flame was {{discovered}} through his personal YouTube video blog.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Hum TV Farhat states that, [...] "Diyar-e-Dil as a novel was not my best thing. It could have been written better which I tried {{to do in the}} script. I personally feel Diyar-e-Dils script is far better than the original novel. I'm planning to rewrite Diyar-e-Dil novel with all the additions that I've made for the script. In my opinion Diyar e-Dil script is my best script till date. Diyar e Dil critics can disagree with me." [...] Commenting on characters, she emphasized that they are based on, [...] "Family ties, relationships and love. It was a journey which <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> took to find out whether love is enough for us or do we need blood relations also? Can a person survive without his/her parents, siblings and family? <b>My</b> <b>characters</b> chose different paths and some of them later regret their decisions. How one generation's mistakes bring troubles to the next generation was also a big problem which <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> faced." ...|$|R

500|$|Claudia Christian as Lieutenant Helga Sinclair, Rourke's German second-in-command and lieutenant. Christian {{described}} her character as [...] "sensual" [...] and [...] "striking".

500|$|Colbert {{occasionally}} makes {{comments that}} he would also make were he not in character.

500|$|Chopra {{said she}} studied method acting {{to make her}} {{character}} seem real. The actress said that her character is determined and added, [...] "While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry". [...] Addressing rumours that the film was an exposé of the fashion industry, she said, [...] "It is nothing like that. Whatever problems that come up to <b>my</b> <b>character</b> in the film are {{not because of the}} profession but because of the choices that <b>my</b> <b>character</b> makes in her life". Ranaut said, [...] "In this script <b>my</b> <b>character</b> is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting." [...] Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described [...] as [...] "outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} during the European tour, guitarist Carlos Alomar ripped a {{ligament}} in his leg, an injury that caused him to change his on-stage character. Said Alomar, [...] " [...] had to change <b>my</b> <b>character</b> into the mad, limping Mad Max reject with spiky hair. I went to a chiropractor and asked him {{for a lot of}} metal stuff -- leg braces, back braces and everything. Now I'll be adding more metal as the show progresses." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I didn't dare judge <b>my</b> <b>character</b> before I {{did that}} scene. Andre Braugher doesn't judge Frank Pembleton about being right or wrong. It's {{a way for}} me to remain blessedly free of conscience. But for me the beauty of that scene was that we really dared to get into it. Typically in TV shows we skim over the edges of issues like water spiders, {{spouting}} platitudes and spouting unearned 'clarifying' emotions. But there were no violins strumming in 'Black and Blue'." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Making {{statement}} in my fiction through <b>my</b> <b>characters,</b> their interactions and {{the usage of}} form are more important for me than crafting a perfect linear story that makes a reader comfortable. My form aims to skew {{the dynamics of the}} situation.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{only know}} I like <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> {{to walk in}} clouds, I like {{a little bit of}} the fairy tale. As long as I'm there behind the camera lens, I'll let {{somebody}} else photograph the ugliness of the world." [...] - Leo McCarey ...|$|R
50|$|The author notes that,"no {{character}} is modeled after one specific person I read about, rather <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> are modeled on many different people I both read about and interviewed."She said that, between 1945 and May 1948, some 69,000 Jews traveled to Mandate Palestine and entered illegally.|$|R
500|$|Back then I didn't {{realize the}} power of <b>my</b> <b>character.</b> [...] I didn't realize the image I had created and {{what it meant to}} so many people. [...] Ruth was so underwritten, so what I was able to bring to it was what made it special to me. [...] The looks, the affection, the pats on the head, the tone and inflection. [...] I got to bring that to her character, and that was all I thought there was. [...] I didn't know what was being {{received}} {{on the other side of}} the screen.|$|E
500|$|Blumenfeld has {{described}} how his character [...] "sort of evolved" [...] from being [...] "super needy [...] weird" [...] to [...] "a little crazier", but that [...] "the root of <b>my</b> <b>character</b> {{is still the}} same, the insecurity of it". Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he is}} [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe the things that he thinks I also think but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E
500|$|The spanking thing started because I {{believed}} that <b>my</b> <b>character</b> in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character. Warren [...] asked me to write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of short stories is a study in varying degrees of isolation. I've drawn characters into moments of significant dynamism, when their relationships with the world around them are changing. These changes are often catalyzed by some external event, or chain of events, and <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> respond to these changes by constructing solitary hiding places enabling them to buffer themselves from the world. Bertha, of "Food and Shelter," hides beneath her dining room table. Gloria, of "Collections," hides inside too-tight suits. James, of "Climbing to the Roof," hides at a buffet, cultivating a relationship with food. I've attempted to unravel the particular sets of logic that drive <b>my</b> <b>characters,</b> and travel with them as they vacillate, attempting to weave their interior lives into relationships with other people...|$|R
5000|$|The 1999 novel The Funnies, by J. Robert Lennon, {{centered}} around a dysfunctional family whose late patriarch drew a cartoon similar to The Family Circus. Lennon later said, {{although there was}} a [...] "resemblance", he did not [...] "know anything about Bil Keane and made up <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> from scratch." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{his adopted}} persona of {{that of a}} failed musician, Cameron notes, [...] "I write about the outlier, the table-for-one guy, the guy whose life is a {{constellation}} of microscopic tragedies. Failure has been underexplored in music. <b>My</b> <b>characters</b> come from a place where ambition, crippling self-doubt and tragedy intersect." ...|$|R
500|$|Moynahan {{made her}} feature-film {{debut in the}} 2000 comedy-drama Coyote Ugly as Rachel, a bartender/dancer in a wild New York bar, a role that is {{considered}} Moynahan's breakthrough. She had accepted the role because she [...] "thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women…and <b>my</b> <b>character</b> was so strong and independent". The film garnered generally unfavorable critical reviews, but was a box-office success, earning $133million worldwide. Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack's character.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Murphy {{starred in}} Red Lights with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character {{who is a}} paranormal investigator. [...] Murphy considered working with De Niro to {{have been one of}} the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: [...] "My first scene when I come to visit him <b>my</b> <b>character</b> is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I {{was first}} {{told about the}} storyline, I felt honoured to be given such a big opportunity. But I was also aware that I had a huge {{responsibility}} {{to get it right}} and do justice to those suffering in real life. [...] Because Sam has chemotherapy, I was asked if I'd be willing to shave off my hair, and I said, [...] "Absolutely," [...] which is why I'm bald. I've also done a lot of research, and try hard to separate <b>my</b> <b>character</b> from my life off-screen, but I feel guilty {{that at the end of}} each day I can walk away from the illness, when many aren't so fortunate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, you see, Miss Sylvia," [...] I explained, flattered beyond {{measure that}} <b>my</b> <b>characters</b> {{had seemed so}} real to her, [...] "that would spoil the story. It would have no reason for {{existence}} then. Its motif is simply his mastery over self. He believes {{it to be the}} nobler course." ...|$|R
