5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E

40|$|NoCalcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> are {{important}} minerals found in sedimentary environments. Although sandstones {{are the most}} common rock colonized by endolith organisms, the production of calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> is important in survival strategies of organisms and as a source for the removal of oxalate ions. Extremophile organisms in some situations may convert or destroy carbonates of calcium and magnesium, which gives important information about the conditions under which these organisms can survive. The identification on the surface of Mars of 'White Rock' formations, in Juventae Chasma or Sabaea Terra, as possibly carbonate rocks makes the study of these minerals a prerequisite of remote Martian exploration. Here, we show the protocol for the identification by Raman spectroscopy of different calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and we present a database of relevance in the search for life, extinct or extant, on Mars; this will be useful for the assessment of data obtained from remote, miniaturized Raman spectrometers now proposed for Mars exploration...|$|R

25|$|The factor {{controlling}} the mineral assemblage is the partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} within the metamorphic fluid, called the XCO2. If XCO2 is above 0.5, the metamorphic reactions favor formation of talc, magnesite (<b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate),</b> and tremolite amphibole. These are classed as talc-carbonation reactions.

25|$|Serpentinite {{sequestration}} {{is favored}} {{because of the}} non-toxic and stable nature of <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> The ideal reactions involve the magnesium endmember components of the olivine (reaction 1) or serpentine (reaction 2), the latter derived from earlier olivine by hydration and silicification (reaction 3). The presence of iron in the olivine or serpentine reduces the efficiency of sequestration, since the iron components of these minerals break down to iron oxide and silica (reaction 4).|$|E
