Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the condition of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to mix water into the milk before the day-break. The girl refused by reminding her mother of the order given by the Caliph. When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present and he would not know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar I was so pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to a man who would rule over Arabia. Umar II was the son of Asim's daughter from this marriage (Abdul Hakam, pp 17-18).|$|E
25|$|The {{reactivity}} of NaBH4 {{can be enhanced}} or augmented {{by a variety of}} compounds. Oxidation with iodine in tetrahydrofuran gives the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex, which can reduce carboxylic acids. Likewise, the NaBH4-MeOH system, formed by the addition of methanol to sodium borohydride in refluxing THF, reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols. <b>Mixing</b> <b>water</b> or an alcohol with the borohydride converts some of it into unstable hydride ester, which is more efficient at reduction, but the reductant will eventually decompose spontaneously to give hydrogen gas and borates. The same reaction can run also intramolecularly: an α-ketoester converts into a diol, since the alcohol produced will attack the borohydride to produce an ester of the borohydride, which then reduces the neighboring ester. The combination of NaBH4 with carboxylic acids results in the formation of acyloxyborohydride species. These can perform a variety of reductions not normally associated with borohydride chemistry, such as alcohols to hydrocarbons and nitriles to primary amines.|$|E

2500|$|The {{clay body}} is a {{necessary}} component of pottery. Clay must be mined and purified in an often laborious process, and certain tribes have ceremonial protocols to gathering clay. Different tribes have different processes for processing clay, which can include drying in the sun, soaking in water for days, and repeatedly running through a screen or sieve. Acoma and other Pueblo pottery traditionally pound dry clay into a powder and then remove impurities by hand, then running the dry powder through a screen, mixing it with a dry temper, and then <b>mixing</b> <b>water</b> to create a plastic paste.

To achieve this target, different localities affected by <b>mixed</b> irrigation <b>water</b> were selected at Tamia Districts, Fayoum Governorate. Aerial photo-interpretation followed by conventional field check and laboratory analyses were integrated with the GIS to provide a suitable base map for the study. The main physical and chemical characteristics of 52 soil profiles, representing the different mapping units, were stored into ILWIS GIS. The Geopedologic aspects of the area were assessed and discussed. Three map units were selected from the geographic database {{in such a way}} that part of the unit is irrigated with fresh water and the other part with <b>mixed</b> <b>water.</b> An obvious increase of the micro elements and heavy metals concentration (Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn) in the <b>mixed</b> <b>water,</b> as compared to the fresh water, is recorded.

Water type had significant effects on matthiola flower yield and quality produced. In general, the three Matthiola cultivars produced the highest flower yields kg m - 2 when irrigated with the UF water type compared to the EF and <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatments. The significantly highest flower yield was recorded for the yellow and lavender cultivars irrigated with the UF water type, while the lowest flower yields were recorded for the three cultivars irrigated with the <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatment. This increase in flower yield weight was accompanied with better flower quality and higher percentages of tissue dry weight. At {{the end of the}} season, the highest macro and micro elements concentrations were recorded in soil plots irrigated with EF water type compared to the UF and <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatments. In both soil depths, P, Ca and Mg showed very low levels while K highly accumulated. Mn and Cu showed high concentrations in soil plots irrigated with the EF and UF water types compared to the <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatment. Fe and Zn highly exceeded the adequate levels in both soil depths when irrigated with EF and UF <b>water</b> types. The <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> type showed much less salinity build-up compared to the EF and UF related to higher concentrations of Na in both soil depths. The three matthiola cultivars tolerated the medium salinity levels of the UF water type which seems to be optimal indicated by the highest cut flowers and quality produced. The highest calculated water use efficiency was given by three matthiola cultivars when irrigated with the UF water type while the least was recorded for <b>Mix</b> <b>water</b> treatment used for the three cultivars...|$|R

This species is biennial; it spends most of its life in fresh-water, but undertakes a short catadromous migration to the sea for reproduction. Reproduction occurs from March-June.

Males die after copulation; ovigerous females return upstream by walking or swimming, where their eggs develop and hatch, after which the females also die.
