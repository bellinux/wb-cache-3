CO and ozone concentrations show a common minimum in summer and in the <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean. They have higher values in other seasons and in the continental <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> that have passed over mainland Asia and the East Asian coast. CO shows the maximum monthly median of 457 – 552 ppbv in winter while ozone shows a maximum of 40 – 50 ppbv in autumn and a distinct peak of 41 – 43 ppbv in spring. The CO concentrations especially in the continental <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> (median of 277 to 428 ppbv) are very high when compared with measurements {{in most parts of the}} world.

The main purpose of this letter is {{to demonstrate that the}} cloud phase assumption made in previous cirrus clouds retrievals using infrared split window signatures is not relevant. Coincident observations of the Earth surface from ERS- 2 and ADEOS- 1 satellites give us the opportunity to compare clouds infrared signatures, as observed by ATSR- 2 onboard ERS- 2, with cloud thermodynamic phase derived from POLDER onboard ADEOS- 1. We find out, firstly, that large Brightness Temperature Differences (BTD), estimated between 11 and 12 µm, may occured for cold liquid water clouds consisting of small supercooled droplets (i. e. altostratus). These BTDs have no longer been attributed to cirrus clouds as previous studies have been. Secondly, the probability to observe ice or water clouds with respect to their cloud top temperature is quantified for our data set. A sharp transition between the ice and water phase is shown for cloud top temperatures ranging between 240 and 260 K. The probability for a cloud to be composed of super-cooled liquid droplets is shown to be higher over land than over ocean.

During the night the inland air cools faster than the air over the Mediterranean Sea. Consequently, this colder air may move offshore, forming a coastal front when interacting with the warmer and moister <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> which is lifted over the colder air. Then clouds and precipitation may occur. In this mechanism {{the depth of the}} cold air mass (H) {{plays an important role in}} theformation of clouds and precipitation.

Moreover, if H is higher than the corresponding level of free convection convective clouds are formed. H is estimated from the mesoscale simulations at an hourly scale, as well as taking the average and maximum values during the whole night. Furthermore, several parameters related to trigger convection, the blockage effect that the cold air mass offers to the prevailing flow, the deceleration induced by cold front on the upstream maritime flow and the location of precipitation with respect to the front are estimated.

40|$|Observations of {{atmospheric}} mercury at the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station on the Atlantic coast of Ireland made from February 1996 to December 2013 are analyzed. Using meteorological analysis and a sophisticated Lagrangian dispersion model, the hourly averaged mercury concentrations {{were attributed to}} four different air mass types: baseline, local, European polluted, and sub-tropical maritime. Monthly median Hg concentrations of all types decreased over the analyzed period but the trend for subtropical maritime air masses was with - 0. 016 +/- 0. 002 ng m(- 3) yr(- 1) in absolute terms significantly smaller than the trends for all other classes which varied between - 0. 021 and - 0. 023 ng m(- 3) yr(- 1). The seasonal variation for sub-tropical maritime air masses is also shallower than for all other classes. This is most likely due to shallower seasonal variation of oxidant concentrations at lower latitudes. The north-south gradient of the trend is qualitatively consistent with the GEOS-Chem model predictions based on decrease of mercury concentrations in surface waters of the North Atlantic but the trends are smaller than predicted. Tests for temporal change of the trends indicate that the decreasing trends of mercury concentrations are leveling off for all air masses with possible exception of the sub-tropical <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> Quantitative assessment of the trend changes, however, will require a longer time series of the mercury measurements at Mace Head.

Four accumulation time series spanning 1930 – 1985 show a pattern of accumulation related to <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> incursions over the East Antarctic ice sheet slope, which is regionally consistent on interannual and interdecadal timescales. The temporal accumulation pattern in Wilkes Land shows decadal fluctuations of ± 10 %. Both these fluctuations and the overall trend of increasing accumulation since the middle 1960 s are consistent with a poleward shift and intensification of the circumpolar trough. This {{is consistent with a}} shift toward the high index state of the southern annular mode. Interannual variability of snow accumulation rate throughout Wilkes Land was found to be dependent upon shifts in the preferred tracks of cyclones along or across the coast and in the location of cyclolysis regions. Significant differences in this temporal accumulation pattern over Wilkes Land can occur {{as a result of the}} time-varying location of atmospheric ridging and the circumpolar long-wave structure south of New Zealand and Australia. Snow accumulation at an additional site (GD 09) displays a well-defined interdecadal pattern, and the mean annual nitrate (NO₃⁻) concentration of snow is correlated to the winter sea level pressure gradient between East Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic and the upper geopotential height and zonal wind data over East Antarctica.

The scale in which coastal fronts occurs in the West Mediterranean basin (WMB) is investigated by using remote sensing instruments (weather radar and satellite) and mesoscale numerical simulations by using the WRF model. Two types of atmospheric dynamic forming coastal fronts in the WMB are noticed in this area Nocturnal coastal fronts develop within the meso-beta and meso-gamma scales during the night when drainage winds move offshore the inland cold air (Mazon and Pino, 2013, 2014). When this air mass interacts with the warmer and wetter <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> cloud and rain may appear having an area from 20 km to 150 - 200 km, and lasting from 3 to 10 hours occurs.

This type of cold fronts moves offshore southward until north Africa, reaching 2000 km and lasting around 30 hours. By using the version 3. 3 of WRF mesoscale model three coastal fronts are simulated and characterized, which cover the whole mesoscale.

Forest ecosystems are dynamic entities that {{are subject to}} a variety of biotic and abiotic environmental changes. Invariably, climate is one of the principal factors controlling the distribution of ecosystems and past fluctuations in climate are known to have shaped the Midwestern United States forests. The Upper Great Lakes region of North America includes Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and is characterized by a gradual south to north climatic gradient that defines the eastern deciduous forests (oak-hickory) to the south, the northern mixed hardwood forests (maple, hemlock, and beech) in northern Michigan and Wisconsin, and the sub-boreal forest (spruce-fir) in the far northern parts of the region. Additionally, the Upper Great Lakes region lies at the intersection of three major contrasting air masses: the cold, dry, polar continental air mass descending from the north; the dry, continental westerlies; and the warm, moist, tropical <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> coming from the Gulf of Mexico. Interactions among these three air masses have created a southwest to northeast climatic gradient across the region resulting in a drier and warmer environment in southwest Minnesota as opposed to wetter and cooler conditions in Upper Michigan. It is in this context that the Upper Great Lakes region ecosystems were formed. They include the prairie-forest border (Zone 1), a transition zone between the tall grass prairies and the northern forests in Minnesota; the forest interior (Zone 2), which extends beyond the prairie-forest border into northern Wisconsin; and the deep forest (Zone 3), which lies in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. In recent years, numerous concerns about global environmental changes and their impact on the Upper Great Lakes northern hardwood forests have emerged. Increases of temperature caused by ongoing climate change, along with the proliferation of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations and invasive European earthworms are predicted to drastically change the overstory and understory of northern hardwood forests. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is a common late successional species in the Great Lakes region and is widespread in dry mesic to mesic northern temperate forests. Sugar maple forests provide habitat for many wildlife species while trees are valued for their products (e. g. timber and syrup). This PhD dissertation aims to advance the understanding of the Upper Great Lakes northern hardwood forests by studying sugar maple forest community dynamics across an environmental gradient from prairie-forest border to interior forest biome and discuss their future in a context of global environmental changes. Rather than adopting a field-based approach, 3515 plots including tree and seedling data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program were studied, with 378 plots in Zone 1, 1823 plots in Zone 2, and 1314 plots in Zone 3. Analyses incorporated a combination of ordinations (Bray-Curtis and successional vector overlay), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models, and Aikaike's Information Criteria (AIC) provided a means for model selection. Chapter 1 investigated the contemporary overstory and understory forest composition of sugar maple communities and successional dynamics across the Upper Great Lakes region, and considered three hypotheses: (1) hardwood forests form a series of distinct communities via association of sugar maple with other tree species in the overstory across the Upper Great Lakes region; (2) sugar maple dominates the understory and succession to sugar maple is occurring in all of the communities [...] therefore the overstory communities identified are not stable; and (3) mesophication (which was used as a broad concept to include increasing maple proportion within mixed maple-oak forests) in sugar maple-red oak communities is progressing towards greater dominance of sugar maple. Sugar maple dominated forests were identified in association with red oak, bur oak-aspen, and basswood at the prairie-forest border, red oak-red maple, quaking aspen, and basswood in the forest interior, and quaking aspen, red maple-balsam fir, and hemlock-yellow birch-white cedar in the deep forest of Upper Michigan. Mesophication is occurring in most sugar maple-red oak communities of the prairie-forest border and sugar maple regeneration dominates in combination with white ash, ironwood, and bitternut hickory (Zone 1), red maple, balsam fir, and ironwood (Zone 2), and balsam fir (Zone 3), indicating that the distinct overstory communities may not be stable and that sites are trending towards relative homogeneity. However, despite the regeneration success of sugar maple, some stands had no sugar maple regeneration and we predict a decline in future sugar maple abundance resulting from the long term effects of deer browsing, earthworm invasion, and increased drought effects due to global environmental change. In Chapter 2, tree and seedling richness-site productivity relationships were examined in sugar maple forests of the Upper Great Lakes region. First, the form of the species richness-site productivity relationship of the overstory and understory of sugar maple forests was investigated on three data sets (i. e. whole data set, upper 90 th quantile subset, and random sample subset) by testing the null hypothesis that the species richness-site productivity is flat. The alternative hypotheses were that the richness-site productivity relationship is 1) hump-shaped, 2) positive monotonic, 3) negative monotonic, and 4) U-shaped. Second, after noticing that sugar maple abundance approached 100 % on some plots, the existence of threshold effects of sugar maple abundance on species richness was investigated by testing the null hypothesis that no threshold effect exists (i. e. species richness decreases linearly with increase sugar maple abundance) against that alternative that there is a threshold effect of sugar maple abundance (i. e. species richness display threshold responses to increase basal area). Results varied across zones and data sets, indicating that sample size might be influencing the results. Overall, there was a significant positive relationship between tree richness and site productivity but a flat seedling richness-site productivity relationship. The addition of sugar maple basal area to the models greatly improved the results. There was no apparent threshold effect but sugar maple abundance had very strong negative effect on species richness, which appeared to increase from the prairie-forest border towards Upper Michigan. Chapter 3 focused on the ecological niche of sugar maple seedlings from the prairie-forest border to the interior of the forest biome. Sugar maple seedling sensitivity to current forest structure and composition (sugar maple basal area and stand age), as well as site level environmental conditions (sand proportion, soil depth, slope, and TRASP - an index related to aspect) was assessed under the hypothesis that sugar maple seedlings respond differently to environment variables across the region and have a broader environmental niche in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan than at the prairie-forest border. As expected, basal area of sugar maple was generally positively related to sugar maple seedling density, while the effects of % sand and soil depth varied across the three zones. TRASP, an index related to aspect, had a strong negative influence on seedling abundance at the prairie-forest border and interior zones (Zones 1 and 2, respectively), but had no influence in the deep interior zone (Zone 3). The overall interpretation of the models and patterns across the climate gradient indicated that sugar maple seedling abundance is currently insensitive to environmental variables (i. e. has a very broad environmental niche) in Upper Michigan, with many stands currently growing on sites with relatively high percent sand content, shallow soils, and southerly slopes. The expected shift in future climate would make the climate of Upper Michigan like that of the prairie-forest border by late 21 st century, thereby reducing the probability of seedling establishment on many sites currently with high dominance of sugar maple. Additionally, high deer populations and earthworm invasion will narrow the niche of sugar maple in Upper Michigan even more so than changing climate alone...|$|E

However, periods in which continental <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> predominate may occur {{at any time of}} the year and can lead to heat waves in the summer and prolonged periods of frost in the winter. In general though, extremes are rare in Bremen and temperatures below -15 C and above 35 C occur only once every couple of years. The record high temperature was 37.6 C on 9 August 1992, while the record low temperature was -23.6 C on 13 February 1940. Being at some distance from the main North Sea, Bremen still has a somewhat wider temperature range than Bremerhaven that is located on the mouth of Weser.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditions}} of the park are defined by a temperate Atlantic climate, with Mediterranean characteristics. Within the headlands of the Olo River it is influenced by <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> that rise over {{the limits of the}} park in the east. This situation results in heavy precipitation during the winter months. These months are cold and rainy, with frequent snow showers in the high altitudes, while in the summer it is dry and warm. The major concentration of rain occurs in the colder months, while during the dry periods there is little rainfall, or concentrated in one month. The variation in slope allows for a diverse microclimate, with different vegetation between high and low altitudes. The combination of microclimatic conditions and rainfall has resulted in a lush landscape.|$|R
