The biochip, which has dimensions of 2 mm x 2 mm, comprises a central membrane having a diameter of 200 ?m, and 20 bond pads with metal tracks leading to the membrane. The packaged biochip provides a fluidic interface to the cartridge as well as electrical interfaces to the biochip electronics being located in a readout instrument. The packaging method ensures the strict separation between the wet sensing area and the electrical contacts.

The purpose of the present numerical study was to determine, in a basic way, how the relative size of a single horizontal frame member mounted in the center of the window affects this convective heat transfer rate. A recessed window has been considered. The flow has been assumed to be steady and both laminar and turbulent flows have been considered.

In RM 3 integration, partially processed heterostructure devices are placed in recesses formed in the dielectric layers covering the surface of an integrated circuit chip, the surface is planarized, and monolithic processing is continued to transform the heterostructures into optoelectronic devices monolithically integrated with the underlying electronic circuitry. Two different RM 3 techniques have been investigated, Aligned Pillar Bonding (APB) and OptoPill Assembly (OPA). APB integrates lattice mismatched materials using aligned, selective area wafer bonding at reduced temperature (under 3500 C), which protects the electronic chips from the adverse effects of high temperatures, and reduces the thermal expansion mismatch concerns. In the OPA technique, optoelectronic heterostructures are processed into circular pills of 8 gm height and 45 gm diameter, the pills are released from the substrate, and collected through a process that involves decanting. (cont.) The pills are then assembled into recesses on silicon chips using manual pick & place techniques, and they are bonded to the metal pads on the bottom surface of the recesses using a Cu-AuSn solder bond.

A cross-section of the drug-treated tissue was then blotted onto a cellulose membrane, precoated in matrix (-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA)), by airspray deposition. In separate experiments the tissue surface was treated with Nizoral within a triangular former, and subsequently blotted onto a matrix-coated membrane. Sample membranes were then <b>mounted</b> into the <b>recess</b> of specialised MALDI targets with adhesive tape.

Treatment of the tissue within a template gave rise to images depicting the expected distribution of the drug, demonstrating that this technique is capable of producing spatially useful data. Ion images demonstrating the permeation of the applied compound into the skin were achieved by imaging a cross-sectional imprint of treated tissue. A calibration graph for the determination of ketoconazole was prepared using the sodium adduct of the matrix ion as an internal standard.

40|$|Cloud-cavitation, often {{formed by}} the {{breakdown}} and collapse of a sheet or vortex cavity, is responsible for severe cavitation noise and erosion damage. This thesis describes an experimental investigation of the dynamics and acoustics of cloud cavitation on a three dimensional hydrofoil and examines the injection of air {{as a means of}} noise suppression. Part one of this work examines the large amplitude impulsive pressures which were measured on the suction surface of an oscillating hydrofoil experiencing cloud cavitation and these pressure pulses are correlated with the observation of shock waves propagating through the bubbly mixture. <b>Recess</b> <b>mounted</b> transducers were used to measure unsteady pressures at four locations along the chord of the suction surface of a hydrofoil. By examining the transducer output, two distinct types of pressure pulses were identified. Local pulses occurred at a single transducer location and were randomly distributed in position and time. Conversely, global pulses were registered by all the transducers almost simultaneously. The location of the global pulses relative to the foil oscillation was quite repeatable and these events produced substantial far-field noise. Correlation of the transducer output with high speed movies of the cavitation revealed that the global pulses were produced by a large scale collapse of the bubble cloud. Conversely, local pulses were generated by local disturbances in the bubbly mixture characterized by large changes in void fraction. The large pressure pulse associated with the local and global cavitation structures, the geometric coherence of their boundaries and the nearly discrete change in void fraction across the boundaries of these structures indicate that these structures consist of bubbly shock waves. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the current experiments and the numerical, analytic and experimental bubbly shock wave analysis of other investigators support this conclusion. Part two of this work examines the dramatic reduction in cloud cavitation noise due to both continuous and pulsed injection of air into the cavitating region of the foil. At sufficient air flow rates, the radiated noise could be reduced by a factor greater than 200 relative to the noise produced without air injection. Unsteady surface pressure measurements also showed a reduction in the acoustic impulse with air injection by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude. An explanation for this noise reduction can be found by examining the high speed motion pictures. The presence of the non-condensible gas in the cavitation cloud is shown to prevent any rapid or coherent collapse process. Although the formation of local structures is still observed, the presence of air in the bubbles diminishes both the magnitude and the frequency of occurrence of local pressure pulses. Finally, pulsed air injection results in a lower acoustic impulse than the impulse obtained by injecting the same mass of air continuously over the entire oscillation cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} process using magnetic forces to assemble micro-components into recesses on silicon based integrated circuits. Patterned SmCo magnetic thin films at the bottom of recesses are used to provide forces to orient, align and retain micro-devices on silicon. The overall objective is to obtain functionalities not readily available from silicon device structures alone. This thesis was done in the context of assembling optoelectronic devices, specifically integrating vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), edge-emitting lasers (EELs), and light emitting diodes(LEDs) onto commercially processed Si-CMOS circuits. This method, magnetically assisted statistical assembly (MASA), incorporates past methods such as Fluidic Assisted Self- Assembly (FASA) and <b>Recess</b> <b>Mounting</b> with Monolithic Metalization (RM 3). Specifically, MASA addresses the main limitation to the FASA method by adding a magnetic layer as a restraint to keep assembled components correctly positioned in recesses until the time bonding may occur. Thus, all components may be permanently bonded into place simultaneously saving both time and money. This thesis will present simulations using Ansoft's Maxwell 3 d providing general behavioral intuition for the behavior of a device over a target magnetic substrate. These results include using a rectangle instead of a circular disc and making recess depths greater than 2 pm to overcome gravitational forces when inverting the substrate. Patterns of SmCo magnetic material, based on results from the simulations, included 50 x 100 [mu]m recesses containing either a solid rectangle, thirty 5 x 10 [mu]m rectangular pads, eighteen 5 x 10 m rectangular pads or four 5 x 10 m rectangular pads. (cont.) Patterns of SmCo material also were experimented with using 50 x 50 [mu]m square recesses containing either a solid square or nine 5 x 5 [mu]m square pads. Experiments with various rectangular patterns showed evidence that upside down devices do not retain as well as right side up devices. It was also seen that four 5 xl 0 [mu]m rectangular pads did not have enough magnetic material to retain even right side up devices. Solid rectangular patterns were also determined to have too much magnetic material to align and orient the device without recesses. Once recesses were added to the experiments, the pattern with thirty 5 x 10 m rectangles proved to assemble the most devices with an assembly ratio of 90 %. However problems occurred with fabricating perfect device shapes and thus mis-shapened devices were counted in the assembly ratio. Results from experimenting with square patterns with recesses show a 88 % assembly ratio with a solid square pattern. This {{may be due to the}} symmetry of the square devices and therefore has higher probability of assembly than that of the rectangular devices. by Diana I. Cheng. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|The {{multimodal}} {{friction ignition}} tester (MFIT) is a testbed for experiments on the thermal and mechanical effects of friction on material specimens in pressurized, oxygen-rich atmospheres. In simplest terms, a test involves recording sensory data while rubbing two specimens {{against each other}} at a controlled normal force, with either a random stroke or a sinusoidal stroke having controlled amplitude and frequency. The term multimodal in the full name of the apparatus refers to a capability for imposing any combination of widely ranging values of the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric oxygen content, stroke length, stroke frequency, and normal force. The MFIT was designed especially for studying the tendency toward heating and combustion of nonmetallic composite materials and the fretting of metals subjected to dynamic (vibrational) friction forces {{in the presence of}} liquid oxygen or pressurized gaseous oxygen test conditions approximating conditions expected to be encountered in proposed composite material oxygen tanks aboard aircraft and spacecraft in flight. The MFIT includes a stainless-steel pressure vessel capable of retaining the required test atmosphere. Mounted atop the vessel is a pneumatic cylinder containing a piston for exerting the specified normal force between the two specimens. Through a shaft seal, the piston shaft extends downward into the vessel. One of the specimens is mounted on a block, denoted the pressure block, {{at the lower end of}} the piston shaft. This specimen is pressed down against the other specimen, which is <b>mounted</b> in a <b>recess</b> in another block, denoted the slip block, that can be moved horizontally but not vertically. The slip block is driven in reciprocating horizontal motion by an electrodynamic vibration exciter outside the pressure vessel. The armature of the electrodynamic exciter is connected to the slip block via a horizontal shaft that extends into the pressure vessel via a second shaft seal. The reciprocating horizontal motion can be chosen to be random with a flat spectrum over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 kHz, or to be sinusoidal at any peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0. 8 in. (. 2 cm) and fixed or varying frequency up to 1 kHz. The temperatures of the specimen and of the vessel are measured by thermocouples. A digital video camera mounted outside the pressure vessel is aimed into the vessel through a sapphire window, with its focus fixed on the interface between the two specimens. A position transducer monitors the displacement of the pneumatic-cylinder shaft. The pressure in the vessel is also monitored. During a test, the output of the video camera, the temperatures, and the pneumatic-shaft displacement are monitored and recorded. The test is continued for a predetermined amount of time (typically, 10 minutes) or until either (1) the output of the position transducer shows a sudden change indicative of degradation of either or both specimens, (2) ignition or another significant reaction is observed, or (3) pressure in the vessel increases beyond a pre-set level that triggers an automatic shutdown...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{launch vehicle}} {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{is a field}} best studied through experimentation, which is often {{carried out in the}} form of large scale wind tunnel testing. Measurement of the fluctuating pressures induced by the boundary layer noise is customarily made with miniature pressure transducers installed into a model of the vehicle of interest. Literature shows that noise level increases between two to five decibels (dB referenced to 20 micropascal) can be induced when the transducer surface is not mounted perfectly flush with the model outer surface. To reduce this artificially induced noise, special transducer holders have been used for aeroacoustic wind tunnel testing by NASA. This holder is a sleeve into which the transducer fits, with a cap that allows it to be <b>mounted</b> in a <b>recessed</b> hole in the model. A single hole in the holder allows the transport of the tunnel medium so the transducer can discriminate the fluctuating pressure due to the turbulent boundary layer noise. The holder is first dry fitted into the model and any difference in height between the holder and the model surface can be sanded flush. The holder is then removed from the model, the transducer glued inside the holder, and the holder replaced in the model, secured also with glue, thus eliminating the problem of noise level increases due to lack of flushness. In order to work with this holder design, special transducers have been ordered with their standard screen removed and the diaphragm moved as close {{to the top of the}} casing as possible to minimize any cavity volume. Although this greatly reduces induced noise due to the transducers being out of flush, the holders can also induce a cavity resonance that is usually at a very high frequency. This noise is termed transducer mount induced noise (XMIN). The peak of the mode can vary with the cavity depth, boundary layer noise that can excite the mode, tunnel flow medium, and the build of the transducers. Because the boundary layer flow interaction with the microphone holder seems to have some effect on the cavity resonance response, the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) aeroacoustic team postulated that changing the design of the holder might reduce the cavity resonance response. An experiment was performed at the MSFC Trisonic Wind Tunnel comparing a new holder design with the traditional MSFC holder. The new holder design is intended to mimic the Kulite Semiconductors, Inc. B-screen, where the single hole of the traditional MSFC holder is replaced by a series of ten 0. 007 inch diameter holes. This particular design serves to protect the transducer diaphragm as in the manufacturer's B-screen, but also increases the frequency of the XMIN such that it is not apparent in the data collected from aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests. MSFC compared the two holder designs by installing two transducers in standard holders on one side of a ten inch long ten degree cone, and two transducers in B-screen holders on the opposite side for a series of runs at different conditions. Over 11 - 13 February, 2013, the model was run at Mach numbers between 0. 80 and 1. 96 at angles of attack at 0 deg, plus or minus 1 deg, plus or minus 2 deg, plus or minus 4 deg, and plus or minus 8 deg. Model roll attitudes at 0 deg, 90 deg, and 180 deg were tested to isolate potential tunnel bias. This paper presents results from the test showing that the proposed holder design significantly reduces the influence of XMIN on measured fluctuating pressure levels...|$|R
