5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, bald eagle, osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is {{the management of the}} wildlife that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross.|$|E

5|$|Thompson and Russell {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted {{area of the}} Salmon River Mountains, Idaho. With {{the arrival of the}} Holocene interglacial, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Pleistocene glaciers receded and opened a <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> linking these southern populations to northern areas where they currently overlap with A. m. krausei and co-migrated north into the Peace River (Canada) Valley. Ferguson also noted an intergradation in the same geographic area, but between the morphological subspecies A. m. columbianum and A. m. kraisei that run parallel to the Bitterroot and Selkirk ranges. Thompson and Russell suggest that this contact zone is between two different subspecies lineages because the A. m. columbianum lineage is geographically isolated and restricted to the central Oregon Mountains.|$|E
500|$|Gull Point covers , {{of which}} [...] form the Natural Area and are closed to park {{visitors}} {{during the height}} of the bird migrations. The natural area is a safe haven and resting spot for migrating and nesting birds. Many of the species of birds that rest at Gull Point are not seen anywhere else in Pennsylvania. Presque Isle lies on the Atlantic Flyway, a major <b>migratory</b> <b>path,</b> and some of these birds migrate from as far north as the Arctic Circle to South America. They pass through in November on their long flights south and return in April on their flights north.|$|E
2500|$|Birds {{frequent}} the mountains, {{some as a}} <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> {{and others}} as native species. The migratory birds often use the area to the west as an overwintering area, and migrate north along the western slopes. In the northern canyons birds may be divided into different habitats, or more specifically, {{the different types of}} forest, leading to differences in range by altitude. Some of this difference by altitude may even extend the range of some species, enabling tropical species to use the mountain valleys for migration. Bird species endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental include tufted jay, the [...] "gray-eared" [...] subspecies of red warbler, eared quetzal, thick-billed parrot, and formerly included the imperial woodpecker, which now may be extinct.|$|E
50|$|Her {{work also}} showed that {{developing}} cortical neurons {{use a variety of}} different <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> as they move from their birthplace to their final destination in the cortex. This work stood in contrast to a prevailing theory at the time, which was that all neuronal migration in the cortex was dependent upon radial glia.|$|R

The Heard has been awarded The Audubon Society's designation as an important birding area.

5000|$|Miner {{was one of}} {{the first}} conservationists to {{determine}} the <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> of birds. In August 1909, he constructed a successful duck trap. His subject was banding with his own hand-stamped aluminum band. [...] Along with address information, his bird tags quoted scripture: [...] "Keep yourselves in the love of God—Jude 1-21" [...] and [...] "With God all things are possible—Mark 10-27". Late that year, his original band was recovered in Anderson, South Carolina. This marked the first complete record for banding migratory birds.|$|R
50|$|Climate {{change could}} be causing {{migration}} patterns to shift into {{an earlier time}} frame, coinciding with an earlier start of the growing period. This means that migratory species may leave lower altitudes for higher-altitude breeding sites while those breeding sites still lack the necessary resources. Some species that have shorter <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> {{may be able to}} return to the lower elevations and wait, but run the risk of running out of the resources in that lower altitude, such as food and cover, that may only be available for a short, set period of time.|$|R

30|$|It is {{therefore}} necessary to explore policy options for facilitating pastoralists’ continued access to resources, {{to reduce the}} risk of climate change and natural disasters and to open up new options such as eco-tourism. The Bhutanese Government will need to look into providing support for better herd management, improving <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> and resolving issues surrounding herders’ access to Tsamdros and conflicts with people in the south. Dairy product packaging, value chain development and storage for increased shelf life, vis-à-vis marketing and transport support, will be essential for TAPs to continue their livelihood and gain access to the conventional market economy.|$|R

50|$|Large white {{butterfly}} migration patterns are typically observed {{only when there}} is a disturbance. In general, the large {{white butterfly}}'s migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate Equator during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed. However, it has been hard to track entire <b>migratory</b> <b>paths,</b> since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.|$|R
