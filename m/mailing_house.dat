5000|$|Electric Semi-automatic label {{dispensers}} were first patented {{in the early}} 1970s. They were originally designed for multiple-row address labels for bulk mailing houses. On average a good <b>mailing</b> <b>house</b> employee could apply approximately 500 labels per hour to envelopes. The label dispenser increased this to over 2,000 per hour. These dispensers advance individual or multiple-row labels and remove them from their lining similar to a manual dispenser, but instead of manually pulling on the liner, label advancement occurs when a trigger on the dispenser detects {{the absence of a}} label, such as when the operator removes the label. The sensor then closes the circuit and engages the motor, dispensing the next label until the sensor once again detects the label which opens the circuit.The first electric dispenser was designed with the limit switch on the left of a 16" [...] wide machine. 4-up multiple-row labels were loaded into the machine and once activated would advance one row of labels. The operator would take the labels from right to left, so that when the leftmost label was taken, the next row advanced, automatically providing a constant supply of labels to apply. The labels are also peeled without the natural curl that will happen when pulled from the backing paper with fingers. Also, only one hand was needed to take the label, the other hand could be used to move the material the label was being applied to.|$|E

5000|$|From its {{establishment}} on June 30, 1945, the StB {{was bound}} to and controlled by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The Party used the StB {{as an instrument of}} power and repression; State Security spied on and intimidated political opponents of the Party and forged false criminal evidence against them, facilitating the Communists' rise to power in 1948. Even before Czechoslovakia became a Communist state, the StB forced confessions by means of torture, including the use of drugs, blackmail and kidnapping. After the coup d'état of 1948, these practices developed under the tutelage of Soviet advisers. Other common practices included telephone tapping, permanent watching of apartments, intercepting private <b>mail,</b> <b>house</b> searches, surveillance, arrests and indictment for so-called [...] "subversion of the republic".|$|R
