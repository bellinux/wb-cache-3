25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately <b>make</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came out the other side.|$|E

But when he came the next day, Maria was not in the drawing-room with her sister, and Miss Wirt went off for the purpose of fetching the latter, and the Captain and Miss Osborne were left together. They were both so silent that the ticktock of the Sacrifice of Iphigenia clock on the mantelpiece became quite rudely audible.|$|E

When the Cat had what he asked for he booted himself very gallantly, and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching out at length, {{as if he had been}} dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.|$|E

This satisfied the parish officers presently, and I lay in with as much credit as I could have done if I had really been my Lady Cleve, and was assisted in my travail by three or four of the best citizens' wives of Bath who lived in the neighbourhood, which, however, made me a little the more expensive to him. I often expressed my concern to him about it, but he bid me not be concerned at it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{remained}} in the carriage, while Basil visited the various points of view on Luna Island with the boy and girl. A boy is probably of considerable interest to himself, and a man looks back at his own boyhood with some pathos. But in his actuality a boy has very little to commend him to the toleration of other human beings. Tom was very well, as boys go; but now his contribution to the common enjoyment was to venture as near as possible to all perilous edges; to throw stones into the water, and to <b>make</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to throw them over precipices on the people below; to pepper his father with questions, and to collect cumbrous mementos of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms. He kept the carriage waiting a good five minutes, while he could cut his initials on a band-rail. [...] "You can {{come back and see}} 'em on your bridal tower," [...] said the driver. Isabel gave a little start, as if she had almost thought of something she was trying to think of.|$|E

60|$|Swiftly--as Orientals {{understand}} speed--with long explanations, with {{abuse and}} windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little things forgotten, the untidy camp broke up {{and led the}} half-dozen stiff and fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept dawn. Kim, regarded as Mahbub Ali's favourite by all who wished to stand well with the Pathan, was not called upon to work. They strolled on by the easiest of stages, halting every few hours at a wayside shelter. Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub Ali says, every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a horse, and, though he be over head in debt to the money-lender, must <b>make</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to buy. That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib, rolling along in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk. Some would even descend from their vehicles and feel the horses' legs; asking inane questions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly insulting the imperturbable trader.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have seen}} so many wonders, {{and each of them}} has such a voice of its own, that I sit all day long {{listening}} to the roar they <b>make</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were in a sea-shell, and have fallen into an idleness so complete, that I can't rouse myself sufficiently to go to Pisa on the twenty-fifth, when the triennial illumination of the Cathedral and Leaning Tower, and Bridges, and what not, takes place. But I have already been there; and it cannot beat St. Peter's, I suppose. So I don't think I shall pluck myself up by the roots, and go aboard a steamer for Leghorn. Let me thank you heartily for the [...] "Keepsake" [...] and the [...] "Book of Beauty." [...] They reached me a week or two ago. I have been very much struck by two papers in them--one, Landor's [...] "Conversations," [...] among the most charming, profound, and delicate productions I have ever read; the other, your lines on Byron's room at Venice. I am as sure that you wrote them from your heart, as I am that they found their way immediately to mine.|$|E
6000|$|It is a truism {{that the}} supernatural in fiction should, {{as a general}} rule, {{be left in the}} vague. In the creepiest tale I ever read, the horror lay in this--there was no ghost! You may {{describe}} a ghost with all the most hideous features that fancy can suggest--saucer eyes, red staring hair, a forked tail, and what you please--but the reader only laughs. It is wiser to <b>make</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were going to describe the spectre, and then break off, exclaiming, [...] "But no! No pen can describe, no memory, thank Heaven, can recall, the horror of that hour!" [...] So writers, as a rule, prefer to leave their terror (usually styled [...] "The Thing") entirely in the dark, and to the frightened fancy of the student. Thus, on the whole, the treatment of the supernaturally terrible in fiction is achieved in two ways, either by actual description, or by adroit suggestion, the author saying, like cabmen, [...] "I leave it to yourself, sir." [...] There are dangers in both methods; the description, if attempted, is usually overdone and incredible: the suggestion is apt to prepare us too anxiously for something that never becomes real, and to leave us disappointed.|$|E
