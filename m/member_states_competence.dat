40|$|This thesis explores EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>competence</b> to {{conclude}} an international convention governing multimodal transport liability, namely the Rotterdam Rules, {{which has been}} drafted by UNCITRAL and has been opened for signatures in 2009. There are several international maritime conventions currently in force and therefore possibly applicable for a contract of carriage, {{and this has been}} considered as one of the obstacles for boosting multimodal transport including a sea leg. If the Rotterdam Rules will enter into force {{it will be the first}} binding universal regime governing multimodal transport liability. 25 ratifications are required in order to the convention to enter into force. At the time of writing only 3 states have ratified the Rules, Spain being the only EU Member State so far. The main concern is whether the Member States ratifying the Rotterdam Rules would risk a treaty conflict stemming from EU law. This will be elaborated through the EU Treaties and from the position of an EU Member State. In order to have an understanding on the topic and the related problems, the thesis begins with an introductory part on the background, context and objectives of the Rotterdam Rules as well as some general remarks on the current state of affairs in Europe. The theoretical perspectives will cover international law considerations based on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as well as international maritime conventions from The Hague Rules to the pending Rotterdam Rules. Treaties on the European Union will be elaborated on the parts relevant for exercising competence in the area of transport. The possibility that EU would join the Rotterdam Rules along with the Member States is also discussed. While the Treaties may not provide comprehensive answer to the competence questions, relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union will be elaborated also. The Union is becoming increasingly active in transport matters. The Commission has already issued several White Papers in the field of transport. Strategic plans have been made and expert groups established for planning a regional transport regime. It will be argued that the competence of the EU has considerably expanded through the judicial activism of the Union institutions and the Court of Justice. Although the Lisbon Treaty was aimed to clarify the competence questions, the attempt was not very successful. Many ambiguities are left and these would require further clarification. The Commission and the Court have often taken a rather protective stand. The EU law shall prevail over anything else. The Union values such as unity and coherence have been used as a recourse to concerted action. Also based on the case-law it seems evident that the principles of EU law such as the duty of loyal cooperation have at times been interpreted so as to render shared competence meaningless. As the case-law suggests there are obvious risks for the Member States autonomous action. Even if the Member States possess competence they may be pre-empted to act. Under the shared competence the Member States may only exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not exercised its competence or has ceased exercising its competence. At the moment the Union has not exercised its competence on the area of multimodal transport liability, it is therefore contended that for the time being the competence lies with the Member States. The main argument of the thesis is that there is no treaty conflict foreseeable between the Rotterdam Rules and the Treaties. But there is a risk of conflict anyway. The conflict would stem from diverging interests and thus be a clash of values. If the Union would choose not {{to conclude}} the Rotterdam Rules but rather continue developing its own regime, this may be a problem for those Member States who have concluded the Rotterdam Rules. Of course on the condition that the Rotterdam Rules eventually enter into force. The poor record of signatures may imply that the Member States are not confident on their competence but it may also imply dissatisfaction with the substance of the Rotterdam Rules. It is recommended that the Member States cooperate with the Union institutions in order to avoid conflicts. A mixed agreement would be one option but that may entail practical problems as it leaves the competence questions intact. Lastly it will be elaborated whether a universal regime on the multimodal transport is achievable at all...|$|E

40|$|Summary: This article {{deals with}} the {{so-called}} internal situation rule, which prevents the application of European Community law in cases deemed to be conﬁned to one <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> Rather than focus on possible avenues for avoiding the ‘reverse discrimination’ against the actors of the regulating state (eg its own nationals) which arises because of the non-application of EC law, I assess the costs and beneﬁts of the rule directly. The approach to this problem is, ﬁrst, to conceptualise the internal situation rule as a speciﬁc, substantive requirement of EC provisions that assume cross-border movement, and not as an overarching, general principle of EC law. With this in mind, I go on {{to claim that the}} rule is largely inadequate for the purpose of protecting <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>competences.</b> Because the rule focuses on cross-border movement in the abstract sense, it does not clearly delineate an ‘internal’ sphere that <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> could regulate independently. Next, I analyse how the case law of the European Court of Justice has interpreted the internal situation rule in various areas of free movement law, concluding that the rule is overly formalistic and that it fails to distinguish between cases where there is a true impact on the internal market and those where there is not. In addition, I analyse the disparities in its application, arguing that they cannot be accounted for by the differences between, eg the free movement of goods and the free movement of persons. Finally, I suggest a more substantive approach to deﬁning internal situations, inspired in particular by public procurement and competition case law. Instead of looking for factual cross-border links, I suggest that what should be at stake is the crossborder impact of the restriction (<b>Member</b> <b>State</b> legislation, administrative measure, practice, etc) that is being challenged...|$|R

Moreover, it would lead to the paradoxical outcome that non-EU nationals who are long-term residents would be able to bring in their family members not lawfully resident in a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> under the Family Reunification Directive 2003/86 whereas a Union citizen in a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> whose nationality he does not possess might not.|$|R
40|$|The ECJ grants migrant {{citizens}} {{an increasingly}} wide {{access to the}} social security schemes of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> lacking <b>competence.</b> This line of case-law is conceptualised as creating a parallel system of social security coordination.

The system adds a layer of social security protection for migrants under the legislation of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> with which they have a privileged connection.

40|$|Lately Croatian {{officials}} have received positive signs {{with regard to}} the progress of their country towards accession. However, in order to gain membership, Croatia still needs to fulfil a number of conditions. As with the Candidate countries of the two previous enlargements, Croatia is subject to the EU pre-accession conditionality method. This method is considered to be among the most successful foreign policy instruments the EU has implemented so far. During the last two enlargement processes, it proved itself to be able to align the post-communist candidate countries with the EU acquis communautaire. However EU conditionality has not been exempt from criticisms, many of them being related to its post-accession sustainability. The strength of the instrument lies primarily in the conditional membership incentive. Hence doubts arose {{with regard to the}} compliance of the new <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> with the EU acquis once the enlargement would be effective and the membership lever would disappear. Studies on post-accession compliance suggest that the dreaded ‘eastern problem’ remains rather theoretical and has not been observed in practice. Nevertheless in specific areas resting on the EU soft acquis, such as the fight against corruption, the ‘eastern problem’ actually occurred. However, empirical evidence backed up by international organisations’ reports demonstrated that the fight against corruption has experienced some backsliding in Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria soon after their integration within the EU. The results of a comparison of the Slovene, Romanian and Bulgarian experiences advocate for a distinction between hard acquis and soft acquis since they do not produce the same degree of postaccession compliance from the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Having confronted the state of corruption in Croatia and the overall environment that underlies domestic corruption in the Slovenian, Bulgarian and Romanian experiences, this thesis establishes that a ‘Croatian problem’ similar to the ‘eastern problem’ is likely to occur as things stand at the present. Even if fighting corruption remains mostly under the scope of the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>competences,</b> the EU can have a substantial impact on the persistence of anti-corruption measures in Croatia and elsewhere if the organisation adjusts its current approach...|$|R
40|$|With {{the birth}} of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the late 1950 s, <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> {{nationals}} were given the freedom to take up an economic activity to be pursued in the territory of another <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> or simply across borders. Such a freedom was necessary to achieve the main aim of the Community at that time – to build a common market. The legal basis for this was found in the market freedoms. By the end of the 1960 s, nonetheless, these provisions – and especially the personal market freedoms – had begun to be viewed not merely as instrumental freedoms but also as sources of rights for anyone who fell within their (broadly delimited) personal scope. This process of rereading the market freedoms as sources of rights has continued unabated to the present day, having been facilitated by the creation of the status of Union citizenship in 1993, and it is clear that these provisions have now been transformed into sources of fundamental rights granted to the Union citizen for their own sake and not merely instrumentally for the purpose of furthering the economic aims of the Treaties. As a result, the aim of these provisions is no longer merely to ensure the liberty of the economic actor in the EU as {{part of the process of}} constructing and maintaining an internal market but, alongside this, to protect the individual freedom and freedom of choice of the Union citizen who falls within their personal scope. This contribution does not aim to prove the fundamental rights-based nature of the market freedoms; this will be taken as a given. The focus of this chapter is different – to examine what the federal implications of the gradual transformation of these provisions (primarily) into sources of fundamental (economic) rights for the Union citizen are. In particular, the Court’s approach in a number of areas will be examined to illustrate how the vertical division of powers between the EU and its <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> has been affected as a result of the transformation in the nature of the market freedoms described above. The focus will be on demonstrating the dilemmas that the Court is facing when attempting to reconcile the nature of these provisions as the source of autonomous and meaningful rights for the Union citizen, with the need to ensure that the limits placed on the EU’s power to intervene with the exercise of <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>competence</b> are respected...|$|R
40|$|Setting {{powers in}} the European Union is a {{particularly}} complex problem, given the heterogeneity of both the Union and how the sharing of the powers between the EU and its <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> By the changes brought forth by the Treaty of Lisbon new provisions were introduced in the European Union Treaty (TFEU), clear areas of exclusive competence of EU are established, also areas of shared competence and areas of coordination and support actions of the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The anterior shortcomings of the previous legislation are being surpassed by the Treaty provisions, as the previous texts did not clearly show the areas of Community competence, establishing only general characteristics of community action against <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in some areas.

Under the principle of conferral, the Union shall act within the powers assigned to it by the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to achieve the targets set. The competences not conferred upon the Union remain with the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas that do not fall within its exclusive competence the Union shall act only and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action can not be sufficiently achieved by the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> either at a central or at a regional and local level, but can, due to the scale and the effects, be better achieved at the Union level. principle of subsidiarity, principle of conferral, <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> exclusive <b>competence,</b> treaty...|$|R

In the final analysis, I argue that the subsidiarity principle necessitates an adjustment of the Court‟s current approach to defining the concept of an obstacle to intra-EU movement. This adjustment isolates and protects an appropriate sphere of <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> regulatory <b>competence</b> from the Court‟s scrutiny at Union level.

As this collective volume shows, the main dilemmas that lie ahead relate to an effective (while more plural) institutional framework under the Treaty of Lisbon, stronger judicial scrutiny through a greater role for national courts and the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, better mechanisms for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of EU AFSJ law and a more solid fundamental rights strategy.

Za nadzor izvajanja pristojnosti je s PEU veljalo načelo subsidiarnosti, pri katerem EU deluje na področjih, ki niso v njeni izključni pristojnosti samo, če države članice ne morejo doseči ciljev predlaganih ukrepov in se le-ti lažje dosežejo na ravni EU. V načelu sorazmernosti oblast ukrepa samo toliko in tako, da je ukrep nujen, torej je sorazmeren cilju. Vrste pristojnosti so določene v pogodbi, in sicer se delijo na izključne pristojnosti EU, deljene pristojnosti med EU in državami članicami ter na dodatne pristojnosti. Kjer ima EU izključno pristojnost sama, izdaja in sprejema akte, države članice posežejo le v primeru, če jih EU pooblasti za njihovo izvajanje. Pri deljeni pristojnosti tako EU kot države članice izdajajo in sprejemajo akte, torej tam, kjer EU ne izvaja, izvajajo države članice. Pri dodatnih pristojnosti EU sprejme ukrepe za podporo in uskladitev ukrepov držav članic.

The purpose of the present study was to establish how the existence of a shared competence between the Community and its <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and the difficulty to clearly divide the respective spheres of powers impact on the implementation of their international obligations for the protection and preservation of the marine environment. Particular attention has been given to the global and regional conventions and bodies in which they jointly participate. Secondly, the research intended to establish whether the Community's regulatory action and approaches are in conformity with the existing international rules for the protection and preservation of the marine environment (hereinafter: international ocean regime), especially looking at the jurisdictional framework established by the LOSC. The material scope of the research has been limited to the prevention of oil pollution from ships, the regulation of ocean dumping and the protection of marine habitats through the establishment of MPAs. These three topics have been discussed within separate case study Chapters...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to examine three inter-connected themes which have emerged in the evolutionary development of the Union as an international actor. The first theme relates {{to the relationship between}} internal and external powers and policies. The degree to which the Union’s external powers reflect or mirror internal competence is not only a question of their extent; it extends to the objectives and content of the policies pursued by the Union internally and externally; the nature or fundamental legal characteristics of the external dimension to the Union legal order. To what extent are external powers an extension of internal powers and objectives? The expansion of the scope and extent of the Union’s external powers (whether express or implied) has of course reflected not only the expansion of areas of activity internally but also the changing preoccupations of the Union, in particular as regards its place in the world. It is also true that external commitments and activity are having an increasing impact on the development of internal policies. As always within the Community and Union systems, issues of competence are intimately connected with both the inter-institutional and the institution–Member State balance of power. The second theme of this chapter traces how the classic approach to pre-emption, whereby the occupation of a field of legislative activity by the Community legal order excludes concurrent <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>competence,</b> has given way to a wide acceptance of shared powers in external and internal spheres of competence, as well as the legal principles and structural solutions by which shared competence is managed. The emergent international identity of the Union and the factors that shape it form the third theme. A number of factors are at play here, including constitutional constraints on Union competence, the essential autonomy of the Union legal order within the wider context of international law and legal relations, the raised profile (and raised expectations) of the Union especially through the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the complexity of relations between the ‘Pillars’ between 1993 and 2009 and the legacy of the Pillars present in the Union’s constitutional structure following the Treaty of Lisbon. The evolution of the Union as an effective international actor will depend on the emergence of sufficiently flexible and robust internal constitutional structures. Amid the angst over policy fragmentation, the failure of the Constitutional Treaty, and the lack of institutional cohesion, it is possible to see a process of integration in the formation of an international identity for the Union. The terms ‘integration’ and ‘identity’ are not, however, intended to imply a monolithic structure. Highly diverse patterns of decision-making, different power-structures between the actors involved (<b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> Commission, Council, European Council, European Parliament), the wide variety of (formal and informal, binding and non-binding) instruments used, the connections between external policies and between internal and external aspects of policies, are all elements of a complex multi-dimensional construction. The complexity and diversity are necessary but need to operate within a framework which manages to be both flexible and coherent, and this chapter will end by assessing some {{of the ways in which}} the most recent Treaty reform process responds to this need...|$|R
40|$|The EU has a {{broad and}} complex network of {{external}} relations, developed both {{within the context of}} the European Community (trade relations, development cooperation, etc.) as well as within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. This chapter first details how the Maastricht Treaty laid out the famous three pillars which originally made up the EU. The Lisbon Treaty would ultimately remove this three-tiered structure, thereby affirming the EU's singular and unified legal personality, both domestically and internationally. The EU enjoys important competences in different fields of its external relations. As shown next in this chapter, these competences can be distinguished as being either explicitly or implicitly conferred, as well as exclusive or shared with regard to the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The Union's <b>competences</b> include inter alia the conclusion of international agreements. To a large extent, the Lisbon Treaty has, along the lines subsequently described, unified the procedures behind the conclusion of such international agreements, while also awarding an ever-increasing role to the European Parliament. The EU also participates to varying degrees in many international organisations. As outlined, such participation is mostly a joint venture with the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> This implies a necessarily close cooperation between the Union and the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> when acting within these international institutions. In conclusion, the chapter highlights the clear intent on strengthening the coherence between the different fields of the EU's external action, as well as between its internal and external policies. Coherence remains a difficult goal, even though the Lisbon Treaty improves the overall situation through important institutional reforms. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to assess the legal {{preconditions}} for using environmental taxes and charges in the perspective of EC-law, focusing in particular on environmental taxation and compatibility with the law regulating the free movements of goods. The thesis has also aimed at examining whether Community measures, limiting <b>state</b> <b>competence</b> in adopting and implementing environmental taxes, {{are likely to be}} taken in the future. To fulfill the purpose primary sources of EC-law, as well as relevant case- law and legal scientific literature, have been examined. The study has also aimed at examining the legal preconditions concerning environmental taxation solely in the perspective of EC-law, and compatibility with other international obligations will therefore not be discussed. The study has shown that the <b>competence</b> of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of adopting environmental taxes is quite large. Few concrete common measures limiting <b>state</b> <b>competence</b> have been taken and future measures are likely to be of minimum or framework character due to difficulties in reaching unanimous taxation decisions. Moreover, national environmental taxation measures are promoted by the Community. There are thus few reasons for why environmental taxes and charges at national level should not be adopted.

40|$|This article, {{written from}} an insider perspective, {{and in a}} {{personal}} capacity (the author has been involved with the Council of Europe’s work on religion and education since its inception in 2002), gives an account of the developing interest in the study of religions (and latterly non-religious convictions) in publicly funded schools by the Council of Europe, one of several international institutions to have focused on the place of religions and beliefs in public education in recent years. Particular attention is given to the 2008 Recommendation from the Committee of Ministers (the Foreign Ministers of the 47 <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the Council of Europe) on teaching about religions and non-religious convictions in schools, and to current work on its dissemination. In 2011, the Council of Europe and the European Wergeland Centre set up a joint committee to produce a document (Policy and Practice for Teaching about Religions and Non-Religious Worldviews in Intercultural Education) to assist policymakers, schools and teacher trainers in implementing the Recommendation, adapted to different contexts across Europe. The present author has written the text on behalf of the joint committee. Signposts was published by Council of Europe Publishing in September 2014 (Jackson, R. 2014. Signposts: Policy and practice for teaching about religions and non-religious worldviews in intercultural education. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing.). The article details the Council of Europe’s approach, includes an explanation of the process of consultation with various stakeholders, and summarises key issues to be addressed in the document. The general approach covered enables <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to increase <b>competence</b> of students to engage in the field of religions and beliefs, in ways that potentially contribute to various aspects of their personal and social development. It is hoped that the document will stimulate and contribute to constructive discussion, policymaking, teacher training, classroom practice and community links in different parts of Europe, and perhaps beyond. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{judgment}} of 1 October 2015 on case C- 290 / 14, Celaj, the Court of Justice ruled that Directive 2008 / 115 /EC, known as the Return Directive, in principle does not preclude legislation of a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> which provides for {{the imposition of a}} prison sentence to migrants illegally staying {{as a result of their}} illegal re-entry into the country. The comment explores the apparently different attitude taken in the earlier and well known case-law (El Dridi, Achughbabian and Sagor). It first scrutinizes the Court’s methodology respectively adopted in that case-law and in Celaj while identifying the effet utile of the Return Directive and shows that Celaj cannot be seen as reversing the Court’s approach on the matter. The comment also highlights the full consistency of Celaj with Achughbabian and Sagor on the nature of <b>State’s</b> <b>competence</b> to establish provisions on criminal sanctions vis-à-vis irregular migrants as one shared with the Union. However, Celaj raises serious doubts in terms of substantive law: since it establishes no conditions and limits to the duration of a custodial sentence for migrants having illegally re-entered an EU <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> in breach of an entry-ban, it potentially undermines the effective return policy which is set as the main purpose of the Return Directive...|$|R

40|$|Entrepreneurship is {{regarded}} as one of the key competences necessary for a knowledge-based society and economy. The development of the entrepreneurial capacity of citizens and organisations is indeed one of the policy priorities for the European Union and the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The Entrepreneurship <b>Competence</b> Framework (EntreComp), published in June 2016, proposes a broad conceptualisation of entrepreneurship as a competence aiming to bridge the worlds of education and work. EntreComp consists of 3 competence areas, 15 competences, an 8 -level progression model and a list of 442 learning outcomes. This paper traces the development of a self-assessment tool (SAT) for entrepreneurship competence targeting young adults aged 16 - 25, based on the EntreComp model. This SAT will provide a compass for young adults' personal and professional development based on the mapping of their entrepreneurship competences; it will also give visibility to these competences as a basis for discussion with teachers, mentors as well as with potential employers. The development of the EntreComp SAT is based on the in-depth analysis of existing tools and how they correspond to the 15 competences identified in the EntreComp model. Such analysis reveals significant differences in the competences addressed by each tool. Based on the analysis a number of general requirements have been set to guide the design of a prototype EntreComp SAT for the entrepreneurship competence of young adults. Such requirements include a user-centred approach; focus on experiential reflection; a broad interpretation of the entrepreneurship competence; and an open (non-judgemental) approach of its self-assessment.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the broader topic of the EU’s role in shaping international regulatory norms or standards. The EU could be said to possess normative power when the following conditions are satisfied: (a) there is an enduring consensus on the overall aims and shape of the EU acquis; (b) there is de jure competence under the treaties; and (c) there is also an acceptance of de facto EU <b>competence</b> by the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> De facto <b>competence</b> exists when there is an agreed, well established regime for decision-making and negotiation with respect to international economic negotiations. Normative power is however unlikely to be sufficient as a means of shaping the positions of other parties (states) in international negotiations. This is clearly illustrated in the EU’s attempts to provide leadership of the multilateral trade negotiations for the decade stretching from the mid- 1990 s until the Global Europe strategy of 2006, when the EU switched (back) to a multi-level approach to trade negotiations. Market power is also required in trade and investment negotiations, and the EU’s relative market power has been in decline for some time due to: (a) the rise of the emerging countries with their market potential and relatively closed markets; (b) the openness of the EU market following the de facto unilateral opening of the 1980 s, especially in investment; and (c) the limited scope for the EU to use ‘negative’ threats of closure to enhance its market power (due to de facto consensus based or even QMV decision-making) ...|$|R
