5|$|Birchington {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1240 as Birchenton, a name {{derived from the}} Old English words 'bircen tun', <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> farm where birch trees grow. Archaeological evidence has shown the area was inhabited before {{the existence of the}} village: Roman and prehistoric artefacts have been discovered in the area, and Minnis Bay was once the site of an Iron Age settlement.|$|E
5|$|Bolton is {{a common}} Northern English name derived from the Old English bothl-tun, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> {{settlement}} with a dwelling. The first recorded use of the name, in the form Boelton, dates from 1185 to describe Bolton le Moors, though {{this may not be}} in relation to a dwelling. It was recorded as Bothelton in 1212, Botelton in 1257, Boulton in 1288, and Bolton after 1307.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} not known to eat fish. The name is instead related to the word fitch, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> European polecat (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E

5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone boundary in 2020, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, would need to be paid by vehicles not meeting key exhaust emission standards. The boundary had originally been proposed by Johnson the previous year, but covering a narrower area.|$|E
5|$|The name Hale, {{which occurs}} {{throughout}} Britain, {{derives from the}} Anglo-Saxon halh <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area which has natural features that would provide shelter. The 'Barns' element of Hale Barns comes from the Old Tithe Barn.|$|E
5|$|Ōtsuki Fumihiko in Daigenkai (1932–1935) {{proposes that}} the word comes from kitsu, which is onomatopoeia for the bark of a fox, and ne, which may be an affix or an honorific word <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> servant of an Inari shrine.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Pocock {{lists the}} vernacular names ye and nigálya ponya (Nepal); thokya and thongwa (Limbu); oakdonga or wakdonka and woker (Bhotia); saknam sunam (Lepcha). Nigálya may {{originate}} from the Nepali word निङालो niṅālo or nĩgālo <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> {{particular kind of}} small bamboo, namely Arundinaria intermedia, but also refers {{to a kind of}} small leopard, or cat-bear. The word pónya may originate from the Nepali word पञ्जा pajā meaning claw, or पौँजा paũjā meaning paw of an animal. Nigálya pónya may translate to bamboo claw or paw.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E

5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, {{in a time when}} many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> conviction would result in the death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E

5|$|Hambleton District Council {{have plans}} to build lots of new housing {{as part of a}} north Northallerton {{development}} scheme. This also involves creating a link road between the A167 and the A684 <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> bridge over the Middlesbrough railway will need to be built. Yuill Homes and Taylor Wimpey UK Ltd have already submitted a planning application for the construction of 283 dwellings on the former York Trailers site (on Yafforth Road).|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment {{found that}} the solar PV would have little impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{most ancient}} {{recorded}} name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), {{which is consistent}} with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (<b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.|$|E
5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is that it comes from the Danish words vid, meaning wide, and noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the promontory projecting into the River Mersey. However, the Widnes promontory is not particularly wide and another possible explanation is the first part derives from the Danish ved, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> wood and possibly referring to a tree-covered promontory. Earlier spellings of the name have been Vidnes, Wydnes and Wydness.|$|E
5|$|The name Sheffield is Old English in origin. It {{derives from}} the River Sheaf, whose name is a {{corruption}} of shed or sheth, meaning to divide or separate. Field is a generic suffix deriving from the Old English feld, <b>meaning</b> <b>a</b> forest clearing. It is likely then that {{the origin of the}} present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo-Saxon settlement in a clearing beside the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don founded between the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in this region (roughly the 6th century) and the early 9th century.|$|E
