40|$|Photoluminescence (PL) {{has been}} studied from {{different}} types of bulk GaN samples grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy technique at Kyma Technologies. Point defects in bulk and at the surface affect the electrical and optical properties of GaN and could be analyzed by PL. The surface of the samples was polished with different techniques: one is chemical <b>mechanical</b> <b>polish</b> (CMP) and another is <b>mechanical</b> <b>polish</b> (MP). PL data from MP and CMP surfaces show that PL intensity from the CMP-treated surface {{is much higher than}} that from the MP-treated surface. This can be explained by defects formed during the process of MP polish. However, after the MP-treated surface is etched with RIE method, the optical quality of the MP-treated surface improves. In particular, as the depth of etching increases from 50 nm to 700 nm, the PL intensity increases by a factor of 1000. PL from the CMP surfaces of undoped bulk GaN samples contains a broad red luminescence (RL) band and a broad green luminescence (GL) band. However, PL from the CMP surfaces of Fe-doped GaN samples contained a blue luminescence band (labeled as BL 2 in literature) and the yellow luminescence (YL) band. PL from MP-treated surfaces (both undoped and Fe-doped) was very weak and it contained relatively narrow red and green bands.
