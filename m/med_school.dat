500|$|Dr. Meredith Grey is the {{daughter}} of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, and grew up in her shadow. Ellis was a deeply flawed, emotionally and verbally abusive, neglectful mother towards her. Meredith is described as a [...] "dark and twisty," [...] damaged person who sees the world in varying shades of gray morality. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person capable of empathizing with others when they're at their lowest points, and a sensitive observer of the people around her. Meredith is a graduate of Dartmouth College and nearly did not attend <b>med</b> <b>school</b> due to conflicts with her mother.

After a month abroad, Meredith was called back to care for Ellis, who had developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and Meredith obtained her M.D.|$|E
