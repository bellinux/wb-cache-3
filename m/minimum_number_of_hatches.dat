40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} a gonad-stimulating substance-like peptide (GSSL) immunochromatography {{measuring}} kit (GIM-Kit) to detect females of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus that {{are ready for the}} collection of matured eggs for artificial insemination in hatcheries. A. japonicus is the major species consumed in East Asian countries. With regard to the increasing demand for the species in the region, collecting the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> females for <b>hatching</b> is beneficial for sustaining the livestock and increasing the efficiency of breeding. A prototype GIM-Kit was constructed based on the double-antibody sandwich immunosorbent assay technique using two polyclonal antibodies that were generated against a physiologically active AEIDDLAGNIDY amino acid sequence of GSSL and a 40 -nm-diameter colloidal gold-tagged antibody. The GIM-Kit detected as little as 80 ng of GSSL in approximately 0. 4 gmL− 1 of ovaries that was diluted in distilled water. The detection time was approximately 20 min in the early (April) to mid (May) breeding season. The immunoreaction of the ovaries was high among the females during the early to mid-breeding season and low {{at the end of the}} season. Thus, the present GIM-Kit is applicable for practical use in hatcheries...|$|R

40|$|A {{great deal}} of effort has been {{directed}} towards determining the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> binary comparisons sufficient to produce various partial orders given some partial order. For example, the sorting problem considers the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> comparisons sufficient to construct a total order starting from n elements. The merging problem considers the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> comparisons sufficient to construct a total order from two total orders. The searching problem {{can be seen as}} a special case of the merging problem in which one of the total orders is a singleton. The selection problem considers the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> comparisons sufficient to select the i th largest of n elements. Little, however, is known about the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> comparisons sufficient to produce an arbitrary partial order. In this paper we briefly survey the known results on this problem and we present some first results on partial orders which can be produced using either restricted types of comparisons or a limited n [...] ...|$|R
