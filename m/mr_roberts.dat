25|$|Kansas {{politics}} have been roiled in recent years. The {{rise of the}} Tea Party and the election of President Obama have prompted Republicans to embrace a purer brand of conservatism and purge what had long been a robust moderate wing from its ranks. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> has sought to adapt to this new era, voting against spending bills that included projects for the state that he had sought.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> Fonda next {{acted in}} Paramount Pictures's {{production}} of the Leo Tolstoy epic novel War and Peace (1956), about French Emperor Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, in which he played Pierre Bezukhov opposite Audrey Hepburn; it took two years to shoot. Fonda worked with Alfred Hitchcock in 1956, playing a man falsely accused of robbery in The Wrong Man; the unusual semidocumentary work of Hitchcock's {{was based on an}} actual incident and partly filmed on location.|$|E
500|$|In 1601 Catesby was {{involved}} in the Essex Rebellion. The Earl of Essex's purpose might have lain in furthering his own interests rather than those of the Catholic Church, but Catesby hoped that if Essex succeeded, there might once more be a Catholic monarch. The rebellion was a failure however, and the wounded Catesby was captured, imprisoned at the Wood Street Counter, and fined 4,000marks (equivalent to over £6million as of 2008) by Elizabeth I. Sir Thomas Tresham helped pay some of Catesby's fine, following which Catesby sold his estate at Chastleton. Several authors speculate about Catesby's movements as Elizabeth's health grew worse; he was probably among those [...] "principal papists" [...] imprisoned by a government fearing open rebellion, and in March 1603 he possibly sent Christopher Wright to Spain to see if Philip III would continue to support English Catholics after Elizabeth's death. Catesby funded the activities of some Jesuit priests, and while visiting them made occasional use of the alias <b>Mr</b> <b>Roberts.</b>|$|E

Sixty-six persons drowned; the seven {{survivors}} were at sea in a small boat for five days before they approached land. While the surf prevented them from landing, the French brig Scythe, which was sailing from Mauritius to Calcutta, came upon them and rescued them. The survivors included Captain Wise, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> (the second officer), and five others. Scythe took them to Kedgeree, where they arrived on 28 May. The entry for Charles Mills in the 1823 Lloyd's Register carries the annotation [...] "lost".|$|E
2500|$|The game progressed the {{following}} year, {{as at least}} two of the clubs had second teams: a newspaper report in late 1885 described [...] "Second Rangers" [...] defeating [...] "Second Queen's Park" [...] 2-1 [...] "at the Pine Apple ground". Whilst there are no known records of organised games under ‘Association’ rules prior to the 1884 season, a speech at the Queen's Park Football Club annual dinner at the end of the 1885 season by Mr Pring Roberts (a guest representing the local Rugby Union) suggests there may gave been earlier games. <b>Mr</b> <b>Roberts</b> acknowledged [...] "the increasing popularity of the [...] game in the metropolis and the great strides made since its revival by the Anglo-Football Association some two seasons ago ..."

2500|$|The {{review in}} The Observer of 20 May 1928 was laudatory about the {{performances}} of J.H. Roberts and Charles Laughton. About Roberts, the reviewer said, [...] "If ever a man succeeded by his performance in throwing an audience of determined sleuths off the scent, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> threw those members of the first-night audience who had not read Mrs. Christie's clever novel off it." [...] About Laughton, the reviewer said, [...] "Let me not be afraid to use superlatives" [...] and then proceeded to detail why he held the view he did, concluding, [...] "He seizes the stage and firmly controls the audience. He fills me {{with a sense of}} his power, and makes me intensely aware of him from the moment he comes on to the stage until the moment he leaves it. He is an actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Refusing another {{long-term}} studio contract, Fonda {{returned to}} Broadway, wearing his own officer's cap to originate {{the title role}} in Mister Roberts, a comedy about the U.S. Navy, during World War II in the South Pacific Ocean where Fonda, a junior officer, Lt. Douglas A. Roberts wages a private war against a tyrannical captain. He won a 1948 Tony Award for the part. Fonda followed that by reprising his performance in the national tour and with successful stage runs in Point of No Return and The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial. After an eight-year absence from films, he starred in the same role in the 1955 film version of Mister Roberts with James Cagney, William Powell, and Jack Lemmon, continuing a pattern of bringing his acclaimed stage roles to life on the big screen. On the set of Mister Roberts, Fonda came to blows with director John Ford, who punched him during filming, and Fonda vowed never {{to work for the}} director again. While he kept that vow for years, Fonda spoke glowingly of Ford in Peter Bogdanovich's documentary Directed by John Ford and in a documentary on Ford's career alongside Ford and James Stewart. [...] Fonda refused to participate until he learned that Ford had insisted on casting Fonda as the lead in the film version of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> reviving Fonda's film career after concentrating on the stage for years.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> {{was a man}} of business, or {{agent to}} the property, who lived at Shrewsbury, and whom Mr. Greenwood {{especially}} disliked. Mr. Greenwood being a clergyman was, of course, supposed to be a gentleman, and regarded <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> as being much beneath himself. It was not customary for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> to dine at the house, and he was therefore regarded by the chaplain as being hardly more than an upper servant. It was therefore very grievous to him to be told that he must discuss his own private affairs and make his renewed request as to the living through <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts.</b> It was evidently intended that he should have no opportunity of discussing his private affairs. Whatever the Marquis might offer him he must take; and that, {{as far as he could}} see, without any power of redress on his side. If <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roberts</b> were to offer him a thousand pounds, he could only accept the cheque and depart with it from Trafford Park, shaking off from his feet the dust which such ingratitude would forbid him to carry with him.|$|E
5000|$|This {{story begins}} with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> her baby son, and her Aunt Mary headed Westbound on the Boston and Albany Railroad. They {{are on their}} way to meet Mrs. Roberts' husband and brother in Boston. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> has not seen her brother in twelve years, and is nervous about how he will react to seeing her. In the time since they last saw each other, she has married and birthed a child, and has heard little from her brother except for {{infrequent}} telegraphs. The porter informs <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> and her aunt that the berths are now ready for them to sleep in, but the conversation continues. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> worries that her husband Edward will not receive Willis well, or vice versa, because Willis is a Californian and Edward has never encountered one before. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> laments that her life would be a wreck if her husband and brother do not get along nicely, and states [...] "I do hope they're sitting down to a hot supper." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{voice from}} an {{adjacent}} berth interjects and sarcastically tells <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> to be quiet. She acquiesces for a moment, but then reverts to conversation, stating how they {{must go to}} bed. Aunt Mary insists that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> and the child take the bottom bunk, because she is afraid that the child will roll off of the top bunk and injure himself. She calls the porter over to help her into the upper berth, and after successfully entering the berth, exchanges [...] "good-night" [...] with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{school system}} is led by its seven-member School Committee that is elected to serve {{for two years and}} {{includes}} a Chairperson, Vice-chairperson and Clerk. The School Committee hires a Superintendent of Schools to administer policies and to manage and lead learning in the district. The Cumberland Superintendent of Schools (in chronological order) are <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robert</b> Condon, Dr. <b>Robert</b> McGinnis, <b>Mr.</b> Rodney McFarlin, Dr. <b>Robert</b> Patterson, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robert</b> Wallace (1993-1996), <b>Mr.</b> Joseph Nasif (1996-2005), Dr. Donna Morelle (2005-2011), Dr. Phil Thornton (2011-2015, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Robert</b> Mitchell (2015-present).|$|R
50|$|After a few minutes, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> rekindles the conversation, and expresses {{her concern}} {{regarding}} {{the safety of}} the train on which they're riding. Her aunt reassures her that the road is safe, and that the train has implemented safety measures to prevent accidents. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> then goes on to discuss where her Aunt left the drinking glass in their luggage, until she is interrupted by a man from the next berth. This man politely requests silence from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> citing that he has come straight through from San Francisco and would very much like some rest. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> responds apologetically, but starts conversing with this man, inquiring about California, her brother Willis, and if he has ever met his acquaintance. Midway through their conversation, a man in the upper berth sarcastically interjects and asks for quiet. The Californian takes offense to the man's tone towards <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts,</b> and the two get into a verbal argument over it. Eventually, the Californian gets the man in the upper berth to back down ("You beg that lady's pardon, or I'll have you out of there before you know yourself!"). Part I ends with the Californian and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> finally going to bed, with only the sounds of Aunt Mary's snoring audible.|$|R

5000|$|The {{neurosis}} of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> {{is another}} point of humor. She frequently states [...] "good-night" [...] to Aunt Mary in part I, but always revives the conversation by expressing some sort of worry, insecurity, or anxiety. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> expresses initially her worry about how her brother and husband will interact, and needs constant reassurance from her aunt to calm down. Minutes later, she {{is concerned about the}} safety of the train, whose creaking noises stir worry about her safety and the safety of her baby son. Aunt Mary again alleviates her stress by citing all of the safety measures the railroad has implemented (i.e. the well-managed road, air-brake, and Miller Platform). After this anxiety passes, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> frets about where the water glass is packed in the luggage, and decides to talk herself through its retrieval. The intense neurosis of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> is comically pathetic, and quite extreme. Effortlessly moving from one point of anxiety to the next, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roberts</b> creates a feeling of persistent neurosis for the reader, who must simply laugh at the woeful worry.|$|R
