40|$|The {{concept of}} media {{influence}} {{has a long}} history in media and communication studies, and has also had significant influence on public policy. This article revisits questions of media influence through three short case studies. First, it critically analyses the strongly partisan position of News Corporation’s newspapers against the Labor government during the 2013 Australian Federal election to consider whether the potential for media influence equated to the effective use of media power. Second, it discusses the assumption in broadcasting legislation, in both the United Kingdom and Australia, that terrestrial broadcasting should be subject to more content regulation than subscription services, and notes the new challenges arising from digital television and over-the-top video streaming services. Finally, it discusses the rise of <b>multi-platform</b> global <b>content</b> aggregators such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and others, and how their rise necessitates changes in ways of thinking about concentration of media ownership, and regulations that may ensue from it...|$|R
40|$|The {{digitalization}} and {{the diffusion}} of connected mobile devices have urged media companies to deliver their content in digital formats such as apps. We evaluate differences in customers' preferences and willingness to pay between traditional and digital content services conducting an adaptive conjoint analysis. Within this analysis we compare subscriptions to a printed newspaper with subscriptions to the website, e-paper, smartphone app or tablet app of this newspaper. Our results show that customers still prefer the printed newspaper over any digital format. The acceptance of digital newspaper formats depends on device ownership but the website is most popular in general. Our findings have profound implications for <b>multi-platform</b> publishing strategies. <b>Content</b> providers have to examine carefully in in which situations their products might be used and which devices their potential customers own in order to choose the right formats and prices...|$|R
40|$|The MELISA {{system is}} a {{distributed}} platform for <b>multi-platform</b> sports <b>content</b> broadcasting, providing end users {{with a wide range}} of real-time interactive services during the sport event, such as statistics, visual aids or enhancements, betting, and user- and context-specific advertisements. In this paper, we present the revamped design of the complete system and the implementation of a middleware entity utilizing concepts present in the emerging MPEG- 21 framework. More specifically, all multimedia content is packaged in a self-contained ""digital item"", containing both the binary information (video, graphics, etc.) required for the playback, as well as structured representations of the different entities that can handle this item and the actions they can perform on it. This module essentially stands between the different components of the integrated content preparation system, thereby not disrupting their original functionality at all; additional tweaks are performed in the receiver sides, as well, to ensure that the additional information and provisions are respected. The outcome of this design upgrade is that IPR issues are dealt with successfully, both with respect to the content itself and to the functionality of the subscription levels; in addition to this, end users can be presented with personalized forms of the final content, e. g., viewing in-play virtual advertisements that match their shopping habits and preferences, thus enhancing the viewing experience and creating more revenue opportunities via targeted advertisements. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Drawing on {{findings}} from our Economic and Social Research Council-funded research project which investigates how media companies {{have made the}} journey from being single sector to digital <b>multi-platform</b> suppliers of <b>content,</b> this article identifies {{some of the key}} managerial and economic challenges and opportunities involved in making that transition. It argues that the current migration towards multi-platform has altered not just media industry processes and output but, more fundamentally, it has re-configured the ways in which content is now being conceptualised by media managers. Multi-platform strategies have encouraged a vast expansion in the volumes of media content supplied and made available to media audiences at a time when, generally, the production budgets of media organisations have been tightly constrained. This article considers critically the question of how the transition to a multi-platform environment has facilitated such abundance in output and an apparently miraculous increase in levels of productivity across the media industry. It questions the implications for content and for policy of an ever-growing commitment to multi-platform strategies...|$|R
40|$|Media diversity, or the {{heterogeneity}} of media content, is considered a central pillar of a democratic society, but it has seldom been studied in a systematic way. Concerns {{about the relationship between}} media concentration and the abuse of power through the over-representation of particular views have been a longstanding focus for debate within communication studies. Logically, highly concentrated media ownership patterns correlate with a more limited range of media sources, implying a less pluralistic system. Recent technological developments and digital innovations have added to the complexity of researching plurality. Meanwhile, media organizations have embarked on new forms of corporate expansion, leading to disagreement amongst commentators over the impact of these changes on the ownership patterns of media content providers. For some political economists, this has heralded a discontinuity and a departure from capitalism, but, for many, new media has deepened and extended the commodification of audiences. The existence of multiple owners, in any case, may not be sufficient to ensure plurality; studies of media diversity should also review the content of the outputs themselves. Despite the fact that many television companies and print publishers have transformed themselves into <b>multi-platform</b> suppliers of <b>content,</b> {{little is known about the}} impact of these strategies on the diversity of media content. This article is based on initial findings from a study of media content being undertaken as part of a three year Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) -funded project ‘Multi-platform media and the digital challenge’. This project has sampled, coded and analyzed the composition of content bundles from a selection of key media organizations drawn from broadcasting, newspaper, and magazine publishing industries, including theBBC, STV, MTV, The Financial Times,The Telegraph, Elle UK, T 3 andNME. To this end, the first two of three phases of content analysis have been employed. This work confirms volumes of content have increased across the sample, but also finds evidence for the recycling and re-purposing of content and for the concentration on particular programmes or stories. Finally, the article argues for the systematic examination of media content outputs and for the development of new ways to measure media content diversity across platform and sector...|$|R
