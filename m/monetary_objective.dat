40|$|The {{standard}} ad hoc <b>monetary</b> <b>objective</b> function {{creates a}} bias {{in favor of}} inflation targeting. Instead, this paper uses the Pareto criterion to assess inflation targeting (IT), price-level targeting (PLT), and nominal-income targeting (NIT). The effect that unanticipated inflation or deflation benefits one party to a nominal contract while hurting the other party is an effect that cannot be captured in a model with a representative consumer or identical consumers. To capture this effect, this paper analyses models with diverse consumers in a pure-exchange economy without storage. When nominal aggregate demand (NAD) is stochastic but real aggregate supply (RAS) is not, PLT Pareto dominates IT. This is because IT perpetuates price errors and hence nominal aggregate demand errors, while PLT tries {{to return to the}} original targeted price path. By perpetuating these errors, IT perpetuates the welfare losses, whereas PLT corrects so to help reduce these welfare losses in the future. When RAS is also stochastic, nominal contracts under NIT can lead to Pareto efficiency when consumers have average relative risk aversion, non-stochastic endowment-to-RAS ratios, and no utility shocks. Under the same assumptions IT and PLT lead to Pareto inefficiencies because they force the payers of nominal contracts to guarantee the real value of those payments to the receivers. In essence this transfers RAS risk from the receivers of the nominal obligations to payers of the nominal obligations. However, this transfer of risk would only be appropriate if all payers of nominal obligations had below average relative risk aversion and all receivers had above average relative risk aversion, a situation that rarely will hold.

The interaction between inflation, output gap and monetary policy rules is analyzed {{within the framework of}} a dynamic general equilibrium model derived from optimizing behavior and rational expectations.

The main motivation is to see how the economy reacts under backward looking and forward looking Taylor type monetary policy reaction functions in order to make conclusions on which type performs better within the estimated model for the Euro area. Also, using model simulations, the conclusions on the optimality of weights assigned to the reaction function coefficients are drawn.

40|$|The {{independence}} of the Czech national bank and its development since 1993 to the present Summary The purpose of my thesis is to describe {{independence of}} the CNB as the crucial principle for the fulfilment of its primary <b>monetary</b> <b>objective,</b> which {{for the vast majority}} of central banks including CNB is to maintain price stability. The importance of price stability ensues from empirical experience with the world economy, which confirms that high and volatile inflation has negative economic consequences. The importance of central bank independence comes to the forefront here primarily because politicians may seek to compel the central bank to adopt measures that although in the short-run may boost economic growth, in the long run will lead to an undesirable rise in inflation. Economic growth will meanwhile return to its original level, or even sink to a lower level (as a result of the higher inflation). A sufficient degree of independence from political influence allows the central bank to resist such pressures.

Methods: A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, using relevant terminology and included articles published from 1 January, 2013 to 30 June, 2016. We included observational studies where the primary outcomes included FT and study samples were greater than 200.

Seventy outcomes of FT were reported with 47 covering <b>monetary,</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective indicators of FT. A total of 28 – 48 % of patients reported FT using monetary measures and 16 – 73 % using subjective measures. The most commonly reported factors associated with FT were: being female, younger age, low income at baseline, adjuvant therapies and more recent diagnosis. Relative to non-cancer comparison groups, cancer survivors experienced significantly higher FT. Most studies were cross-sectional and causal inferences between FT and determinants were not possible. Measures of FT were varied and most were not validated, while monetary values of out-of-pocket expenses included different cost components across studies. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of cancer survivors experience financial hardship irrespective of how it is measured. Using standardised outcomes and longitudinal designs to measure FT would improve determination of the extent of FT.

However, small economies and countries with undeveloped financial markets have found that a lack of competition in their financial markets complicates their efforts to rely on money market operations, at times forcing them to rely instead on direct instruments or moral suasion. In some larger countries, the shift toward a reliance on money market operations has been gradual and, at times, fraught with difficulty.

40|$|Uncertainty is an {{unavoidable}} part of decision making. Decisions {{always have to}} be made before perfect knowledge on their consequences is known. However, there is no ‘perfect knowledge’ in hindsight. To research uncertainty and take actions proactively becomes the challenge to scientists and decision makers. In water resources planning and management, uncertainty is presenting at all stages of planning, developing and managing a water system (Loucks, Van Beek et al. 2005). The water systems are dynamically driven by factors such as climate, environment, demographics, socio-economy, technology, policies and regulations, etc. For example, climate change will affect hydrological and water conditions such as rainfall, temperature, water availability for irrigation; socio-economic development causes the change of water demand. However, the variation of these driving forces is unknown and beyond the control of decision makers, so as their impact on water systems. To plan and manage water systems without addressing uncertainty will invite surprises and potential risk subject to unexpected consequences and losses. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to contribute knowledge to decision making under uncertainty for water resources planning and management. Scenarios have been widely used to explore uncertainty for long-term strategic planning. Scenarios are defined as “a coherent and plausible description of possible future states of the world” by the IPCC. They are distinguished from the deterministic or most-likely prediction of future states. Scenario-based approaches have been applied largely to analyse future water- related issues, and support water managers and decision makers to put forward strategies for potential problems. Two criteria ‘robustness’ and ‘rationality’ are proposed for decision making in face of uncertainty. Unlike traditional decision analysis which makes decisions based on the ‘most-likely’ futures, robust decisions are those who perform satisfactorily over a wide range of plausible future states. Rationality was usually modelled to maximize the expected profits in economic terms. Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) added the risk attitudes and satisfaction of decision makers to economic outcomes, and introduced expected utility theory to model rationality as maximizing the expected utility. To apply scenario-based approaches to support decision making in a rational and robust way, the crucial task is to develop scenarios that can describe and quantify future states under uncertainty. Two research questions are raised in the research: (1) How to develop scenarios for future water circumstances to cope with uncertainty? (2) How to make robust and rational decisions based on the developed scenarios? Scenarios are defined as qualitative storylines about the future, however, quantitative projections and numerical information should be included to inform decision making. Traditional scenarios were quantified according to each storyline, and leaves out possible situations in between them. The ignorance of in-between scenarios constrains the explorative characteristic of scenarios. Besides, each storyline is assumed to be equally likely without attaching probabilities. Future states with equal chance are not realistic, and it forces decision makers to pick up any scenario arbitrarily. Conversely, the application of probabilities encourages representing uncertainty and explaining assumptions behind scenarios explicitly. It is also more approachable for risk quantification, and informs decision makers the different chances of future situations. The thesis advances scenario development by combining numerical information and attaching probability distributions. Probability distributions of future states can only be estimated subjectively, and they are highly conditional on the assumptions being made. Bayesian probabilities and expert judgement are two main techniques to combine subjective probabilities and scenarios. Subjectivity cannot be avoided or stopped when talking about uncertainty and {{the important thing is to}} make the assumptions and expert judgement about scenarios as explicit and transparent as possible. Besides, the principle of Maximal entropy can be used to choose probability distributions with the largest uncertainty. To estimate climate change impact on water availability in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China in the next 30 years, probabilistic scenarios of water availability were generated which are based on the climate scenarios (precipitation and temperature) based on the projections of General Circulation Models (GCMs). To investigate socio-economic development impact on water demand in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China, probabilistic scenarios of water demand were developed using expert judgement. Four storylines comprising two extremes (urbanization speed-up/ agriculture intensive, water-saving/ water consumptive) were constructed to describe the future development of the YRD. An existing expert elicitation technique, i. e. the SHELF method, is used to elicit prior probabilities of socio-economic driving variables from local experts. Probability distributions from individual experts are then aggregated, and correlations between different variables are taken into account by using a multivariate probability distribution based on the Gaussian Copula. The thesis developed the probabilistic scenario-based decision making framework to handle uncertainties and support decision making in a systematic, robust and rational manner. The framework relies on a full probabilistic distribution of scenarios and outcomes, and ranks decision alternatives based on expected utility theory. The framework not only investigated the <b>monetary</b> <b>objective,</b> but also further engaged the decision makers by investigating their preferences and risk attitudes (risk averse, risk neutral, risk taking) under uncertainty. The risk attitudes of decision makers were modelled using a negative exponential utility function. The decision making framework was applied for a case study of long-term water resources planning and management in the YRD. Evaluation and ranking of candidate strategies was performed against the full probability distribution of water supply and demand scenarios. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the decisions with respect to uncertain factors such as water supply and demand, market prices and the risk attitudes of decision makers. In summary, the thesis contributes knowledge on uncertainty management and decision making, which includes: achieve better understanding of the state-of-the-art in scenario science; advance scenario development – from qualitative storylines to quantitative projections, discrete states to continuous states, equal- likelihood states to probabilistic states; develop the probabilistic scenario-based decision making framework to handle uncertainties and support decision making in a systematic, robust and rational manner; taking into account risk from both the engineers’ and decision makers’ perspectives; and analyse the influence of decision makers’ risk attitudes on the choice of decisions.

40|$|Unconventional {{central bank}} {{measures}} {{are playing a}} key policy role for many advanced economies in the 2007 - 09 global crisis. Are they playing a similar role for emerging economies? Emerging economies have widely used unconventional foreign exchange and domestic short-term liquidity easing measures. Their use of credit easing and quantitative easing measures has been much more limited. Thus, unconventional measures are much less important for emerging economies compared to advanced economies in achieving broader macroeconomic objectives. The difference {{can be attributed to}} the relatively limited financial stress in emerging economies, their external vulnerabilities and their limited scope for quasifiscal activities.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} some practical advice on establishing initial conditions {{in support of}} an inflation-targeting monetary framework. These conditions are divided into four areas: a mandate in support of an inflation objective and accountability for achieving this objective; macroeconomic stability; a sufficiently well-developed and stable financial system; and effective policy implementation tools. The measures taken by countries to meet these conditions are also reviewed.

40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} (IT) {{serves as}} monetary policy framework in several advanced economies, {{where it has}} enhanced policy transparency and accountability. The paper considers its wider applicability to developing countries. The prerequisites for a successful IT framework are identified as an ability to carry out an independent monetary policy (free of fiscal dominance or commitment to another nominal anchor, like the exchange rate) and a quantitative framework linking policy instruments to inflation. These prerequisites are largely absent among developing countries, though several of them could with some further institutional changes and an overriding commitment to low inflation make use of an IT framework.

40|$|The {{perception}} that Asia''s inflation dynamics {{is driven by}} idiosyncratic supply shocks implies, as a corollary, {{that there is little}} scope for a policy reaction to a build-up of inflationary pressures. However, Asia''s fast growth and integration {{over the last two decades}} suggest that the drivers of inflation may have changed, and that domestic demand pressures may now play a larger role than in the past. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of inflation dynamics in Asia using a Global VAR (GVAR) model, which explicitly incorporates the role of regional and global spillovers in driving Asia''s inflation. Our results suggest that over the past two decades the main drivers of inflation in Asia have been monetary and supply shocks, but also that, in recent years, the contribution of these shocks has fallen, whereas demand-side pressures have started to emerge as an important contributor to inflation in Asia.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the literature on the factors behind financial stability, focusing on monetary policy design. In particular, it assesses empirically for a sample of 79 countries in the period 1970 to 2000 whether the choice of the central bank <b>objectives</b> and the <b>monetary</b> policy strategy affect financial stability. We find that focusing the central bank objectives on price stability reduces the likelihood of a banking crisis. This result is robust to several model specifications and groups of countries. As regards the monetary policy strategy, exchange rate targeting significantly reduces the likelihood of a banking crisis for some model specifications and, in particular, for the group of countries in transition.
