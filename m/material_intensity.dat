Combining survey and public data from a sample of Canadian manufacturing industries, the results suggest for managerial practices that environmental strategic planning, environmental administrative mechanisms, and incentives are associated with two eco-efficiency ratios—namely, the <b>material</b> <b>intensity</b> ratio and the environmental productivity ratio—while environmental performance indicators are associated with the <b>material</b> <b>intensity</b> ratio.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, the {{economic}} integration of the Chilean economy into global markets has been taking place at a rapid pace. For example, in 1986, exports represented 29 % of GDP while in 1996 they had increased to 38 % of GDP. This period of time was characterized by strong economic growth with an average annual growth rate of about 10 %. From a physical perspective, material requirements more than doubled from 220 to 500 Â million tons of direct material inputs (DMI) during the same decade (the rate of material growth requirements was around 13 % per year). The main objective {{of this study is}} to explain the changes in DMI by using a structural decomposition analysis (SDA). The changes in material flow accounting (MFA) were broken down into the effects caused by changes in resource use per unit of output (<b>material</b> <b>intensity</b> effect), changes between and within sectors (structural change effect), changes in the composition of final demand (mix effect), changes due to shifting shares of domestic final demand and export categories (category effect) and finally changes in the overall level of economic activities (level effects). The results, as a percentage of the total level of DMI used in 1986, indicate that economic growth was the major source of material changes (109 %). The <b>material</b> <b>intensity</b> and category effects explained 31 % and 14 % of the increase, respectively. The increase in the <b>material</b> <b>intensity</b> is mainly due to a declining quality of ores in copper production. However, these components were partly compensated by the structure (-Â  14 %) and mix (-Â  13 %) effects. Therefore, for a Southern American country such as Chile, the main causes of these changes in material consumption have been a combination of the nature of economic growth along with an increase in export production and <b>material</b> <b>intensity</b> of production. ...|$|E

Leasing activity is examined both at microeconomic level, for which it has a direct impact, as well as at macroeconomic level for which it has both direct and indirect influence.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify potential opportunities of using leasing in the wealth creation process and its impact on economic growth, and therefore the use of this activity as a tool to stimulate economic growth.
