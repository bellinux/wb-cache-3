Fourier transform is employed {{to reduce the}} mixed boundary value problem of the crack to dual integral equations, which are solved exactly. Steady-state asymptotic fields near the crack tip are obtained in closed form and the corresponding field intensity factors are expressed explicitly. The crack speed influences the singular field distribution around the crack tip {{and the effects of}} electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> on the crack tip fields are discussed. The crack kinking phenomena is investigated using the maximum hoop stress intensity factor criterion.

40|$|International audienceThe {{permeability}} {{spectra of}} composite magnetic materials (NiZn ferrite composites and YIG composites) has been experimentally studied {{on a wide}} range in <b>magnetic</b> <b>load</b> C. The resonance frequency decreases with the increasing <b>magnetic</b> <b>load</b> of the mixture. This is attributed to the fading of the magnetic pole {{on the surface of the}} magnetic inclusions.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{necessity to}} miniaturize smooth torque rotary actuators has placed severe {{constraints on the}} current slotless permanent-magnet technology. These constraints are mainly the consequence of the relatively large effective magnetic airgap which limits the achievable <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> and, therefore, the torque density of slotless permanent-magnet rotary actuators. Further, the miniaturization has to be achieved at ever-decreasing costs and, therefore, it would be advantageous to implement solid back irons. However this, even at reduced <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading,</b> still results in considerable eddy-current losses. Therefore, a careful selection of the various actuator dimensions and most appropriate soft magnetic laminated or solid material {{is a prerequisite for}} applications that require smooth speed and torque characteristic.

40|$|Shock loading {{techniques}} {{are often used}} to determine material response along a specific pressure loading curve {{referred to as the}} Hugoniot. However, many technological and scientific applications require accurate determination of dynamic material response that is off-Hugoniot, covering large regions of the equation-of-state surface. Unloading measurements from the shocked state provide off-Hugoniot information, but experimental techniques for measuring compressive off-Hugoniot response have been limited. A new pulsed <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> technique is presented which provides previously unavailable information on isentropic loading of materials to pressures of several hundred kbar. This smoothly increasing pressure loading provides a good approximation to the high-pressure material isentrope centered at ambient conditions. The approach uses high current densities to create ramped <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> to a few hundred kbar over time intervals of 100 [...] 200 ns. The method has successfully determined the isentropic mechanical response of copper to about 200 kbar and has been used to evaluate the kinetics of the alpha-epsilon phase transition occurring in iron at 130 kbar. With refinements in progress, the method shows promise for performing isentropic compression experiments to multi-Mbar pressures...|$|E

40|$|Both {{analytical}} and computational methods have been, {{for the first}} time, employed to study the demagnetising factors for bonded magnets. The demagnetising factors for bonded NdFeB magnets are dependent on the external shape of the bonded magnet, the shapes of magnetic particles, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> percentage and the distributions of magnetic particles. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that the demagnetising factor along the length of an infinitely long bonded magnet is not equal to zero but that it also depends on the shapes of the magnetic particles, <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> percentage and the distribution of magnetic particles. However, the sum of the demagnetising factors along the x, y and z directions is, as expected, unity for all bonded magnets. The demagnetising factor for a fully dense magnet, which is dependent only on the external shape of the magnet, can be considered as a special case of bonded magnets in which the <b>magnetic</b> <b>loading</b> is 100 %. Simplified formulae for calculating the demagnetising factors for simple shaped magnets such as cuboid, cylindroid and ellipsoid shapes were obtained and the values are in reasonable agreement with precise analytical solutions. A Lorentz ''sphere'' concept has, for the first time, been employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for hollow magnets and bonded NdFeB magnets. The simplified formulae for hollow magnets and bonded magnets were derived. Computer programmes based on the basic energy method were developed and employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for bonded magnet models, such as a one-dimensional NdFeB ribbon array, two-dimensional bonded magnets and three-dimensional bonded magnets. A finite difference method and a finite element method have been, for the first time, employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for two-dimensional bonded magnet models and the results are comparable with those obtained using the basic energy method. Procedures for calculating demagnetising curves (J vs H) for bonded magnets were developed. The calculated demagnetising curves for bonded magnets, based on these procedures, are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.

40|$|Abstract- At the {{macroscopic}} scale {{two different}} phenomena illustrate the couplings between the elastic and magnetic behaviours of ferromagnetic materials: first, magnetisation induces a deformation mechanism called magnetostriction, and, second, stresses {{have an effect}} on the magnetic behaviour. The complexity of the non-linear relations between these phenomena is such that few realistic macroscopic constitutive equations have been proposed to model the coupled magneto-elastic behaviour of magnetic materials. Magnetisation and magnetostriction are macroscopic manifestations of the complex magnetic domain structure that is modified by applied mechanic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>loads.</b> Herein, it is proposed to use homogenisation methods to deduce the macroscopic behaviour of single crystals and polycrystals from a statistical description of the magnetic domain structure. Therefore, the macroscopic couplings naturally arise from the expression of the free energy written at the level of the magnetic domains. 1...|$|R

The multidomain boundary element technique is implemented with imperfect interlaminar interfaces and unilateral interface conditions to prevent the physical inconsistence of the overlapping between interface nodes belonging to two different plies. To assess the reliability {{and the effectiveness of}} the model numerical analyses are carried out on the dynamic response of magnetically activated magnetoelectroelastic devices in presence of delamination cracks.
