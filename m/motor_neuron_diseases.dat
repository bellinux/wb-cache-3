5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>diseases.</b> In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>diseases,</b> polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Mortality {{rates from}} <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> in England and Wales {{for the years}} 1959 - 1979 were studied through death {{certification}} data supplied by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. The age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate increased over the period from 1 - 2 per 100000 per year in 1959 - 61 to 1 - 6 in 1977 - 79, the increase being most apparent in women over age 45 years and men over 60 years. The ratio of the sex-specific mortality rates remained fairly constant at 1 - 6 : 1 (male to female). The distribution of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> deaths within England and Wales showed more variation between counties and between Hospital Regions than expected, and areas of high <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> mortality along the south coast and low mortality in the Midlands could be identified.

40|$|Linked {{statistics}} from hospital records and death certificates {{were used to}} study the incidence of and mortality from <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> in a defined English population. The incidence of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease,</b> measured as first-admission rates for the disease, was studied from 1963 to 1985 and death certificates for the patients admitted to hospital were obtained {{to the end of}} 1990. The average annual first-admission rate for <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> was 2. 1 / 100, 000 men (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 9 to 2. 4) and 1. 7 / 100, 000 women (95 % CI 1. 5 to 1. 9). First-admission rates increased with age and peaked in the age range 65 - 84 years. <b>Motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> was recorded on the death certificate for 86 % of patients who died while they had the disease and there was no appreciable change over time in the recording of <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> <b>disease</b> as the underlying cause of death.
