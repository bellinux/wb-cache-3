This allows the Start menu to act as a fast and powerful application launcher.

2500|$|The {{search engine}} uses {{indexing}} {{to allow for}} a quick display of results for a given search.

The Start <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> also doubles as the Run command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The indexed search platform is based on Microsoft's Windows Desktop Search 3.0 (Windows Search version 4.0 in Vista SP2), allowing third-party applications (e.g. Microsoft Outlook 2007) to use the indexing platform to store metadata and perform searches on Windows Vista or Windows XP (with the Windows Desktop Search redistributable installed). This is in contrast to the search engine of Windows XP, which takes some time to display results, and only after the user has finished typing the search string. The Windows Vista search allows users to add multiple filters to continually refine search results (Such as [...] "File contains the word 'example'"). It is also possible to search across RSS and Atom feeds, straight from Windows Explorer. Windows search uses IFilters that are used by Windows Desktop Search as well. The IFilter interface can be implemented by software makers so that files created by their applications can be better integrated with search and indexing programs.|$|E

2500|$|Windows Vista and its successors added {{minor changes}} to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu {{consisted}} of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a Search box that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> box replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders.

40|$|Abstract. Scientists {{from many}} {{different}} disciplines (including physiology, psychology, and engineering) have worked on modelling visual perception. However this field has been less extensively studied {{in the context of}} computer science, as most existing perception models work only for very specific domains such as <b>menu</b> <b>searching</b> or icon searching tasks. We are developing a perception model that works for any application. It takes a list of mouse events, a sequence of bitmap images of an interface and locations of different objects in the interface as input, and produces a sequence of eye-movements as output. We have identified a set of features to differentiate among different screen objects and using those features, our model has reproduced the results of previous experiments on visual perception in the context of HCI. It can also simulate the effects of different visual impairments on interaction. In this paper we discuss the design, implementation and two pilot studies to demonstrate the model. ...|$|R

40|$|Eye {{movement}} {{is a basic}} human behavior that offers a valuable means to explore human cognitive processes. This article introduces two modeling studies of eye movement. First, random <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> was modeled using a queueing network approach and second, a reinforcement learning algorithm was used to generate various eye movement patterns. Random <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> is a task component involved in many human-machine interfaces and has been modeled with several cognitive models including ACT-R and EPIC. Based upon review of empirical data in <b>menu</b> <b>search,</b> and strengths and limitations of existing models, this article proposes a queueing network model, which has been successfully applied in some other task domains (e. g., response time, driver performance). The queueing network model for random <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> was implemented and evaluated through model simulation. In contrast to existing models that rely on four task-specific strategies to account for data, the queueing network model accounted for the same data using only one strategy already employed in cognitive modeling. To extend this parsimonious, “minimal task strategy ” modeling approach, Q-Learning, one of the reinforcement learning methods, was adopted to generate different patterns in eye movement. The same strategy from random <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> was used to generate eye movement, and the simulated eye movements were qualitatively compared to the human eye movement. I...|$|E
40|$|When people search a Web {{page for}} links that are {{relevant}} to their information goal, they attend to the labels and estimate the likelihood that the link will lead to the goal. We have previously found in a simplified single-page <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> task that people sometimes, but not always, assess only a subset of the links available. Importantly, the presence of lower relevance distracters resulted in fewer items being fixated; suggesting people may adjust an independent assessment of the relevance of a link, in order to derive an estimate that is interdependent with the quality of the other links in the choice set. Recently, we have presented an ACT-R model that was inspired by Young’s (1998) rational account of exploratory choice. The model makes use of ACT-R’s architectural assumptions in order to produce behavior that provides both qualitative and quantitative fits across a range of performance measures including eye-movement data. The behavior of the model differs substantially from previous ACT-R models of Web navigation. Keywords: Web navigation, single-page <b>menu</b> <b>search,</b> ACT-...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} {{identifying}} {{factors related to}} search efficiency resulted in empirical models {{that are hard to}} apply. In order to overcome the limitations inherent in descriptive empirical methods, a quantitative model of visual search, the Guided Search (GS) model, which has been validated in many perceptual tasks, was extended to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) settings. By testing the validity of the GS model in HCI visual search tasks, it provided insights in the perceptual factors related to the reduction of search time for HCI visual search tasks. First, GS simulation models were separately defined for a menu and an icon search task. Model parameters were determined by obtaining the best fit between model predictions and experimental data from 300 <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> trials and 300 icon search trials with 10 subjects respectively. The validity of GS models in HCI visual search tasks was examined in a series of three experiments with 40 subjects. In these experiments, the GS models were used to generate comparative menu and icon designs based on pre-defined search frequency using a Simulated Annealing (SA) optimization method. Two sets of performance comparison were made: one was between two designs generated by the GS model, the other was between a design generated by the model and a design generated by a human designer. The experimental results indicated that key perceptual aspects of a <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> task could be captured and manipulated by the GS model to minimize search time when cognitive factors were kept constant. However, the GS model by itself was not sufficient to generate designs as good as those made by a human because it was not able to account for cognitive factors such as memory search, which proved to be important in determining search efficiency in the <b>menu</b> <b>search</b> task. The GS model was not as successful in capturing the perceptual factors for an icon search task due to the complexity of the visual appearance of the icons. The GS models could be further developed into tools to evaluate or automate designs for HCI visual search tasks. ...|$|E

The icon- based menu is shown to produce a significantly higher learnability thus outweighing initial differences. In general, results demonstrate that icon-based menus are basically viable and successfully applicable, if a users-centered procedure is pursued and if icons represent prototypical semantic knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Auditory display {{research}} for driving has mainly focused on collision warning signals, and recent studies on auditory in-vehicle information presentation have examined {{only a limited}} range of tasks (e. g., cell phone operation tasks or verbal tasks such as reading digit strings). The present study used a dual task paradigm to evaluate a plausible scenario in which users navigated a song list. We applied enhanced auditory menu navigation cues, including spearcons (i. e., compressed speech) and a spindex (i. e., a speech index that used brief audio cues to communicate the user’s position in a long menu list). Twenty-four undergraduates navigated through an alphabetized song list of 150 song titles—rendered as an auditory menu—while they concurrently played a simple, perceptual-motor, ball-catching game. The menu was presented with text-to-speech (TTS) alone, TTS plus one of three types of enhanced auditory cues, or no sound at all. Both performance of the primary task (success rate of the game) and the secondary task (<b>menu</b> <b>search</b> time) were better with the auditory menus than with no sound. Subjective workload scores (NASA TLX) and user preferences favored the enhanced auditory cue types.
