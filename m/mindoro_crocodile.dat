5000|$|The Philippine {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus mindorensis), {{also known}} as the <b>Mindoro</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the Philippine freshwater crocodile or locally, bukarot, is one of two species of crocodiles found in the Philippines; the other is the larger Indo-Pacific crocodile or saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). [...] The Philippine crocodile, the species endemic only to the country, became data deficient to critically endangered in 2008 from exploitation and unsustainable fishing methods, such as dynamite fishing. Conservation methods are being taken by the Dutch/Filipino Mabuwaya foundation, the Crocodile Conservation Society and the Zoological Institute of HerpaWorld in Mindoro island. It is strictly prohibited to kill a crocodile in the country, and it is punishable by law.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{species of}} {{crocodiles}} are indigenous to the Philippines: the [...] "saltwater crocodile". Crocodylus porosus, {{also known as}} the Indo-Pacific crocodile, thrives in the Indo-Pacific region, Australia, Brunei, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Thailand. The <b>Mindoro</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus mindorensis) is unique to the Philippines that tends to prefer a freshwater habitat. The latter [...] - [...] is considered [...] "critically endangered" [...] by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [...] - [...] is found in Mindoro, Busuanga, Palawan, Masbate, Negros , Samar, and in the islands of Sulu. As both are threatened because of loss of their habitats to humans, conservation efforts apply to them both. Crocodile farming under CITES is geared towards the rescue and sustainable exploitation.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 the PWRCC [...] - [...] {{under the}} {{management}} of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) [...] - [...] were breeding over 600 <b>Mindoro</b> <b>crocodiles</b> and over 700 Philippine saltwater crocodiles for commercial purposes.|$|R
25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile has been extirpated from {{much of its}} former range within the Philippines and currently populations remain {{in only a few}} scattered locations. On the island of Mindanao the species is present within the Ligawasan Marsh and adjacent waterways in the southwest of the island and also within the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary in the eastern portion of the island, where in September 2011 a 20.24 foot/6.17 meter {{saltwater crocodile}}, the largest reliably measured, was captured by locals following two fatal attacks. This species is also reported to be found within the mangroves of Languyan Island of the Tawi-Tawi province southwest of Mindanao and within the mangroves of Del Carmen municipality on Siargao Island northeast of Mindanao. On Luzon Island the species has been reported from three areas in the northeast: the Blos River of barangay Reina Mercedes, the Divilacan mangroves of barangay Dimasalansan and the Palanan River estuary of barangay Culasi. On the island of Palawan the species appears to remain within only the southern portion of the country and in recent years, attacks on humans have occurred within the Rio Tuba area near Bataraza on the southeast coast and from near Rizal on the southeastern coast. The species is also reported to be present within the islands of the Balabac Strait between the island of Palawan and the Malaysian Borneo state of Sabah. The status of the species within Naujan Lake on the island of <b>Mindoro</b> is unclear; <b>crocodile</b> eye-shines have been spotted in recent years and these are believed to belong to the saltwater crocodile, but it is unknown whether a viable population remains.|$|R
