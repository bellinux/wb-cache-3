40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of the pasteurization and filtration on selected chemical compounds in beer. Specifically, the influence on elemental composition, content of organic acids, carbohydrates and phenolic substances was studied. Optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) was used for elemental analysis of beer. Analysis of organic acids was evaluated by Ion chromatography. For analysis of carbohydrates was used High performance liquid chromatography with ELSD detector (HPLC-ELSD), phenolic compounds was evaluated by HPLC with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Data from analysis of beer was performed by usage of statistical methods (analysis of variance and principal component analysis). Parameters that showed the most significant differences between individual groups of beers were obtained. Correlations between the variables and the technological beer processing operations were found. 12 parameters of total 23 were affected. The effect of filtration and pasteurization was observed in content of the iron, silicon, potassium and <b>magnesium,</b> <b>malate,</b> monosaccharides glucose and fructose and phenolic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt {{have been}} implicated as {{virulence}} factors in several pathogenic organisms, notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans. Malate synthase has thus {{emerged as a}} promising target for design of anti-microbial agents. For this effort, {{it is essential to}} have reliable models for enzyme:substrate complexes. A 2. 7 Å resolution crystal structure for M. tuberculosis malate synthase in the ternary complex with <b>magnesium,</b> <b>malate,</b> and coenzyme A has been previously described. However, some unusual aspects of malate and Mg++ binding prompted an independent determination of the structure at 2. 3 Å resolution, in the presence of saturating concentrations of malate. The electron density map of the complex reveals the position and conformation of coenzyme A to be unchanged from that found in the previous study. However, the coordination of Mg++ and orientation of bound malate within the active site are different. The revised position of bound malate is consistent with a reaction mechanism that does not require reorientation of the electrophilic substrate during the catalytic cycle, while the revised Mg++ coordination is octahedral, as expected. The results should be useful in the design of malate synthase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The binding of {{phosphoenolpyruvate}}, malate, and glucose 6 -phosphate to {{phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase}} purified from Crassula argentea Thunb. {{was measured using}} both the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme and the extrinsic fluorescence of the complex of 8 -anilino- 1 -napthalenesulfonate with the enzyme. It {{was found that the}} substrate phosphoenolpyruvate can bind in the absence of magnesium but is bound in greater quantities and more tightly when <b>magnesium</b> is present. <b>Malate</b> reduces the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate, while glucose 6 -phosphate increases the binding of the substrate. Glucose 6 -phosphate requires magnesium to bind to the enzyme, while malate does not. The general trends from the binding experiments using fluorescence methods were confirmed by activity determinations using assays performed in the absence of magnesium...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium {{participates in}} {{numerous}} enzymatic reactions {{in the human}} body and it has essential role in the maintenance of the antioxidant system. Since several magnesium compounds have been applied in the food and pharmaceutical industry, our purpose was to investigate the antioxidant/free radical scavenging activity of some magnesium compounds in vitro. The antioxidant/prooxidant effect of inorganic salts (e. g. MgCl 2) and organic complexes (e. g. Mg-gluconate) was determined with chemiluminometric method (H 2 O 2 /•OH-microperoxidase-luminol) and heme mediated LDL oxidation (LDL-heme-H 2 O 2) in vitro. It has been stated that the chemiluminescence method and LDL (low density lipoprotein) oxidation measurement is applicable in the presence of magnesium salts and complexes. Most of the compounds do not generate free radicals and the antioxidant/prooxidant effect depends {{on the quality of the}} ligand and the concentration. In the concentration range used, some representatives of the magnesium compounds (MgO, Mg-gluconate, Mg-polygalacturonate) investigated showed radical generating activity measured with chemiluminescence method, whereas the LDL oxidation has not been affected. <b>Magnesium</b> citrate and <b>malate</b> proved to be antioxidants measured with the chemiluminescence method and they slightly accelerate the LDL oxidation in the system and in the concentration applied. In vitro some of the ligands of magnesium compounds showed antioxidant activities. ...|$|R
