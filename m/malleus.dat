5|$|Middle ear - In crown-group mammals, {{sound is}} carried from the eardrum by {{a chain of}} three bones, the <b>malleus,</b> the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the <b>malleus</b> and the incus are derived from the {{articular}} and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids.|$|E
5|$|The {{three small}} {{bones in the}} middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the <b>malleus,</b> incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The <b>malleus</b> and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (<b>malleus,</b> incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (<b>malleus</b> and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
50|$|Both B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei can be cultured in a laboratory; {{nutrient}} agar {{can be used}} to grow the bacteria. When grown in culture, B. <b>mallei</b> grows in smooth, grey, translucent colonies. In a period of 18 hours at 37°C, a B. <b>mallei</b> colony can grow to about 0.5-1.0 mm in diameter. B. <b>mallei</b> culture growth on MacConkey agar is variable. Many microbiologists are unfamiliar with B. <b>mallei</b> and as a result it has frequently been misidentified as a Pseudomonas species or as a contaminant in a culture.|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia <b>mallei</b> is the causative {{agent of}} human and animal {{glanders}} and is a category B biothreat agent. Rapid diagnosis ofB. <b>mallei</b> and immediate prophylactic treatment are essential for patient survival. The majority of current bacteriological and immunological techniques for identifying B. <b>mallei</b> from clinical samples are time-consuming, and cross-reactivity with closely related organisms (i. e. Burkholderia pseudomallei) is a problem. In this investigation, twoB. mallei-specific real-time PCR assays targeting the B. <b>mallei</b> bimAma gene (Burkholderia intracellular motility A; BMAA 0749), which encodes a protein involved in actin polymerization, were developed. The PCR primer and probe sets were tested for specificity against a collection of B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei isolates obtained from numerous clinical and environmental (B. pseudomallei only) sources. The assays were also tested for cross-reactivity using template DNA from 14 closely related Burkholderia species. The relative limit of detection for the assays {{was found to be}} 1 pg or 424 genome equivalents. The authors also analysed the applicability of assays to detectB. <b>mallei</b> within infected BALB/c mouse tissues. Beginning 1 h post aerosol exposure, B. <b>mallei</b> was successfully identified within the lungs, and starting at 24 h post exposure, in the spleen and liver. Surprisingly, B. <b>mallei</b> was not detected in the blood of acutely infected animals. This investigation provides two real-time PCR assays for the rapid and specific identification of B. <b>mallei...</b>|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia <b>mallei</b> is a Gram-negative {{bacterial}} pathogen of domestic equidae and humans {{that can cause}} severe, rapidly life-threatening pneumonic infections. Little is known regarding the role of chemokines and early cellular immune responses in protective immunity to pulmonary infection with B. <b>mallei.</b> Although the role of MCP- 1 in Gram-positive bacterial infections has been previously investigated, the role of MCP- 1 in immunity to acute pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacteria, such as B. <b>mallei,</b> has not been assessed. In a mouse model of pneumonic B. <b>mallei</b> infection, we found that both MCP- 1 mice and CCR 2 mice were extremely susceptible to pulmonary infection with B. <b>mallei,</b> compared with wild-type (WT) C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. Bacterial burden and organ lesions were significantly increased in CCR 2 mice, compared with WT animals, following B. <b>mallei</b> challenge. Monocyte and dendritic cell recruitment into the lungs of CCR 2 mice was significantly reduced in comparison with that in WT mice following B. <b>mallei</b> infection, whereas neutrophil recruitment was actually increased. Depletion of monocytes and macrophages prior to infection also greatly raised the susceptibility of WT mice to infection. Production of IL- 12 and IFN-γ in the lungs after B. <b>mallei</b> infection was significantly impaired in both MCP- 1 and CCR 2 mice, whereas treatment of CCR 2 mice with rIFN-γ restored protection against lethal challenge with B. <b>mallei.</b> Thus, we conclude that MCP- 1 {{plays a key role}} in regulating cellular immunity and IFN-γ production following pneumonic infection with B. <b>mallei</b> and therefore may also figure importantly in other Gram-negative pneumonias.

5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the <b>malleus</b> bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The <b>malleus</b> rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the <b>malleus</b> (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
40|$|Burkholderia <b>mallei</b> is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} gram-negative pathogen and is the causative agent of human and animal glanders. By generating polar mutations (disruption of bsaQ and bsaZ) in the B. <b>mallei</b> ATCC 23344 animal pathogen-like type III secretion system (TTS), we demonstrate that this bacterial protein delivery system is required for intracellular growth of B. <b>mallei</b> in J 774. 2 cells, formation of macrophage membrane protrusions, actin polymerization, and phagosomal escape. These findings suggest that TTS {{plays a role in}} the intracellular trafficking of B. <b>mallei</b> and may facilitate cell-to-cell spread via actin-based motility...|$|R
5000|$|The genome of B. <b>mallei</b> was {{sequence}}d in the United States by The Institute of Genomic Research. The size of {{the genome}} is smaller than that of B. pseudomallei. The B. <b>mallei</b> sequence revealed a chromosome of 3.5 mega base pairs (Mb) and a 2.3 Mb [...] "megaplasmid”. Many insertion sequences and phase-variable genes were also found. The genome for B. <b>mallei</b> {{is made up of}} two circular chromosomes. Chromosome 1 is where genes relating to metabolism, capsule formation, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis are located. B. <b>mallei</b> has a polysaccharide capsule which indicates its potential as a pathogen. Chromosome 2 is where most of the information regarding secretion systems and virulence-associated genes are located. Multilocus sequence typing has revealed that B. <b>mallei</b> most likely evolved from a B. pseudomallei clone reduction. About 1000 B. pseudomellei genes are absent or varying in the B. <b>mallei</b> genome. B. mallei’s genome also has a large amount of insertion sequences.|$|R
5000|$|Lipopolysaccharide {{isolated}} from B. <b>mallei</b> demonstrated significantly lower biological activity {{as compared to}} the LPS from Escherichia coli, in agreement with the lower degree of acylation of its lipid A: the major forms of B. <b>mallei</b> lipid A were penta- and tetraacylated, whereas classical lipid A from E. coli was hexaacylated. In addition, lipid A from B. <b>mallei</b> contains 4-amino-4-deoxyarabinose residue in almost half of the molecules, which would partially neutralize the negative charge of the phosphate groups necessary for the interaction with the positively charged amino acids of TLR4. At the same time, lipid A acyl chains in B. <b>mallei</b> were on the average longer (14-16 carbon atoms) than those in E. coli (14 carbon atoms), yet LPS from B. <b>mallei</b> appeared to be a weaker activator. B. <b>mallei</b> may employ LPS with low biological activity to evade proper recognition by the TLR4/MD-2 complex of innate immune system, dampening the host immune response and increasing the risk of bacterial dissemination.|$|R
5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The <b>malleus</b> receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the <b>malleus</b> and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the <b>Malleus</b> Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese used B. <b>mallei</b> {{in their}} {{biological}} warfare research units. The most notable and notorious unit, Unit 731, used the bacterium to conduct experiments on live human subjects. However, the Japanese {{did not end}} up creating a biological weapon out of B. <b>mallei.</b> They did actually use B. <b>mallei</b> to test its effectiveness in contaminating water supplies, {{and the results of}} these tests were successful.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} days of B. <b>mallei</b> infection, neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells go to the spleen in great quantities. The early {{cellular}} response to B. <b>mallei</b> infection involves Gr-1+ (antigen) cells, and implies their importance to immunity against this bacterial infection. T cells (nitric oxide) are actually more involved in combating B. <b>mallei</b> in the later stages of its infection of a host.|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antimicrobial}} susceptibilities of isolates of Burkholderia <b>mallei</b> to 16 antibiotics were assessed and {{compared with the}} susceptibilities of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia cepacia. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of B. <b>mallei</b> resembled that of B. pseudomallei more closely than that of B. cepacia, which corresponds to their similarities in terms of biochemistry, antigenicity, and pathogenicity. Ceftazidime, imipenem, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin were active against both B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei. Gentamicin was active against B. <b>mallei</b> but not against B. pseudomallei. Antibiotics clinically proven {{to be effective in}} the treatment of melioidosis may therefore be effective for treating glanders...|$|R
25|$|Indeed, {{the very}} {{title of the}} <b>Malleus</b> Maleficarum is feminine, {{alluding}} {{to the idea that}} it was women who were the villains. Otherwise, it would be the <b>Malleus</b> Maleficorum (the masculine form of the Latin noun maleficus or malefica, 'witch'). In Latin, the feminine maleficarum would only be used for women, while the masculine maleficorum could be used for men alone or for both sexes if together. The <b>Malleus</b> Maleficarum accuses male and female witches of infanticide, cannibalism and casting evil spells to harm their enemies as well as having the power to steal a man's penis. It goes on to give accounts of witches committing these crimes.|$|E
25|$|The alleged {{approval}} from the theologians at Cologne, which Kramer included in the <b>Malleus</b> {{with a list of}} names of theologians who he claimed approved the book, has also been questioned by many historians, since In 1490 the clergy at Cologne condemned the book and {{at least two of the}} clergy listed by Kramer, Thomas de Scotia and Johann von Wörde, publicly denied having approved the <b>Malleus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Malleus</b> elevates sorcery to the {{criminal}} status of heresy and prescribes inquisitorial practices for secular courts in order to extirpate witches. The recommended procedures include torture to effectively obtain confessions and the death penalty as the only sure remedy against the evils of witchcraft. At that time, it was typical to burn heretics alive at the stake and the <b>Malleus</b> encouraged the same treatment of witches. The book had a strong influence on culture for several centuries.|$|E
40|$|Burkholderia <b>mallei</b> is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that can}} cause fatal disease in animals and humans. To better understand the role of phagocytic cells in the control of infections caused by this organism, studies were initiated to examine the interactions of B. <b>mallei</b> with RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages. Utilizing modified kanamycin-protection assays, B. <b>mallei</b> was shown to survive and replicate in RAW 264. 7 cells infected at multiplicities of infection (moi) of ≤ 1. In contrast, the organism was efficiently cleared by the macrophages when infected at an moi of 10. Interestingly, studies demonstrated that the monolayers only produced high levels of TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 10, GM-CSF, RANTES and IFN-β when infected at an moi of 10. In addition, nitric oxide assays and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunoblot analyses revealed {{a strong correlation between}} iNOS activity and clearance of B. <b>mallei</b> from RAW 264. 7 cells. Furthermore, treatment of activated macrophages with the iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, inhibited clearance of B. <b>mallei</b> from infected monolayers. Based upon these results, it appears that moi significantly influence the outcome of interactions between B. <b>mallei</b> and murine macrophages and that iNOS activity is critical for the clearance of B. <b>mallei</b> from activated RAW 264. 7 cells...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia <b>mallei</b> {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) {{has been}} previously shown to cross-react with polyclonal antibodies raised against B. pseudomallei LPS; however, we observed that B. <b>mallei</b> LPS does not react with a monoclonal antibody (Pp-PS-W) specific for B. pseudomallei O polysaccharide (O-PS). In this study, we identified the O-PS biosynthetic gene cluster from B. <b>mallei</b> ATCC 23344 and subsequently characterized the molecular structure of the O-PS produced by this organism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBurkholderia <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei are Gram-negative {{pathogenic}} bacteria, {{responsible for}} the diseases glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Furthermore, there is currently no vaccine available against these Burkholderia species. In this study, we aimed to identify protective proteins against these pathogens. Immunization with recombinant B. <b>mallei</b> Hcp 1 (type VI secreted/structural protein), BimA (autotransporter protein), BopA (type III secreted protein), and B. pseudomallei LolC (ABC transporter protein) generated significant protection against lethal inhaled B. <b>mallei</b> ATCC 23344 and B. pseudomallei 1026 b challenge. Immunization with BopA elicited the greatest protective activity, resulting in 100 % and 60 % survival against B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei challenge, respectively. Moreover, sera from recovered mice demonstrated reactivity with the recombinant proteins. Dendritic cells stimulated {{with each of the}} different recombinant proteins showed distinct cytokine patterns. In addition, T cells from immunized mice produced IFN-γ following in vitro re-stimulation. These results indicated therefore {{that it was possible to}} elicit cross-protective immunity against both B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei by vaccinating animals with one or more novel recombinant proteins identified in B. <b>mallei...</b>|$|R
25|$|Gender-specific theory {{developed}} in the <b>Malleus</b> Maleficarum laid the foundations for widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches. Later works on witchcraft have not agreed entirely with the <b>Malleus</b> {{but none of them}} challenged the view that women were more inclined to be witches than men. It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why women are witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness of body and mind (the old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.|$|E
25|$|The tensor tympani acts {{to dampen}} the noise {{produced}} by chewing. When tensed, the muscle pulls the <b>malleus</b> medially, tensing {{the tympanic membrane}} and damping vibration in the ear ossicles and thereby reducing the perceived amplitude of sounds.|$|E
25|$|The Leges Henrici Primi, written c. 1115, treated pre-quickening {{abortion}} as a misdemeanor, and post-quickening {{abortion as}} carrying a lesser penalty than homicide.

5000|$|B. <b>mallei</b> is {{very closely}} related to B. pseudomallei, being 99% {{identical}} in conserved genes when compared to B. pseudomallei. B. malllei has about 1.4 Mb less DNA than B. pseudomallei. [...] B. <b>mallei</b> may have actually evolved from a strain of B. pseudomallei after the latter had infected an animal. The bacterium would have lost the genes that were not necessary for living in an animal host. This suggestion has found support from studies that compare strains of B. <b>mallei</b> to B. pseudomallei and indicate that their two respective genomes are very similar. The genes that allowed the bacterium {{to survive in a}} soil environment, like genes that gave B. <b>mallei</b> the capacity to protect against bactericidals, antibiotics, and antifungals, were likely deleted. Thus, the reason that B. <b>mallei</b> is not found outside of a host is because it lacks the genes necessary for survival in the soil. Genome comparisons also seem to indicate that the B. <b>mallei</b> is still evolving and adapting to an intracellular lifestyle.|$|R
40|$|Cases of {{melioidosis}} and glanders {{are rare}} in the United States, but the etiologic agents of each disease (Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia <b>mallei,</b> respectively) are classified as Tier 1 select agents {{because of concerns about}} their potential use as bioterrorism agents. A rapid, highly sensitive, and portable assay for clinical laboratories and field use is required. Our laboratory has further evaluated a latex agglutination assay for its ability to identify B. pseudomallei and B. <b>mallei</b> isolates. This assay uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the capsular polysaccharide produced by B. pseudomallei and B. <b>mallei,</b> but is absent in closely related Burkholderia species. A total of 110 B. pseudomallei and B. <b>mallei</b> were tested, and 36 closely related Burkholderia species. The latex agglutination assay was positive for 109 of 110 (99. 1 % sensitivity) B. pseudomallei and B. <b>mallei</b> isolates tested...|$|R
50|$|B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei have {{a history}} of being on a list of {{potential}} biological warfare agents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies B. <b>mallei</b> as a category B critical biological agent. As a result, research regarding B. <b>mallei</b> may only be done in biosafety level 3 facilities in the US and internationally. Though it is so highly infective and a potential biological weapon, little research has been conducted on this bacterium. B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei under the policy of Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern would be subject to oversight to ensure the responsible investigation of these agents.|$|R
25|$|Kramer {{wrote the}} <b>Malleus</b> {{following}} his expulsion from Innsbruck {{by the local}} bishop, due to charges of illegal behavior against Kramer himself, and because of Kramer's obsession with the sexual habits {{of one of the}} accused, Helena Scheuberin, which led the other tribunal members to suspend the trial.|$|E
25|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} the early Jurassic, {{provides}} the first clear evidence of fully mammalian jaw joints and middle ears, in which the jaw joint is formed by the dentary and squamosal bones while the articular and quadrate move to the middle ear, where they are known as the incus and <b>malleus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The late 15th {{century was}} also a period of {{religious}} turmoil.

50|$|Most organisms {{within the}} Burkholderiaceae live in soil; however, B. <b>mallei</b> does not. Because B. <b>mallei</b> is an obligate {{mammalian}} pathogen, it must infect a host mammal {{to live and}} to be transmitted from one host to another.|$|R
50|$|B. <b>mallei</b> is {{responsible}} for causing glanders disease, which historically mostly affected animals, such as horses, mules, and donkeys, and rarely humans. Horses are considered the natural host for B. <b>mallei</b> infection and are highly susceptible to it. B. <b>mallei</b> infects and gains access to the cell of its host through lysis of the entry vacuole. B. <b>mallei</b> has bacterial protein-dependent, actin-based motility once inside the cell. It is also able to initiate host cell fusion that results in multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). The consequence of MNGCs {{has yet to be}} determined, but it may allow the bacteria to spread to different cells, evade responses by the infected host’s immune system, or allow the bacteria to remain in the host longer. B. <b>mallei</b> is able to survive inside host cells through its capabilities in disrupting the bacteria-killing functions of the cell. It leaves the vacuoles early, which allows for efficient replication of the bacteria inside the cell. Leaving the cell early also keeps the bacteria from being destroyed by lysosomal defensins and other pathogen-killing agents. MNGCs may help protect the bacteria from immune responses. B. mallei’s ability to live within the host cell makes developing a vaccine against it difficult and complex. The vaccine would need to create a cell-mediated immune response, as well as a humoral response to the bacteria in to be effective in protecting against B. <b>mallei.</b> In regards to a vaccine against B. <b>mallei,</b> the closeness of B. <b>mallei</b> to B. pseudomallei may make it possible that a vaccine developed for either type would be effective against the other.|$|R

The high molecular weight polysaccharide material is thought to be the capsule of B. pseudomallei and B. <b>mallei</b> and may have important links with virulence. B. pseudomallei and B. <b>mallei</b> are known to be closely related, sharing many epitopes, but antigenic variation has been demonstrated within both the species. The lipopolysaccharide from strains of B. pseudomal/ei and B. <b>mallei</b> has been isolated and the silver stain profiles found to be visually very similar. A monoclonal antibody raised to B. <b>mallei</b> LPS has been found to recognise both B. <b>mallei</b> and B. pseudomallei strains.

A monoclonal ant ibody rai sed against this atypical LPS showed no recognition of the typical LPS profile of either B. <b>mallei</b> or B. pseudomallei. This atypical LPS structure has not been reported and may be immunologically distinct from the typical LPS. Molecular biology and antibody engineering techniques have been used in an attempt to produce single-chain antibody fragments reactive to B. pseudomallei.
