25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E

500|$|During {{performances}} of [...] "Don't Panic", Martin {{would stop the}} song after Buckland performs his verse and make him perform it a second time. Buckland jokingly stated {{in an interview with}} Business Times that he wanted the practice dropped, saying, [...] "I don't think I would dread it so much if he didn't (sometimes) make <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> twice." [...] Performances during 2017 legs of A Head Full of Dreams Tour would feature drummer Will Champion as lead vocalist.|$|E
500|$|The 48-page {{prestige}} format one-shot comic took {{a considerable}} amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says [...] "seemed prepared to let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at my own pace." [...] The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a [...] "very hands-off sort of guy," [...] with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Wrubel and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, if you let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E

500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{also helped}} popularize {{political}} subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths {{at the turn}} of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan's cultural nationalism on their debut album To the East, Blackwards, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded The Devil Made <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers' debut Holy Intellect. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only [...] "the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world" [...] but also [...] "the most politically ambitious. Not even in the heyday of [...] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous '60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music." [...] Their music on the album inspired leftist and Afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in the music. Reeves said it introduced black consciousness to the [...] "hip-hop youth" [...] of the [...] "post-black power generation", [...] "as leather African medallions made popular by rappers like P.E. replaced thick gold chains as the ultimate fashion statement ... P.E.'s million seller sat at the front of a full-blown black pride resurgence within rap".|$|E
2500|$|Their second album, Made <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It,</b> {{released}} in 2000, was more melodic and resembled the Gothenburg style (with bands such as At the Gates, etc.) more than old-school thrash metal {{that was used}} on The Haunted. It is originally called Made <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It,</b> but it is meant for the band name {{to be included in}} the title. [...] "The Haunted Made Me Do It" [...] topped CMJ Loud Rock Radio Chart in four weeks, and won a Swedish Grammy for Best Hard Rock Album. The album was followed by European tours with Entombed and Nile, The Crown in U.K., and In Flames in Japan. The Haunted played on festivals such as 2000 Decibel, Hultsfred (both in Sweden), Graspop (Belgium), and Wacken Open Air (Germany). The band subsequently released their first live album - Live Rounds in Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|ABC invited Keith to sing [...] "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue" [...] on a 2002 Fourth of July concert it was producing, then {{rescinded}} {{the invitation}} after host Peter Jennings heard {{the song and}} vetoed it. Jennings said the song [...] "probably wouldn’t set the right tone". [...] "I find it interesting that he's not from the U.S.," [...] Keith said of Jennings, who was Canadian. [...] "I bet Dan Rather'd let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on his special." ...|$|E

It was released in February 1983 as the first single and title track from the album If Gonna <b>Do</b> <b>Me</b> Wrong (<b>Do</b> <b>It</b> Right).

The eighth Ice Cube studio LP, titled Raw Footage, was {{released}} on August 19, 2008, and featured the singles Gangsta Rap Made <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> and Do Ya Thang. Ice Cube appeared on a song by rapper The Game titled [...] "State of Emergency" [...] off The Game's album, L.A.X. In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and returned to perform at the 2011 festival.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the punch was thrown {{by a member of}} Raekwon's entourage named Hanz. Hanz stated that he [...] "did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer." [...] He further commented [...] "I punched him in the face because he was outta line. I look at him like, not the school yard bully, but the motherfucker that's always picking on a motherfucker that don't fuck with nobody. To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy, Meth don't fuck with nobody. I'm not gonna sit here and say Rae made <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> that was a spontaneous decision on my own. I'm glad I did it, 'cause he got a big mouth...It wasn't actually planned, he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded, as it went on".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{surveillance}} videotape made on February 5, 2003, {{of a private}} meeting in Garson's , Siminovsky asked Garson if he would award the couple’s home to his client, Avraham Levi. Garson responded: [...] "I’ll award him exclusive use". He gave Siminovsky detailed instructions {{as to how to}} argue the Levi divorce case before him. He assured Siminovsky that if he followed Garson's instructions: [...] "The worst possible scenario is a win.... You're in good shape. You're a winner either way. And your schmuck [...] doesn't deserve it." [...] Garson dictated to Siminovsky the exact language the lawyer should use in a memo to Garson. He urged him to charge his client extra for the memo, saying: [...] "I am telling you, charge for it. This is extra; this was not contemplated; the judge made <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it....</b> Squeeze the guy." [...] Referring to the estranged wife (Sigal Levi), the judge said: [...] "She's fucked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was a big}} fool to take up with a {{stranger}} like Shocker," [...] said the money-lender's son. [...] "You'll not catch <b>me</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> again!

2500|$|Ozu {{told me to}} come [...] in {{the room}} [...] and circle around. So I did as I was told, but of course it wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s {{what he was trying to}} express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During August 2010, Blasko {{recorded}} an album, Seeker Lover Keeper, in New York for {{the group}} {{of the same name}} with fellow founding members and Australian singer-songwriters, Sally Seltmann and Holly Throsby. The group's debut album peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Albums Charts in June 2011, Blasko's highest chart entry. The trio embarked on a national tour to promote the album in June and July that year. Of the album's 12 tracks each of the artists had an equal share of four tracks, however Blasko takes lead vocal on five tracks including [...] "Rely on Me" [...] written by Throsby, Blasko described [...] "I was reluctant to do it but the girls kept asking me. I couldn't hear myself singing that one until Holly made <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I enjoyed it because the song has real generosity to it". Greenberg felt Blasko's lead vocals were on the [...] "most memorable tracks, using her signature form of lilting power". By year's end all three artists had returned to their respective solo careers.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1981, Adam & the Ants {{released}} another {{highly successful}} album, Prince Charming. The album featured two United Kingdom No.1 singles – [...] "Stand and Deliver" [...] {{and the title}} track [...] "Prince Charming" [...] – {{as well as the}} No.3 UK hit [...] "Ant Rap". This trio of singles was promoted by some of the most lavish music videos of the period and paved the way for Adam Ant's later acting career. The work schedule Adam Ant imposed upon himself was punishing. [...] "I took no holidays – and I mean no holidays. When Kings of the Wild Frontier took off, I was halfway through making Prince Charming, and so on, because we had to bring out an album and four singles a year. But the price you pay... I split my cartilage in Cleveland doing [...] "Goody Two Shoes", it was my body saying, 'Look, no!' Then I was back onstage doing the Motown 25 [...] show 10 days later, having had the operation. Nobody could have stopped me, or make <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I did it. I was very, very bad at pacing," [...] he later remembered.|$|E
