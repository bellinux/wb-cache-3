30|$|Medical {{radiation}} from X-rays and nuclear medicine {{is the largest}} <b>man-made</b> <b>source</b> of radiation exposure in Western countries [4]. Ionizing radiation including X-rays and γ-rays are well-known proven carcinogens, according to the classification of the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer [5]. Radiation’s deleterious effects are typically classified as stochastic effects that are due to radiation-induced mutations and deterministic effects (i.e. tissue reactions) due to radiation-induced cell death. Deterministic effects only occur above a threshold level of radiation, which is generally higher than levels occurring from a single non-invasive imaging procedure. The risk of developing cancer deriving from radiation exposure is mainly stochastic, which means that it may occur without a specific threshold level, although {{the magnitude of this}} risk remains unclear, particularly at very low doses. The risk is also cumulative.|$|E

40|$|The current {{generation}} of Earth-imaging satellites is used primarily to produce photographic quality images that are corrected for inherent non-uniformity in the focal plane (flat-fielding) and non-linearity in the sensor. The next generation of satellites requires the extraction of target reflectance with 1 - 2 % uncertainty from these images. This requires the payload to be radiometrically calibrated to 1 % uncertainty, or less. In order to achieve these levels of uncertainty, a radiometric standard is needed that is accessible from low Earth-orbit. Unfortunately, {{there is no such}} standard currently available.
