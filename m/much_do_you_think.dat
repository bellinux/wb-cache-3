6000|$|... "Is there very <b>much,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> in the {{suggestion}} that some of this Ulster trouble is a German intrigue? You and Mr. Philbert were saying things--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her father {{spoke for}} the first time since the Galahad of the tin bug had come: [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we ought to give this fellow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of my going home?" [...] Chad {{was clearly}} surprised. [...] "Oh not <b>much!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that when I {{want to go}} any one will have any power--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a good walker," [...] was Dave's comment, as {{the three}} partook of food themselves. [...] "How <b>much</b> further <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he'll go to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One will answer. How <b>much</b> fortune <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will be {{necessary}} to make such a couple happy, at starting in the world? Name such a sum as will comport with your own ideas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>much</b> further <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it may be}} to the tree, Onondago?" [...] {{demanded the}} surveyor, as soon as the whole party was {{collected}} in a circle. [...] "I have a reason for asking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] exclaimed Baynes; [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon--I was {{thinking}} of something else. Why yes, of course, glad to pay, I'm sure. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm worth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{pulled himself}} up in the hammock to get her face fully in view, and asked, [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I've been able to average up to this time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{we ought}} to pay?" [...] asked Dick. [...] "Name a {{reasonable}} price and I may settle, just to avoid trouble, and not because I think I ought to pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear chap, I don't {{know what}} on earth you're talking about. How <b>much</b> money <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I've got? Four hundred pounds a year, and no {{prospect}} of ever making more unless I sweat for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{either of}} you suppose," [...] remarked the Master of the House, [...] "that that Anita woman gave the whole of that great estate to the widow and her two children? How <b>much</b> land <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> John Gayther, was {{enclosed}} inside that chicken wire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mr. Flint interrupted, smiling {{somewhat}} blandly, [...] "how <b>much</b> money <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{that pass}} would save an active young lawyer in a year? Is three hundred dollars too much? Three hundred dollars {{is not an}} insignificant sum {{to a young man}} on the threshold of his practice, is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{have touched}} of that? Not two! Of that, three-fourths {{went to the}} harpies I fell in with at Paris, under Charles's auspices--and five-and-twenty there'--pointing in the {{direction}} of Whittington-street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look! look! A nugget! Oh, what a big fellow! How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it's worth?" [...] he cried; {{and rubbed}} the muck {{off with his}} coat sleeve. [...] "It {{looks as if it}} was solid!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you keep}} quiet. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it would cost}} my father for detectives and all that to recover that safe? Give me your promise, that 's all, and when I 've got things arranged, if you don't like them you can back out. Come on; that 's fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{must not}} be too lavish,” Stephen said, “as {{we do not know}} how long we may have to wait here. I propose for breakfast that we have {{biscuits}} only, then for dinner we will have some meat and biscuits again, and for supper cold meat and cakes. How <b>much</b> meat <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> there is, Wilcox?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't mention {{what will}} happen if we miss it," [...] Harding commented with grim humor. [...] "Anyway, that piece of meat won't make <b>much</b> difference. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Blake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{waved his}} hand at the shining {{whiteness}} below. [...] "It's dead--dead! Vast extinct volcanoes, lava wildernesses, tumbled wastes of snow, or frozen carbonic acid, or frozen air, and everywhere landslip seams and cracks and gulfs. Nothing happens. Men have watched this planet systematically with telescopes for over two hundred years. How <b>much</b> change <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they have seen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord bless you, my dear Mr. Miles, it {{has been}} foreclosed, under the statue I believe they call it; and it was advertised to be sold three months. Then, when it was sold, how <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the place, mill and all, {{actually}} brought? Just give a guess, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{think of}} Villa," [...] Dick replied, {{with a sharp}} laugh the {{bitterness}} of which did not escape Paula. [...] "If he wins he says he's going to divide all the land among the peons. The next logical step will be the mines. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we've coughed up to the constitutionalists in the past twelvemonth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we are averaging?" [...] asked Randy, one day, and {{his uncle}} {{replied that he}} could not figure very closely, but he would put it down as over a hundred dollars per day. This meant twenty-five dollars a day as the boy's share, and he felt more content than ever to slave along in the gulch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dare {{you believe}} that would have mattered so very <b>much</b> to me? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I didn't know why you turned farmer, and why you have since then done things that none of your neighbors would have been capable of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you might}} well say 'so young,' amico mia! To be grown up is <b>much</b> nicer; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> so? And then I shall not look such a baby as now, and have people scold me when I {{get in the}} way, as they do little bambini." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently Elizabeth was of age, and Denton had a {{business}} interview {{with her father}} that was not agreeable. An exceedingly disagreeable interview with their money-lender followed, from which he brought home a white face. On his return Elizabeth {{had to tell him}} of a new and marvellous intonation of [...] "Goo" [...] that their daughter had devised, but Denton was inattentive. In the midst, just as she was at the cream of her description, he interrupted. [...] "How <b>much</b> money <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we have left, now that everything is settled?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} nothing to do with Mr. Farnaby--unless I find that his wife's money is not at her own disposal. What you heard in the kitchen has altered all my plans. Wait a minute--and you will see what I am driving at. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Mrs. Farnaby would give me, if I found that lost {{daughter}} of hers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Major {{had sunk}} every {{shilling}} he could scrape together on an annuity, {{and of course}} {{was going to leave}} Pen nothing; but he did not tell Foker this. [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a Major on half-pay can save?" [...] he asked. [...] "If these people have been looking at him as a fortune, they are utterly mistaken-and-and you have made me the happiest man in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If the {{business}} {{is going to be}} conducted as you say, captain," [...] replied the first mate, [...] "I say it will be all fair and square, and I needn't bother my head with any more doubts about it. But there is one thing I wish you would tell me: how <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I will be likely {{to get out of this}} cargo, when you divide?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{mouth opened}} {{as if for}} bitterness; but no sound came. [...] "How <b>much</b> self-respect <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> is left for me after to-day?" [...] she said mournfully at last; and then she quickly took a step nearer her dear one, as if to caress the spot where these words had struck him. But she stopped, {{and for a moment}} she was the Grizel of old. [...] "Have no fear," [...] she said, with a trembling, crooked smile; [...] "there is only one thing to be done now, and I shall do it. All the blame is mine. You shall not be {{deprived}} of your self-respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{he is in}} a more domineering mood {{he likes}} such allusions to his [...] rank as king.... If he could resume his walks on the terrace he [...] might improve slightly. But it is too soon yet. We must {{consider}} [...] what we shall report to the Council. There is little hope of his [...] being <b>much</b> better. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Willis? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{troubles}} of which <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not speak," [...] he went on. [...] "If my friendship is worth anything, {{it ought to}} enable me to share those troubles with you. You have had a little further disagreement with your husband, I think, and bad luck at the tables. You ought not to let either of these things depress you too <b>much.</b> Tell me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that I could help with Sir Henry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} which I like best; this, or my own place at Boxall Hill. You have the {{advantage}} here in trees, and those sort of things. But, as to the house, why, my box there is very comfortable, very. You'd hardly know the place now, Lady Arabella, if you haven't seen it since my governor bought it. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he spent about the house and grounds, pineries included, you know, and those sort of things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young lady}} fixed on him those large grey eyes which had in them {{the roll of}} genius. [...] "Dear Don Pickwixote," [...] she said, [...] "I would merely take it from the mouths of those who don't know what it means; and how <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would be left? Not enough to butter the {{parsnips}} of a Borough Council, or fill one leader in a month of Sundays. Have you not discovered, Don Pickwixote, that Liberty means the special form of tyranny which one happens to serve under; and that our form of tyranny is GAS." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would do}} admirably, Pertaub. Of course, I shall also want saddles and bridles. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it will come}} to, altogether? I do not want showy horses, but they must be animals capable of {{performing}} a long journey, and of travelling at a fair rate of speed--the faster the better. We are likely to get seven or eight hours start, at least; but must, of course, travel fast. As long as all goes well, I shall keep the main roads, {{but if there is}} a breakdown, or an unforeseen accident occurs, I may have to leave the road and take to bypaths." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' he said. 'Ah! now you've done it! Now you've given {{yourself}} away! <b>You</b> <b>did</b> it on purpose. You mixed those {{tickets on}} purpose. I thought as <b>much.</b> Say, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are, <b>doing</b> {{this sort of}} thing? Don't you know that professional dancers are three for ten cents? I could go out right now and whistle, and get a dozen girls for your job. The boss'll sack you just one minute after I tell him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; you {{can tell}} her so. You may {{take my word for}} this, too,--my sister hates Crosbie quite as <b>much</b> as <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I <b>think</b> she'd 'pitch into him,' as you call it, herself, if she knew how. You come down to Guestwick for the Christmas, and then go over to Allington and tell them all plainly what you mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Apart from that, which, as you hint, {{gives me}} {{a reason to be}} thankful that I alone (happily for all the rest) possess, surely there is no one in the House who would not say and feel at least as <b>much.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> that anybody here would be {{indifferent}} to a mischance or misfortune happening {{to the head of the}} House, or anything than truly sorry for it?' ...|$|R
