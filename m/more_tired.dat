5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the <b>more</b> <b>tired</b> you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
500|$|England's {{selection}} of Ramsey {{and three of}} his Tottenham teammates—Ditchburn, Nicholson and forward Eddie Baily—for the 1950 World Cup in Brazil made them the first Tottenham players ever at a World Cup. England were among the favourites to win the tournament, largely because of their reputation. The team had little preparation, arriving in Brazil only a week before their first game. Ramsey found the South American conditions difficult, noting that [...] "at the conclusion of even an easy kick-around, I felt infinitely <b>more</b> <b>tired</b> than after a hectic League match at home." [...] Despite this an England team including Ramsey won their opening match, in Rio de Janeiro against Chile, 2–0.|$|E
500|$|The {{very first}} scene {{was shot in}} a small tank {{across the street from}} North Shore Studios in Vancouver. Wide-angle lenses were used to film the scene as the actors did not {{actually}} have much room for swimming. This made it look like the actors are actually covering some ground, while in reality they only swam [...] On the set of the following scene in which Fox Mulder reaches the shore, it was raining and very cold. Manners commented that the acting crew was <b>more</b> <b>tired</b> than usual because of it—during filming, Duchovny struggled to run from the actors playing his pursuers, but had previously been able to run from two horses when filming the episode [...] "Tunguska".|$|E

500|$|Jack Bender {{stated that}} Matthew Fox [...] "really commits {{body and soul}} into the story he's telling" [...] and Fox {{questioned}} whether {{he had ever been}} <b>more</b> <b>tired</b> than while shooting the double episode. [...] Like the other Lost season finales, the final cliffhanger scene was given a codename—"The Rattlesnake in the Mailbox"—and kept top secret. [...] After Lindelof and Cuse wrote the scene, only Fox, Lilly, Bender, and co-executive producer Jean Higgins were given copies of the script. [...] The scene was shot with a green screen in an abandoned Honolulu parking lot with the airport edited in. [...] Despite the security measures, a complete and detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online over a week before the episode aired. [...] Disney investigated the leak. [...] The leak prompted Lindelof and Cuse to enter [...] "radio silence", which was temporarily broken at Comic-Con International 2007. [...] The funeral parlor that Jack visits is called [...] "Hoffs/Drawlar", which is an anagram of [...] "flashforward". The idea of flashforwards was conceived by creators Lindelof and Abrams during the show's conception. [...] However, Cuse and Lindelof only started fleshing out the idea {{at the end of the}} first season, after they realized that flashbacks would eventually stop being revelatory and knew that they would eventually have to switch to flashforwards. [...] With the announcement that the series would conclude 48 episodes after [...] "Through the Looking Glass", they felt comfortable playing flashforwards as early as the third season finale.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise {{meets the}} USS Fearless to bring aboard Mr. Kosinski (Stanley Kamel), a Starfleet {{propulsion}} expert {{who plans to}} run tests on the warp engines to improve their efficiency. With Kosinski is his assistant, an alien being from Tau Alpha C known as the Traveler (Eric Menyuk). As Kosinski and the Traveler explain the tests to the engineering crew, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) quickly grasps what the tests are designed to accomplish and the Traveler expresses admiration for his problem-solving abilities. The test quickly goes awry when the Enterprise speeds up, surpassing the known capabilities of warp engines. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship stopped, and the crew find themselves {{on the far side}} of the M33 Galaxy (more than 2.7million light years from the Milky Way, the Enterprises home galaxy). Although Kosinski is pleased with the results, he is reprimanded by Picard and asked to simply redo the process to return home. Crusher attempts to warn Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that during the warp test, the Traveler appeared to [...] "phase," [...] drifting in and out of reality, but Riker dismisses him without listening. However, after Kosinski begins the second test, Crusher and Riker both observe the Traveler again drifting out, appearing <b>more</b> <b>tired.</b> The Enterprise again experiences a burst of speed, and when it stops, the crew cannot determine their position. Picard demands that Kosinski get the crew home.|$|E

50|$|Skidding is the vehicle's {{response}} {{to one or}} <b>more</b> <b>tires</b> slipping. The vehicle dynamics during a skid will depend on whether {{some or all of}} the tires are skidding, and whether the car was rotating or turning when the skid began.|$|R
2500|$|If {{a person}} with fatigue decides to seek medical advice, the overall goal is to {{identify}} and rule out any treatable conditions. [...] This is done by considering the person's medical history, any other symptoms that are present, and evaluating of the qualities of the [...] fatigue itself. [...] The affected person {{may be able to}} identify patterns to the fatigue, such as being <b>more</b> <b>tired</b> at certain times of day, whether fatigue increases throughout the day, and whether fatigue is reduced after taking a nap.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} continued {{traveling and}} growing <b>more</b> <b>tired</b> and cold. Then the sleigh again hit an obstruction and tipped over, throwing Hazel over the dashboard into the snow. Hazel, Emmet, and Myrdith {{tried to push}} the sleigh upright, but were {{not strong enough to}} lift it, even with all three pushing at once. Using the overturned sleigh as a shelter, Hazel spread two blankets, told Emmet and Myrdith to lie down, and placed a third blanket atop them. The children tried to keep moving to stay warm. Hazel huddled beside her brother and sister and used her body heat to warm them. She told them stories to keep them awake. The children sang all four verses of [...] "America the Beautiful," [...] a song they had sung during opening exercises at the country school that morning, and repeated the Lord's Prayer. Hazel advised her siblings, [...] "Remember, you mustn't go to sleep — even if I do. Promise me you won't, no matter how sleepy you get. Keep each other awake! Promise?" [...] Her brother and sister promised.|$|E

50|$|While {{blindfold}} chess {{has been}} recommended in moderation by many sources {{as a method}} of increasing one's playing strength, simultaneous blindfold exhibitions were officially banned in 1930 in the USSR as they were deemed to be a health hazard.

50|$|Tires are {{classified}} into several standard types, {{based on the}} type of vehicle they serve. Since the manufacturing process, raw materials, and equipment vary according to the tire type, it is common for tire factories to specialize in one or <b>more</b> <b>tire</b> types. In most markets, factories that manufacture passenger and light truck radial tires are separate and distinct from those that make aircraft or off-the-road (OTR) tires.|$|R
