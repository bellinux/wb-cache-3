30|$|Performing surgery {{requires}} {{a broad spectrum}} of psychomotor, cognitive, and interprofessional skills to complete complex tasks in stressful environments. Therefore, intensive training is needed for surgeons to master techniques and attain surgical expertise. Much research has been focused on training <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> for surgery, such as suturing and knot tying [1], resulting in standardized certification programs like the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) curriculum, which is endorsed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). However, <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> are only one aspect of surgical expertise. After <b>mastering</b> <b>technical</b> <b>skills,</b> surgeons must combine them into complex tasks and procedures. Further, surgery takes place under stressful, attentionally demanding conditions. The surgeon must perform tasks with enough spare attention to multitask.|$|R

40|$|Expert {{professional}} practice in any field {{is known to}} rely on both explicit (formal) and tacit (personal) forms of knowledge. Current anaesthetic training programmes appear to favour explicit knowledge and measurable competencies. We aimed to describe and explore the way different types of knowledge are learned and used in anaesthetic practice. Method. Qualitative approach using non-participant observation of, and semi-structured interviews with, anaesthetic staff in two English hospitals. Results. The development of expertise in anaesthesia rests {{on the ability to}} reconcile and interpret many sources of knowledge—clinical, social, electronic, and experiential—and formal theoretical learning. Experts have <b>mastered</b> <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> but are also able to understand the dynamic and uncertain condition of the anaesthetized patient and respond to changes in it. This expertise is acquired by working with colleagues, and, importantly, by working independently, to develop personal routines. Routines mark the successful incorporation of new knowledge but also function as a defence against the inherent uncertainty of anaesthetic practice. The habits seen in experts’ routines are preferred ways of working chosen from a larger repertoire of techniques which can also be mobilized as changing circumstances demand. Conclusions. Opportunities for developing expertise are linked to the independent development of personal routines. Evidence-based approaches to {{professional practice}} may obscure the role played by the interpretation of knowledge. We suggest that the restriction of apprenticeship-style training threatens the acquisition of anaesthetic expertise as defined in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{field hockey}} {{coaching}} process across both Malaysia and India favours a traditional, coach-centred approach of <b>mastering</b> <b>technical</b> <b>skills</b> {{in terms of}} game play parameters, fitness, intensity, and load training, whereas a tactical- and player-centred pedagogical approach still takes a backseat. On the other hand, the Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) model offers tactical-cognitive instruction and is gaining international recognition {{for its ability to}} produce intelligent players via a problem-solving approach in game play. Therefore, the purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to investigate the effect of TGfU compared to skill mastery instruction, termed as <b>Skill</b> Drill <b>Technical</b> (SDT), among Malaysian and Indian elite junior hockey players in term of the game play attributes of adjust and cover in 5 vs. 5 small-sided game play and game play intensity via heart rate (HR) at different points of game play. A total of n = 60 players with an average age of 15 ± 1. 03 was selected via simple random sampling from both countries involved in this study and assigned equally to groups, with 15 per group for TGfU and for SDT across Malaysia and India. Gathered data were analysed using the ANOVA and ANCOVA techniques. Findings indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} for adjust in 5 vs. 5 game play between TGfU and SDT across Malaysia and India after the intervention. For cover, there was significant improvement for Malaysian players using the TGfU model compared to SDT. In contrast, there was no significant difference between these two models among the Indian players after the intervention. There was significant difference between these two models in terms of warm-up HR across the two countries, and HR was higher via TGfU. For HR immediately after the 5 vs. 5 game play intervention and HR after three minutes’ recovery, Indian players with TGfU recorded a higher and significant difference compared to SDT. However, findings indicated no significant difference between these two instruction types among Malaysians, although TGfU proved to have higher HR intensity. Therefore, these findings reiterated that TGfU is a useful approach for game play to enhance intensity and cardiac output. In conclusion, for TGfU to be more relevant to the coaching environment, future research should link game play and physiological parameters. TGfU should able to overcome the barriers of tradition and cultural background that may hinder its momentum...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of laboratory medicine on veterinary medicine in Spain {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century. It is considered from a perspective that places the laboratory at the centre of a strategy for introducing the ideal of progress into veterinary medicine at a sensitive moment in its history. In the adverse context created by the steady replacement of horses —the principal recipients of veterinary care— by motor vehicles, an awareness grew that the time had come to reinvent the profession. The arrival of experimental veterinary medicine, especially the area linked to bacteriological laboratories, opened the door to explore new prospects for the future and became one of the bases for the discipline’s modernisation. A new professional was envisaged to attain this objective, the «scientific laboratory veterinarian», whose knowledge would be based on experimentation and who would <b>master</b> highly specialised <b>technical</b> <b>skills.</b> This vision of a profession in search of prestige would bring to light conflicting interests among the different healthcare professions and would emphasise the importance of adopting patterns of behaviour that led to identification of these new veterinary surgeons with the elite of society...|$|R

Revising the IS curriculum to keep it up to date while meeting demands of the Information Technology (IT) labor market {{continues to be a}} challenging task. In order to graduate students that are competitive, post-secondary educational institutions must adopt a new methodology where IT certification {{is an integral part of}} the IS curriculum. The IEEE and ACM recognize the importance of IT certification and provide its members with over 800 online courses that lead to various IT certificates. The selection of the appropriate IT certificate for integration into the IS curriculum is a complex task as it entails a thorough knowledge of the curriculum and the certificate objectives. The goal of this paper is to propose a selection of IT certificates which can be readily integrated into the IS curriculum. Three potential certification tracks for the purpose of this study are identified: Networking, Programming, and IT hardware and software. A list of vendors and non-vendors IT certificates and their exam requirements is developed, and the IS courses which can lead to the listed IT certificates are identified. This identification is based on matching specific course objectives with the IT certificate and the timeline needed for the certificate completion. The selection of the IT certificates for each track is optimized to facilitate both student learning and the completion of the certificate. Integrating IT certification in computing curricula makes IS programs more attractive to students. Moreover, the acquisition of IT certification is a valued asset for graduates seeking employment or advancement in the computing field...|$|R
