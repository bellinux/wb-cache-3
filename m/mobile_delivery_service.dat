However, there are some limitations and obstacles for <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> in <b>mobile</b> environment because of the particularity of mobile network and limiting ability of mobile terminals. In order to improve the efficiency and performance of <b>service</b> <b>delivery,</b> this paper introduces a middleware-based approach for <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> In this way, the workload of mobile terminal devices can be reduced and the heterogeneities of terminal platforms and network communication protocols can be shielded off. Platform-independent, favorable extensibility, strong flexibility and well-behaved security are the typical advantages of the <b>mobile</b> <b>delivery</b> approach. Moreover, it can provide user-centric services through building user profile, without worrying about the mobile network discontinuity and limited processing abilities of mobile terminal devices.

A <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> system should be able to detect relevant events that occur such as change of location, availability of new last-minute specials, sales opportunities and safety issues and then reactively take action in response to these events. This work describes a situation management ontology based framework for delivering such a system. Issues addressed include HMP and service states and events, context, situations and situation-action rules, and syntactically and semantically compatible XML ontologies for their specification. A generic situation management ontology is developed in OWL using the ontology development tool, Protégé. This ontology is combined with domain specific classes in the travel domain to create a travel situation management ontology that can be used as the basis for a ubiquitous mobile travel service application. Using a typical independent traveller scenario, the travel situation management ontology is instantiated to demonstrate its effectiveness. The flexibility of the generic situation management ontology is demonstrated by creating an academic situation management ontology by simply replacing a small number of domain specific classes. A framework is also proposed that is based on the situation management ontology, distributed, co-operating software agents, and context based filtering, and is suitable for <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> The example framework uses the situation management ontologies developed in this work and action rules to link situation specification to situation detection and action.

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{critical}} challenges for service oriented computing systems is the capability to guarantee scalable and reliable service provision. This paper presents Reliable GeoGrid, a decentralized service computing architecture based on geographical location aware overlay network for supporting reliable and scalable <b>mobile</b> information <b>delivery</b> <b>services.</b> The reliable GeoGrid approach offers two distinct features. First, we develop a distributed replication scheme, aiming at providing scalable and reliable processing of location service requests in decentralized pervasive computing environments. Our replica management operates on a network of heterogeneous nodes and utilizes a shortcut-based optimization to increase the resilience of the system against node failures and network failures. Second, we devise a dynamic load balancing technique that exploits the service processing capabilities of replicas to scale the system in anticipation of unexpected workload changes and node failures by taking into account of node heterogeneity, network proximity, and changing workload at each node. Our experimental evaluation shows that the reliable GeoGrid architecture is highly scalable under changing service workloads with moving hotspots and highly reliable {{in the presence of}} both individual node failures and massive node failures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel “cache-and-forward ” (CNF) protocol architecture for <b>mobile</b> content <b>delivery</b> <b>services</b> {{in the future}} Internet. The CNF architecture can be implemented as an overlay {{on top of the}} Internet Protocol (IP), or as a clean slate protocol for next-generation networks. CNF is based on the concept of store-and-forward routers with large storage, providing for opportunistic delivery to occasionally disconnected mobile users and for in-network caching of content. The proposed CNF protocol uses reliable hop-by-hop transfer of large data files between CNF routers in place of an end-to-end transport protocol like TCP. This approach makes it possible to serve mobile users with intermittent connectivity, while also mitigating selfinterference problems which arise in multi-hop wireless scenarios. Hop-by-hop transport is similarly useful in wired networks where router storage can help to smooth out link congestion bottlenecks which arise in TCP/IP networks. A second key feature of the CNF protocol is the integration of addressbased and content-based routing to support various content delivery modes that take advantage of in-network storage. An overview of the CNF architecture and major protocol components is given, and preliminary performance evaluation results are summarized to validate the main design principles...|$|R

Towards this direction, we develop a QoS-predictions service provider, which includes functionality for the acquisition of generic offered-QoS information and which, via a multidimensional processing and history-based reasoning, will provide predictions of the expected offered-QoS in a reliable and timely manner. We acquire the generic QoS-information from distributed mobile services’ components quantitatively (actively and passively) measuring the applicationlevel QoS, while the reasoning is based on statistical data mining and pattern recognition techniques...|$|R
