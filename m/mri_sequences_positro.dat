50|$|Steady-state free {{precession}} (SSFP) imaging is {{a magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) technique which uses steady states of magnetizations. In general, SSFP <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> {{are based on a}} (low flip angle) gradient-echo <b>MRI</b> <b>sequence</b> with a short repetition time which in its generic form has been described as the FLASH MRI technique. While spoiled gradient-echo sequences refer to a steady state of the longitudinal magnetization only, SSFP gradient-echo sequences include transverse coherences (magnetizations) from overlapping multi-order spin echoes and stimulated echoes. This is usually accomplished by refocusing the phase-encoding gradient in each repetition interval {{in order to keep the}} phase integral (or gradient moment) constant. Fully balanced SSFP <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> achieve a phase of zero by refocusing all imaging gradients.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} several magnetic resonance imaging (<b>MRI)</b> <b>sequences</b> on amniotic fluid temperature and intrauterine sound pressure.

Intrauterine summation levels reached peak levels up to 103. 0 dB(A) before starting the <b>MRI</b> <b>sequence</b> and levels up to 116. 0 dB(A) during a real-time sequence.

Our procedure consists of the following steps: a) Pre-processing of the <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences,</b> T 2, T 1 and T 1 post contrast for size standardization, contrast equalization and division into active cells b) Identification of the T 2 <b>MRI</b> <b>sequence</b> as normal or abnormal by exploiting the vertical symmetry of the brain c) Determination of the region of abnormality using its hyper-intense nature. d) Separation of tumor from edema using the T 1 and its postcontrast (enhanced) sequences and e) Estimation {{of the volume of}} tumor found and generation of an anatomical differential of the possible disorders. This approach has been tested on more than a hundred real dataset both normal and abnormal representing tumors of different shapes, locations and sizes and results being checked by radiologists thus defining an efficient and robust technique for automated detection and segmentation of brain tumors.

30|$|This {{study has}} several limitations. First, {{this is a}} {{retrospective}} study, {{and there is no}} histopathological correlation of disease for the PSMA-positive foci that were detected. The majority of patients were treated according to the findings of their PET/MRI scans without biopsy confirmation. It is possible that there were false-positive PSMA PET-avid foci, although no pathology proven false-positive lesions are known. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify which <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> should be used to co-localize suspicious findings, rather than estimating the diagnostic accuracy of PSMA PET/MRI. Additionally, only a small number of limited <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> were obtained for localization of PSMA-positive lesions. It is possible that optimized, dedicated, <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> would have a better diagnostic performance; yet, the goal of the study was not to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for the detection of PSMA PET-avid foci, but to identify the best sequences to co-localize suspicious findings.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} non-enhanced magneticresonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI) for detecting hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). METHODS: A total of 121 consecutive patients with 149 initialHCCs definitely diagnosed by dynamic computed tomographyunderwent non-contrast MRI including DWI and ultrasound(US). Detection rates for hypervascular HCC were calculated forall non-enhanced <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> including DWI and US. Then,the correlations between tumor negativity on DWI and otherMRI sequences and tumor location were analyzed to clarify thecharacteristics of negative HCC on DWI. RESULTS: The detection rates for HCC by US, all MRI sequenceswithout DWI, and all <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> including DWI were 85 %, 91 %,and 99 %, respectively. The HCC detection rate was significantlyhigher by all <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> including DWI than by US (p< 0. 001) and all <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> without DWI (p< 0. 001). All negative HCCson DWI were isointense or hyperintense on T 1 -weighted imaging(p< 0. 001). Negative HCCs on DWI showed significantly higher ratesof positive chemical shift (p= 0. 013) on T 1 -weighted imaging andhypointense or isointense tumors on T 2 -weighted imaging (p< 0. 001). The HCC detection rate by DWI was 83 % in S 2, lower than in othersegments. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of hypervascular HCCs on nonenhancedMRI including DWI was superior to that on non-enhancedMRI without DWI and US. However, a well-differentiated HCCor a nodule in S 2 influenced by cardiac motion artifact may not bedetected on DWI...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} fast 3 D dynamic {{programming}} expansion {{to find a}} shortest surface in a 3 D matrix. This algorithm can detect boundaries in an image sequence. Using phantom image studies with added uniform distributed noise from different SNRs, the unsigned error of this proposed method is investigated. Comparing the automated results to the gold standard, the best averaged relative unsigned error of the proposed method is 0. 77 % (SNR = 20 dB), and its corresponding parameter values are reported. We further apply this method to detect the boundary of the real superficial femoral artery (SFA) in <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> without a contrast injection. The manual tracings on the SFA boundaries are performed by well-trained experts to be the gold standard. The comparisons between the manual tracings and automated results are made on 16 <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> (800 total images). The average unsigned error rate is 2. 4 % (SD = 2. 0 %).
