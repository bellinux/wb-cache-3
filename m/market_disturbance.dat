(2011), Zhang (2010), and Jarrow and Protter (2012), regulators have {{taken steps to}} increase their regulatory authority over HFT activities. Some {{of the problems that}} arose in the mid- 2000 s led to regulatory hearings in the United States Senate (2009) on dark pools, flash orders and HFT practices in 2009, and the discussions continued into 2012 (Brooks 2012). Another example occurred after the Facebook IPO problem. This led the SEC to call for a limit up-limit down mechanism at the exchanges to prevent trades in individual securities from occurring outside of a specified price range so that market volatility will be under better control (Pisani 2013). These regulatory actions put stricter requirements on HFT practices, aiming to minimize the <b>market</b> <b>disturbance</b> when many fast trading orders occur within a day. Similar regulatory actions have occurred in Europe as well. For example, in September 2013, Italy became the first country to levy fees HFT trading to discourage its usage (Stafford 2013).|$|E

40|$|I {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} different types of credit <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> on the euro area economy since the introduction of the euro, i. e. exogenous credit demand shocks, innovations to the credit multiplier (e. g. shocks to risk taking by banks, securitiza-tion or financial innovations such as credit risk transfer instruments) and monetary policy shocks. In a second step, monetary policy shocks are further decomposed into traditional interest rate innovations and non-conventional policy actions. Overall, the macroeconomic relevance is considerable. Credit <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> account to-gether {{for more than half of}} output variation and up to 75 percent of long-run inflation variability. The majority of these effects are driven by shocks to the credit multiplier. I further show that the dynamic effects crucially depend on the underlying source of the disturbance. Whereas surges in credit caused by innovations to the credit mul-tiplier have a significant positive impact on economic activity and inflation, exactly the opposite is the case for exogenous credit demand shocks. Finally, both types of monetary policy instruments can influence the economy. The ultimate consequences on output and consumer prices are however more sluggish for non-standard policy measures, and the transmission mechanism via financial institutions- very likely the risk-taking channel- is different...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{epidemiological}} studies of infections spreading through trade networks, e. g. via livestock movements, generally show that central large-size holdings (hubs) should be preferentially surveyed and controlled {{in order to}} reduce epidemic spread. However, epidemiological strategies alone may not be economically optimal when costs of control are factored in together with risks of market disruption from targeting core holdings in a supply chain. Using extensive data on animal movements in supply chains for cattle and swine in France, we introduce a method to identify effective strategies for preventing outbreaks with limited budgets while minimizing the risk of market disruptions. Our method involves the categorization of holdings based on position along the supply chain and degree of market share. Our analyses suggest that trade has a higher risk of propagating epidemics through cattle networks, which are dominated by exchanges involving wholesalers, than for swine. We assess the effectiveness of contrasting interventions from the perspectives of regulators and the market, using percolation analysis. We show that preferentially targeting minor, non-central agents can outperform targeting of hubs when the costs to stakeholders and the risks of <b>market</b> <b>disturbance</b> are considered.

40|$|In this paper, we {{simulate}} the car market {{in order to}} forecast the effects of feebate systems based on an energy-labeling scheme using categories A to G. Very fuel-efficient (A) cars receive a cash incentive, highly inefficient (G) cars pay additional fees. Consumers have different price elasticities and behavioral options to react to feebates. They can switch to a smaller sized car, but as energy-efficiency varies widely within size segments, they can also stick to the preferred size class and choose a more efficient (smaller) engine. In addition, previously owned cars influence the next car to be chosen. We use an agent-based microsimulation approach particularly suited to predict environmental and market effects of feebates. Heteorogenous agents choose from a choice set drawn from a detailed fleet of new cars.

This dissertation contains three chapters, each {{focusing on a}} different aspect of the micro structure of trade flows and shipments to and within the United States. All three chapters make use of rich micro level data on trade flows. In the first chapter, I study imports of heavy goods and how these products compete with local production. Although imports of heavy goods are often thought to stay near the coast, these goods frequently travel much farther. I develop a structural model of demand with large choice sets where all transaction prices are observed, but offered prices are unknown. Using unique micro data linking shipments to locations, I find that the rail network {{plays an important role}} in allowing shipments to reach distant locations. Once firms pay the fixed cost of accessing this network, shipments can cheaply go far. As a result, the ability of imports to easily reach all locations disciplines prices even in areas with low import shares. Because domestic producers have access to the same transportation infrastructure, they also discipline prices in distant locations. I also find that the ability to price discriminate by location enables this type of competition over long distances. The second chapter is coauthored with Thomas Holmes. This chapter studies the shipment of internationally-traded goods, focusing on the path the goods take to get to their final destination, and in particular taking into account the internal geography of the destination country. We use Wal-Mart's distribution network as our primary empirical example, modeling the flow of shipments from origination country to U. S. port to import distribution center and finally on to the final consumer. The paper estimates the costs incurred by Wal-Mart on account of transit time, by studying the choice behavior, as Wal-Mart trades off shorter transit times in exchange for higher freight rates. The paper assembles a variety of new data sources including bills of lading for ocean shipping transactions that have been processed to match to data on selected individual firms, and that have been merged with GPS data on ocean vessels to ascertain shipping times. As an application, the paper considers the recent labor <b>market</b> <b>disturbance</b> on the West Coast ports of the United States. The paper produces estimates of the cost of this disruption as well as the gains to Wal-Mart of having a ''four corners'' distribution network. The third chapter looks at internal shipments within the United States. Shipment distances in the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) are disproportionately very short. This chapter looks at the distribution of shipment distances by industry using the 2012 public CFS. I use this data to support the explanation that wholesale networks result in low average distances. When measuring the total distance from manufacturer to consumer, if all layers of the wholesale network are considered then distances would be much larger...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Economics. Advisor: Varadarajan V. Chari. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 101 pages. This dissertation {{consists of three}} essays. In the first essay, I document novel empirical facts at the aggregate and the firm level on the reallocation of tangible and intangible capital. First, at the aggregate level, I interpret firm physical capital sales data as tangible capital reallocation and data on mergers and acquisitions (M&As) data on intangible capital reallocation. I document the cyclicality patterns of the reallocation of both forms of capital. I show that in recessions, the correlation of intangible capital reallocation with GDP {{is greater than the}} correlation of tangible capital reallocation with GDP but in booms, the correlation of both types of capital reallocation with GDP are the same. I interpret this result as suggestive evidence that tangible capital serves a collateral motive which intangible capital does not since in recessions, firms choose to reallocate intangible capital over tangible. I also show that in the last decade the correlation of tangible capital reallocation with GDP has decreased to a quarter of its 1980 s level. However, the correlation of intangible capital reallocation with GDP has remained the same in the last decade as in the 1980 s. This result indicates that tangible capital collateralizability has become more important over time. Both these results show the distinctive cyclicality of the reallocation of both forms of capital. Second, at the firm level, I use data on M&As to document the effects of capital reallocation on firm productivity and the importance of including intangible capital when evaluating the effects of capital reallocation. I document that after an M&A, acquirer's structurally estimated productivity increases on average 4 % annually, and this productivity is 45 % higher when intangible capital is excluded from the estimation. This serves as evidence that capital reallocation is beneficial for the acquirers and intangible capital reallocation can account for measured productivity gains. In the second essay, I contribute to the recent macroeconomics literature on financial frictions at a theoretical and a quantitative level. This literature attempts to quantify the magnitude of output fluctuations attributable to financial market disturbances through frictions on the reallocation of capital among firms. At the theoretical level, I build a model in which heterogeneous firms use two forms of capital, tangible and intangible capital, to produce output. These firms are subject to idiosyncratic productivity shocks. I assume that only tangible capital is collateralizable and that both forms of capital are reallocatable across firms post-shock. I show that a financial <b>market</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{in the form of a}} tighter collateral constraint leads to a decline in output in the model with both forms of capital that is 2. 8 times greater than the decline in output in the model with only tangible capital, in the sense, allowing for intangible capital magnifies the effects of financial market disturbances on output. A tighter collateral constraint causes tangible capital reallocation to decline sharply because firms are more constrained and leads to a fall in intangible capital reallocation because both types of capital are complementary in production. In the third essay, I present novel empirical observations about mergers and acquisitions. I show that acquirer productivity increases after an merger or an acquisition and that these the ex-post productivity gains are an inverse function of the productivity difference between the acquirer and target at the time of the merger or an acquisition. I also note that the higher the ex-post productivity gains for an acquirer, the bigger the decline in acquirer announcement returns and smaller the increase in target announcement returns. Lastly, I show that the executive compensation increase does not account for most of the ex-post productivity gains. These findings show that gains after a merger or an acquisition are not accruing towards shareholders or executives. Thus, I find suggestive evidence that labor obtains the most benefit associated with a merger or an acquisition in the form of increased wages and benefits...|$|E

Several studies evaluate whether natural currency areas emerge based on historical pattern {{of international trade and}} of co-movements of prices and outputs, and found a well-defined dollar and euro areas but no clear yen area. This paper applies three different time series methods to determine if there are multi-country currency unions in the East Asian region.

Next, we employ a Bayesian sampling technique to estimate the latent parameters embedded in the Black-Scholes (1973) model and in the Merton (1976) model. Previous research has suggested that jumps in the underlying asset price are more critical for options with less than three months to expiration. Our results suggest that jumps in the underlying asset become more critical to option prices for options with less than two weeks to maturity. With our sampling technique, we are also able to generate implied-volatility distributions. We find that volatility distributions for options with less than two weeks to expiration are statistically different from volatility distributions for options with more than two weeks to expiration.

40|$|A {{financial}} crisis is a <b>disturbance</b> to financial <b>markets,</b> associated typically with falling asset prices and insolvency among debtors and intermediaries, which spreads through the financial system, disrupting the market's capacity to allocate capital. In this paper we analyze the generation and propagation of financial crises {{in an international}} setting. We provide a perspective on the danger of a serious disruption to the global financial system by comparing the last full-fledged {{financial crisis}} - that of the 1930 s - with conditions prevailing today. Our definition of a financial crisis implies a distinction between generalized financial crises {{on the one hand}} and isolated bank failures, debt defaults and foreign-exchange <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> on the other. We represent this distinction in three sets of linkages: between debt defaults and bank failures; between exchange-market disturbances and debt defaults; and between exchange-market disturbances and bank failures. In both the 1930 s and 1980 s, the institutional environment was drastically altered by rapid change in foreign exchange markets, in international capital markets, and in the structure of domestic banking systems. Our comparative analysis underscores the critical role played by institutional arrangements in financial markets as a determinant of the system's vulnerability to destabilizing shocks.

40|$|Liability {{management}} by the Australian trading banks {{is a relatively}} recent development, largely {{made possible by the}} inroduction of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCD’s). The market for NCD’s also acts as an important link in transmitting credit <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> to non-bank financial intermediaries. Relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} analysing the working of this market in Australia. This paper presents and estimates two models of the NCD market. In the first case the hypothesis of short term rationing, that arises from various restrictions on the operation of the market, is tested. The second model assumes that the market clears in the short run but adjusts with a lag to the desired long run position. Our results favour the second model. In addition, the demand for NCDs by the non-bank public depends on wealth and interest rates. The supply of NCD’s by the banks depends on the banks liquidity position and on interest rates. The results suggest that banks may use asset management instead of liability management when rates rise on liquid assets of the banks. Adjustment by the non-bank public to the long run demand is instantaneous, while the banks adjust with a lag. Our results suggest that approximately 84 per cent of the adjustment in the banks’ supply occurs within one year. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between yield spreads on the sovereign bonds and their determinants with a primary focus on the Czech Republic. First, a homogeneous panel of Visegrad group countries (V 4) was investigated by the pooled mean group (PMG) method of Pesaran et al. (1998). It was found that debt-to-gdp ratio along with VIX, the "fear gauge", are the main factors driving the spread dynamics in the V 4 group. Based on the results from PMG estimation, we estimate a three-dimensional vector autoregression (VAR) model and structural VAR (SVAR) model in order to observe spread reactions on external shocks. Among the V 4 group countries, Hungary exhibits the largest spread response to a VIX shock. Overall, the (S) VAR results confirmed that countries {{with higher levels of}} yields before crisis had also a stronger reaction to the <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> during 2007 - 2009.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{appropriate}} treatment of indirect socio-economic effects of transport investments and policies. A central question is how assessment of indirect effects can be improved and harmonised in a European context. First, the paper describes {{state of the art}} in assessment (identifying types of indirect socio-economic effects, modelling). Secondly, an overview is presented on current practice in EU-countries. Market imperfections and cross-border effects appear as key conditions for the existence of indirect effects. The proposed starting point for analysis is therefore the total absence of <b>market</b> <b>disturbances.</b> This point of reference, however, is used in no country. The paper concludes by stressing the importance of harmonisation of transport initiative assessment, as well as elaboration on the distinction of types of effects as well as market imperfections. A very clear advantage of harmonisation in Europe would be the inclusion of cross-border effects as direct socio-economic effects in CBA where they concern national borders and not EU-borders, instead of viewing them as welfare effects ‘leaking away’ to other member countries. Especially the market imperfections characterising land markets (external effects, replacement value) and the disturbances and rigidities specific for European labour markets offer great perspectives for better analysis of transport projects and hence better decision making. ...|$|R

Based on my estimates, I conclude that under normal circumstances a temporarily more aggressive interest policy alone does not help cushion shocks, and that the sensitivity of domestic prices to the exchange rate is similar in these countries irrespective of the interest rate policy they adopt. By contrast, price stability and the fact that inflation expectations are firmly anchored may reduce exchange rate pass-through considerably, which, in terms of inflation, offers better protection against external shocks. However, the results are not valid under circumstances where the central bank is experiencing severe <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> or panicky behaviour; firm interest measures in these cases may be appropriate and serve the intended purpose. monetary policy, risk premium shocks, exchange rate pass-through, structural VAR, sign restriction. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} a strong {{presumption}} in the financial press that oil prices drive the stock market, the empirical evidence on the impact of oil price shocks on stock prices has been mixed. This paper shows that the response of aggregate stock returns may differ greatly depending on whether the increase in the price of crude oil is driven by demand or supply shocks in the crude oil market. The conventional wisdom that higher oil prices necessarily cause lower returns is shown to apply only to oil-market specific demand shocks such as increases in the precautionary demand for crude oil that reflect fears about the availability of future oil supplies. In contrast, positive shocks to the global aggregate demand for industrial commodities are shown to cause both higher real oil prices and higher stock prices. Shocks to the global production of crude oil, while not trivial, are far less important for understanding changes in stock prices than shocks to global aggregate demand and shocks to the precautionary demand for oil. Further insights can be gained from the responses of industry-specific stock returns to demand and supply shocks in the crude oil market. We identify the sectors most sensitive to these shocks and study the opportunities for adjusting one’s portfolio in response to oil <b>market</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Demand shocks; Oil prices; Stock returns; Supply Shocks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate the existence of contagion effects of the Dow Jones index, commodity prices and exchange rate on the trajectory of the Bovespa index in the period 1999 - 2010, and analyze the longterm relationships between the variables. The theoretical framework is based on contagion effect, which occurs in the spread of <b>market</b> <b>disturbances</b> from one country to another country as discussed by Dornbusch, Park and Claessens (2000), Pericoli and Sbracia (2003), and Forbes and Rigobon (2002), as well as in empirical studies such as Lamounier and Nogueira (2007), Tabak e Lima (2003), Groppo (2006) and Pimenta (2004), among others, complete with research of the impact on commodity prices in the stock market, {{as can be seen in}} Barr and Kantor (2002). For this purpose, a cointegration test from the procedure suggested by Johansen (1991) was applied, and a vector autoregression model (VAR), initially proposed by Sims (1980) and Sims (1986), with the causality/exogeneity Granger test, was utilized. The results of Johansen cointegration test did not indicate the existence of long-term relationships between the variables. As to short-term effects, the impulse response functions showed that the Brazilian stock market index reacts positively to shocks in commodity prices and the U. S. stock market, and it demonstrates a positive reaction to currency depreciation, which suggests presence of the contagion effect...|$|R
