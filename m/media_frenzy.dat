5|$|A book by Van der Sloot and {{reporter}} Zvezdana Vukojevic, De zaak Natalee Holloway (The Case of Natalee Holloway) {{was published}} in Dutch in April 2007. In the book, Van der Sloot gives his perspective of the night Holloway disappeared and the <b>media</b> <b>frenzy</b> that followed. He admits and apologizes for his initial untruths, but maintains his innocence.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{began as}} early as May 2005, when Radcliffe {{announced}} he would reprise his role as Harry.

5|$|On February 14, 2008 a typo {{in court}} papers filed by Federal {{prosecutors}} erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run.

5|$|By 2000, Madonna {{was dating}} {{director}} Guy Ritchie, and {{was pregnant with}} their child. Wanting to distract herself from the <b>media</b> <b>frenzy</b> surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated {{on the development of}} her eighth studio album, Music. Buoyed up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new material. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{unprecedented}} <b>media</b> <b>frenzy</b> surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia {{for the birth of}} their first biological child. On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund. They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs. People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide <b>media</b> <b>frenzy.</b> Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies asset {{markets where}} Knightian {{uncertainty}} about the fundamentals can be mitigated through costly information acquisition. In these markets, investors’ information choices can be strategic complements, resulting in multiple equilibria, history-dependent prices, and large price swings occurring after small changes in uncertainty. Our model makes a number of predictions about the market response to uncertainty shocks, including crashes, followed by sustained rallies and price overshoots, and switches in information regimes, which the model generates due to the information complementarities. Our model highlights uncertainty as a new channel for episodes of extreme price volatility and <b>media</b> <b>frenzies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} and machine learning have been major research interests {{in computer science}} {{for the better part}} of the last few decades. However, all too recently, both AI and ML have rapidly grown to be <b>media</b> <b>frenzies,</b> pressuring companies and researchers to claim they use these technologies. As ML continues to percolate into daily life, we, as computer scientists and machine learning researchers, are responsible for ensuring we clearly convey the extent of our work and the humanity of our models. Regularizing ML for mass adoption requires a rigorous standard for model interpretability, a deep consideration for human bias in data, and a transparent understanding of a model's societal effects.

5|$|The Common Linnets capitalised {{on their}} Eurovision success with several events across Europe, {{including}} in Belgium, Germany and a secret concert in Vienna, Austria. However some controversy erupted when Waylon was absent from several scheduled events in May 2014, {{as well as}} inactivity from his official Twitter account for over a week. After becoming active again on social media, he expressed bemusement over the <b>media</b> <b>frenzy</b> over his absence. He also stated that The Common Linnets was always DeLange's vehicle and that his continuing participation in the group was always agreed {{to be in a}} varying capacity, and that he wished to focus on his solo career, including the release of his new album, which had already been delayed. Waylon stepped down from the group after their performance at the Tuckerville Festival in Enschede.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord {{were the}} next to feel the wrath of United in a {{back-to-back}} fixture. A penalty from Irwin in the home tie helped ensure the Mancunians would increase their tally to nine points, and a hat-trick from Andy Cole in Rotterdam helped maintain their 100% record in the group stage. However, the game was marred by a high tackle on defender Denis Irwin by Feyenoord midfielder Paul Bosvelt (leaving the Irish international six weeks out at a crucial stage {{of the season and}} causing something of a <b>media</b> <b>frenzy</b> back in Britain) and constant clashes between both sets of fans. Nevertheless, United were placed as favourites for the competition, largely due to their impressive start, and a routine 3–0 win at home to Košice all but ensured qualification to the knockout stage. Filippo Inzaghi's late header ended United's unbeaten streak in Europe in their last match away to Juventus, but United qualified as group winners nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Ian Meckiff (born 6 January 1935) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} Australia in 18 Tests between 1957 and 1963. A left-arm fast bowler, he {{is best known for}} two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player: He was the batsman run out by Joe Solomon in 1960, causing the first Tied Test in cricket history; and in December 1963, his career was sensationally ended when he was called for throwing in the First Test against South Africa by Australian umpire Col Egar. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a <b>media</b> <b>frenzy</b> about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing.|$|E

50|$|As a writer, Tracy Quan {{first made}} a splash with her Nancy Chan: Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl column in Salon.com. Combining {{sex with a}} twice-weekly serial, the semi-autobiographical column {{centered}} on Nancy as she juggles her 'straight' boyfriend and family with her clients and girlfriends' problems. The story continues in the novels. Tracy expresses the emotional aspects of her life experiences in her novels, her fiction writing, and keeps her journalism for professional commentary on topics of interest: the plight of sex trade workers, changing sexual mores, topical <b>media</b> <b>frenzies</b> on public personalities such as the Eliot Spitzer scandal. She was interviewed in 2005 by Rain Taxi on the tension and balance of her past and present careers. Quan is currently a full-time writer, has been a columnist for The Guardian website and is a contributor to The Daily Beast. In 2010, Quan was a semifinalist for the 3 Quarks Daily Politics Prize, judged by Lewis Lapham. She has become a frequent guest on Morning Brew, a Radio 3RTHK weekday breakfast show hosted by Phil Whelan, commenting on current events and social media.|$|R
