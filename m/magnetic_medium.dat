25|$|The 8-inch and 5¼-inch floppy disks {{contain a}} magnetically coated round plastic medium {{with a large}} {{circular}} hole in the center for a drive's spindle. The medium is contained in a square plastic cover that has a small oblong opening in both sides to allow the drive's heads {{to read and write}} data and a large hole in the center to allow the <b>magnetic</b> <b>medium</b> to spin by rotating it from its middle hole.|$|E
25|$|A {{spindle motor}} {{in the drive}} rotates the <b>magnetic</b> <b>medium</b> at a certain speed, while a stepper {{motor-operated}} mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E

The fabric is designed to reduce friction between the medium and the outer cover, and catch particles of debris abraded off the disk {{to keep them from}} accumulating on the heads. The cover is usually a one-part sheet, double-folded with flaps glued or spot-welded together.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s, {{limitations}} of the 5¼-inch format became clear. Originally designed to be more practical than the 8-inch format, it was itself too large; as the quality of recording media grew, data could be stored in a smaller area. A number of solutions were developed, with drives at 2-, 2½-, 3-, 3¼-, 3½- and 4-inches (and Sony's 90.0mm×94.0mm disk) offered by various companies. They all shared a number of advantages over the old format, including a rigid case with a sliding metal cover over the head slot, which helped protect the delicate <b>magnetic</b> <b>medium</b> from dust and damage, and a sliding write protection tab, which was far more practical than the adhesive tabs used with earlier disks. The large market share of the 5¼-inch format {{made it difficult for}} these new formats to gain significant market share. A variant on the Sony design, introduced in 1982 by a large number of manufacturers, was then rapidly adopted; by 1988 the 3½-inch was outselling the 5¼-inch.|$|E
