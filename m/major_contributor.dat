5|$|Since {{the breed}} first became {{commercial}}, it {{has spread to}} Canada and become a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> in the commercial lamb industry. The breed adapts well to confinement and is readily used in accelerated crossbreeding programs.

5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the {{sedimentation}} of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an {{irrigation ditch}} near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons {{of dirt and}} mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipyard}} {{was established}} in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 {{at the request of}} Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding, and it soon became a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to markets throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} from Crane Tech in1905, Brundage {{enrolled at the}} University of Illinois, where he undertook an arduous schedule of civil engineering courses. He received an honors degree in 1909. He wrote for various campus publications and continued his involvement in sports. Brundage played basketball and ran track for Illinois, and also participated in several intramural sports. In his senior year, he was a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to Illinois' Western Conference championship track team, which defeated the University of Chicago (coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg).|$|E

5|$|Canada's strong {{attachment}} to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations. During the Cold War, Canada was a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.|$|E

AM General, Crowe Horwath, Martin's Super Markets, and Schurz Communications all have corporate headquarters in South Bend.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 the United Kingdom was a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the {{invasion}} of Iraq, sending a force of over 46,000 military personnel. The British Army controlled southern Iraq, maintained a peace-keeping presence in Basra. All British troops were withdrawn from Iraq by 30 April 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to extend their mandate. One hundred seventy-nine British military personnel died in Iraqi operations. The British Armed Forces returned to Iraq in 2014 as part of Operation Shader to counter the Islamic State (ISIL).|$|E

5|$|Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and {{its shape}} is {{strongly}} asymmetrical, {{with one of}} the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one.

5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep geological repository environment. This makes it and its predecessors such as americium-241 candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation. Due to its long half-life, neptunium will become the <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> of the total radiotoxicity in 10,000 years. As {{it is unclear what}} happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Sclerocitrin, a pigment {{compound}} originally {{isolated from}} the common earthball (Scleroderma citrinum), is the <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow pigment, chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E

5|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E
5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} exponent of the revival was Dundee-born John Duncan (1866–1945), {{who was also}} influenced by Italian Renaissance art and French Symbolism.

Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950). Duncan was a <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to Geddes' magazine The Evergreen. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced Robert Burns (1860–1941), E. A. Hornel (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).|$|E
