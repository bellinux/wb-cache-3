5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in terms of human physiology, which in turn <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Alertness is {{a global}} {{observation}} of level of consciousness i.e. awareness of, and responsiveness to the environment, and this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as alert, clouded, drowsy, or stuporous. Orientation is assessed by asking the patient {{where he or she}} is (for example what building, town and state) and what time it is (time, day, date).|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E

5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{molecular}} structure, synephrine has a phenethylamine skeleton, with a phenolic hydroxy- group, an alcoholic hydroxy- group, and an N-methylated amino-group. Alternatively, synephrine <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as a phenylethanolamine with an N-methyl and p-hydroxy substituent. The amino-group confers basic properties on the molecule, whereas the phenolic –OH group is weakly acidic: the apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated synephrine are 9.55 (phenolic H) and 9.79 (ammonium H).|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, {{electronegativity}} {{is associated}} more with different functional groups than with individual atoms. The terms group electronegativity and substituent electronegativity are used synonymously. However, {{it is common}} to distinguish between the inductive effect and the resonance effect, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as σ- and π-electronegativities, respectively. There are a number of linear free-energy relationships that have been used to quantify these effects, of which the Hammett equation is the best known. Kabachnik parameters are group electronegativities for use in organophosphorus chemistry.|$|E
25|$|When the {{dimension}} of the lattice rises to four or more, rotations need no longer be planar; the 2D proof is inadequate. However, restrictions still apply, though more symmetries are permissible. For example, the hypercubic lattice has an eightfold rotational symmetry, corresponding to an eightfold rotational symmetry of the hypercube. This is of interest, not just for mathematics, but for the physics of quasicrystals under the cut-and-project theory. In this view, a 3D quasicrystal with 8-fold rotation symmetry <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as the projection of a slab cut from a 4D lattice.|$|E

25|$|Human reason {{requires}} more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire {{would have to be}} thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.|$|E
25|$|He practised as an {{architect}} in Bristol from 1888. His work includes schools, such as the board schools in Barton Hill, Easton, and Southville, Greenbank Elementary School and St George's School. He designed the schools of medicine and engineering at Bristol University and the Music School of Clifton College. He also undertook a number of domestic commissions for the King's Weston estate of Philip Napier Miles, including a number of substantial houses in Shirehampton, the Miles Arms public house in Avonmouth, the now-demolished King's Weston estate office and the public hall in Shirehampton. Cossham Memorial Hospital is also an example of his work. The style of his mature works in the Edwardian years <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as English Baroque or Queen Anne Revival. In addition he oversaw the restoration {{of a number of}} churches, became an acknowledged authority on the history of church architecture, and in 1909 published, with Dom Bede Camm, a two-volume treatise entitled Roodscreens and Roodlofts.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{measured}} {{radiated power}} with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He {{was concerned with}} selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium {{in which they had}} been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Within each {{of these}} poker variants, a myriad of options exist. [...] For example, {{depending}} on the betting structure, a tournament <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as no-limit, limit, or pot-limit. Games may include other variations on the rules governing {{the execution of the}} specific game such as shootout, eight or better, or heads up.|$|E
500|$|Strictly speaking, {{replacing}} a component {{with one of}} an entirely different type {{is still the same}} topology. [...] In some contexts, however, these can loosely be described as different topologies. [...] For instance, interchanging inductors and capacitors in a low-pass filter results in a high-pass filter. [...] These <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as high-pass and low-pass topologies even though the network topology is identical. [...] A more correct term for these classes of object (that is, a network where the type of component is specified but not the absolute value) is prototype network.|$|E
500|$|On March 17, 2005, the BBC {{published}} an article implying that researcher Horaţiu Năstase believes black holes have been created at RHIC. However, the original papers of H. Năstase and the New Scientist article cited by the BBC state that the correspondence of the hot dense QCD matter created in RHIC to a black hole {{is only in the}} sense of a correspondence of QCD scattering in Minkowski space and scattering in the AdS5×X5 space in AdS/CFT; in other words, it is similar mathematically. Therefore, RHIC collisions <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by mathematics relevant to theories of quantum gravity [...] within AdS/CFT, but the described physical phenomena are not the same.|$|E

500|$|The {{ultimate}} substantive {{legacy of}} Principia Mathematica is mixed. [...] It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there {{would in fact}} be some truths of mathematics {{which could not be}} deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims. [...] However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. [...] In this way, Principia Mathematicas legacy <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. [...] But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.|$|E
500|$|Reception of the {{painting}} {{as a work of}} art has been predominantly negative. The historian David Starkey described it as [...] "an appallingly bad picture and there's absolutely no reason to suppose it's got anything to do with Lady Jane Grey", a sentiment which the art dealer Christopher Foley echoed. Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery gave less sharp criticism, stating [...] "it's a paint-by-number, labored copy", and [...] "its value is as a historical document rather than a work of art". Zarin describes {{the painting}} as looking bleached in comparison with other portraits of monarchs, with [...] "the flat face of a paper doll". Edwards writes [...] "the quality <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as naive, primitive, or even folk art".|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road {{initially}} received {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who criticised the production's artificial sounds and viewed its music as inauthentic. William Mann of the London Times {{said that the}} album will [...] "be called gimmicky by people who want a record to sound exactly like a live performance", although he considered it to be [...] "teem with musical invention" [...] and added: [...] "Nice as Come Together and Harrison's Something are – they are minor pleasures {{in the context of}} the whole disc … Side Two is marvellous …" [...] Ed Ward of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "complicated instead of complex" [...] and felt that the Moog synthesizer [...] "disembodies and artificializes" [...] the band's sound, adding that they [...] "create a sound that could not possibly exist outside the studio". While he found the medley on side two to be their [...] "most impressive music" [...] since Rubber Soul, Nik Cohn of The New York Times said that, [...] "individually", the album's songs are [...] "nothing special". Albert Goldman of Life magazine wrote that Abbey Road [...] "is not one of the Beatles' great albums" [...] and, despite some [...] "lovely" [...] phrases and [...] "stirring" [...] segues, side two's suite [...] "seems symbolic of the Beatles' latest phase, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as the round-the-clock production of disposable music effects".|$|E
