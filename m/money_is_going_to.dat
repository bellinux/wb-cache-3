5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the {{fraternity}} boys, {{and one of them}} tells her information that leads to her suspecting a boy named Chip. Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, who says that he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never say so openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other rape victims, Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, who says that Claire went in with a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to).</b>|$|E

2500|$|On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, {{participated in}} an {{interview}} with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, {{in the days after the}} story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair. During that same day, an article from CBS News was published saying, [...] "CBS News legal analyst, Mickey Sherman, told Early Show co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for.

2500|$|Leiweke in {{the past}} had said that even without an {{expansion}} the stadium needed $30 million in repairs, and that the original agreement called {{for the city and}} MLSE to split that bill equally. [...] Instead, MLSE looked for $10 million in public funding from each of the municipal, provincial, and federal governments to top up their $90 million contribution, plus any cost overruns, for the expansion. [...] MLSE argued that the new stadium would result in $8 million in economic benefits, including taxes, accruing to the province annually, and $18 million in taxes on the construction project. [...] The company has agreed to pay a fixed annual rental fee of $865,000 to the City for the upgraded stadium, rather than the variable revenue sharing model under the present agreement which returned an average of $397,000 to the city over the previous five years, to help ensure that the city recoups its investment. [...] The new arrangement guaranteed the city $25.4 million, and with the projected $6 million in parking revenues the $31 million in revenue over the term of the lease would be $19 million more than under the former agreement. [...] As manager of the stadium, MLSE gets any profit turned by the stadium, and is responsible for any losses. [...] MLSE's management and naming rights agreement for the stadium, which was set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years under the proposal. [...] The agreement requires MLSE to reach a [...] "long-term use (i.e. 20 years)" [...] lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium starting in 2015. [...] The proposed renovations were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on March 7, and the City of Toronto's Executive Committee gave their consent on March 19. [...] The full City Council approved the deal on April 3, and the agreement is planned to be finalized by June 15. [...] The Provincial Minister of Tourism and Culture Michael Chan said that MLSE has submitted a funding request that that [...] "we are looking at it", while the Federal Infrastructure Minister Denis Lebel's spokesperson said that [...] "the federal government has no program to fund professional sports facilities". [...] A spokesperson for Lebel would later say [...] "our government will not fund the BMO Field {{as long as it is}} used by a professional sports team". [...] However, according to Leiweke, the federal funding [...] "is not going to the stadium, their <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> host big events."
