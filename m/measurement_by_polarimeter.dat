40|$|The {{polarization}} measurement through elastic ({rvec p},C) reaction plays {{a crucial}} role in the polarized proton beam operation of Relativistic Heavy Ion collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. As well as measuring the polarization, the unknown analyzing power A{sub N} of elastic ({rvec p},C) is determined as well in combination with the absolute polarization <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> a H-jet <b>polarimeter.</b> The systematic uncertainty of the Run 05 measurements are discussed as well as introducing the experimental apparatus of the polarimeter system...|$|R
40|$|For physics {{measurements}} with polarized colliding beams, beam polarizations {{and relative}} luminosities must both be determined. Predictions for spin observables of many interesting physics processes at RHIC are quite small in magnitude. This requires high statistics measurements of relative luminosities and careful control of systematic errors. Discussions about the polarized beams at RHIC often presume that the polarization {{and intensity of}} each bunch within a will be known quite well from <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> the RHIC <b>polarimeters.</b> The purpose of this note is to give {{a description of the}} knowledge that can actually be obtained from these polarimeters...|$|R

30|$|Logically, lung {{resection}} {{decreases the}} volume of EVLW. Two experimental studies [55, 56] showed that EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> transpulmonary thermo-dye dilution or thermodilution decreased after pneumonectomy, but was correlated with the gravimetric EVLWI measurement. Nevertheless, the absolute value of EVLWI measured by transpulmonary thermodilution was overestimated compared with the EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> gravimetry [55]. Similarly, a recent experimental study demonstrated that EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> transpulmonary thermodilution was significantly affected by 1 -lung ventilation [57]. Thus, in ARDS patients with pneumonectomy or 1 -lung ventilation, EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> transpulmonary thermodilution should be interpreted with caution, though {{the ability of the}} technique to measure changes in EVLWI should be unaffected.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{variability}} and systematic differences in polyp measurements on optical colonoscopy and CT colonography. Gastroenterologists measured 51 polyps by visual estimation, forceps comparison and linear probe. CT colonography observers randomly assessed polyp size two-dimensionally (abdominal and intermediate window) and three-dimensionally (manually and semi-automatically). Linear mixed models {{were used to}} assess the variability and systematic differences between CT colonography and optical colonoscopy techniques. The variability of forceps and linear probe measurements was comparable and both showed less variability than <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> visual assessment. <b>Measurements</b> <b>by</b> linear probe were 0. 7 mm smaller than <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> visual assessment or by forceps. The variability of all CT colonography techniques was lower than for <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> forceps or visual assessment and sometimes lower (only 2 D intermediate window and manual 3 D) compared with <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> linear probe. All CT colonography measurements judged polyps to be larger than optical colonoscopy, with differences ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 3 mm. A linear probe does not reduce the measurement variability of endoscopists compared with the forceps. Measurement differences between observers on CT colonography were usually smaller than at optical colonoscopy. Polyps appeared larger when using various CT colonography techniques than when measured during optical colonoscop...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAttempts to {{separate}} (–) -thujone, (+) -thujone epimers from camphor enantiomers by enantioselective HPLC with polarimetric detection In a first step, 26 chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have been screened for {{the separation of}} (–) -thujone, (+) -thujone epimers and camphor enantiomers by LC. The separations were monitored <b>by</b> a <b>polarimeter</b> detector. None of these CSPs provided a noticeable resolution for camphor enantiomers. The three components of a test mixture were clearly baseline separated on Chiralpak ASH, Chiralpak AZ-H and TCI-MBS (poly(N-alpha-(S) -methylbenzylmaleimide) coated on silica gel) in a mobile phase composed of hexane/ 2 -PrOH (99 : 1 v/v). Interestingly, for a preparative application, the three CSPs produced different elution orders for the three constituents of the mixture. In a second step, it is shown {{that the use of}} online polarimetric detection constitutes an unprecedented method to reveal the occurrence and the relative content of thujone epimers and the chirality of the major camphor enantiomer in crude essential oils. A proof of concept is illustrated on crude essential oils from Rosmarinus tournefortii, Artemisia herba alba and A. arborescens, which grow in Morocco and have several traditional uses there. In a third step, pure (+) -thujone was quantitatively collected from A. arborescens crude oil by semi-preparative HPLC on Chiralpak AZ-H monitored <b>by</b> a <b>polarimeter...</b>|$|R
