40|$|Introduction: This {{laboratory}} study {{deals with the}} effect of various environments in which the fractured part is kept before being bond to the remaining tooth on the <b>required</b> <b>force</b> to fracture the restored teeth by a re-attachment method. Materials & Methods: Seventy two mandibular incisor teeth divided into six groups of 12. The samples in 5 groups were fractured on middle one third, and the apical part of the remainders of teeth was dipped in normal saline. The environments where the fractured parts was kept in first to fifth group were, normal saline, water, milk, saliva and dry environment respectively. Sixth group was regarded as positive control group. After 24 hours all parts were bonded to the apical parts of the related groups by a bonding agent (Single Bond) and a flowable composite resin. The <b>required</b> <b>force</b> for the fracture was measured by a universal testing machine, and was analyzed by using Anova and Tukey statistical tests. Results: The <b>required</b> <b>force</b> to fracture the teeth in first to sixth group were 239. 4, 231. 2, 347. 2, 328. 6, 205. 4, 693. 3 Newton respectively. Statistical analyses indicated significant difference among the various groups (p value < 0. 001). The <b>required</b> <b>forces</b> for the fracture in third and forth group {{were significantly higher than}} first, second and fifth groups. Conclusion: The <b>required</b> <b>force</b> to fracture the restored teeth is affected by placing the fractured parts in various environments before bonding.

Consistent with cognitive load theory, we find that short, on-screen instructions which <b>require</b> <b>forced</b> inputs improve on subjects' comprehension and familiarity with the experimental task, and they contribute to reduce both decision and waiting times without affecting the overall pattern of contributions. ...|$|R

Because mining needed such large quantities of wood, its regulation was an early consideration and, by the end of the Middle Ages the first taxes were imposed on forests for their use in the mining industry. Forests in mining regions enjoyed a special status and, early on, their primary use for mining purposes was firmly established.|$|R
