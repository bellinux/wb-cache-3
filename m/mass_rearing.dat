Laboratory lines were started from 1, 10 and 50 founder couples from 750 adults collected in the field and their performance was evaluated at the 5 th– 6 th and 10 th– 11 th generations. Adaptation to the captive rearing situation occurred in the 10 and 50 founder couples lines while it failed in the 1 founder couple line. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) increased and the period for doubling the population (D) decreased over the generations in the 10 and 50 founder couples lines, while (rm) decreased and (D) increase in the 1 founder couple line. Also, consumption of Frankliniella occidentalis prey was significantly lower for females from the 1 founder couple line at the 5 th generation compared to females from the 10 and 50 founder couples lines. Females of laboratory lines of all founder couples did not respond to odours from thrips infested plants during the 5 th and 10 th generations, whereas wild females strongly reacted to these odours. We suggest that the lack of reaction to infested plant volatiles may be due to the artificial <b>rearing</b> method where <b>mass</b> <b>reared</b> predators do not experience an infested crop. The results showed that the 1 founder couple line differed from the 10 and 50 founder couples lines, suggesting that bottlenecking had an effect at that level.

50|$|Successful efforts using {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (IPM) of the glassy-winged sharpshooter {{include the use of}} insecticides, parasitoids (especially wasps in the family Mymaridae), and the impact of naturally occurring pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. One of the newly discovered pathogens is a virus specific to sharpshooters. The leafhopper-infecting virus, Homalodisca coagulata virus-1 (HoCV-1, Dicistroviridae), has been shown to increase leafhopper mortality. The virus occurs in nature and is spread most readily at high population densities through contact among infected individuals, contact with virus-contaminated surfaces, and/or as an aerosol in leafhopper excreta. One of the most successful biocontrol efforts has been the <b>mass</b> <b>rearing</b> and release of four different leafhopper parasitoids (in the mymarid genus Gonatocerus), which have been very successful in reducing the number of eggs that survive.

Both larvae and adults feed on all stages of mealy bugs, (Jayaraman et al., 1988). The first introduction of this ladybird for biological control dates back to 1891 when Albert Koebele brought it into California for control of Planococcus citri Risso (Bartlett 1974).

A RIDL strain of Ae. aegypti was successfully tested in the field in Grand Cayman(9, 10); further field use is planned or in progress in other countries around the world. <b>Mass</b> <b>rearing</b> of insects has been established in several insect species and to levels of billions a week.

In a <b>mass</b> <b>rearing</b> program there are several stages to produce the males to be released: egg production, rearing eggs until pupation, and then sorting males from females before release. These males are then used for a RIDL control program, released as either pupae or adults(11, 12).

40|$|The {{current study}} is an {{important}} step toward calibrating, validating, and improving irradiation methods used for Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) sterile insect technique (SIT). We used routine International Atomic Energy Agency/U. S. Department of Agriculture/Food and Agriculture Organization quality control tests assessing percentage of emergence, flight ability, sex ratio, mortality under stress, reproductive sterility, and sexual competitiveness, as well as a nonstandard test of longevity under nutritional stress {{to assess the impact of}} a range of target irradiation doses (60, 65, 70, 75, and 80 Gy) on the product quality of <b>mass</b> <b>reared</b> B. tryoni used in SIT. Sterility induction remained adequate (> 99. 5 %) for sterile male-fertile female crosses, and 100 % sterility was achieved in fertile male-sterile female crosses and sterile male-sterile female crosses for each irradiation doses tested. There was significant increase in mortality under stress as irradiation dose increased, and reduced participation in mating by males irradiated at higher doses. The current target-sterilizing dose for SIT of 70 - 75 Gy is associated with significant reduction in fly product "quality. " Our data suggest that adequate sterility and improved fly quality could be achieved through a small reduction in target sterilizing dose. 10 page(s...|$|R
