All I can do is stick to <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E

I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead.
