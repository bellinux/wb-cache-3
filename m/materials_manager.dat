50|$|The major {{challenge}} that <b>materials</b> <b>managers</b> face is maintaining a consistent flow of materials for production. There are many factors that inhibit {{the accuracy of}} inventory which results in production shortages, premium freight, and often inventory adjustments.

Although there are no known methods that eliminate the afore mentioned inventory accuracy inhibitors, there are best methods available to eliminate the impact upon maintaining an interrupted flow of materials for production.|$|R

50|$|Materials {{management}} {{is not a}} science and depending upon the relevance and importance that company officials place upon controlling material flow, the level of expertise changes. Some companies place materials management on a level whereby there is a logistics director, other companies see the importance level as managing at the plant level by hiring an inventory manager or <b>materials</b> <b>manager,</b> and still other companies employ the concept that the supervisors in the plant are responsible accompanied by a planners.|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} for manufacturing companies to optimise purchase order quantities. Inaccurate lot size planning raises costs and lowers profits, which top management of course attempts to avoid through controlling processes. The lot size decision becomes even more relevant {{in the case of}} just-in-time delivery within a supply chain. The interaction between lot sizing and auditing can be described in terms of a modified inspection game. This paper considers how probabilities, which are the basis for the mixed strategies at equilibrium in the inspection game, will change if the level of penalties accruing to the two players (<b>material</b> <b>manager</b> and controller) depends on the cost deviation caused by the <b>material</b> <b>manager's</b> poor lot-size planning. It is evident that the Nash equilibrium shifts to the strategy combination (methodically determined decision and low auditing level), if the penalties imposed on the controller and <b>material</b> <b>manager</b> increase. Penalties that depend on such deviations, and an accurate audit of the controller's report by top management, prove to be the best instruments for avoiding mismanagement by the <b>material</b> <b>manager</b> and poor controller work, both of which lead to high costs.

40|$|The {{stock level}} in {{industrial}} companies is frequently subject of critical discussions. <b>Material</b> <b>managers</b> tend towards high stock levels to ensure delivery and operational readiness. In contrast, controllers demand lower stock levels {{to minimize the}} costs of capital commitment. This decision conflict – based on lateral perception – can be modelled using an approach of game theory {{and it can be}} analysed in view of decision theory. This is the central object of this article. The consequences of decisions of the <b>material</b> <b>manager</b> and the controller in a company will be analysed if their actions result in different payoffs. Both the warehouseman and the controller each have two different alternatives to choose their own behaviour from with a specific probability. The <b>material</b> <b>manager</b> can select a low stock level at the risk of shortfalls or he can select a high stock level to ensurce delivery disposition. The controller can check the economic efficiency of the stock level on a low or a high audit level. With respect to the different strategy conditions and the respective payoffs we show the existence of noncooperative Nash equilibria in dependence of specific probabilities by which the players choose their strategies. Following these actions the top management analyses how far the players have pursued the economic efficiency of the company and how far the company was damaged because of the choice of their actions. This damage can be exposed by the top management with a specific probability. Additionally, the analysis will provide the management with informations, how the payoffs should be specified {{in order to reduce the}} probability of bad stockkeeping and bad auditing. ...|$|R

50|$|What was {{initially}} reported as sewage {{was found to}} be about 1000 gal of a chemical mixture consisting of some sort of organic peroxide. In the first days of the investigation, officials speculated that two inert chemicals mistakenly mixed in the truck and created an organic peroxide substance with sulfuric acid appearing {{to be part of the}} mix. Organic peroxide combines unstably bound oxygen together with hydrogen and carbon in the same molecule and ignites easily and then burns rapidly and intensely. While field testing was performed on the reactive material for initial identification, the county hazardous <b>materials</b> <b>manager</b> found that laboratories would not test the chemicals over concerns that lab personnel could be injured or their equipment damaged. Three weeks after the incident, the substance was still highly susceptible to friction and seemed to react to something as slight as wind. Sodium chlorite was identified in an internal investigation by the firm in the months following the disaster. They claimed that the chemical was being using as a water treatment agent for the first time and was stored in the same type of storage container as wastewater. The worker combined the chemical with wastewater in the vacuum truck where the chemical interacting with organic material caused an explosion that blew off the back of the truck. A former county district attorney, retained by a company attorney, issued a report in March 2015 that provided an explanation of events indicating that the worker may have accidentally combined the chemicals. Later, investigators found that an inspection by a Defense Logistics Agency contractor was scheduled for that morning and officials of the firm had directed the transfer of these hazardous materials to another location.|$|E

This means that companies are investing heavily in materials than is necessary. Problem: How can materials management minimize the cost of supplies in Cocoa Processing Company of Ghana? Purpose: The aim {{of this research is}} to illustrate how the application of materials management concept can minimize the cost of supplies in Cocoa Processing Company of Ghana. Methods: With regards to primary data, interviews (face-to-face, telephone) and questionnaire were used. Secondary data has been sourced through literature from the university library and internet sources, qualitative design method was chosen over others {{because of the nature of}} the research work. Conclusion: Financially, materials (inventories) are very important to manufacturing companies and on the balance sheet they usually represent from twenty to sixty percent of total assets. Therefore, if the application of the concept of materials management is accepted with well qualified personnel, it could lead to the minimization of cost. The function of a <b>materials</b> <b>manager</b> is to promote coordination and integration within the supply chain and the major benefits are assumed to be; reduction in interdepartmental conflicts, reduction of inventory levels, increased knowledge of total corporate operations and reduction of materials handling costs among others...|$|E
40|$|Jill Roberts, <b>Materials</b> <b>Manager</b> for Worth District Hospital, a small {{hospital}} in the San Joaquin Valley in California, finally {{had to face the}} problem with Pete Smith, a chronically tardy subordinate whose lateness had gained the attention of the new chief executive. The situation had evolved both {{as a result of the}} hospital’s organizational culture and Roberts’ decision to tolerate Smith’s behavior, which she felt had little impact on departmental efficiency. Indeed, she regarded Smith as a valuable employee. The Worth Hospital Board had recently hired a new chief executive, John Briggs, who was charged with the task of correcting the hospital’s continuing financial slide due to lower revenues amidst rising costs. As a part of his review of hospital operations, Briggs insisted on reviewing departmental performance evaluations as a part of his assessment of the staff. When Briggs reviewed Roberts’ ratings of Smith, Briggs disagreed with her assessment that Smith’s tardiness was a minor issue. He then directed her to take disciplinary action against Smith, which could ultimately lead to his termination if his behavior did not change. Although Roberts tried various tactics to change Smith’s behavior, her efforts proved less than successful. At the end of the case, Roberts was perplexed by the unpleasant decision she must face. She sincerely believed that Smith generally performed his job well, had become quite a valuable employee to her department, and would be difficult to replace in the short term. But Roberts also recalled her conversation with her boss, John Briggs, and her subsequent understanding about what she should do if Smith did not correct the tardiness problem...|$|E

40|$|The {{new world}} {{economic}} conditions and increasing global competition {{have changed the}} way in which manufacturing companies view production/operations management and their role in achieving greater productivity, lower costs, operational efficiency and better customer service. Several manufacturing planning and control systems have been developed in order to enable manufacturers to meet these new challenges. Material Requirements Planning System-MRP I and its extension Manufacturing Resources Planning System-MRP II, the much proclaimed systems, have gained wide acceptance from both academics and practitioners. The research presented here concentrates on the key issues of MRP practices and the effectiveness of MRP systems. Evidence from the literature shows that over 60 percent of MRP I/MRP II users have failed to achieve the expected benefits. Also, {{a review of the literature}} reveals that very little work has been done to provide mathematical models to relate these benefits to their determinants. Furthermore, it reveals that much was written about MRP practices based on case studies, but very few studies survey-based have been conducted to investigate MRP implementation. None of these studies was conducted in less developed countries. The researcher has attempted to fill some of these gaps in this study by posing three key questions, namely: how have MRP systems been implemented in Egyptian manufacturing companies?, what are the benefits obtained from these which have been implemented?, and what are the explanatory variables of MRP systems effectiveness?. Accordingly, the objectives of the current study are threefold: " To investigate MRP practices in Egyptian manufacturing companies. " To assess the effectiveness of MRP practices measured by the benefits obtained from MRP implementation based on the expectations and perceptions of MRP users in Egyptian manufacturing companies. " To explorea nd examineth e explanatoryv ariableso f MRP systemse ffectiveness. This study has drawn on an extensive review of the literature and previous empirical studies in western industrialised countries and in newly industrialised countries. The strategy used to achieve the research objectives involved quantitative analysis of questionnaire data. Data for the study were collected by a postal questionnaire.

50|$|This trend {{away from}} the daily {{procurement}} function (tactical purchasing) resulted in several changes in the industry. The first was the reduction of personnel. Purchasing departments were now smaller. There {{was no need for}} the army of clerks processing orders for individual parts as in the past. Another change was the focus on negotiating contracts and procurement of large capital equipment. Both of these functions permitted purchasing departments to make the biggest financial contribution to the organization. A new term and job title emerged - Strategic sourcing and Sourcing Managers. These professionals not only focused on the bidding process and negotiating with suppliers, but the entire supply function. In these roles they were able to add value and maximize savings for organizations. This value was manifested in lower inventories, less personnel, and getting the end product to the consumer quicker. Purchasing managers' success in these roles resulted in new assignments outside to the traditional purchasing function - logistics, materials management, distribution, and warehousing. More and more purchasing managers were becoming Supply Chain Managers handling additional functions of their organization's operation. Purchasing managers were not the only ones to become Supply Chain <b>Managers.</b> Logistic <b>managers,</b> <b>material</b> <b>managers,</b> distribution managers, etc. all rose to the broader function and some had responsibility for the purchasing functions now.|$|R
