25|$|The {{creation}} of recombinant DNA {{is in many}} ways the simplest step of the molecular cloning process. DNA prepared from the vector and foreign source are simply mixed together at appropriate concentrations and exposed to an enzyme (DNA ligase) that covalently links the ends together. This joining reaction is often termed ligation. The resulting DNA <b>mixture</b> <b>containing</b> randomly joined ends is then ready for introduction into the host organism.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, ethane {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a feedstock for other commodity chemicals. Oxidative chlorination of ethane has long {{appeared to be a}} potentially more economical route to vinyl chloride than ethene chlorination. Many processes for producing this reaction have been patented, but poor selectivity for vinyl chloride and corrosive reaction conditions (specifically, a reaction <b>mixture</b> <b>containing</b> hydrochloric acid at temperatures greater than 500nbsp&°C) have discouraged the commercialization of most of them. Presently, INEOS operates a 1000 t/a (tonnes per annum) ethane-to-vinyl chloride pilot plant at Wilhelmshaven in Germany.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{composition}} of engineered soil media largely determines the stormwater treatment efficiency of urban bioretention basins. Laboratory flow‐through experiments {{were conducted to}} quantify infiltration, bulk density, and moisture holding capacity {{as a function of}} different composite mixtures of sand, soil, and compost, and to assess the effect of compaction on bulk density, moisture holding capacity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Eleven mixtures were evaluated that varied in volumetric proportions of sand (30 % to 70 %), sandy or silt loam soil (0 % or 20 %), and organic compost (20 % to 70 %). Steady‐state infiltration rates were high for all mixtures, ranging from 87 to 178 cm h- 1, and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and silt loam soil. Infiltration rates for <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only and <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil exhibited a significant linear relationship with the ratio of sand to compost. Bulk density of the mixtures was inversely related to the proportion of compost and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and silt loam soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only. Conversely, moisture holding capacity increased with the proportion of compost and followed the order of <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand and compost only> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and sandy soil> <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> sand, compost, and silt loam soil. Compaction {{as a result of an}} initial wetting process and the infiltration tests led to increases in bulk density and decreases in moisture holding capacity, with <b>mixtures</b> <b>containing</b> a silt loam component showing the greatest resistance to these effects.

25|$|The process uses a cobalt–manganese–bromide catalyst. The bromide source can be sodium bromide, {{hydrogen}} bromide or tetrabromoethane where bromine {{functions as a}} regenerative source of free radicals. In this process, acetic acid is the solvent and oxygen from compressed air is the oxidant. The combination of bromine and acetic acid {{is found to be}} highly corrosive and hence the equipment is lined with titanium. A feed <b>mixture</b> <b>containing</b> p-xylene, acetic acid, the catalyst system, and compressed air is fed to a reactor. The oxidation of the methyl group takes place in two steps where p-xylene is converted to p-toluic acid and the byproduct undesirable 4-carboxybenzaldehyde along with crude p-toluic acid. It is further purified to obtain the p-toluic acid with the removal of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde using crystallization, centrifugation and filtration. 98% of the p-xylene is reacted to give more than 95mol% TPA. The solvent losses are comparatively low, and hence the Amoco process is followed by the industries.|$|E

The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction <b>mixture</b> <b>containing</b> the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E
500|$|Strontium {{is named}} after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic Sròn an t-Sìthein), where it was {{discovered}} in the ores of the lead mines. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged {{in the preparation of}} barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other [...] "heavy spars" [...] sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 [...] "...it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined." [...] The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also {{came to the conclusion that}} it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name [...] strontites. [...] He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: [...] "...Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion." [...] The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a <b>mixture</b> <b>containing</b> strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.|$|E

2500|$|Ethylene oxide is {{relatively}} stable to heating – {{in the absence}} of a catalyst, it does not dissociate up to 300°C, and only above 570°C there is a major exothermic decomposition, which proceeds through the radical mechanism.

2500|$|Hydroiodic acid is not pure {{hydrogen}} iodide, but a <b>mixture</b> <b>containing</b> it. Commercial [...] "concentrated" [...] hydroiodic acid usually contains 48–57% HI by mass. The solution {{forms an}} azeotrope boiling at 127 °C with 57% HI, 43% water. The high acidity {{is caused by}} the dispersal of the ionic charge over the anion. The iodide ion is much larger than the other common halides, which results in the negative charge being dispersed over a large space. By contrast, a chloride ion is much smaller, meaning its negative charge is more concentrated, leading to a stronger interaction between the proton and the chloride ion. This weaker H+···I− interaction in HI facilitates dissociation of the proton from the anion and is the reason HI is the strongest acid of the hydrohalides.|$|E

What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp's large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot's? The risk is practically nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too clever--and that was their undoing." ...|$|E
