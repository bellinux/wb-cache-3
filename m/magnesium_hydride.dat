However, high work temperature, slow reaction kinetics and hard activation process limit the practical application of Mg-based hydrides system. Recently, the reaction ball milling (RBM) technique has been successfully introduced to prepare hydrogen storage materials [1, 2]. It combines the courses of sample preparation, activation and hydrogenation into one step. Pure Mg milled under the hydrogen atmosphere was studied by Gennari [3]. In his study, the metastable-MgH 2 was generated by the RBM process. A reduction of particle and crystallite size and an increase of specific surface were observed. Unfortunately, only half of Mg was transformed into hydrides and the crystallite size was still very big. Moreover, it took many hours to finish the hydriding process. Some researchers tried to improve the reaction efficiency between Mg and H 2 by addition of some second phases, such as FeTi 1. 2 [4], TiO 2 [5], and amorphous TiMn 1. 5 [6]. Due to the excellent kinetic properties, the reaction efficiency was greatly improved. However, few investigations have been directed to the mechanisms of hydriding process in the RBM process, especially with the existence of catalyst. Further investigation is much needed.

40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>hydride</b> {{is cheap}} and {{contains}} 7. 7 wt % hydrogen, {{making it one}} of the most attractive hydrogen storage materials. However, thermodynamics dictate that hydrogen desorption from bulk <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydride</b> only takes place at or above 300 degrees C, which is a major impediment for practical application. A few results in the literature, related to disordered materials and very thin layers, indicate that lower desorption temperatures are possible. We systematically investigated the effect of crystal grain size on the thermodynamic stability of magnesium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydride,</b> using ab initio Hartree-Fock and density functional theory calculations. Also, the stepwise desorption of hydrogen was followed in detail. As expected, both magnesium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydride</b> become less stable with decreasing cluster size, notably for clusters smaller than 20 magnesium atoms. However, <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydride</b> destabilizes more strongly than magnesium. As a result, the hydrogen desorption energy decreases significantly when the crystal grain size becomes smaller than ~ 1. 3 nm. For instance, an MgH 2 crystallite size of 0. 9 nm corresponds to a desorption temperature of only 200 degrees C. This predicted decrease of the hydrgen desorption temperature is an important step toward the application of Mg as a hydrogen storage material...|$|E

Using Electron Localisation Function topological analysis, the site preference for hydrogen entering the host lattice can be predicted. Vibrational spectra have been calculated with Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the aim of modelling the incoherent inelastic neutron scattering spectra, which have been measured at the TOSCA spectrometer at ISIS. DFT calculations show a weakening in the force constants of the Ti-H and Mg-H bond which can be directly related to the FCC structures of TiH 2 and MgH 2. The structural similarities of the three FCC systems lead to a better understanding of the formation process of the new ternary compounds. The presence of two non-equivalent types of tetrahedral site with different force constants resulting from the normal modes of vibration suggests a twostep hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process. Comparison with the TiHx system is also interesting in terms of hydrogen diffusion inside the host lattice and a quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiment has been carried out to investigate this.
