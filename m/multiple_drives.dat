25|$|Image Mastering API (IMAPI v2) enables DVD burning {{support for}} applications, in {{addition}} to CD burning. IMAPI v2 supports multiple optical drives, even recording to <b>multiple</b> <b>drives</b> simultaneously, unlike IMAPI in Windows XP which only supported recording with one optical drive at a time. In addition, multiple filesystems are supported. Applications using IMAPI v2 can create, and burn disc images—it is extensible {{in the sense that}} developers can write their own specific media formats and create their own file systems for its programming interfaces. IMAPI v2 is implemented as a DLL rather than as a service {{as was the case in}} Windows XP, and is also scriptable using VBScript. IMAPI v2 is also available for Windows XP. With the Windows Feature Pack for Storage installed, IMAPI 2.0 supports Recordable Blu-ray Disc (BD-R) and Rewritable Blu-ray Disc (BD-RE) media as well. Windows DVD Maker can burn DVD-Video discs, while Windows Explorer can burn data on DVDs (DVD±R, DVD±R DL, DVD±R RW) {{in addition to}} DVD-RAM and CDs.|$|E
2500|$|For RAID subsystems, data {{integrity}} and fault-tolerance requirements {{also reduce the}} realized capacity. For example, a RAID1 array has about half the total capacity {{as a result of}} data mirroring, while a RAID5 array with [...] drives loses [...] of capacity (which equals to the capacity of a single drive) due to storing parity information. RAID subsystems are <b>multiple</b> <b>drives</b> that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user, but provide fault tolerance. Most RAID vendors use checksums to improve {{data integrity}} at the block level. Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors of 520 bytes to contain 512 bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes, or by using separate 512-byte sectors for the checksum data.|$|E
60|$|The century-plant, which {{here does}} not require pampering under glass, but boldly takes its place out doors with the other trees of the garden, employs much {{less than a hundred}} years to bring itself to bloom.

One such must be in bloom at this very writing, in the garden of a house which this very writer marked for his own on his first drive ashore from the steamer to the hotel, when he bestowed in its dim, unknown interior one of the many multiples of himself which are now pretty well dispersed among the pleasant places of the earth. It fills the night with a heavy heliotropean sweetness, and on the herb beneath, in the effulgence of the waxing moon, the multiple which has spiritually expropriated the legal owners stretches itself in an interminable reverie, and hears Youth come laughing back to it on the waters kissing the adjacent shore, where other white houses (which also it inhabits) bathe their snowy underpinning. In this dream the <b>multiple</b> <b>drives</b> home from the balls of either hotel with the young girls in the little victorias which must pass its sojourn; and, being but a vision itself, fore casts the shapes of flirtation which shall night-long gild the visions of their sleep with the flash of military and naval uniforms. Of course the multiple has been at the dance too (with a shadowy heartache for the dances of forty years ago), and knows enough not to confuse the uniforms.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide belt {{conveyors}} {{are used to}} transport {{a great variety of}} bulk solid materials. The desire to carry higher tonnages over longer distances and more diverse routes, while keeping exploitation costs as low as possible, has fuelled many technological advances. An interesting development in the recent past is the distribution of drive power along the path of a belt conveyor, which has resulted in the <b>multiple</b> <b>driven</b> belt conveyor. The main idea behind this study is based on finding the right balance between the locally applied drive power and the occurring resistances in such a <b>multiple</b> <b>driven</b> belt conveyor system, so the belt tension stays within the safety margins in a controlled manner. Existing sub models describing belt dynamics, mechanical resistances and the transfer of drive force onto the belt are investigated, and expanded if necessary, so they can be combined to create a complete model of a distributed driven belt conveyor. The combined model serves as a base to test existing design rules used for conventional single drive {{belt conveyors}} and to investigate what modifications are required in the <b>multiple</b> <b>drive</b> case.

40|$|We discuss wakefield {{excitation}} and propagation in dielectric structures, particularly {{concentrating on}} the case of <b>multiple</b> <b>drive</b> beam excitation in multimode structures. We emphasize calculations of the energy loss of the drive bunch train, the amplitude of the wakefield, and the relation between power flow and stored energy in the dielectric wakefield device. We show that for a collinear multimode structure the amplitude of the wakefield generated by a bunch train is {{less than or equal to}} the wakefield generated by a single bunch of the same total charge. Furthermore, the transformer ratio, R, is shown to be always less than 2, even in the <b>multiple</b> <b>drive</b> beam case. Plans for an experiment to measure wakes in a multimode structure at AWA are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a further study on Dai and Zhang’s (2008) supply networks, which are Cost Saver, Adapter, and <b>Multiple</b> <b>Driven.</b> This concept is centred on hub or focal firm {{which is the}} core of the supply networks, built on Miles and Snow’s (2003) strategic typology. In Cost Saver supply network, the hub firm is ‘Defender’; for Adapter supply network it is ‘Prospector’, while in <b>Multiple</b> <b>Driven</b> supply network it is ‘Analyser’. This study explores the interrelationship between the hub and supplier’s configuration and its effect on organisational performance. A comprehensive literature review is carried out with reference to supply chain (SC), supply network (SN) and supply network management (SNM). It stretches to describing Dai and Zhang’s (2008) novel supply networks, its association with Miles and Snow’s theory, the supply network configuration concept, and further expatiates on the need for appropriate supplier configuration for improved performances within the supply networks. The key performance indicators (KPI) adopted for this work, the variables considered in the simulation modelling were evaluated. Usable data were collected from a sample of 630 suppliers, and 15 hub firms. This is accompanied by Hypotheses testing, Case study and Simulation experiments to fulfil the aims and objectives of this research. From the findings of this study, it is confirmed that organisations can be grouped as either the Defender, Prospector, Analyser or Reactor type according to the Miles and Snow typology. The investigation identified that for <b>Multiple</b> <b>Driven,</b> Adapter and Cost Saver supply networks, performances are most improved with an increase in the existence of suppliers of the same typology with the hub organisation within the supply network...|$|R
