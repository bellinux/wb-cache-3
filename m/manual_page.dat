This Q2 indicator does not predict a specific error rate, but rather indicates that a specific final portion of the read should not be used in further analyses. Also, the quality score encoded as [...] "B" [...] letter may occur internally within reads at least as late as pipeline version 1.6, as shown in the following example: ...|$|E
