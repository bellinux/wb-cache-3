The analysis of these referenda and initiatives {{has shown that the}} mobilization of the popular initiative has proven to be an institution for successfully promoting more state intervention, in particular for agro-food biotechnology. Direct democracy contributed to opening up the policy-making process for interests critical towards biotechnology and thus helped to produce a more inclusive policy- making process and provided a counterweight to the influence of physicians and research interests on public policies.

40|$|Expanding the {{availability}} of monoclonal antibodies interfering with hepatitis C virus infection of hepatocytes is an active field of investigation within <b>medical</b> <b>biotechnologies,</b> to prevent graft reinfection in patients subjected to liver transplantation and to overcome resistances elicited by novel antiviral drugs. In this paper, we describe a complete pipeline for screening of phage display libraries of human scFvs against native Claudin- 1, a tight-junction protein involved in hepatitis C virus infection, expressed on the cell surface of human hepatocytes. To this aim, we implemented a high-throughput sequencing approach for library screening, followed by a simple and effective strategy to recover active binder clones from enriched sublibraries. The recovered clones were successfully converted to active immunoglobulins, thus demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} whole procedure. This novel approach can guarantee rapid and cheap isolation of antibodies for virtually any native antigen involved in human diseases, for therapeutic and/or diagnostic applications...|$|R

40|$|Marcello Ciaccio, Giulia Bivona, Chiara BelliaDepartment of <b>Medical</b> <b>Biotechnologies</b> and Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Palermo, ItalyAbstract: Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing {{aminoacid}} {{produced during}} metabolism of methionine. Since 1969 {{the relationship between}} altered homocysteine metabolism and both coronary and peripheral atherotrombosis is known; in recent years experimental evidences have shown that elevated plasma levels of homocysteine are {{associated with an increased}} risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular ischemic events. Several mechanisms by which elevated homocysteine impairs vascular function have been proposed, including impairment of endothelial function, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent oxidation of low-density lipids. Endothelial function is altered in subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia, and endothelial dysfunction is correlated with plasma levels of homocysteine. Folic acid and B vitamins, required for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, are the most important dietary determinants of homocysteine and daily supplementation typically lowers plasma homocysteine levels; it is still unclear whether the decreased plasma levels of homocysteine through diet or drugs may be paralleled by a reduction in cardiovascular risk.
