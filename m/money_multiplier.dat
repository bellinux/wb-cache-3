25|$|MMT economists {{regard the}} concept of the <b>money</b> <b>multiplier,</b> where a bank is {{completely}} constrained in lending through the deposits it holds and its capital requirement, as misleading. Rather than being a practical limitation on lending, the cost of borrowing funds from the interbank market (or the central bank) represents a profitability consideration when the private bank lends in excess of its reserve and/or capital requirements (see interaction between government and the banking sector).|$|E
25|$|Banks {{began to}} fail in October 1930 (one {{year after the}} crash) when farmers {{defaulted}} on loans. There was no federal deposit insurance during that time as bank failures were considered quite common. This worried depositors {{that they might have}} a chance of losing all their savings, therefore, people started to withdraw money and changed it into currency. As deposits taken out from the bank increased, the money supply decreased because the <b>money</b> <b>multiplier</b> worked in reverse, forcing banks to liquidate assets (such as call in loans rather than create new loans.) This caused the money supply to shrink and the economy to contract and a significant decrease in aggregate investment. The decreased money supply further aggravated price deflation, putting further pressure on already struggling businesses.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>money</b> <b>multiplier</b> is a {{heuristic}} used {{to demonstrate}} {{the maximum amount of}} broad money that could be created by commercial banks for a given fixed amount of base money and reserve ratio. This theoretical maximum is never reached, because some eligible reserves are held as cash outside of banks. Rather than holding the quantity of base money fixed, central banks have recently pursued an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit indirectly so the ceiling implied by the <b>money</b> <b>multiplier</b> does not impose a limit on money creation in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada William White said [...] "Some decades ago, the {{academic}} literature would have emphasised {{the importance of}} the reserves supplied by the central bank to the banking system, and the implications (via the <b>money</b> <b>multiplier)</b> for the growth of money and credit.

60|$|If {{we assume}} the {{quantity}} of goods on sale, {{and the number of}} times those goods are resold, to be fixed quantities, the value of money will depend upon its quantity, together with the average number of times that each piece changes hands in the process. The whole of the goods sold (counting each resale of the same goods as so much added to the goods) have been exchanged for the whole of the <b>money,</b> <b>multiplied</b> by the number of purchases made on the average by each piece. Consequently, the amount of goods and of transactions being the same, the value of money is inversely as its quantity multiplied by what is called the rapidity of circulation. And {{the quantity of}} money in circulation is equal to the money value of all the goods sold, divided by the number which expresses the rapidity of circulation.|$|R
5000|$|Lorenzo, {{a distant}} {{relative}} of Fontanelli, argues in articles he writes {{for a school}} magazine, that {{the root of all}} evil {{lies in the fact that}} the central banks are allowing a credit only with the collection of interest.

2500|$|Commercial {{bank money}} is created through fractional-reserve banking, the banking {{practice}} where banks keep {{only a fraction}} of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of money creation by commercial banks, as it expands money supply (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be. [...] Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the broad money supply of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of base money created by the country's central bank. That multiple (called the <b>money</b> <b>multiplier)</b> is determined by the reserve requirement or other financial ratio requirements imposed by financial regulators.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is how the}} Federal Reserve's high-powered <b>money</b> is <b>multiplied</b> into {{a larger}} amount of broad money, through bank loans; as written in a {{particular}} case study, [...] "as banks increase or decrease loans, the nation's (broad) money supply increases or decreases." [...] Once granted these additional funds, the recipient has the option to withdraw physical currency (dollar bills and coins) from the bank, which will {{reduce the amount of}} money available for further on-lending (and money creation) in the banking system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{question}} as to whether the volatility of the monetary aggregates arises primarily from the behavior of the monetary base or the monetary multipliers. The findings indicate that the monetary multipliers are more volatile than the base, regardless of the definition of <b>money.</b> The <b>multiplier</b> is substantially more volatile than the m 2 or m 3 multipliers. Analysis of multiplier's component ratios indicates high volatility of individual components. However, the m 2 and m 3 multipliers, hence the M 2 and M 3 aggregates, internalize the movements of volatile individual components. Copyright 1991 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{criticism}} that social credit policies are inflationary {{is based upon}} what economists call the quantity theory of money, which states that the quantity of <b>money</b> <b>multiplied</b> by its velocity of circulation equals total purchasing power. Douglas was quite critical of this theory stating, [...] "The velocity of the circulation {{of money in the}} ordinary sense of the phrase, is - if I may put it that way - a complete myth. No additional purchasing power at all is created by the velocity of the circulation of money. The rate of transfer from hand-to-hand, as you might say, of goods is increased, of course, by the rate of spending, but no more costs can be canceled by one unit of purchasing power than one unit of cost. Every time a unit of purchasing power passes through the costing system it creates a cost, and when it comes back again to the same costing system by the buying and transfer of the unit of production to the consuming system it may be cancelled, but that process is quite irrespective of what is called the velocity of money, so the categorical answer is that I do not take any account of the velocity of money in that sense." [...] The Alberta Social Credit government published in a committee report what was perceived as an error in regards to this theory: “The fallacy in the theory lies in the incorrect assumption that money 'circulates', whereas it is issued against production, and withdrawn as purchasing power as the goods are bought for consumption." ...|$|R
