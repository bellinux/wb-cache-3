40|$|The {{assessment}} of biomechanical loading in the musculoskeletal {{system of the}} pregnant women is particularly interesting since {{they are subject to}} morphological, physiological and hormonal changes, which may lead to adaptations in gait. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the effect of the increased mass in the trunk associated to pregnancy on the lower limb and pelvis, during walking, on temporal-distance parameters, joint range <b>of</b> motion and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> by comparing a pregnant women group to a non-pregnant group, and to this group while carrying a 5 kg additional load located in the abdomen and breasts during walking, to understand which gait adaptations may be more related with the increased trunk mass, or if may be more associated with other factors such as the girth of the thigh. The subjects performed a previous 12 min training adaption to the added load. To calculate ankle, knee and hip joint angles and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> a three-dimensional biomechanical model was developed. The inverse dynamics method was used to estimate net joint <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> The increased mass of the anterior trunk associated with second trimester of pregnancy may influence some gait variables such as the left step time, left and right stance times, double limb support time, maximum hip extension, maximum pelvic right obliquity, pelvic obliquity range of motion, maximum transversal left rotation and peak hip flexion <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|When {{investigating}} the joint kinetics of human locomotion, ground reaction forces are typically measured directly using a force platform. In many different skills and movement environments, the utilization <b>of</b> a <b>force</b> platform to collect external force data is not possible. These particular movement situations require an indirect method to estimate joint kinetic variables {{if they are}} to be analyzed. This study investigated whether or not an eleven segment, complete body model could be used to accurately predict the net joint reaction <b>forces</b> and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> from cinefilm and body segment parameter data, using force platform calculated net joint reaction <b>forces</b> and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> as the criterion for validation. The body was modelled as a linked system of pin-connected rigid bodies and was restricted to the sagittal plane analysis of single support locomotions. The movements analyzed for three subjects were jogging, running, the acceleration phase of sprinting, the long jump takeoff and a running front somersault into a forward roll. Displacement and ground reaction force data were both sampled at 100 Hz and low-pass filtered at cutoff frequencies of 6 and 10 Hz, respectively. The film predicted, support limb net joint reaction <b>forces</b> and <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> were compared to the force platform calculated results using RMSE and Pearson product moment correlation statistics to quantify phase and magnitude variations. It was found that vertical net joint reaction forces can be estimated from displacement data using the inverse dynamics approach and a complete body segment model. Limited success was attained in estimating the horizontal net joint reaction forces. No consistent results were obtained in estimating the net joint <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> Further refinements are necessary if net joint moments are to be predicted accurately using this particular method...|$|R

2500|$|In physics, {{a moment}} is a turning {{effect of a}} force. It is an {{expression}} involving {{the product of a}} distance and a physical quantity, and in this way it accounts for how the physical quantity is located or arranged. [...] Moments are usually defined with respect to a fixed reference point; they deal with physical quantities as measured at some distance from that reference point. [...] For example, the <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> acting on an object, often called torque, is the product of the force and the distance from a reference point. In principle, any physical quantity can be multiplied by distance to produce a moment; commonly used quantities include forces, masses, and electric charge distributions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} moment in physics {{is derived from}} the {{mathematical}} concept of moments[...] The principle of moments is derived from Archimedes' discovery of the operating principle of the lever. In the lever one applies a force, in his day most often human muscle, to an arm, a beam of some sort. Archimedes noted that the amount of force applied to the object, the <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> is defined as M = rF, where F is the applied force, and r is the distance from the applied force to object. However, historical evolution of the term 'moment' and its use in different branches of science, such as mathematics, physics and engineering, is unclear.|$|E

40|$|Background. Conservative {{treatment}} for osteoarthritis often involves educating {{the patient in}} methods of decreasing the load transmitted through the diseased joint. The use of a cane is one such method and the correct placement of the cane with respect to an abnormal knee joint is crucial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare effects on knee <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> contralateral versus ipsilateral cane usage in female subjects with osteoarthritic knees. Methods. A convenience sample of 14 subjects volunteered for this study. Subjects walked over force platforms while ground reaction force and three-dimensional kinematic data were captured using a Vicon 370 System. The subjects were tested walking: (a) unaided, (b) with ipsilateral cane, and (c) with contralateral cane. Inverse dynamics were employed to calculate temporal-spatial, kinematic and kinetic variables. Dependent variables included hip and knee frontal plane and sagittal plane <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> walking speed, cadence and stride length. Repeated measures ANOVA assessed differences among walking conditions. Findings. Subjects walked significantly faster in the unaided gait condition owing to a higher cadence. Ipsilateral cane use resulted in significantly larger hip (versus contralateral P = 0. 018; versus unaided P = 0. 036) and knee (versus contralateral P = 0. 043; versus unaided P = 0. 030) frontal plane peak moments during gait. Contralateral cane placement was associated with the smallest peak knee abductor (P = < 0. 001) and flexor (P = < 0. 001) moments. Knee deformity (varus or valgus) did not have any significant effect on any variable possibly due to small sample size. Interpretation. The results suggest that as is the case for the hip contralateral cane placement is the most efficacious for persons with knee osteoarthritis. In fact, no cane use may be preferable to ipsilateral cane usage as the latter resulted in the highest knee <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> a situation which may exacerbate pain and deformity.
