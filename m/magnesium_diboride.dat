40|$|Ceramic {{compositions}} {{based on}} carbides, nitrides, and borides {{are widely used}} {{as a result of}} their exceptional resistance to wear, creep at high temperature, thermal shock, and oxidation. In order to provide these properties, it is necessary to prepare a starting powder material structure characterized by uniformity and high specific surface. Zirconium, titanium, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>diborides</b> are prepared in this work by metallothermic reduction. The materials obtained are analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD), laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Thermodynamic calculations are carried out using FactSage® thermochemical software and databases. It is observed that a significant part of the specimens obtained in this work have a high MgO content in their structure. Apotential field of application of these materials could be as antioxidants in periclase-carbon refractories since this industrial application does not require magnesium oxide removal.

40|$|Superconductivity in iron-based <b>magnesium</b> <b>diborides</b> {{and other}} novel superconducting {{materials}} {{has a strong}} multi-band and multi-gap character. Recent experiments support the possibillity for a BCS-BEC crossover induced by strong-coupling and proximity of the chemical potential {{to the edge of}} one of the bands. Here we study the simplest theoretical model which accounts for the BCS-BEC crossover in a two-band superconductor, considering tunable interactions and tunable energy separations between the bands. Mean-field results for condensate fraction, correlation length, and superconducting gap are reported in typical crossover diagrams to locate the boundaries of the BCS, crossover and BEC regimes. When the superconducting gap is of the order of the local chemical potential, superconductivity is in the crossover regime of the BCS-BEC crossover and the Fermi surface of the small band is smeared by the gap opening. In this situation, small and large Cooper pairs coexist in the total condensate, which is the optimal condition for high-T-c superconductivity. The ratio between the gap and the Fermi energy in a given band results in the best detection parameter for experiments to locate the system in the BCS-BEC crossover. Using available experimental data, our analysis shows that iron-based superconductors have the partial condensate of the small Fermi surface in the crossover regime of the BCS-BEC crossover, supporting the recent ARPES findings...|$|R

2500|$|In superconducting materials, the {{characteristics}} of superconductivity appear when the temperature T is lowered below a critical temperature Tc. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20K to less than 1K.

Cuprate superconductors can have much higher critical temperatures: YBa2Cu3O7, one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature of 92K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130K. The explanation for these high critical temperatures remains unknown. Electron pairing due to phonon exchanges explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, but it does not explain superconductivity in the newer superconductors that have a very high critical temperature.|$|E

50|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II).
