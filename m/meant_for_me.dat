2500|$|Russian {{writer and}} philosopher Leo Tolstoy was greatly {{influenced}} by Schopenhauer. After reading Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: [...] "Do {{you know what this}} summer has <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> <b>me?</b> Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer" ...|$|E
2500|$|During his posting in Sopore, Batra {{had several}} {{encounters}} with militants. In {{one of those}} encounters when Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he had a miraculous escape when a bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, killing the soldier. Believing that the bullet was meant for him and not his colleague, he ordered his men to nab the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed. Batra, however, was saddened, {{because he knew that}} the bullet was meant for him. [...] "Didi, it was <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I lost my man," [...] he had told his elder sister over the phone.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Snowden {{said his}} [...] "breaking point" [...] was [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, {{directly}} lie under oath to Congress." [...] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, and {{nine months after}} the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads {{during the summer of}} 2012—in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who {{need to be able to}} trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E

"It is {{too late}} for remorse," [...] {{retorted}} Beresteyn roughly, [...] "if Gilda had been free to speak of what she heard in the cathedral on New Year's Eve, you and I to-day {{would have had to}} flee the country as you fled from it once before, branded as traitors, re-captured mayhap, dragged before the tribunal {{of a man who has}} already shown that he knows no mercy. Gilda's freedom would have <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> you, <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> Heemskerk, van Does and all the others, torture first and a traitor's death at the last." ...|$|R

60|$|But {{descending}} into Snake Gulch, {{which was}} only a mile across the sparsely cedared ridge, proved to be tedious labor. By virtue of Satan's patience and skill, I forged ahead; which advantage, however, <b>meant</b> more risk <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because of the stones set in motion above.

2500|$|Helene {{noted in}} her book that she exposed herself and her family to great danger by {{assisting}} the queen in her efforts to obtain the crown. In an atmosphere of political intrigue, where death was a common punishment for many crimes, Helene apparently had reservations concerning the advisibility of the queen's request: [...] "The queen's request frightened <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> it <b>meant</b> great danger <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and my little children." [...] In her writing she describes how she prayed for success and promised to make a barefoot pilgrimage to Zell. At least two assistants accompanied Helene, who did the breaking in while Helene kept watch. After they got the crown without attracting attention, they locked the doors again and fixed the queen's seal.|$|R

500|$|Spivey {{returned}} to the EBL in 1963 to join the Scranton Miners, for whom he played five seasons. His highest scoring average for the Miners came in the 1964–65 season, when he had 27.0points per game. In 1967–68, his final professional season, Spivey {{went back to the}} Barons. Playing for about $200 in salary per contest, he had 10.4points per game. On February 11, 1968, Spivey participated in his final professional game. Taking advantage of a loophole in the NBA's rules, he took part in an all-star game in Baltimore featuring former Baltimore Bullets players before a Bullets – San Diego Rockets game. Spivey led both teams by scoring 12points, but his team lost by onepoint. One day later he retired, saying [...] "It really <b>meant</b> something <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to finish off my career with a game like that." [...] By the end of his career, Spivey's physical condition had declined; Lou Tsioropoulos, who had played with him at Kentucky, said, [...] "He was just completely disabled. He could barely walk." ...|$|R

5000|$|His {{first job}} after {{completing}} his studies {{was at a}} sleigh shop in a neighboring town. According to Franklin [...] "the proprietor paid day wages to the men building sleighs. My job was sandpapering the bodies. It {{seemed to me that}} we all took it easy. I talked to the owner about paying by the sleigh, so much for each sleigh I sandpapered. It <b>meant</b> more money <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and more sleighs finished faster for him. Soon the other men in the shop took it up and the whole operation was on piecemeal. I was there for months and he wanted me to stay assisting him in the business, but I didn't think I wanted to be a sleigh-maker either." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Kissing You" [...] {{was covered}} by American R singer Beyoncé under the title [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", later {{replaced}} with other track [...] "If". Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album. She called the song [...] "a beautiful ballad" [...] and said, [...] "I've always loved [...] It gives you this emotion – I don't care who you are, you just feel it.

It certainly <b>meant</b> a lot <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> It {{had to do with}} a lot of parts of my own life. The thing that I was probably proudest of about the episode was that in the long run, it was not specifically a weeper, which I never wanted it to be. I thought there was a strength in it. I thought {{at the end of the}} episode, where Kevin Arnold walks down the hallway, there was a manliness to him, which I had wanted to accomplish. I wanted an episode where he accepted being a man." [...] Director Michael Dinner said the episode dealt with death, but was about [...] "growing up and realizing his own failings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not know}} how long I slept, but at last I came {{suddenly}} broad awake and heard my father say in a terrible voice, [...] "By the great Snow God, there's a fish-hook gone!"

The presentiment was confirmed in the same instant: my father shouted, [...] "Up, everybody, and seize the stranger!" [...] Then there was an outburst of cries and curses from all sides, and a wild rush of dim forms through the obscurity. I flew to my beloved's help, but what could I do but wait and wring my hands?--he was already fenced away from me by a living wall, he was being bound hand and foot. Not until he was secured would they let me get to him. I flung myself upon his poor insulted form and cried my grief out upon his breast while my father and all my family scoffed at me and heaped threats and shameful epithets upon him. He bore his ill usage with a tranquil dignity which endeared him to me more than ever, and made me proud and happy to suffer with him and for him. I heard my father order that the elders of the tribe be called together to try my Kalula for his life.|$|R
