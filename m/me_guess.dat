I don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to <b>me.</b> <b>Guess</b> I'm too old to learn.

6000|$|She was dark. Her hair, eyes, and {{complexion}} were {{darker than}} usual in English women. The form, the look altogether, of her face, coupled with what I could see of her figure, made <b>me</b> <b>guess</b> her age {{to be about}} twenty. There was the appearance of maturity already {{in the shape of}} her features; but their expression still remained girlish, unformed, unsettled. The fire in her large dark eyes, when she spoke, was latent. Their languor, when she was silent--that voluptuous languor of black eyes--was still fugitive and unsteady. The smile about her full lips (to other eyes, they might have looked too full) struggled to be eloquent, yet dared not. Among women, there always seems something left incomplete--a moral creation to be superinduced on the physical--which love alone can develop, and which maternity perfects still further, when developed. I thought, as I looked on her, how the passing colour would fix itself brilliantly on her round, olive cheek; how the expression that still hesitated to declare itself, would speak out at last, would shine forth in the full luxury of its beauty, when she heard the first words, received the first kiss, from the man she loved! ...|$|E

I don't agree with Frazer about these socialists and all--fellow that's worked at the plow like I have knows a man wants to get ahead for his woman and himself, first of all, and let the walking-delegates go to work, too. But I think he's honest, all right, and, well, I stood up, and that means losing my scholarship. They won't try to fire <b>me.</b> <b>Guess</b> I'll mosey on to the U. of M. Can't probably live there as cheap as here, but a cousin of mine owns a big shoe-store and maybe I can get a job with him.... Boy, you were plucky to get up.... Glad we've got each other, finally.
