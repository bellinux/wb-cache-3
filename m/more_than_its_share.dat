25|$|China {{could not}} afford a heavy investment, either ideologically or financially, in the {{education}} of a few students. Since 1978 China's leaders have modified the policy of concentrating education resources at the university level, which, although designed to facilitate modernization, conflicted directly with the party's principles. The policies that produced an educated elite also siphoned off resources that might have been used to accomplish the compulsory nine-year education more speedily and to equalize educational opportunities in the city and the countryside. The policy of key schools has been modified over the years. Nevertheless, China's leaders believe an educated elite is necessary to reach modernization goals. Corruption has been increasingly problematic for rural schools. Because the educational funding is distributed from the top down, each layer of bureaucracy has tended to siphon off <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of funding, leaving too little for the bottom rural level.|$|E

500|$|Hastert was {{initially}} {{represented in the}} civil case by his son, attorney Ethan Hastert, and then by Christian Poland, a Bryan Cave partner in Chicago. U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras twice dismissed the suit, but allowed John's attorneys to redraft the complaint. In July 2015, Kocoras reinstated the suit, finding that John's second amended complaint was sufficient to allow the suit to go forward and proceed to discovery. John claimed in court filings to {{have had at least}} three conversations with an FBI agent about Hastert's use of the post-speakership office. In September 2015, Hastert's attorneys issued subpoenas for records of conversations between John and FBI agents. John's attorneys moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing that they were overly broad and sought information [...] "unrelated to the present case or Hastert." [...] In October 2015, Judge Kocoras said that he would review the records in camera (privately) before deciding what information should be turned over, saying: [...] "This case has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of sensitivity and unusual aspects." ...|$|E
500|$|A Little More Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The album holds {{a score of}} 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, saying, [...] "Lindsay Lohan clearly spells out her ambition in the title to her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) -- she's going to shed the glitzy trappings of her debut, Speak, and dig down deep in her heart, letting feelings flood onto the page". Erlewine also stated that the album [...] "is far from being totally successful, it is an intriguing mash-up of heart and commerce. And it does suggest one thing that Speak never did: Lindsay Lohan may have an artistic vision as a recording artist, which is indeed a huge step forward". Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt said, [...] "like so many pop records today, Personal has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of filler, and like all teenagers, Lohan contradicts herself. [...] Perhaps Personal 's vulnerability is calculated, and its rawness a misnomer, or maybe she's really opening up. We'll probably never know. Lindsay {{may no longer be}} on the edge of 17, but being 19, troubled, and ridiculously famous can cut pretty deep, so props to her for letting us see her bleed — just a little".|$|E

500|$|Six out {{of eight}} areas in Knowle West are ranked as being {{economically}} deprived. The {{closure of the}} Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A House of Commons report noted that this had a seriously {{negative effect on the}} area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for [...] "manual and semi-skilled employment". The Independent in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, BBC News said [...] "Knowle West has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of social problems. [...] The highest number of kids in care of any council ward in Bristol. [...] The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). [...] A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people are fed up with bad housing." [...] Shawnie, a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written {{from the point of view}} of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters [...] "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and nicking their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{group of}} special concern are work migrants, most often poor men, who leave the {{countryside}} to join the wage economy in towns and cities all over China. Some come from areas such as Henan Province where huge numbers of peasants were infected with HIV from scandalous plasma-donor practices in the 1990s. Many male migrants {{are at risk of}} unprotected sex when away from home. And men are also at higher risk of tuberculosis than women in China because the male-to-female ratio of adults with pulmonary tuberculosis is about 2:1 or more, reflecting a real risk excess rather than differential detection or notification. So several factors converge in young male migrant workers to put them at risk of both HIV and tuberculosis, and this convergence has been of great concern. With this [...] "floating" [...] migrant population making up 10% of the total being poorer and having more tuberculosis than average, China has far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of tuberculosis (disease burden) in the world. This problem is compounded because China's internal work migrants often live and work in circumstances that promote transmission of tuberculosis and impede its diagnosis and treatment. They are usually so poor that the cost of adequate diagnosis and treatment is prohibitively expensive. Indeed, {{they may not be able}} to get treated at all unless they return to their home village in the poor interior, because subsidized management of tuberculosis (and other social welfare) is only available through facilities in the area where they were registered at birth. Those born in rural zones are not allowed to switch registration to become urban residents. They have been allowed to leave their area (temporarily) or work since 1992 and now number more than 100 million. China's rapid economic growth depends on them, but if they get tuberculosis, they have to return home for treatment.|$|E

For a time, being in the second line, they looked on, impatient spectators of the fight; but, at the crisis of the battle, they were brought up to check Clausel's impetuous counter attack, and nowhere was the struggle fiercer. Hulse's brigade, to which they were attached, bore <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of the fighting; and the 11th and the 61st, together, had but 160 men and officers left when the battle was over. The Portuguese fought valiantly, and the fact that their countrymen had been defeated, in their attempt to capture the French Hermanito, inspired them with a fierce determination to show that Portuguese troops could fight as well as their allies. They pushed forward well abreast of the other regiments of the brigade, and suffered equally.|$|E

60|$|Of this {{masterpiece}} of Macaulay we may confidently say three things: {{that for many}} years {{it was the most}} popular historical work in our language; that by its brilliant style and absorbing interest it deserved its popularity, as literature if not as history; and that, though it contains its share of error and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of Whig partisanship, it has probably as few serious faults as any other history which attempts to cover the immense field of the political, social and intellectual life of a nation. Read, for example, one of the introductory chapters (the third is excellent) which draws such a picture of England {{in the days of the}} Stuarts as no other historian has ever attempted. When you have finished that chapter, with its wealth of picturesque detail, you may be content to read Macaulay simply for the pleasure he gives you, and go to some other historian for accurate information.|$|E
6000|$|... § 3. The principle, however, {{on which}} the {{reasoning}} proceeds, is sufficiently evident. It is the obvious one that when the cases which exist are shared among several kinds, it is impossible that each of those kinds should be {{a majority of the}} whole: on the contrary, there must be a majority against each kind, except one at most; and if any kind has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> in proportion to the total number, the others collectively must have less. Granting this axiom, and assuming that we have no ground for selecting any one kind as more likely than the rest to surpass the average proportion, it follows that we can not rationally presume this of any, which we should do if we were to bet in favor of it, receiving less odds than in the ratio of the number of the other kinds. Even, therefore, in this extreme case of the calculation of probabilities, which does not rest on special experience at all, the logical ground of the process is our knowledge—such knowledge as we then have—of the laws governing the frequency of occurrence of the different cases; but in this case the knowledge is limited to that which, being universal and axiomatic, does not require reference to specific experience, or to any considerations arising out of the special nature of the problem under discussion.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pett was by {{this time}} heartily regretting the impulse which had caused her to {{telephone}} to Mr. Sturgis. In a career which had had <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of detectives, both real and fictitious, {{she had never been}} confronted with a detective like this. The galling thing was that she was helpless. After all, one engaged a detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency, not for suavity and polish. A detective who hurls speech at you through clenched teeth and yet detects is better value for the money than one who, though an ideal companion for the drawing-room, is incompetent: and Mrs. Pett, like most other people, subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be. It is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility. She crushed down her resentment at her visitor's tone, and tried to concentrate her mind on {{the fact that this was}} a business matter and that what she wanted was results rather than fair words. She found it easier to do this when looking at the other's face. It was a capable face. Not beautiful, perhaps, but full of promise of action.

60|$|What {{signifies the}} empty {{compliment}} {{paid to the}} country, by giving it, perhaps, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> {{in the theory of}} your representation? Where have you placed the real power over moneyed and landed circulation? Where have you placed the means of raising and falling the value of every man's freehold? Those whose operations can take from or add ten per cent to the possessions of every man in France must be the masters of every man in France. The whole of the power obtained by this Revolution will settle in the towns among the burghers, and the moneyed directors who lead them. The landed gentleman, the yeoman, and the peasant have, none of them, habits or inclinations or experience which can lead them to any share in this the sole source of power and influence now left in France. The very nature of a country life, the very nature of landed property, in all the occupations and all the pleasures they afford, render combination and arrangement (the sole way of procuring and exerting influence) in a manner impossible amongst country-people. Combine them by all the art you can, and all the industry, they are always dissolving into individuality. Anything in the nature of incorporation is almost impracticable amongst them. Hope, fear, alarm, jealousy, the ephemerous tale that does its business and dies in a day, all these things, which are the reins and spurs by which leaders check or urge the minds of followers, are not easily employed, or hardly at all, amongst scattered people. They assemble, they arm, they act, with the utmost difficulty, and at the greatest charge. Their efforts, if ever they can be commenced, cannot be sustained. They cannot proceed systematically. If the country-gentlemen attempt an influence through the mere income of their property, what is it to that of those who have ten times their income to sell, and who can ruin their property by bringing their plunder to meet it at market? If the landed man wishes to mortgage, he falls the value of his land and raises the value of assignats. He augments the power of his enemy by the very means he must take to contend with him. The country-gentleman, therefore, the officer by sea and land, the man of liberal views and habits, attached to no profession, will be as completely excluded from the government of his country as if he were legislatively proscribed. It is obvious, that, in the towns, all the things which conspire against the country-gentleman combine in favor of the money manager and director. In towns combination is natural. The habits of burghers, their occupations, their diversion, their business, their idleness, continually bring them into mutual contact. Their virtues and their vices are sociable; they are always in garrison; and they come embodied and half-disciplined into the hands of those who mean to form them for civil or military action.|$|E
