5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death {{less than}} a month after her {{daughter}} <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> born, <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> raised by Godwin, who was able to provide his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his own liberal political theories.

5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. <b>Mary</b> <b>is</b> itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

50|$|Many Methodists, {{including}} John Wesley, {{have held}} that <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> a perpetual virgin, which {{is the belief that}} <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> ever-virgin for the whole of her life and Jesus was her only biological son. Contemporary Methodism does hold that <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> a virgin before, during, and immediately after the birth of Christ. A small number of Methodists hold the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary as a pious opinion.|$|R

5|$|Production {{began in}} early 1954. The film was {{simultaneously}} shot in Tamil as Missiamma, with an altered cast. Missamma {{tells the story}} of two unemployed people of different religions and mentalities: M. T. Rao and Mary.

5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. <b>Mary</b> <b>is</b> shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E
5|$|To {{escape a}} family who does not share her values, Mary befriends Ann, a local girl who educates her still further. Mary becomes quite {{attached}} to Ann {{who is in the}} grip of an unrequited love and does not reciprocate Mary's feelings. Ann's family falls into poverty and is on the brink of losing their home, but <b>Mary</b> <b>is</b> able to pay off their debts after her marriage to Charles gives her limited control over her money.|$|E

5000|$|She said: [...] "As Suzie Sweet in Balamory, <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> well {{respected}} {{by those who}} worked with her and much loved by the CBeebies audience. Like Suzie, <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> a kind and giving woman who took {{on the role of}} nurturing young talent." ...|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, <b>Mary</b> <b>is</b> not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nobility}} {{there were many}} educated and cultured women, of which Queen <b>Mary</b> <b>is</b> the most obvious example. By the early eighteenth century their {{education}} was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, musical instruments (including lute, viol and keyboard), needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746). There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, {{all of which are}} largely religious in content.|$|E
5|$|Both of McCool's {{parents also}} work in education; her mother, <b>Mary,</b> <b>is</b> {{a teacher and}} her father, Terry, is a superintendent. She has an older brother who played {{football}} at the University of Cincinnati. Growing up, McCool was an avid wrestling fan, going as far as knowing how to do Ric Flair's signature maneuver, the figure-four leglock, by age seven. Before and during high school, McCool played softball, basketball and volleyball. She also played first base at Pasco-Hernando State College. McCool later received her Master's degree in Educational leadership from Florida State University. Before becoming involved in professional wrestling, she taught seventh grade science for four years {{in her hometown of}} Palatka, Florida. She also competed in National Physique Committee fitness contests, taught gymnastics and kickboxing, and worked as a personal trainer.|$|E
50|$|St <b>Mary's</b> however <b>is</b> {{predominantly}} Roman Catholic. St. <b>Mary's</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} Catholic secondary school in Limavady, and has {{close ties with}} St <b>Mary's</b> chapel which <b>is</b> opposite the school. The principal <b>is</b> Mrs <b>Mary</b> McCloskey.|$|R
5000|$|Mary {{remained}} in the Temple until her twelfth year, at which point she was assigned to Joseph as guardian. According to Coptic tradition, her father Joachim died when <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> six years old and her mother when <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> eight. [...] While the story is a legend with no foundation in history, {{the point is to}} show that even in her childhood <b>Mary</b> <b>was</b> completely dedicated to God. It is from this account that arose the feast of Mary's Presentation.|$|R
