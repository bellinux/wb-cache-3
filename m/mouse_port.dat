25|$|By mid-1984, Apple's {{commitment}} to bringing the mouse to its entire product line {{resulted in the}} release of the Apple II Mouse Interface peripheral card. Since this was a dedicated <b>mouse</b> <b>port,</b> Apple simply re-packaged the Macintosh mouse, but with the same creamy-beige cable and connector used on the IIc mouse and bundled it along with special software called MousePaint for use with the Apple II, II Plus, and IIe computers. Like the original IIc mouse, it used the same model number as the Macintosh. Unlike the Mouse IIc, however, it can be interchanged with the Macintosh version, but cannot be used on the IIc. Due to the popularity of the Macintosh and shortage of mice, Apple later repackaged the original Apple Mouse IIc in this bundle as well since it was cross-platform compatible. The AppleMouse II and its successors were never included as standard equipment on any computer.|$|E
2500|$|The DE-9 {{connectors}} {{were designed}} to be electrically compatible with the joysticks popular on numerous 8-bit systems, such as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 2600. [...] Although the ports {{could be used for}} both purposes, the signals must be interpreted differently. [...] As a result, plugging a mouse into a joystick port causes the [...] "joystick" [...] to continuously move in some direction, even if the mouse stays still, whereas plugging a joystick into a <b>mouse</b> <b>port</b> causes the [...] "mouse" [...] to only be able to move a single pixel in each direction.|$|E

5000|$|Mini-DIN-6 {{connectors}} {{were used}} for IBM PC compatible PS/2 keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports</b> and for Acorn Archimedes keyboards (prior to the A7000 were proprietary, A7000 and later were standardised PS/2).|$|R
5000|$|Ports: MIDI In/Out, 3 x RS-232, [...] "Serial LAN" [...] LocalTalk/RS-422, printer, monitor (RGB and Mono), RF modulator, extra {{disk drive}} port, ACSI, SCSI (ACSI/SCSI daughterboard), port, VMEbus inside case, {{detachable}} keyboard, joystick and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports</b> on keyboard ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{many of the}} PS/2's innovations, such as the 16550 UART (serial port), 1.44 MB 3.5-inch {{floppy disk}} format, 72-pin SIMMs, the PS/2 {{keyboard}} and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports,</b> and the VGA video standard, {{went on to become}} standards in the broader PC market.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimate Calculator: A project {{involving}} fully customizing {{the hardware}} of a TI-83+; this includes customization of the casing, adding a PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>port,</b> {{and at one}} point, even incorporating a PS/2 trackpad. There have been three incarnations of the Ultimate Calculator.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, the PS/2 {{introduced}} a new software data area known as the Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA). Its primary use was to add a new buffer area for the dedicated <b>mouse</b> <b>port.</b> This also required making a change to the [...] "traditional" [...] BIOS Data Area (BDA) which was then required {{to point to the}} base address of the EBDA.|$|E
5000|$|The mouse daemon {{listens to}} a <b>mouse</b> <b>port</b> (by default, [...] ) and {{supplies}} mouse data to a virtual mouse driver, sysmouse(4). A user process {{that wants to}} use the mouse simply opens [...] and reads from it like a normal file. This {{makes it possible for}} the console and user processes such as the X Window System to share the mouse.|$|E
5000|$|Mini-DIN-8 {{connectors}} {{were used}} for Sun Microsystems keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports,</b> {{as well as for}} serial printer, modem, and Apple LocalTalk connections. It was also used as the game pad connector for the PC Engine video game system and its variants (except the TurboGrafx-16 USA variant, which used a full sized DIN-8) ...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{peripherals}} on both Alpha and Intel models {{included a}} SCSI host adapter, DEC 21040 Ethernet controller, two PCMCIA slots, two RS-232 ports, a bi-directional parallel port, a 2.5 in or 3.5 in SCSI or ATA hard disk (340 MB to 1.6 GB), PS/2 keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports,</b> and a PCI slot (on models with 2.5-inch hard disks).|$|R
50|$|A common {{frame buffer}} was the Sun-2 Prime Monochrome Video. This board {{provided}} an 1152x900 monochrome display with TTL or ECL video signals, and keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports.</b> It normally occupied the top 1 MB of physical memory address space. There {{was also a}} Sun-2 Color Video board available that provided an 1152x900 8-bit color display. This board occupied the top 4 MB of address space.|$|R
50|$|The system's {{keyboard}} has a <b>mouse</b> <b>port</b> {{built into}} either side. The {{front of the}} computer has a headphone jack, volume control, joystick, keyboard and mouse ports. The top has a retractable carrying handle only on non-Compact models, a reset button, and a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) button. The rear {{has a variety of}} ports, including stereoscopic output for 3D goggles, FDD and HDD expansion ports, and I/O board expansion slots.|$|E
5000|$|PS/2 systems {{introduced}} a new specification for the keyboard and mouse interfaces, which are still in use today and are thus called [...] "PS/2" [...] interfaces. The PS/2 keyboard interface was electronically identical to the long-established AT interface, but the cable connector was changed from the 5-pin DIN connector to the smaller 6-pin mini-DIN interface. The same connector and a similar synchronous serial interface {{was used for the}} PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{they are}} hot swapped, the devices must be similar {{enough that the}} driver running on the host system recognizes, {{and can be used}} with, the new device. Otherwise, the new device will not {{function}} properly. While this is seldom an issue with standard keyboard devices, the host system rarely recognizes the new device attached to the PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>port.</b> In practice most keyboards can be hot swapped but this should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|The {{best known}} {{example of a}} PC device that uses {{programmed}} I/O is the ATA interface; however, this interface can also be operated in any of several DMA modes. Many older devices in a PC also use PIO, including legacy serial ports, legacy parallel ports when not in ECP mode, the PS/2 keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports,</b> legacy MIDI and joystick ports, the interval timer, and older network interfaces.|$|R
50|$|ATX {{also made}} the PS/2-style mini-DIN {{keyboard}} and mouse connectors ubiquitous. AT systems used a 5-pin DIN connector for the keyboard and were generally used with serial <b>port</b> <b>mice</b> (although PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>ports</b> were also found on some systems). Many modern motherboards are phasing out the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse connectors {{in favor of the}} more modern Universal Serial Bus. Other legacy connectors that are slowly being phased out of modern ATX motherboards include 25-pin parallel ports and 9-pin RS-232 serial ports. In their place are onboard peripheral ports such as Ethernet, FireWire, eSATA, audio ports (both analog and S/PDIF), video (analog D-sub, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort) and extra USB ports.|$|R
50|$|The first-generation Zonbox {{hardware}} was the eBox-4854 sold by DMP Electronics of Taiwan.Called the Zonbu Mini, {{it was a}} nettop computer measuring 6 ¾” × 4 ¾” × 2 ¼”. It is flash based, fanless, {{and thus}} effectively silent. The official specifications for the device in 2007 were:1.2 GHz Via Eden CPU (C7 Esther core),512 MB RAM,Ethernet over twisted pair 10/100 Mbit/s,PS/2 keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports,</b> VGA display port and 6 USB 2.0 ports,4 GB CompactFlash local storage, and Graphics up to 2048 x 1536 with 16 million colors - hardware graphics and MPEG2 acceleration.|$|R
50|$|The ATi Wonder series {{represents}} some of {{the first}} graphics add on products for IBM PCs and compatibles introduced by ATi Technologies in the mid to late 1980s. These cards were unique at the time as they offered the end user a considerable amount of value by combining support for multiple graphics standards (and monitors) into a single card. The VGA Wonder series added additional value with the inclusion of a bus <b>mouse</b> <b>port,</b> which normally required the installation of a dedicated Microsoft Bus Mouse adapter.|$|E
5000|$|The DE-9 {{connectors}} {{were designed}} to be electrically compatible with the joysticks popular on numerous 8-bit systems, such as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 2600.

5000|$|The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN {{connector}} {{used for}} connecting some keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its {{name comes from}} the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 [...] "serial mouse" [...] connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 designs on keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>port</b> may not be interchangeable since the two devices use {{a different set of}} commands.|$|E
50|$|The A740 uses a quad-core Intel Core-i7 processor, 8 {{gigabytes}} of RAM, and a 1-terabyte Solid State Hybrid Drive with an 8GB SSD part. There is no {{optical drive}} in the machine itself, but a USB DVD burner is given as a standard accessory along with the USB (wireless) keyboard and <b>mouse.</b> <b>Ports</b> include ethernet, HDMI, combined audio jack for headphones/microphone, four USB 3.0 connections and a 6-in-1 card reader. The A740's ability to accept HDMI input allows for using the screen with external devices. An internal TV-tuner is optional.|$|R

50|$|Tandy 1000 used a {{proprietary}} 6-pin female round connector for the joystick port {{that on the}} SX/TX was adjacent to the keyboard port {{in the front of}} the computer. As with the keyboard, it was compatible with the older TRS-80 and Tandy color computer models. It was not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port and required a Tandy 1000 compatible joystick. Some PC-DOS games would not work with it, but most games made to work with Tandy 1000 graphics and sound do work. The Tandy 1000 mouse also fit in the game port. The Tandy 1000 mouse is not compatible with 9-pin serial or PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>port,</b> and some DOS software will not work with it, though Tandy 1000 specific software like deskmate does work.|$|E
50|$|By mid-1984, Apple's {{commitment}} to bringing the mouse to its entire product line {{resulted in the}} release of the Apple II Mouse Interface peripheral card. Since this was a dedicated <b>mouse</b> <b>port,</b> Apple simply re-packaged the Macintosh mouse, but with the same creamy-beige cable and connector used on the IIc mouse and bundled it along with special software called MousePaint for use with the Apple II, II Plus, and IIe computers. Like the original IIc mouse, it used the same model number as the Macintosh. Unlike the Mouse IIc, however, it can be interchanged with the Macintosh version, but cannot be used on the IIc. Due to the popularity of the Macintosh and shortage of mice, Apple later repackaged the original Apple Mouse IIc in this bundle as well since it was cross-platform compatible. The AppleMouse II and its successors were never included as standard equipment on any computer.|$|E
50|$|The IBM PC AT used an Intel 8042 chip to {{interface}} to the keyboard. This computer also controlled {{access to the}} A20 line in order to implement a workaround for a chip bug in the Intel 80286. The keyboard controller was also used to initiate a software CPU reset {{in order to allow}} the CPU to transition from protected mode to real mode because the 286 did not allow the CPU to go from protected mode to real mode unless the CPU is reset. This was a problem because the BIOS and the operating system services could only be called by programs in real mode. These behaviors have been used by plenty of software that expects this behavior, and therefore keyboard controllers have continued controlling the A20 line and performing software CPU resets even when the need for a reset via the keyboard controller was obviated by the Intel 80386's ability to switch to real mode from protected mode without a CPU reset. The keyboard controller also handles PS/2 mouse input if a PS/2 <b>mouse</b> <b>port</b> is present. Today the keyboard controller is either a unit inside a Super I/O device or is missing, having its keyboard and mouse functions handled by a USB controller and its role in controlling the A20 line handled by the chipset.|$|E
50|$|Optionally, a {{southbridge}} {{also includes}} support for Ethernet, RAID, USB, audio codec, and FireWire. Where support is provided for non-USB keyboard, <b>mouse,</b> and serial <b>ports,</b> a machine normally does so through a device {{referred to as}} a Super I/O; still more rarely, a southbridge may directly support the keyboard, <b>mouse,</b> and serial <b>ports.</b>|$|R
50|$|Original PS/2 {{connectors}} {{were black}} or {{had the same}} color as the connecting cable (mainly white). Later the PC 97 standard introduced a color code: the keyboard port, and the plugs on compliant keyboards, were purple; <b>mouse</b> <b>ports</b> and plugs were green. (Some vendors initially used a different color code; Logitech used the color orange for the keyboard connector for a short period, but soon switched to purple.) Today this code is still used on most PCs. The pinouts of the connectors are the same, but most computers will not recognize devices connected to the wrong port.|$|R
5000|$|I/O ports: composite, RF and DE9 RGB video output, RS-232 (DB25 male + DE9 male {{connector}} {{reserved for the}} <b>mouse),</b> parallel <b>port</b> (DB25 fe{{male connector}}), external floppy connector, DA15 PC joystick female connector, light pen and expansion connector ...|$|R
50|$|Keyboard and <b>mouse</b> {{cables and}} <b>ports</b> are almost {{invariably}} serial—such as PS/2 port and Apple Desktop Bus and USB.|$|R
5000|$|The RSX {{offered a}} 25 MHz 80386SX processor, 1 MB RAM, two 16-bit ISA slots, AcuMos SVGA video, a {{bidirectional}} parallel port, and standard PS/2 keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports.</b> It {{was a full}} 386-class PC and could run Microsoft Windows 3.x. Two sockets for SIMM memory cards were provided. Only 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs of the 9-chip type were supported, and if two were installed {{they had to be}} of like capacity. With two 4 MB SIMMs installed, the 1000 RSX could be expanded to 9 MB RAM (without using an ISA slot). The RSX/HD variant came with a 52 MB hard drive using an AT-compatible IDE interface; replacement hard drives up to 504 MB could be substituted. Because of the slimline case, only one hard drive could be installed alongside the 1.44 MB 3.5" [...] floppy drive.|$|R
50|$|The Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX series were slim-line desktop home computers. The RL and RL/HD {{featured}} a 9.56 MHz 8086 processor (surface-mounted, so no V30 upgrade was possible), 512 KB of RAM (expandable to 768 KB to provide 128 KB for video and 640 KB conventional memory), smaller keyboard and <b>mouse</b> <b>ports</b> (which {{were similar to}} the PS/2's ports but not 100% compatible), a DB-25 unidirectional parallel port instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL's enhanced graphics and sound. A single half-size 8-bit expansion slot was available. Both the RL and RL/HD included a built-in XT IDE hard drive interface and the RL/HD came with a 20MB drive preinstalled. The RL/HD had a battery-backed real-time clock chip to store date and time information, which the RL lacked. These models also had MS-DOS and a portion of DeskMate in ROM, and could therefore boot much faster than many other computers on the market.|$|R
5000|$|ISA bus or LPC bridge. ISA support {{remains an}} {{integrated}} {{part of the}} modern southbridge, though ISA slots are no longer provided on more recent motherboards. The LPC bridge provides a data and control path to the super I/O (the normal attachment for the keyboard, <b>mouse,</b> parallel <b>port,</b> serial port, IR port, and floppy controller) and FWH (firmware hub which provides access to BIOS flash storage).|$|R
50|$|In the PC version, {{the paddle}} (a rocket) is {{controlled}} using a <b>mouse.</b> The Wii <b>port</b> instead supports the Wii Remote's pointer and tilt functions, the Nunchuk, the Classic Controller and the Wii Balance Board.|$|R
50|$|The CD32 {{is capable}} of running most of the titles {{developed}} for the Amiga CDTV multimedia device, but differences in CPU speed and Kickstart version prevent some of the earlier CDTV titles from running. Most of the games released for the CD32 are simply ports of games that were already available for Amiga computers. One benefit of this is that, when appropriate, many games retain {{the ability to use}} an Amiga <b>mouse</b> (in <b>port</b> 2) or Amiga keyboard (plugged into the AUX port).|$|R
