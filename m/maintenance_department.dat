40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate, through an empirical study, the different functions of the highways <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> and to suggest methods by means of which road maintenance work could be carried out in a more efficient way by utilising its resources of men, material and plant to the utmost advantage. This is particularly important under the present circumstances of national financial difficulties which have resulted in continuous cuts in public expenditure. In order to achieve this objective, the researcher carried out a survey among several Highways Authorities by means of questionnaire and interview. The information so collected was analysed {{in order to understand}} the actual, practical situation within highways manintenance departments, and highlight any existing problems, and try to answer the question of how they could become more efficient. According to the results obtained by the questionnaire and the interview, and the analysis of these results, the researcher concludes that it is the management system where least has been done, and where problems exist and are most complex. The management of highways <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> argue that the reasons for their problems include both financial and organisational difficulties, apart from the political aspect and nature of the activities undertaken. The researcher believes that this ought to necessitate improving the management's analytical tools and techniques in order to achieve the most effective way of performing each activity. To this end the researcher recommends several related procedures to be adopted by the management of the highways <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments.</b> These recommendations, arising from the study, involve the technical, practical and human aspects. These are essential factors of which management should be aware - and certainly should not neglect - in order to achieve its objectives of improved productivity in the highways <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The growing {{awareness}} of delivering public services into more costumer-oriented minded triggers the public organisations to manage their assets professionally. Building assets {{are one of the}} resources owned by the public organisations that need to be maintained. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> are part of the public body that have responsibilities {{to make sure that the}} building assets are functioning well and can perform for what it is designed for. The problems arise when there are many buildings that should be managed within different functions and types; such as monumental buildings, schools, offices, etc. creates complexities. Furthermore, the nature of public organisations is different compared to private organisations. Public organisations must follow the law and regulations, facilitating stakeholders’ opinions and politics, and satisfying public. It is questioned whether the <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> are capable to perform the maintenance activities professionally. In order to reveal the capabilities of an organisation a measurement tool is needed. One of the measurement tools that can disclose the professionalism of organisations is a maturity model. With maturity model, an organisation can understand their current maturity level and design their strategy to reach the next level. Furthermore, this is a self-assessment tool that is simple to use. A maturity model can consist of several levels of five, six, or seven, that will depend on the desired function. It is believed that the higher the level, the more professional is the organisation. Several quality management tools are being used by many organisations to enhance their professionalism, for instance the EFQM model. The EFQM model is commonly used in Europe that has components of “enablers” and “results”. By using those components, organisations can value their performances and processes. The main purpose of this research is to develop a maturity model that can measure the capabilities of <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments.</b> By having this tool that specifically designed for building <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments,</b> they can design strategies that fit their goals. Furthermore, to narrow down the research, the subjects of Planned preventive maintenance and Responsive maintenance are involved. To develop a maturity model as an adaptation of the EFQM model, there are several steps to do. Firstly, the literature reviews are conducted. The topics that have to be explored are the types of maturity models, the EFQM model, and the activities of <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> include the Planned preventive maintenance and Responsive maintenance. There are two maturity models that become main references; the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) by Paulk et. al (1993) and the Public Commissioning Maturity Model (PCMM) by Hermans et. al (2014). The main important aspects of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> are then summarised and linked to those maturity models and the EFQM enablers. The result is the proposed maturity model. Secondly, the first round interviews are conducted to get opinions and feedbacks from the experts about the proposed maturity model. This will find the relevancy of the key aspects in the model. The results of these interviews are the proposed maturity model and maturity levels. The third step in this research is to design an assessment sheet that can be used to measure the maturity level. This proposed assessment sheets are consisting of 26 questions with five multiple choices for each question. The fourth step is to carry on the second round interviews to explore whether the proposed assessment sheet is relevant to test <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments.</b> The results of the interviews improve the questions and the multiple answers, which are improving the maturity levels. Finally, as final products of this research, a maturity model for <b>maintenance</b> <b>departments</b> and an assessment sheet are formed. The final maturity model consists of five main aspects, 20 sub aspects, and five levels for every main aspects and sub aspects. The final assessment sheet is consisting of 27 questions with five multiple answers per question. Design and Construction ManagementReal Estate & HousingArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

500|$|The {{claim that}} a {{metallic}} strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of Jacques Chirac's aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay. British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear. They {{came to the conclusion}} that the Concorde veered off course on the runway, which reduced takeoff speed below the crucial minimum. John Hutchinson, who had served as a Concorde captain for 15 years with British Airways, said that [...] "the fire on its own should have been 'eminently survivable; the pilot should have been able to fly his way out of trouble'", had it not been for a [...] "lethal combination of operational error and 'negligence' by the <b>maintenance</b> <b>department</b> of Air France" [...] that [...] "nobody wants to talk about".|$|E
