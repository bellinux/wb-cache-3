5000|$|Edward Ormerod {{developed}} and patented the [...] "Ormerod" [...] safety link or detaching hook, known in mining circles as a [...] "butterfly". This elegant device was {{inserted into the}} <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> {{in such a way}} that if the lift cage was accidentally overwound the link would be pulled into a bell through which the <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> passed. This action would not only disconnect the cage from the <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> but also prevent the cage from falling back down the shaft. The device was patented in 1867 and is manufactured today. It is believed that the lives of many miners have been saved by its use and it has never failed in service.|$|R
40|$|The Nicaraguan <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump avoids {{a number}} of the {{technical}} complications in-herent to the classical windpump, especially the starting problem and the occurence of dynamic peak loads. The <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump starts smoothly and can achieve system e-ciencies comparable to the piston pump. As a result, the rotor and the tower can be very lightweight, resulting in signicantly lower production and installation costs than for a classical windmill (typically 25 - 35 %). This opens up a new market of wind pump users, e. g. small farmers. The present paper gives a description of the <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump system using a stationary approach. Expressions are derived for the system eciency and long-term output of the wind pump in a Weibull wind regime. It is shown that a properly maintained <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump can have a higher output and better availability than a classical wind pump; typically a higher matching ratio would be used (xd 1 : 4). The use of the device in Nicaragua, however, seems not to optimize the average water output. The question therefore arises whether the critical design parameters, i. e. the design pump speed, rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] A bi-objective {{optimization}} model {{of power and}} power changes generated by a wind turbine is discussed in this paper. The model involves two objectives, power maximization and power ramp rate (PRR) minimization. A new constraint for power maximization based on physics and process control theory is introduced. Data-mining algorithms were used to identify the model of power generation from the industrial data collected at a wind farm. The models and constraints derived from the data were integrated to optimize the power itself and the power variability, expressed as the power ramp rate. Due to the nonlinearity {{and complexity of the}} {{optimization model}}, an artificial immune network algorithm was used to solve it. The optimization results, such as computed operation strategies and the corresponding outputs, are demonstrated and discussed.
