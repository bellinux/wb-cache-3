There was much discussion {{at that time of}} multimedia voice/data services but the conception of these services was very vague. There was no real understanding of the utility and therefore customer value of these services. As a result, office controller services were usually restricted to various forms of <b>modem</b> <b>pooling.</b>|$|E

40|$|This is {{the third}} {{analysis}} of the <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> situation of HUT. Jani Lakkakorpi made the two previous ones in 1997 and 1998. When the first survey was made {{the capacity of the}} HUT staff <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> was 120 simultaneous connections and the capacity of the student pool was 60 simultaneous connections. It was discovered that the staff pool had excess capacity and thus the staff capacity was reduced to 60 while the student capacity was increased to 180. The data I analyzed is from 2001 and 2002. The staff <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> capacity was still 60 simultaneous connections and the student pool had 180 simultaneous connections. The purpose of this survey is to monitor the situation of the <b>modem</b> <b>pools,</b> to see whether there is enough capacity or not. Also as using a modem is not so popular anymore it is interesting to see the development in the number of user. The pricing policy of Elisa (ex-Helsinki Telephone Company) can also be seen from the data. In the 1998 survey the evening and weekend rates were no longer fixed, you had to pay extra for every minute that exceeded 30 minutes. Today there is yet again a fixed rate for evenings and weekends, this rate is for Internet usage and it’s called Elis...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} policy for {{managing}} <b>modem</b> <b>pools</b> that disconnects users only if not enough modems {{are available for}} other users to connect. Managing the <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> then becomes a replacement problem, similar to buffer cache management (e. g., in virtual memory systems). When a new connection request is received, the system needs to find a user to "replace". In this paper we examine such demand-disconnect schemes using extensive activity data from actual ISPs. We discuss various replacement policies and propose CIRG: a novel replacement algorithm that is well suited for <b>modem</b> <b>pools.</b> In general, the choice of algorithm is significant. A naive algorithm (e. g., one that randomly replaces any user who has been inactive for a while) incurs many tens of percent more "faults" (i. e., disconnections of users {{who are likely to}} want to be active again soon) than the LRU algorithm, which, in turn, incurs 10 % more faults than CIRG. For good replacement algorithms, the impact can be significant in terms [...] ...|$|R

The dimensioning of <b>modem</b> <b>pools</b> to support this type of access is of particular importance to commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) as well as to universities that maintain their own <b>modem</b> <b>pools</b> to support access by faculty, staff, and students.

40|$|Much {{work in the}} {{analysis}} of proxy caching has focused on high-level metrics such as hit rates, and has approximated actual reference patterns by ignoring exceptional cases such as connection aborts. Several of these low-level details have a strong impact on performance, particularly in heterogeneous bandwidth environments such as <b>modem</b> <b>pools</b> connected to faster networks. Trace-driven simulation of the <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> of a large ISP suggests that "cookies" dramatically affect the cacheability of resources; wasted bandwidth due to aborted connections can more than offset the savings from cached documents; and using a proxy to keep from repeatedly opening new TCP connections can reduce latency more than simply caching data...|$|R

Demon moved initially to Energis lines with a Regionally Organised <b>Modem</b> <b>Pool</b> (ROMP) and later added Colt lines to the service so they had more control over which lines new customers used over separate 0845 numbers.|$|R
50|$|Always-on connections: Throughout the 1990s, the {{predominant}} mode of consumer Internet access was telephone modem dial-up. The {{rapid increase in}} the number of the dial-up networks increased address consumption rates, although it was common that the <b>modem</b> <b>pools,</b> and as a result, the pool of assigned IP addresses, were shared amongst a large customer base. By 2007, however, broadband Internet access had begun to exceed 50% penetration in many markets. Broadband connections are always active, as the gateway devices (routers, broadband modems) are rarely turned off, so that the address uptake by Internet service providers continued at an accelerating pace.|$|R

This is called the DUHL or Dynamic User and Host List. SORBS does not automatically rescan DUHL listed hosts for updated rDNS so to remove an IP address from the DUHL the user or ISP has to request a delisting or rescan.

In order {{to estimate the}} number of additional lines and switching capacity required in an exchange, the Internet access traffic must be characterised in terms of holding time and call interarrival time distributions. In this paper, we analyse six months worth of log files tracing the usage of the central <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> and ISDN access lines at University of Stuttgart.

We provide simple and easily computable conditions under which these games are learnable by several models of learning, such as adaptive and sophisticated learning (Milgrom and Roberts [34]), calibrated learning (Foster and Vohra [8]), and reasonable learning (Friedman and Shenker [15]). Thus, using these methods one can evaluate the stability of such games on the Internet or in other settings in which players must learn over time.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasingly}} sophisticated workforce management tools, a significant gap remains between {{the goal of}} effective staffing and the present difficulty predicting the stochastic demand of inbound calls. We have investigated the hypothesized nonhomogeneous Poisson process model of <b>modem</b> <b>pool</b> callers of the University community. In our case, we tested if the arrivals could be approximated by a piecewise constant rate over short intervals. For each of 1 and 10 -minute intervals, based on the close relationship between the Poisson process and the exponential distribution, the test results did not show any sign of homogeneous Poisson process. We have examined the hypothesis of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process by a transformed statistic. Quantitative and graphical goodness-of-fit tests have confirmed nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Further analysis on the intensity function revealed that linear rate intensity was woefully inadequate in predicting time varying arrivals. For sinusoidal rate model, difficulty arose in setting the period parameter. Spline models, {{as an alternative to}} parametric modelling, had more control of balance between data fitting and smoothness, which was appealing to our analysis on call arrival process...|$|R
50|$|Although Sweden had {{connected}} to the internet in 1984, it was not until 1988 that this access was considered significant, when the higher education network SUNET was able to connect with the USA. Internet access became available to the Swedish public in 1994 when Algonet as the first operator connected the Swedish Internet with the Swedish telephone network via <b>modem</b> <b>pools.</b> The usage costs were made up of a fixed monthly fee and per minute charges as with any other telephone call. In 1996 Internet access became available for a flat monthly fee in Ängelholm where the local cable TV company began to offer connectivity via Cable TV modems with an Ethernet interface. A big change started in 1999 when Bredbandsbolaget concluded a Framework Agreement with housing movement HSB and a large number of condominium apartments were given access to the Internet. This led Telia {{to come up with a}} similar offer, and soon a market was created where Bredbandsbolaget and Telia were just two of several players.

Rapidly increasing subscriber bases, data intensive applications (such as streaming audio and video), heavy Web browsing, and large file downloads require significant resources and may tax existing network bandwidth. Reliability and quality of service are becoming serious issues for service providers across the country. Due to the dynamic nature of the information technology (IT) sector in general, it is difficult to predict future network usage patterns or what types of applications may be available, and how these applications may be used over time.

40|$|Although new {{technologies}} such as xDSL and PONs will soon permit a direct and continuos access to Global Information Infrastructures, such as the Internet, of residential and SOHO (small office-home office) users, dial-up access via analog modems over PSTN remains the most frequent approach. The ever increasing number of Internet users adopting this access modality is leading to two kind of problems: (1) a dimensioning problem for the ISPs which have to properly define the number of modems to guarantee a low refuse probability for the incoming traffic (dial-up connections); (2) terrible implications on dimensioning problems of the PSTN which was designed {{on the basis of}} assumptions strongly modified by the new statistical nature of ISP access connections. The paper presents an extensive measurement analysis carried out collecting traffic data offered to an Internet Dial-up access server. The characterisation of the arrival process and the Call Holding Time (CHT) distribution is presented.

40|$|An Internet-based virtual {{private network}} uses the open, {{distributed}} infrastructure of the Internet to transmit data between corporate sites. VPNs using the Internet {{have the potential to}} solve many of the business networking problems. Virtual Private Networks provide an economical yet secure way to connect sites together and to provide network access to remote users. Virtual Private Networks provide attractive solution. A VPN uses the Internet infrastructure to interconnect sites and provide connectivity for remote dial-up users. The nearly universal coverage of the Internet eliminates the need for private leased lines and <b>modem</b> <b>pools,</b> and it eliminates long distance telephone charges remote, dial-up users. VPNs are less costly than conventional wide area networks. A VPN operates by passing data over the Internet or corporate intranet through “tunnels” which are secure, encrypted virtual connections that use the Internet (or corporate intranet) as the connection medium. The VPN establishes tunnels between servers in a site-to-site VPN, and between clients and servers in a client-to site VPN. The VPN encrypts and encapsulates each IP (or IPX) packet before passing it through a tunnel. The encapsulated packet includes authentication information to ensure the authenticity of the data and its source. The VPN also uses the authentication information to check that the original data has not been corrupted during transmission, ensuring the integrity of the data...|$|R
