40|$|This outlook paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the traceability of <b>minor</b> <b>crops.</b> These kinds of cultivations consist in a large number of plants locally distributed with a modest production in terms of cultivated acreage and quantity of final product. Because of globalization, the diffusion of <b>minor</b> <b>crops</b> is increasing due to their benefit for human health or their use as food supplements. Such a phenomenon implies a major risk for species substitution or uncontrolled admixture of manufactured plant products with severe consequences for the health of consumers. The need for a reliable identification system is therefore essential to evaluate the quality and provenance of minor agricultural products. DNA-based techniques can help in achieving this mission. In particular, the DNA barcoding approach has gained a role of primary importance thanks to its universality and versatility. Here, we present the advantages in the use of DNA barcoding for the characterization and traceability of <b>minor</b> <b>crops</b> based on our previous or ongoing studies at the ZooPlantLab (Milan, Italy). We also discuss how DNA barcoding may potentially be transferred from the laboratory to the food supply chain, from field to table...|$|R

500|$|In 2009, the {{historian}} Michael Decker stated that widespread cultivation {{and consumption of}} four staples, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum and cotton were already commonplace under the Roman Empire and Sassanid Empire, centuries before the Islamic period.

In the case of cotton, which the Romans grew mainly in Egypt, the plant remained a <b>minor</b> <b>crop</b> in the classical Islamic period: the major fibre was flax, as in Roman times. Decker further asserted that the advanced state of ancient irrigation practices [...] "rebuts sizeable parts of the Watson thesis," [...] since for example in Spain, archaeological work indicated that the Islamic irrigation system was developed from the existing Roman network, rather than replacing it. Decker agreed that [...] "Muslims made an important contribution to world farming through the westward diffusion of some crops", but that the introduction of [...] "agronomic techniques and materials" [...] had been less widespread and less consistent than Watson had suggested.

40|$|Leaf area index (LAI), {{specific}} leaf area (SLA) {{and leaf}} {{dry matter content}} (LDMC) are plant/crop physiological variables {{which could be used}} to differentiate among and select maize cultivars suitable for specific environmental conditions, particularly in rain-fed agriculture. The leaf area index, SLA, LDMC and total dry matter (TDM) were estimated for the three rain-fed maize cultivars (Golden Crystal, Mamaba and Obatanpa) during the major and <b>minor</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons. The experimental design used was the completely randomized block design in four replicates, with maize cultivars as treatments. This study was undertaken to assess differences or similarities in the time course of LAI, SLA and LDMC as an assessment of the response of the three maize cultivars to rain-fed conditions during the major and <b>minor</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons in a coastal savannah agro-ecological environment. Additionally, the linear correlation analysis was used to assess the association between LAI and SLA, LAI and LDMC, SLA and LDMC, SLA and LDMC, TDM and LAI as well as between TDM and LDMC for the three rain-fed maize cultivars. Generally, Obatanpa and Mamaba maize cultivars produced comparatively higher LAI which peaked at about 1. 30 and 2. 00 on 84 DAE during the major and <b>minor</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons, respectively. The maize cultivars had mean peak SLA values of 1. 20 m^ 2 g^- 1 on 14 DAR and 1. 60 m^ 2 g^- 1 on 28 DAE during the major and <b>minor</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons, respectively. With regards to LCMD, all the maize cultivars had peak values on 28 DAE, with the value of Golden Crystal being 0. 70 g g^- 1 during the major season and 0. 65 g g^- 1 for Mamaba during the <b>minor</b> <b>cropping</b> season. During the major cropping season the linear regression between SLA and LDMC for Obatanpa (R = 0. 948) and for Mamaba (R = 0. 222) were positive but positive and poor for Golden Crystal (R = 0. 059). For the <b>minor</b> <b>cropping</b> season, the correlation between SLA and LDMC remained positive and fairly good for Obatanpa (R = 0. 702), Mamaba(R = 0. 861) and positive but poor for Golden Crystal (R = 0. 363). However the combined cropping seasons, R value was positive and good for Obatanpa (R = 0. 701) and Mamaba (R = 0. 861) while that for Golden Crystal was poor (R = 0. 363). Such a poor linear correlation between SLA and LDMC for Golden Crystal is an indication that the maize cultivar is poorly adapted to the rain-fed coastal savannah agro-ecological environment and, therefore, not suitable for the cropping environment. Additionally, the correlation between TDM and LAI was positive but poor in all the crop growing seasons, with R values ranging from 0. 423 for Obatanpa, 0. 524 for Mamaba and 0. 562 for Golden Crystal. Furthermore, R value was 0. 507 for the combined cropping seasons and all the maize cultivars.
