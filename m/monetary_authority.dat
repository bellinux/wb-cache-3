40|$|We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo {{algorithm}} {{to estimate}} {{a model that}} allows temporary gaps between a true expectational Phillips curve and the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> approximating non-expectational Phillips curve. A dynamic programming problem implies that the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> inflation target evolves as its estimated Phillips curve moves. Our estimates attribute {{the rise and fall}} of post WWII inflation in the US to an intricate interaction between the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> beliefs and economic shocks. Shocks in the 1970 s altered the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> estimates and made it misperceive the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. That caused a sharp rise in inflation in the 1970 s. Our estimates say that policymakers updated their beliefs continuously. By the 1980 s, their beliefs about the Phillips curve had changed enough to account for Volcker's conquest of US inflation in the early 1980 s. ...|$|R
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national <b>monetary</b> <b>authority</b> existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Hong Kong <b>Monetary</b> <b>Authority</b> {{granted a}} deposit-taking company license to the operator, {{removing}} previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15 {{percent of its}} turnover from non-transit-related functions. This allowed the Octopus card to be widely adopted for non-transit-related sales transactions. On 29 June 2003, the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new Octopus card-operated system.

5000|$|... ==Supply shock== During a {{negative}} supply shock, the fiscal and <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> may follow conflicting policies {{if they do}} not coordinate, as the fiscal authorities would follow expansionary policies to bring the output back to its original state while the <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> would follow contractionary policies so as to reduce the inflation created due to the cutback in output caused by the supply shock.|$|R
40|$|Proponents of {{flexible}} exchange rates have long claimed {{that one of the}} main advantages of a flexible exchange rate regime is that It allows a nation to pursue an Independent monetary policy. Under a system of fixed exchange rates, the actions of the domestic <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> are limited by their ability to finance a balance of payments deficit. Whether a nation is small (in the sense that its <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> cannot control the nominal money supply) or large (in the sense that its actions can affect the world money supply) fixed exchange rates prevent the domestic <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> from continually expanding the domestic component of the money supply at a rate greater than the rate of growth of the demand for domestic money. As a flexible exchange rate eliminates the reserve constraint, It also gives the domestic <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> control over the domestic money supply. Yet the term "independent monetary policy " connotes more than sinqple control over the nominal money supply. One such connotation is that disturbances in the domestic money market are Isolated from disturbance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} "Fed watching" {{within the context of}} a macroeconomic policy game. Following A. Cukierman and A. H. Meltzer's 1986 article, the policymaker's preferences are private information and noisy monetary control causes past observations of money growth to be a noisy signal of the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> future intentions. Individuals are allowed to acquire additional information about the <b>monetary</b> <b>authority's</b> preferences. Thus, both past observations of money growth and costly information about the policymaker's preferences are used by agents in forming expectations about policy.

5|$|Due to the {{expansion}} of the company's businesses, Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and Octopus Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary. The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong <b>Monetary</b> <b>Authority,</b> while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited. As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus. Since the Government of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Authority</b> of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E

To structuralists, when <b>monetary</b> <b>authorities</b> pursue an expansionary policy, the opposite effect is achieved. Orthodox economists counter this argument.
