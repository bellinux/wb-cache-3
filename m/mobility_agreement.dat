2500|$|AT Mobility v. Concepcion, , is a {{legal dispute}} that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. [...] On April 27, 2011, the Court ruled, by a 5–4 margin, that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that {{prohibit}} contracts from disallowing class-wide arbitration, such as the law previously upheld by the California Supreme Court {{in the case of}} Discover Bank v. Superior Court. [...] As a result, businesses that include arbitration agreements with class action waivers can require consumers to bring claims only in individual arbitrations, rather than in court as part of a class action. [...] The decision was described by Jean Sternlight as a [...] "tsunami that is wiping out existing and potential consumer and employment class actions" [...] and by law professor Myriam Gilles as [...] "the real game-changer for class action litigation". [...] By April 2012, Concepcion was cited in at least 76 decisions sending putative class actions to individual arbitration. [...] After the decision, several major businesses introduced or changed arbitration terms in their consumer contracts (some of which were based on the consumer-friendly terms found in the AT <b>Mobility</b> <b>agreement),</b> although the hypothesis of massive adoption of consumer arbitration clauses following the decision has been disputed.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other {{arbitration}} <b>agreements,</b> AT&T <b>Mobility's</b> arbitration <b>agreement</b> {{was designed}} to facilitate the pursuit of small claims in arbitration. The arbitration agreement provided that AT&T Mobility would pay the entire cost of arbitration (unless the claim {{was determined to be}} frivolous). The arbitration would take place in the county where the consumer was located, by telephone, or through document submission, and forms for the arbitration were made available on AT&T Mobility's website. The arbitrator was not limited in the damages it could award to a consumer, and if the consumer received an award greater than AT&T Mobility's last written settlement offer, the award would be increased to $7,500, and the consumer would be entitled to double attorney's fees. This led the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to state that arbitration under AT&T <b>Mobility's</b> <b>agreement</b> was [...] "quick, easy to use, and prompts full or, as described by Plaintiffs, even excess payment to the customer without the need to arbitrate or litigate." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{negotiations}} that the European Commission, with the formal support of France, Italy and Spain, opened with Senegal in 2008 for a <b>mobility</b> partnership <b>agreement.</b> <b>Mobility</b> partnerships, {{as defined by the}} Commission in 2007, are a new EU (multilateral) instrument for managing migratory flows into the Union. The negotiations with Senegal were indefinitely suspended in 2009 and are now widely considered as having failed. This article sets out to identify the factors that contributed to the suspension of talks. It shows that failure can be attributed to a complex web of factors originating in the specific Senegalese, European and Senegal-EU political landscapes and jointly contributing to an unfavourable cost-benefit calculation by the French and Senegalese parties to the negotiation, to an unclear and awkward negotiating strategy {{on the part of the}} European Commission and to incoherent, EU and Senegalese, foreign policies.

30|$|We {{examine this}} issue empirically {{based on a}} unique {{database}} that links inventors {{to the general population}} in Sweden (Jung and Ejermo 2014; Zheng and Ejermo 2015).

Sweden’s accession to the EEA means that all EU- 15 citizens could move to Sweden freely. We use difference-in-differences (DiD) estimations to evaluate the impact of liberalization on the skill composition of immigrants. This method means that the treatment group (i.e., EU- 15 citizens) is compared in terms of skill composition (education, probability of becoming an inventor) both against themselves before treatment and relative to the trend in the control groups.|$|E
40|$|When {{domestic}} {{labor markets}} cannot fully absorb an increasing level of educated labor force, migration {{is an important}} channel for resolving local market imbalances with potentially large benefits to the individuals and nations involved. Labor movement is particularly important for the MENA region {{because one of the}} region’s main characteristics is excess labor in a subgroup of countries (such as the Arab Republic of Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Morocco) and excess capital in another (such as the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries). 1 A similar point can be made about labor-abundant countries in the South versus capital-rich countries in the North. This situation creates an opportunity for a mu-tually beneficial exchange between the two groups of countries, provided that market failures across borders are addressed and national migration policies are not biased against migration. In this chapter, it is argued that, despite the significant level of mi-gration in MENA, a host of factors has limited the full realization of its potential benefits. In addition to political factors, which are {{beyond the scope of this}} report, migration is adversely affected by widespread mar-ket failures (most visibly information asymmetry and imperfect con-tracts) and national migration and labor policies at both ends of the ex-change. Historically, governments in the region tended to focus on the liberalization of trade in goods and services by joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) or signing regional free-trade agreements. No similar effort was made to liberalize or coordinate labor movement over-seas, although the benefits from labor mobility can be more substantial than those from the movement of goods and capital because of the huge differential in the wage rates for similar skills across countries. 2 Thus, there is room for enhancing the returns to education through migration. This potential can be realized through labor <b>mobility</b> <b>agreements</b> among MENA countries (or a subset of countries) and through reforms of na-tional migration policies that stand in the way of greater and more effi-cient labor mobility...|$|R
