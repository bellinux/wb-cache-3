A particular {{focus is on the}} size of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees,</b> the degree of centralization, and the representation of relative economic size in the voting rights of regional (or sectoral) interests. Broad benchmarks for the optimal design of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> are derived, combining relevant theoretical arguments with available empirical evidence. A new indicator compares the mismatch of relative regional economic size and voting rights in the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> of the US Fed, the pre- 1999 German Bundesbank, and the ECB over time. Based on these benchmarks, there seems to be room to improve the organization of the ECB Governing Board and current plans for reform.

25|$|Stable {{prices and}} {{confidence}} in the currency are the two main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base interest rate, which is decided by the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Committee,</b> and through its communications strategy, such as publishing yield curves.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Committee</b> (MPC) {{has had the}} {{responsibility}} for setting the official interest rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{preference}} heterogeneity in <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> of inflation-targeting (IT) countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) during the period 2005 - 2010. It employs (individual) voting records of the Monetary Council of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (the central bank of Hungary) and of the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> Council of the National Bank of Poland. Preference heterogeneity in committees is not directly observable. Therefore, we pursue an indirect measurement and conduct an econometric analysis based on (pooled) Taylor-type reaction functions estimated using real-time information on economic and financial indicators and voting records. Recent evidence for the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> (MPCs) of advanced economies (see Besley et al., 2008; and Jung, 2011) suggests that preference heterogeneity among its members is systematic. Unlike for <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> of advanced countries, the present paper finds preference heterogeneity to be random for both the members of the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> Council of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), and the members of the Monetary Council of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB). But, similar to the committees of advanced economies, the diversity of views on the inflation forecast is measurable in both committees. A separate cluster analysis shows that different preferences of MPC members may be attributable to their status (chairman, internal member, external member) and that members may also differ in their desired response to changes in the economic outlook...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the most}} notable, but least discussed, {{hallmarks}} of what I {{have called the}} quiet revolution in central banking practice (Blinder, 2004 a) has been the movement toward making <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> decisions by <b>committee.</b> Until about a decade ago, most central banks had a single governor, who {{might or might not}} have been independent {{of the rest of the}} government. But since then, the United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Brazil, to name just a few, have opted to establish <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> (MPCs). In addition, the committee-based ECB replaced 12 central banks, most of which had previously been run by individual governors. I am unaware of any case in which a country replaced an MPC by a single decisionmaker. In fact, a recent survey by Pollard (2004) found that 79 out of 88 central banks made <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> by <b>committee.</b> Thus the existence of a pronounced worldwide trend is clear. So the first question for this paper is why. Why have so many central banks switched from individual to group decisionmaking?...|$|R

25|$|Government {{involvement}} in the economy is primarily exercised by HM Treasury, headed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In recent years, the UK economy has been managed in accordance with principles of market liberalisation and low taxation and regulation. Since 1997, the Bank of England's <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Committee,</b> headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, {{has been responsible for}} setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year. The Scottish Government, subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament, has the power to vary the basic rate of income tax payable in Scotland by plus or minus 3 pence in the pound, though this power has not yet been exercised.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May 1997, {{following}} the 1997 general election which brought a Labour government to {{power for the}} first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Committee</b> was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target has changed to 2% since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index. If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.|$|E
25|$|The UK has a {{partially}} regulated market economy. Based on market exchange rates, the UK is today the fifth-largest {{economy in the}} world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency (after the US dollar and the euro). Since 1997 the Bank of England's <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Committee,</b> headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} optimal communication by <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> in a {{model of}} imperfect knowledge and learning.

When <b>committee</b> members have heterogeneous policy preferences, welfare is greater under majority voting than under consensus decision-making. Furthermore, central bank communication under majority voting {{is more likely to be}} beneficial in this case.

A key reason for the committee's superior performance is that committee members are relatively likely to opt for low inflation and building a reputation when shocks are small. When large shocks hit the economy, the incentive to react outweighs the reputation-building benefit. ...|$|R

25|$|Government {{involvement}} in Scotland's economy {{is on the}} whole exercised by the UK Government and the Scottish Government via HM Treasury, respectively headed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Constitution and Economy, representing those two administrations which are responsible for reserved and devolved matters respectively. Since 1979, management of the UK economy (including Scotland) has followed a broadly laissez-faire approach. The Bank of England is Scotland's central bank and its <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Committee</b> is responsible for setting interest rates.

Using a new data set that characterizes central bank <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>committees</b> (MPCs) in more than 30 countries from 1960 through 2006, we find a U-shaped relationship between MPC size and inflation; our results suggest that the lowest level of inflation is reached at MPCs with intermediate size of about five to nine members.
