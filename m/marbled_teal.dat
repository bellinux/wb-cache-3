40|$|Brood {{attendance}} {{by adults}} in the globally threatened <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> Marmaronetta angustirostris was studied {{in the field in}} Spain and Turkey. In seven broods, only one adult (thought to be the female) was seen attending. Two adults were in attendance for 10 broods, amongst which all age classes were represented.

When these four broods were disturbed, the female led the ducklings into emergent cover whilst the male remained close to the human observer, flying around or past him repeatedly and giving conspicuous alarm calls.

40|$|Current {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggests that, if a character is sexually dimorphic {{as a result}} of sexual selection, it should be positively allometric (i. e. relatively larger in larger individuals), whereas if the dimorphism is the result of natural selection (e. g. niche divergence), it should be isometric. I show how this can be used to study the selective forces responsible for dimorphic morphological characters, using the monochromatic <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> Marmaronetta angustirostris as an example. In absolute terms, first-year male teals have a higher body mass, wing length, head length and bill length than females. In relative terms (controlling for body size), males still have longer wings, heads and bills. The scaling in <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> suggests that bill and head dimorphisms are due to sexual selection, whereas wing dimorphism is due to natural selection. Tail length is sexually monomorphic but positively allometric, possibly because of a display function. Such scaling studies are easy to carry out, and provide a useful complement to direct investigation of the influence of variation in the size of dimorphic characters on mating success, foraging efficiency etc. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The first {{detailed}} study of the breeding biology of the globally threatened <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> Marmaronetta angustirostris is presented, {{using data from the}} Marismas del Guadalquivir in southwestern Spain. Complete clutches, with 9 — 20 eggs, were recorded from 28 April to 27 July. Excluding clutches of over 14 eggs (likely to be intraspecifically parasitized), the mean clutch size was 11. 8, larger than that reported for almost all other Anatidae species. Broods hatched from May to early August (later than sympatric duck species), with a peak in mid—late June and significant annual variation in date. Brood sizes were exceptionally high, declining from a mean of 10. 9 {{in the first week of}} age to 8. 5 when fully feathered (at 42 days or more). Duckling mortality was concentrated in the first 2 weeks after hatching. Nine percent of broods had 15 — 23 ducklings, largely as a result of nest parasitism. Brood size decreased strongly with hatching date and varied significantly between years. Data from across the species’ range showed that breeding occurs later at more northerly latitudes. A recent decline in the <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> in the Marismas is linked with its late breeding season. Anthropogenic changes have reduced the duration of flood­ ing in the natural marshes of Doñana National Park, which now dry out by August, before this species has completed breeding.

40|$|Capsule This {{globally}} {{threatened species}} is {{less dependent on}} invertebrates and more dependent on seeds than other ducks. Aims To assess seasonal variation in <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> diet at {{two of the most}} important wetlands for the west Mediterranean population. Methods Faecal samples from El Hotba, Morocco (19 in October, 28 in May) and Veta Ia Palma, Doñana (19 in August, five from July broods) were analysed. Gut contents of six birds from Veto Ia Palma (September—October were analysed. Results At El Hotba, small seeds (especially Ruppia) and green plant material (especially charophytes) were the dominant faecal components in May and October. The proportion of invertebrates did not change, but more Corixidae and less Chironomidae were consumed in May. At Veta Ia Palma, Ruppia seeds were dominant in August, but Ephydridae, Chironornidae, Coleoptera and other insects were dominant in faeces from July broods. Significantly fewer Coleoptera but more Foraminifera were recorded in August. The overall proportion of invertebrates at El Hotba in May and October was higher than at Veto a Palma in August, but lower than in July broods. Corixidae were dominant in May, Ephydridae in July broods, unidentified insects, Ostracoda and Foraminifera in August and Coleoptera in October. Gut contents from Veto Ia Palma confirmed the dominance of Ruppia seeds in the post-breeding diet. Conclusion <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> differs in its ecology from the better-known north-temperate ducks.

40|$|The {{tribe of}} surface-feeding, or dabbling, ducks {{is the largest}} single tribe in the family. There are 40 species in the tribe as it is {{constituted}} here. Contrary to the arrangement of Delacour (1956), the ringed teal {{is included in the}} Cairinini; and the crested duck, included in the Tadornini by Delacour, is here considered a typical dabbling duck. In addition, the pink-headed duck has been removed from the Anatini and placed in the Aythyini with the pochards, and the freckled duck has been removed from the tribe and is considered a primitive species having anserine relationships. The <b>marbled</b> <b>teal</b> has been removed from the genus Anas and placed in a monotypic. genus which, I believe, provides an evolutionary link between the dabbling ducks and the pochards. The Anatini are world-wide in distribution and include the most numerous and widespread species of the family. Most species (and especially those of the shoveler group) forage on the water surface, gathering food from the surface by up-ending or 2 ̆ 2 tipping-up, 2 ̆ 2 or, more rarely, by diving. Most species open their wings when diving. A few species, such as the wigeon, graze, and nearly all species are predominantly vegetarians. Nearly all nest on the ground, but a few species nest in holes or crevices. The downy young are much like those of the perching ducks and are usually strongly marked with brown and white or with yellow. All species mature their first year, and pair bonds are generally renewed yearly. Most species exhibit sexual dimorphism in plumage, and metallic coloration is usually restricted to the head and speculum. The males of most sexually dimorphic species have a distinct eclipse plumage. Nearly all species have metallically colored wing specula.

In this paper on the Anati- dae, we study the scaling of wing length and tarsus length with body mass, relationships that {{can be expected to}} have biomechanical significance. At an interspecific level, both wing length and tarsus are positively allometric, a finding consistent with results from pre- vious comparative avian studies. These trends remained significant in regressions control- ling for the effects of phylogeny, but interspecific slopes were less steep within tribes than in the whole family (a taxon-level effect). We are not aware of any biomechanical resaons that explain these patterns satisfactorily. Intraspecific (static) allometries in Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and <b>Marbled</b> <b>Teal</b> (Marmaronetta angustirostris) are different: wing length is negatively allometric and tarsus is isometric.

It contains the largest wetland in Western Europe (García Novo and Marín Cabrera 2005), an intricate matrix of marshlands (270 km 2), phreatic lagoons, and a 25 km-long dune ecosystem with its respective shoreline and representative Mediterranean terrestrial plant communities (Fig. 28. 1).

Ducklings rescued in 1997 (n = 44) were released together in February 1998 over ﬁve months after ﬂedging, and their survival was modelled for six months from February until August. Their apparent monthly survival rate was 0. 54 ± 0. 06. Ducklings rescued in 1998 (n = 159) were released in August–September soon after ﬂedging and their survival was modelled for 10 months from August until June. Their apparent monthly survival rate was 0. 83 ± 0. 07. Monthly survival was sig- niﬁcantly higher for the 1996 and 1998 cohort, suggesting that retaining birds in captivity after ﬂedging had a negative impact on post-release survival. When birds were released in February, a lower proportion survived until the breeding season three months later than when they were released ﬁve months earlier in September. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This tribe includes all of the 2 ̆ 2 puddle ducks 2 ̆ 2 that constitute most of the important game species throughout the world. Of the 39 species making up the tribe, all but 3 can readily {{be placed in the}} single genus Anas. The tribe has a worldwide distribution, with some of the species occurring on several continents and having extensive transcontinental migration patterns. However, most of the species are temperate-breeding forms and are generally adapted to shallow, marshy habitats where food can be obtained from near the surface by dabbling or tipping-up. In most species the males have fairly elaborate and colorful breeding plumages, whereas the ground-nesting females are mostly cryptically patterned with buff and brown. In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx. Pair bonds are generally reformed each year during the nonbreeding season, but in some species with long breeding seasons the pair bonds are relatively permanent and the males remain with their offspring and help to protect them...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to test and evaluate the various taxonomic arrangements of the family, to discover some of the trends of behavioral evolution, {{and to provide a}} basis for future workers to use in naming, describing, and evaluating the behavioral patterns observed in waterfowl. The major sexual behavior patterns of the species of Anatidae are reviewed and summarized, for the purpose of clarifying evolutionary relationships in the family, tracing the evolution of behavior patterns through various taxa, and evaluating the importance of certain behavior patterns as potential isolating mechanisms.
