Understanding interactions between NO and MMP- 9 is of biological and pharmacological relevance and may prove crucial in designing new therapeutics. The reciprocal interaction between NO and MMP- 9 have been studied for nearly twenty years but to our knowledge, are yet {{to be the subject}} of a review. This review provides a summary of published data regarding the complex and sometimes contradictory effects of NO on MMP- 9. We also analyse molecular mechanisms modulating and mediating NO-MMP- 9 interactions. Finally, a potential therapeutic relevance of these interactions is presented...|$|R

To identify pathways that may influence sleep, we examined afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), an area critically implicated in promoting sleep. Injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the VLPO produced modest numbers of CTB-labeled monoaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nuclei, and ventrolateral medulla, {{as well as a}} few neurons in the locus coeruleus. Immunohistochemistry for monoaminergic markers showed dense innervation of the VLPO by histaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic fibers. Along with previous findings, these results suggest that the VLPO and monoaminergic nuclei <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reciprocally</b> connected. Retrograde and anterograde tracing showed moderat...|$|R

Results indicated that urbanization and availability of resources were the strongest predictors of mass media development, that education was found to be not as important as had been assumed, that the relationships between mass media development and its predictors differ according to the region of the world studied and with the time period examined, and that urbanism and availability of resources <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reciprocally</b> related over time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-power encoding technique, called chromatic encoding, for the Digital Visual Interface standard (DVI), a digital serial video interface. Chromatic encoding reduces power consumption by minimizing the transition counts on the DVI. This technique {{relies on the}} notion of tonal locality, i. e., the observation - first made in this paper - that the signal differences between adjacent pixels in images follow a Gaussian distribution. Based on this observation, an optimal code assignment is performed to minimize the transition counts. Furthermore, the three color channels of the DVI <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reciprocally</b> encoded to achieve even more power saving. The idea is that given the signal values from the three color channels, one or two of these channels are encoded by reciprocal differences with a number of redundant bits used to indicate the selection. The channel selection problem is formulated as a minimum spanning tree problem and solved accordingly. The proposed technique requires only three redundant bits for each 24 -bit pixel. Experimental results show up to a 75 % power reduction in the DVI...|$|R

40|$|CD 44 is a {{principal}} cell-surface receptor for hyaluronate and is found {{on a wide variety}} of cells. CD 44 plays an important role in lymphocyte homing, lymphohemopoiesis, and T-cell activation as well as in cell motility and migration. CD 44 is expressed on the cell surface of epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), and is one of the candidates for molecules that are involved in the migratory capability of LC, but little is known about its regulatory properties. We examined the modulatory effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukln (IL) - 10 on the CD 44 expression in LC. We found 1) that TNF-α significantly up-regulated the expression of CD 44 in a concentration-dependent manner, 2) that IL- 10 down-regulated the expression of CD 44 in a concentration-dependent manner, 3) that the effect of TNF-α or IL- 10 was readily detectable as early as 24 h after the initiation of culture, and 4) that the simultaneous addition of TNF-α and II- 10 mutually neutralized the effect of each other.

40|$|Abstract Background Ethanol {{inhibits}} proliferation in astrocytes, {{an effect}} that was recently {{linked to the}} suppression of phosphatidic acid (PA) formation by phospholipase D (PLD). The present study investigates ethanol's effect on the induction of apoptosis in astrocytes {{and the formation of}} ceramide, an apoptotic signal. Evidence is presented that the formation of PA and ceramide <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reciprocally</b> linked during ethanol exposure. Results In cultured rat cortical astrocytes, ethanol (0. 3 – 1 %, v/v) induced nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering indicative of apoptosis. Concomitantly, in cells prelabeled with [3 H]-serine, ethanol caused a dose-dependent, biphasic increase of the [3 H]-ceramide/ [3 H]-sphingomyelin ratio after 1 and 18 hours of incubation. As primary alcohols such as ethanol and 1 -butanol were shown to inhibit the phospholipase D (PLD) -mediated formation of PA, a mitogenic lipid messenger, we tested their effects on ceramide formation. In astrocytes prelabeled with [3 H]-serine, ethanol and 1 -butanol, in contrast to t-butanol, significantly increased the formation of [3 H]-ceramide. Moreover, exogenous PA, added to transiently permeabilized astrocytes, suppressed ethanol-induced [3 H]-ceramide formation. Vice versa, addition of C 2 -ceramide to astrocytes inhibited PLD activity induced by serum or phorbol ester. Conclusion We propose that the formation of ceramide in ethanol-exposed astrocytes is secondary to the disruption of phospholipase D signaling. Ethanol reduces the PA:ceramide ratio in fetal astrocytes, a mechanism which likely participates in ethanol-induced glial apoptosis during brain development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{and cancer}} therapy are often {{associated}} with symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbances, before, during and after therapy. These symptoms of fatigue and poor sleep often occur in parallel having {{a significant impact on}} the physical functioning of patients with cancer. A strong correlation between cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and sleep has been observed in several studies, suggesting that they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>reciprocally</b> related. The co-clustering of these symptoms suggests that they may have similar underlying aetiology and that treatments targeting either symptom may positively affect the other. Studies examining these clusters have shown that these symptoms often co-vary together. The potential mechanisms that link the relationship between insomnia and CRF are intriguing but require further investigation. Despite the high prevalence of insomnia and the often bidirectional relationship between poor sleep and fatigue, there are limited data to support the use of sleep management interventions as a means to reduce fatigue in patients with cancer. Assessment of the available evidence across trials is complicated by different study designs, patient selection criteria, stage of cancer treatment and by the nature of the interventions studied. Improvements from baseline in both sleep parameters and CRF have been documented in a limited number of studies, including two randomized-controlled trials using cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In contrast, the efficacy of pharmacological therapies in reducing both insomnia and CRF is largely lacking. Clearly, treating clinically significant insomnia is likely to have benefits for the patient with cancer and for those who are recovering from cancer. In particular, pharmacotherapies for insomnia, singly or in combination with CBT-I, should be evaluated in multicentre randomized clinical trials to examine their efficacy in improving sleep quality and reducing associated CRF. 1...|$|R

The Rolling mouse Nagoya (Cacna 1 atg-rol) is a spontaneous P/Q type VDCC mutant, {{which has been}} suggested as an animal model for some human neurological diseases such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA 6), familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic ataxia type- 2. Morphology of Purkinje cell (PC) dendritic spine is suggested to be regulated by signal molecules such as Ca 2 + and by interactions with afferent inputs. The amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic current was decreased in parallel fiber (PF) to PC synapses, whereas apparently increased in climbing fiber (CF) to PC synapses in rolling mice Nagoya. We have studied synaptic morphology changes in cerebella of this mutant strain. We previously found altered synapses between PF varicosity and PC dendritic spines. To study dendritic spine plasticity of PC in the condition of insufficient P/Q type VDCC function, we used high voltage electron microscopy (HVEM). We measured the density and length of PC dendritic spines at tertiary braches. We observed statistically {{a significant decrease in}} spine density as well as shorter spine length in rolling mice compared to wild type mice at tertiary dendritic braches. In proximal PC dendrites, however, there were more numerous dendritic spines in rolling mice Nagoya. The differential regulation of rolling PC spines at tertiary and proximal dendrites in rolling mice Nagoya suggests that two major excitatory afferent systems <b>may</b> <b>be</b> regulated <b>reciprocally</b> in the cerebellum of rolling mouse Nagoya...|$|R
