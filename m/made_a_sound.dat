5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
25|$|The team <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> start, with an {{encouraging}} home draw with much fancied Nottingham Forest, and they peaked at 5th on 21 October 2006. Some {{of the results}} in that period flattered the performances and the wheels came off in the next game with a 3–0 loss to Brighton & Hove Albion.|$|E
25|$|The now extinct Hare Indian dog of {{northern}} Canada {{was not known}} to bark in its native homeland, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> described as a growl building up to a howl.|$|E

25|$|During the shooting, many {{of those}} in {{attendance}} managed to escape the room and flee deeper into the building, while those who remained hid underneath tables or in bathrooms, closets, and cupboards. A bullet hit a fire sprinkler pipe, causing water to pour down the banquet room, {{making it difficult to}} see. The perpetrators moved between tables, shooting anyone who moved or <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> One person was struck by a bullet that tore through an interior wall, while another was shot while trying to escape through a glass door near where the shooters had entered. Three men attempted to stop one of the shooters, but all were shot; it was unclear if any of them survived. One victim was killed while shielding a coworker with his body. Some initially mistook the attack as an active shooter drill; some previous such drills had taken place in the same banquet room.|$|E
25|$|During the forenoon {{watch on}} 6 July 1944, however, an escort {{on the port}} side of the convoy {{obtained}} a sound contact, the alarm prompting the ships to make an emergency 45 degree turn to starboard at 10:53. Zeus went to general quarters at 10:56, after which time an escort dropped depth charges at 10:57. The battle damage repair ship resumed her original base course at 11:13, then secured from general quarters seven minutes later. The convoy resumed zig-zagging (11:30-15:30), suspended steering those courses for a brief period while one escort and two ships from the group left on duty assigned (15:40), then again began steering zig-zag courses twenty minutes later, with Zeus being ordered to assume a new position at 16:15. The passage proceeded uneventfully for a little over an hour, before an escort ahead of the disposition <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> contact at 17:16, with general quarters being sounded again, with the convoy steering another emergency 45 degree turn to starboard. Subsequently, the disposition resumed steering zig-zag courses at 17:30, with Zeus standing down from general quarters two minutes later. The convoy continued its zig-zagging until noon on 8 July, then reached Eniwetok a little less than four hours later. Steering various courses and speeds to conform to the channel, Zeus anchored in berth 526 in the central anchorage at 18:45.|$|E
500|$|The Romans contributed {{little to}} the {{foundations}} of botanical science laid by the ancient Greeks, but <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> contribution to our knowledge of applied botany as agriculture. In works titled [...] four Roman writers contributed to a compendium Scriptores Rei Rusticae, published from the Renaissance on, which set out the principles and practice of agriculture. These authors were Cato (234–149 BC), Varro (116–27 BC) and, in particular, Columella (4–70 AD) and Palladius (4th century AD). Roman encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) deals with plants in Books 12 to 26 of his 37-volume highly influential work [...] in which he frequently quotes Theophrastus but {{with a lack of}} botanical insight although he does, nevertheless, draw a distinction between true botany on the one hand, and farming and medicine on the other.|$|E

5000|$|Sound {{effects were}} also {{associated}} {{with many of the}} aircraft's abilities. When Airwolf bolted across the sky in [...] "turbo boost" [...] mode, one would hear it [...] "howl like a wolf" [...] as it <b>made</b> <b>a</b> glass-shattering <b>sound</b> effect. When sitting idle, the aircraft <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mechanical trilling <b>sound,</b> and while hovering the rotor blades <b>made</b> <b>a</b> ghostly wind drone.|$|R
500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively {{to the way he}} would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{referred}} to on Harry Hill's TV Burp twice. The first time it was referred to was when [...] "Dev" [...] (Coronation Street) <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> like the countdown end of thirty seconds time. The second time was when the competition [...] "Where Has The Knitted Character Been This Week?" [...] had the answer: On Rachel Riley's chair.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal who had {{performed}} with the group recollected on their career, saying [...] "They <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> that somehow fused rock, reggae, punk and hip-hop {{in a way that}} was seamless and credible, bound together by the undeniable soul of Brad Nowell's voice." [...] He was joined by other members of bands that {{had performed}} with Sublime, such as Pennywise and also by punk progenitor Mike Watt, Philadelphia neo-bluesman G Love, California beachcomber Jack Johnson, Latin-rock eclecticists Ozomatli and progressive hip-hop figures Michael Franti and Gift of Gab on [...] "Look at All the Love We Found: A Tribute to Sublime," [...] to donate money to help support artists with substance abuse problems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{arrival of}} sound {{at the very}} end of the 1920s, {{produced}} a final artistic flourish of German film before the collapse of the Weimar Republic in 1933. As early as 1918, three inventors came up with the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film system and tried to introduce it to the industry between 1922 and 1926. UFA showed an interest, but possibly due to financial difficulties, never <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> film. But in the late 1920s, sound production and distribution were starting to be adopted by the German film industry and by 1932 Germany had 3,800 cinemas equipped to play sound films. The first filmmakers who experimented with the new technology often shot the film in several versions, using several soundtracks in different languages. The film The Blue angel (1930), directed by the Austrian Josef von Sternberg and produced by Erich Pommer, was also shot in two versions - German and English, with a different supporting cast in each version. It is considered to be Germany's first [...] "talkie" [...] and one of the first sound films in the world, and will always be remembered as the film that made an international superstar of its lead actress Marlene Dietrich. Other notable early sound films, all from 1931, include Jutzi's adaptation to Alfred Döblin's novel Berlin Alexanderplatz, Pabst's Bertolt Brecht adaptation The Threepenny Opera and Lang's M, as well as Hochbaum's Raid in St. Pauli (1932). Brecht was also one of the creators of the explicitly communist film Kuhle Wampe (1932), which was banned soon after its release.|$|E
2500|$|The Emperor did not {{normally}} get up until noon, had brunch at about 2pm before {{going back to}} bed for another rest, to be followed up by playing tennis or table tennis, riding his bicycle or his car aimlessly around {{the grounds of the}} palace or listening to his vast collection of Chinese opera records. Puyi become a devoted Buddhist, a mystic and a vegetarian, having statues of the Buddha put up all over the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to while banning his staff from eating meat. Puyi's Buddhism led him to ban his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found any insects or mice droppings in his food, the cooks were flogged. When Puyi went into the gardens to mediate before a statue of the Buddha, there always had to be complete silence, and as there were two loud Japanese cranes living in the garden, the emperor always had his servants flogged if the cranes <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> One day when out for a stroll in the gardens, Puyi found that a servant had written in chalk on one of the rocks: [...] "Haven't the Japanese humiliated you enough?" [...] When Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he gave them long lectures on the [...] "glorious" [...] history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing Emperors with himself, a miserable man living as a prisoner in his own palace. The Empress Wanrong retreated in seclusion as she became addicted to opium, and her father stopped visiting the Salt Tax Palace as he could not bear to see what she had become. Wanrong, who detested her husband, liked to mock him behind his back by performing skits before the servants by putting on dark glasses and imitating Puyi's jerky movements. During his time in Tianjin, Puyi had started wearing dark glasses at all times, as during the interwar period wearing dark glasses in Tianjin was a way of signifying one was a homosexual or bisexual.|$|E
