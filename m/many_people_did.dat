5|$|ReTool {{bought and}} sold used tools. Winmark opened the first ReTool on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of ReTool's goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not sell tools they did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at ReTool. Winmark sold ReTool around 2002.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{political}} parties will provide transport for voters {{to and from}} the voting centre. While campaigning is not allowed on election day, transportation is seen as something of a social service, especially since <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not have a personal means of conveyance until the last decade or two, as of 2004.|$|E

25|$|Citizens of Russia (according to {{registration}} in {{the internal}} passport) could change the amount of 100,000 rubles, as stamped in passports. Rumours of reform went ahead, the authorities denied them and the reform was carried out during the holiday season, when many were away from their place of residence. The limitation was also aimed at combating the influx of currency notes from the former Soviet republics. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not physically have time to exchange their cash savings, and their money was gone.|$|E
25|$|Local population: The militias, and the {{political}} parties they served, believed they had legitimate moral authority to raise taxes to defend their communities. Road checkpoints were a particularly common way to raise these (claimed) taxes. Such taxes were in principle viewed as legitimate by much of the population who identified with their community's militia. However, many militia fighters would use taxes/customs as a pretext to extort money. Furthermore, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not recognize militia's tax-raising authority, and viewed all militia money-raising activities as mafia-style extortion and theft.|$|E
25|$|The Indigirka {{belonged to}} a fleet of steamships {{operated}} by Dalstroi to transport prisoners from Vladivostok, endpoint of the Transsiberian railway, to Magadan and Kolyma across the Sea of Okhotsk. Travel time was about six days to two weeks to Magadan. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not survive. Prisoners were held in the cargo holds where criminals ruled; the guards stayed outside and above and would spray the holds with ice-cold ocean water if things became too unruly. Women prisoners were abused.|$|E

25|$|Author Martin Bollinger {{reports that}} during the ship's Soviet career there is ample {{evidence}} that Dzhurma was used on Gulag routes between 1936 and 1950. As a part of the Dalstroy fleet, the ships «Ягода» (later renamed «Дальстрой»), «Кулу», «Джурма» transported prisoners from Vladivostok, endpoint of the Transsiberian railway, across the Sea of Okhotsk to Kolyma via Nagayevo port, which was the port of Magadan city. Travel time to Magadan was about 6 to 14 days; trips to the Arctic were seasonal as during the winter the sea froze over. A steamer would make about ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous, and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not survive the trip.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} of the modern town was shaped by the great flood of November 11, 1934. Deforestation on the slopes above the town combined {{with the fact that}} the city had been built as a series of closely packed houses and buildings – usually sharing walls – built in narrow roads paralleling and closely hugging the shore of the lake. Flood waters carrying mud, stones, and boulders rushed down the slopes and filled the streets and buildings with water so rapidly that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not have time to escape; the loss of life and property was great. The city rebuilt on the slopes and the British Mandatory government planted the Swiss Forest on the slopes above the town to hold the soil and prevent similar disasters from recurring. A new seawall was constructed, moving the shoreline several yards out form the former shore. In October 1938, Arab militants murdered 20 Jews in Tiberias during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December 1941, Japanese forces {{attacked}} Hong Kong, {{marking the}} start of the Battle of Hong Kong. Seventeen days later, on Christmas Day of 1941, which {{came to be known as}} [...] "Black Christmas", the Hong Kong government surrendered, and Hong Kong came under Japanese occupation. On 4 January 1942, a notice appeared in an English-language newspaper that all [...] "enemy nationals" [...] were to assemble on Murray Parade Grounds. [...] <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not see the notice, but about 1,000 people were eventually gathered on the grounds. In addition to those who gathered voluntarily, there were people forcibly removed from their homes.|$|E

500|$|Conroy's {{relationship}} with the Duchess {{was the subject of}} much speculation both before and after his death in 1854. When the Duke of Wellington was asked if the Duchess and Conroy were lovers, he replied that he [...] "supposed so". In August 1829, Wellington reported to court diarist Charles Greville that Victoria, then ten years old, had caught Conroy and her mother engaged in [...] "some familiarities". Victoria told her governess, Baroness Lehzen, who in turn told Madame de Spaeth, one of the Duchess's ladies-in-waiting. De Spaeth confronted the Duchess about the relationship and was immediately dismissed. All of this was recorded by Greville; his subsequent diary entry has led to the persistent belief that the Duchess and Conroy were lovers. Later, as an aged Queen, Victoria was aghast to discover that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> indeed believe that her mother and Conroy were intimate and stated that the Duchess' piety would have prevented this.|$|E
500|$|Another popular Farkism {{involves}} KABC-TV Consumer Specialist Ric Romero, {{which began}} on October 19, 2005, {{when he wrote}} a news story on the [...] "new" [...] Internet phenomenon of blogging. The story was then picked up by Fark, where he was ridiculed for posting a story about something that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not consider [...] "news" [...] and was actually quite obvious. Over {{the course of the}} next several years, he became somewhat of a meme on the site, as Farkers would post links to his stories, along with his photo, and a brief caption stating something obvious that everyone already knew. On December 7, 2009, Drew Curtis discovered his Facebook fan page, which led Romero to ask the Farkers that joined his new Facebook page to donate to the Spark of Love Toy Drive, which subsequently resulted in 582 online donations totaling $13,659.20 by December 16, 2009. Romero thanked the Fark community on the news for their donations, and recognized his status as a Farkism, also reporting the [...] "breaking news" [...] that [...] "Water is Wet." ...|$|E
500|$|Inevitably, the Manual {{became a}} {{lightning}} rod for controversy. [...] Some observers took issue with its perspective on Canada; most notably, The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature criticizes its [...] "condescending tone" [...] in describing Canada's resources. [...] Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the Manual. [...] According to journalist Lynn Coady, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press's offices. [...] In addition, Anansi co-founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBI–RCMP concerns. [...] <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not want the Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the Manual encouraged emigration. [...] But few observers believed him, then or later. [...] The first sentence of an article in The New York Times from 1968 describes the Manual as [...] "a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription". [...] Canadian essayist Robert Fulford remembers the Manual as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers. [...] Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 concedes that the Manual is [...] "coyly titled".|$|E

2500|$|After the {{sometimes}} [...] "airy" [...] and decidedly experimental [...] "Mwandishi" [...] albums, Hancock {{was eager to}} perform more [...] "earthy" [...] and [...] "funky" [...] music. The Mwandishi albums – though later seen as respected early fusion recordings – had seen mixed reviews and poor sales, so {{it is probable that}} Hancock was motivated by financial concerns as well as artistic restlessness. Hancock was also bothered by the fact that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not understand avant-garde music. He explained that he loved funk music, especially Sly Stone's music, so he wanted to try to make funk himself.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} in the Chinese legal community that the endemic corruption {{is caused by the}} lack of an independent judiciary and a failure to enforce laws and regulations. They contend that these problems will not be permanently fixed until much deeper systemic problems are addressed. Guanxi and other social customs, may have also contributed to the prevalence of practices seen as corrupt from a strictly legal perspective but seem relatively benign from a cultural standpoint. Gift-giving during holidays, securing patrons for career advancement, hosting banquets at expensive restaurants to secure minor deals, exchanging favours, and navigating the complex web of guanxi to get things done was seen as an ordinary part of Chinese life. Indeed, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not see these activities as illegal or even morally problematic. [...] Moreover, many regulations and law governing cadre work and public service were rarely enforced, resulting in two prevailing winds among Chinese officialdom that [...] "if everyone else is doing it then it must be okay," [...] and that [...] "I probably won't ever be caught anyway".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{figures of}} the intelligentsia took Najibullah's offer seriously, even if they sympathised or were against the regime. Their hopes were {{dampened}} when the Najibullah government introduced {{the state of emergency}} on 18 February 1989, four days after the Soviet withdrawal. 1,700 intellectuals were arrested in February alone, and until November 1991 the government still supervised and restricted freedom of speech. Another problem was that party members took his policy seriously too, Najibullah recanted that most party members felt [...] "panic and pessimism." [...] At the Second Conference of the party, the majority of members, maybe up to 60 percent, were radical socialists. According to Soviet advisors (in 1987), a bitter debate within the party had broken out between those who advocated the islamisation of the party and those who wanted to defend the gains of the Saur Revolution. Opposition to his policy of National Reconciliation was met party-wide, but especially from Karmalists. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not support the handing out of the already small state resources the Afghan state had at its disposal. On the other side, several members were proclaiming anti-Soviet slogans as they accused the National Reconciliation programme to be supported and developed by the Soviet Union. Najibullah reassured the inter-party opposition that he would not give up the gains of the Saur Revolution, but to the contrary, preserve them, not give up the PDPA's monopoly on power, or to collaborate with reactionary Mullahs.|$|E

2500|$|Most British {{people still}} use {{imperial}} units {{in everyday life}} for distance (miles, yards, feet and inches) and volume in some cases (especially milk and beer in pints) but rarely for canned or bottled soft drinks or petrol. Though use of kilograms is increasing, most British people also still use imperial units in everyday life for body weight (stones and pounds for adults, pounds and ounces for babies). Some government documents aimed at the public give body weight and height not only in metric units (kilograms centimetres) but also in imperial units (stones and pounds, feet and inches). A survey in 2015 found that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not know their body weight or height in one system or the other. People {{under the age of}} 40 preferred the metric system but people aged 40 and over preferred the imperial system. [...] The height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States is usually measured in hands, standardized to 4 inches (101.6mm). Fuel consumption for vehicles is commonly stated in miles per gallon, though official figures always include litres per 100km equivalents. When sold draught in licensed premises, beer and cider must be sold in pints and half-pints. Cow's milk is available in both litre- and pint-based containers in supermarkets and shops. Areas of land associated with farming, forestry and real estate are commonly advertised in acres and square feet, but for official government purposes the units are always hectares and square metres.|$|E
