The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million. The film earned more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor Batman Returns, and was the second-highest (behind Toy Story) grossing film of 1995, in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the <b>money</b> <b>than</b> the ship and Webb was spending more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> anything else he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, {{and there is no}} subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of the}} most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less <b>money</b> <b>than</b> men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|Alston's Dodgers {{teams of}} the 1960s {{benefited from the}} strong {{pitching}} by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> anyone was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games. Koufax retired after the season {{on the advice of}} doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> they did in their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

Hermética played only a few songs at a concert with Riffthe headline band, which ended with minor riots. Hermética were the opening act for Black Sabbath at Obras Sanitarias; Black Sabbath's frontman Ronnie James Dio thanked the band for playing with them. The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to Daniel Grinbank, the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath. In October 1992, they were the supporting band for Motörhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, but once in the country the show's producers tried to pay less <b>money</b> <b>than</b> had been agreed. Unable to find an alternative location, the band refused to play and returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more of their own <b>money</b> <b>than</b> in the past.|$|E
5|$|The Godwins were {{constantly}} in debt, so Godwin returned to writing {{to support the}} family. He and his wife started a Juvenile Library for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's bookselling district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> they could afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.|$|E

5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently {{under the impression that}} they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E
5|$|The final {{deliveries}} included six non-rigid airships, several kite {{balloons and}} additional aircraft, including two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2C, and single examples of Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2D and Vickers F.B.9, {{along with some}} replacement airframes, bringing the total to 120 aircraft. In addition to the aircraft, numerous spares were sent, including engines and ancillary equipment such as cameras and seaplane beaching gear, along with 300 support vehicles consisting of motor transports, trailers and motorcycles. The value of the Imperial Gift was about $5 million, more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> the Canadian government spent on aviation from 1919 to 1923.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E

5|$|Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 {{and cost}} $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June {{and the first}} public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of {{approximately}} ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed {{to show off the}} huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s. After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> any other film released in 1935.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as <b>money</b> <b>than</b> they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
5|$|With the {{emergence}} of The New Yorker, Benchley was able {{to stay away from}} Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year for more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> he was making writing for The New Yorker.|$|E
