In 1945 he was convicted in Roland Freisler's People's Court of hostility to Nazism.|$|E
25|$|Writers, painters, and filmmakers have {{produced}} innumerable {{works of art}} concerning the urban experience. Classical and medieval literature includes a genre of descriptiones which treat of city features and history. Modern authors such as Charles Dickens and James Joyce are famous for evocative descriptions of their home cities. Fritz Lang conceived the idea for his influential 1927 film Metropolis while visiting Times Square and <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nighttime neon lighting. Other early cinematic representations of cities {{in the twentieth century}} generally depicted them as technologically efficient spaces with smoothly functioning systems of automobile transport. By the 1960s, however, traffic congestion began to appear in such films as The Fast Lady (1962) and Playtime (1967).|$|E

Was he the first to see it? Perhaps. It was so hidden, so concealed by the ferns. It gave him a strange feeling, a feeling almost of ownership. He stepped down a little toward the water.|$|R

Nannini finished in fourth, while Pierluigi Martini qualified fifth and finished in that position, also leading for one lap; the only time in the Minardi team's 21-year history that it led a Grand Prix. Tyrrell racing finished in sixth for the 2nd consecutive race, although it was Jonathan Palmer that earned the point for them in Portugal. The new Williamses, however, suffered near-simultaneous and identical motor blow-outs. Up until then they looked promising.|$|E

500|$|Tipping the Velvet was {{critically}} acclaimed upon its release and Waters' writing style highly praised. Harriet Malinowitz {{wrote that the}} story is an [...] "utterly captivating, high octane narrative" [...] and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote, [...] "Could this be a new genre? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel? Whatever it is, take it with you. It's gorgeous." [...] Kirkus Reviews also praised it, writing [...] "Waters' debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters", comparing the depiction of Nancy's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield, and adding that it [...] "pulsat with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat". John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it [...] "has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> author's craftsmanship, idiosyncrasy and sheer effort." [...] Perry did acknowledge, however, that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters' vision of a lesbian past.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{waking up}} {{on the morning of}} flight day six three and a half minutes early, they {{discussed}} with Mission Control in Houston the day's timeline of events. The second lunar excursion's primary objective was to visit Stone Mountain to climb up the slope of about 20 degrees to reach a cluster of five craters known as [...] "Cinco Craters." [...] After preparations for the day's moonwalk were completed, the astronauts climbed out of the Lunar Module. After departing the immediate landing site in the lunar rover, they arrived at the day's first destination, the Cinco Craters, [...] from the LM. At [...] above the valley floor, the pair were at the highest elevation above the LM of any Apollo mission. After <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> view (including South Ray) from the side of Stone Mountain, which Duke described as [...] "spectacular," [...] the astronauts gathered samples in the vicinity. After spending 54 minutes on the slope, they climbed aboard the lunar rover en route to the day's second stop, station five, a crater [...] across. There, they hoped to find Descartes material that had not been contaminated by ejecta from South Ray Crater, a large crater south of the landing site. The samples they collected there, although their origin is still not certain, are, according to geologist Don Wilhelms, [...] "a reasonable bet to be Descartes." [...] The next stop, station six, was a [...] blocky crater, where the astronauts believed they could sample the Cayley Formation as evidenced by the firmer soil found there. Bypassing station seven to save time, they arrived at station eight on the lower flank of Stone Mountain, where they sampled material on a ray from South Ray Crater for about an hour. There, they collected black and white breccias and smaller, crystalline rocks rich in plagioclase. At station nine, an area known as the [...] "Vacant Lot," [...] which was believed to be free of ejecta from South Ray, they spent about 40 minutes gathering samples. Twenty-five minutes after departing station nine, they arrived at the final stop of the day, halfway between the ALSEP site and the LM. There, they dug a double core and conducted several penetrometer tests along a line stretching [...] east of the ALSEP. At the request of Young and Duke, the moonwalk was extended by ten minutes. After returning to the LM to wrap up the second lunar excursion, they climbed back inside the landing craft's cabin, sealing and pressurizing the interior after 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds of EVA time, breaking a record that had been set on Apollo 15. After eating a meal and proceeding with a debriefing on the day's activities with Mission Control, they reconfigured the LM cabin and prepared for the sleep period.|$|E

[...] "While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently {{the character of the}} nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon.

2500|$|The English {{were among}} the first who saw the {{tendency}} of Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait, and tried to understand why it did bubble. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling, and that nearly any wine could be made to sparkle by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it. This {{is one of the first}} known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and suggests that British merchants were producing [...] "sparkling Champagne" [...] even before the French Champenois were deliberately making it. Concurrently, advances in glass manufacture in Britain, by George Ravenscroft and others, allowed more robust wine bottle to be made which could contain the effervescence without exploding. The popularity of sparkling Champagne steadily grew. In 1663, the British poet Samuel Butler penned the first written English reference to [...] "brisk" [...] (i.e. frothy) Champagne in his poem Hudibras. The 1698 George Farquhar play Love and a Bottle featured one of the characters <b>marveling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steady stream of bubbles in a glass of a Champagne. As the popularity of sparkling Champagne grew in London, other European courts began to discover the bubbly curiosity-including the French who had previously despised the bubbles as a wine fault.|$|E

At Verona they tarried again, and wondered much <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great amphitheater, then almost perfect. Cuthbert related to Cnut and the archers how men had there been set to fight while the great stone benches round were thronged with men and women looking on at their death struggles, and said that not unfrequently British captives were brought hither and made to contend in the arena. The honest fellows were full of indignation and horror <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thought of men killing themselves to give sport to others.
