However, inclusion of nonmonetary stakeholder priorities is still uncommon in ecosystem service valuations and disaggregation of stakeholders is all but absent from practice. We look at four site-scale wetland ecosystem service valuations from Asia that used nonmonetary participatory stated preference techniques from a range of stakeholders, and compare these prioritizations to those obtained from the largest <b>monetary</b> <b>assessments</b> available globally, the Ecosystem Service Value Database (ESVD). Stakeholder assessment suggests very different priorities to those from <b>monetary</b> <b>assessments,</b> yet priorities between different sites remained broadly consistent.

Monetary values correlate positively with values held by government officers and business owners, but negatively with fishermen and women who are relying most directly on the wetland ecosystem services.

In Romania the legal framework wherein the payments for ecosystem services shall be implemented has been created by the all three Forest Acts adopted by the Parliament since 1996 and the article highlights the pitfalls of the legal provisions referring to these payments. The key-word of the two law articles referred to by the study is the fair price of the ecosystem services, a price which cannot be captured by the market since such a market doesn’t exist neither in Romania nor in other similar countries. Another important issue we have brought into discussion is the inappropriateness of any system of payments {{in the context of}} illegal cuttings, simply because the opportunity costs that shall be compensated doesn’t exist when illegal cuttings occur.

This study seeks to address this gap in the literature and explores risk disclosures within a sample of 79 UK company annual reports using content analysis. A significant association is found between the number of risk disclosures and company size. Similarly a significant association is found between the number of risk disclosures and level of environmental risk as measured by Innovest EcoValue` 21 ™ Ratings. However, no association is found between the number of risk disclosures and five other measures of risk: gearing ratio, asset cover, quiscore, book to market value of equity and beta factor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a potential <b>monetary</b> <b>assessment</b> of natural habitats {{based on a}} method worked out in 2003 in the Czech Republic. The assessment was prepared for the reclaimed flooded mining pit in Suszec. The analysis was focused on three variants of real and potential habitats from the reclaimed land. Natural values of the flooded mining pit have undergone changes due to afforestation reclamation activities. It has been calculated {{that the value of}} natural habitats expressed in numbers will decrease by 70. 7 % in comparison to the area prior to reclamation, whereas the monetary value of the natural habitats will decrease by 10, 319, 519. 00 PLN. An important element of the assessment includes recognition, diagnosis and evaluation of the actual state of natural habitats by preparing a detailed inventory and determining the most valuable species of plants and animals as well as landscape values. Unfortunately, at present in Poland there is no clear and explicit method of estimating the assessment of lost natural value that would allow approximating the monetary value of a given terrain and determine the most favourable direction of its management. Application of <b>monetary</b> <b>assessment</b> of natural habitats requires its adjustment to Polish conditions. Due to the similarity of climate and geomorphological conditions in Central Europe, it is possible to adopt elements of habitat assessments used in the Czech Republic and in Germany. Natural habitat assessment will provide a solid base for preventing conflicts caused by the needs of economic development at the expense of local protection of the natural environment. As a result, it will be easier to achieve an agreement between different parties in the investment process, and, moreover, the assessment method will prevent additional financial losses, generated during the process of achieving functionality by the habitats. Correct analysis of the values of natural habitats may significantly reduce losses in the natural environment and aid in the selection and choice of the most relevant reclamation method...|$|E

The question arises of which criteria environmental policy decisions ought to be based. This paper suggests economics to help solve environmental problems. This economic approach requires the monetary valuation both of benefits of protecting or enhancing environmental resources and opportunity costs or benefits forgone of alternative uses. Whereas the monetary valuation of costs is not too complicated and therefore not controversial in most cases, the <b>monetary</b> <b>assessment</b> of environment-based benefits requires the application of non-market valuation tools. The comparison of monetary costs and benefits contributes to deciding upon environmental trade-off alternatives.

40|$|In this contribution, {{we focus}} on the {{configuration}} of logistics systems embedded into production processes. To evaluate the dynamic behavior of alternative configurations, Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) proofs helpful. Emphasis is typically put on physical performance measures. However, as configuration decisions have significant financial impact to the firm, an ad-ditional <b>monetary</b> impact <b>assessment</b> is usually performed. This requires cost accounting techniques that appropriately incor-porate system complexity into the financial model. To this end, we propose a novel approach to extend the applicability of DES for configuration problems. The basic idea is to incorporate technical consumption or engineering production functions into Riebel’s Generic Direct Cost Accounting and to add both methods to a standard DES modeling. Consequently, the in-formational value of DES is significantly improved. Misleading decision support can be avoided and insights into the rela-tionship between processes and the value structure are achieved. Both of which contribute towards improved configuration decisions. ...|$|R
