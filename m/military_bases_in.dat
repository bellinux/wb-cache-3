He refused to give {{interviews}} to the British press, preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and performances.

50|$|The <b>military</b> <b>base</b> {{was founded}} <b>in</b> 1956, by the Lebanese army, {{in order to}} govern its forces {{distributed}} in the southern Lebanese region. Since 1948, ground forces such as the Second Artillery Regiment, the Sixth Brigade and an armored regiment, have positioned in its barracks till the mid-1970s. Later, the location where the present <b>military</b> <b>base</b> (<b>in</b> Sidon) was established, constituted of the Officers' club, Banu Barakat <b>military</b> <b>base</b> <b>in</b> Tyre (founded in 1958) and Marjayoun <b>military</b> <b>base</b> <b>in</b> Marjayoun (founded in the early 1940s). In 1982, the Israeli air-strikes destroyed several buildings <b>in</b> the <b>base,</b> however several damaged facilities were later reconstructed.|$|R
5|$|Japan has {{close ties}} to the United States. Since Japan's defeat by the Allies in World War II, the two {{countries}} have maintained close economic and defense relations. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, having <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Japan for partially that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Jewish-American {{soldiers}} {{were assigned to}} the <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Puerto Rico and many choose to stay and live on the island. Large numbers of Jewish immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico in the 1930s as refugees from Nazi occupied Europe. The majority settled in the island's capital, San Juan, where in 1942 they established the first Jewish Community Center of Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|The United States National Weather Service {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Guam as Tropical Storm Saomai approached the island on August 6. <b>Military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> northern Guam entered Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1, meaning that winds of 50 knots or higher were expected within 12hours. The rest of the island was placed under Condition of Readiness 2, meaning that such winds were possible within 24hours. Several bases were temporarily closed.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.|$|E

5|$|Nasser's {{involvement}} in political activity increased throughout his school years, such {{that he only}} attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school. Despite it having the almost unanimous backing of Egypt's political forces, Nasser strongly objected to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty because it stipulated the continued presence of British <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> the country. Nonetheless, political unrest in Egypt declined significantly and Nasser resumed his studies at al-Nahda, where he received his leaving certificate later that year.|$|E
5|$|The BSA {{charters}} two councils for American Scouts living overseas, {{largely on}} <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Europe and Asia. The Transatlantic Council, headquartered in Livorno, Italy, serves BSA units {{in much of}} Europe, and the Far East Council, headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas. The Direct Service branch makes the Scouting movement available to US citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas. The Aloha Council in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E
50|$|Western governments {{generally}} {{refrain from}} significant criticism of Djibouti's press freedom issues. This is possibly {{due to its}} strategic value: Djibouti has proximity to unstable nations like Somalia, Eritrea and Yemen. It {{is also home to}} a French <b>military</b> <b>base</b> and the only permanent US <b>military</b> <b>base</b> <b>in</b> Africa. In March 2016, China said it would establish its first permanent overseas <b>military</b> <b>base</b> <b>in</b> Djibouti.|$|R

5|$|The Soviets, {{wanting to}} {{establish}} permanent <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Angola, tried {{to increase their}} influence, but despite persistent lobbying, especially by G. A. Zverev, the Soviet chargé d'affaires, Neto stood his ground, refusing to allow the construction of permanent military bases. With Alves no longer a possibility, the Soviet Union backed Prime Minister Lopo do Nascimento against Neto for the MPLA's leadership. Neto moved swiftly, getting the party's Central Committee to fire Nascimento from his posts as Prime Minister, Secretary of the Politburo, Director of National Television, and Director of Jornal de Angola. Later that month, the positions of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister were abolished.|$|E

TAF has overseas <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Iraq, Qatar and in Somalia.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky, the Indiana cities of Jeffersonville, New Albany, and Port Fulton saw increased trade and military activity. Some of this increase {{was due to}} Kentucky's desire to stay neutral in the war. In addition, Kentucky was home to many Confederate sympathizers. <b>Military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> southern Indiana were needed to support Union operations against Confederates in Kentucky, and it was safer to store war supplies in towns {{on the north side}} of the River. Jeffersonville served as an important military depot for Union troops heading south. Towards the end of the war, Port Fulton was home to the third-largest hospital in the United States, Jefferson General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{unilateral}} French decision led to {{a censure}} debate in the House of Commons. By 1967, when the French decided {{to withdraw from the}} AFVG programme, the Air Ministry was faced with a dilemma stemming from the imminent prospect of cancelling the F-111K, a decision that was taken in November 1967, to be formalized on 20 March 1968. Up to this point, Britain had spent £2.5 on the AFVG for practically no gains. In order to justify the absence of any new strike aircraft following the failure of multiple projects to develop or procure one, Healey decided to entirely dismantle the requirement for one. Thus, in 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson, alongside Healey, announced that British troops would be withdrawn in 1971 from major <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> South East Asia, the Persian Gulf and the Maldives, collectively known as 'East of Suez'.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the beetle}} became {{established}} near USA <b>military</b> <b>bases</b> <b>in</b> Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread {{by the beginning}} of World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and the beetle is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In East Germany they were known as Amikäfer ('Yankee beetles') following a governmental claim that the beetles were dropped by American planes. In the EU it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not established in any of these Member States, but occasional infestations can occur when, for example, wind blows adults from Russia to Finland.|$|E
