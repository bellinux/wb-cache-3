50|$|Significant {{volcanic}} activity {{took place in}} the Lower Paleozoic in the Malé Karpaty Mts., where the relicts are seen in the rock of the Pernek Group with typical basic volcanism. Large volumes of volcanic rock, considered a product of stratovolcanos, significantly changed by metamorphism, are present in the Gemeric. Basic volcanism is recognized in the Carboniferous and Permian rock. Among the Permian rock the Ipoltica Group of the Hronic nappe is best known. The lower part of the group is called the Malužiná Formation. It is characteristic of synsedimentary dacite to andesite volcanism in the lower part and andesitic-basalts close to the Tholeitic type in the upper part. Nodules of hydrothermal agate are common in the cavities of these rocks, widely known as the <b>melaphyres.</b> According to some authors, Permian volcanism in Hronic has polyphase linear character.|$|R
50|$|The Erdesbach area is geologically {{characterized}} {{mainly by}} the so-called Kusel Strata (Kuseler Schichten in German) of the Lower Rotliegend. These strata {{are made up}} mainly of sandstone, claystone and conglomerates. The basic volcanic rock deposited in between is mainly made up of <b>melaphyre,</b> andesite, tholeiitic basalt and cuselite. The geological structure {{to a great extent}} deﬁnes the shape of the municipal area’s relief.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater Bay (previously, Novaia and New harbor) is an inlet in the U.S. {{state of}} Alaska. It is {{situated}} {{on the eastern shore}} of Chichagof Island, Chatham Strait, in the Alexander Archipelago. Overlying rocks of cherty limestones of Silurian age stand nearly vertically and are over 1000 ft thick. On the northeast side of the bay, a thick series of <b>melaphyre</b> lava flows and tuffs are interstratified with limestone of Upper Devonian age.|$|E
5000|$|Niederwörresbach {{is built}} on {{conglomerates}} from the Upper Rotliegend. This is permeated with igneous rocks such as porphyry and <b>melaphyre.</b> Going eastwards, the material changes over into the Devonian slate that characterizes the Rhenish Massif. Also worth mentioning here are the limonite stones on the [...] "Wart" [...] and a sandstone quarry on the [...] "Klink". To this day, the firm F. L. Juchem & Söhne maintains, among other construction-related operations, a quarry {{along the road to}} Fischbach.|$|E
50|$|After the {{amalgamation}} of Kreimbach and Kaulbach, a new “amalgamated” {{coat of arms}} {{was approved}} bearing charges from both former coats, which had themselves been approved {{less than a decade}} and a half earlier, in 1955 and 1956. The current coat’s composition groups together the wolf charge, the round <b>melaphyre</b> stones and the wave from the old Kaulbach arms, and from the old Kreimbach arms come the Roman castrum (without the palisade and partly in different tinctures) and the two crows.|$|E
50|$|After 1850, a few tanning {{families}} {{moved on}} and rose with new businesses in new locations, sometimes to worldwide importance. After the Rhine-Nahe Railway had been completed, not only leather products could be shipped to market, but so could the <b>melaphyre</b> being quarried at Kirn’s quarries. With {{the rise of}} the brewery near the winery in 1863, the town eventually earned itself the title “Town of Leather, Stones and Beer”. As industry grew, so too did the demand for manpower, and thus between 1850 and 1910, the town’s population swelled from roughly 1,500 to 7,000.|$|E
50|$|In {{early years}} as ingénieur des mines he {{investigated}} and described various new minerals; he proceeded afterward {{to the study}} of rocks, devising new methods for their determination, and giving particular descriptions of <b>melaphyre,</b> arkose, porphyry, syenite, and others. The igneous rocks of the Vosges, and those of the Alps, Corsica, etc., and the subject of metamorphism occupied his attention. He also prepared in 1858 geological and hydrological maps of Paris, with reference to the underground water, similar maps of the départements of the Seine and Seine-et-Marne, and an agronomic map of the Seine-et-Marne (1880), in which he showed the relation that exists between the physical and chemical characters of the soil and the geological structure.|$|E
50|$|Professor Dr. Ernst Christmann {{declared}} that the <b>melaphyre</b> stone west of the village {{on the north side}} of the Kaulbach (brook) has the characteristic of weathering into ever rounder shapes, shedding one layer after another, rather like an onion. The villagers’ forebears called these rounded stones Kaulen or Kulen, or later even Kugelen (resembling the modern German word for “ball” or “sphere”), thus giving the brook its name, a concept reinforced by many of these Kaulen being found on the brookbed. Kaulbach had its ﬁrst documentary mention in 1281 as Culebach. Other forms of the name are also known from the past: Kulbach (1345), Kullebach uff der Lauter (1446), Kaulenbach (1560), Coulbach (1580) and Kaulbach (1824).|$|E
50|$|The Upper Nahe region {{includes}} the westernmost and oldest vineyards on the Nahe. The region {{begins with the}} villages of Martinstein, Monzingen and follows the river to Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg where it meets the Alsenz. The area is noted for its vast diversity of vineyard soils, particularly in the area near Oberhausen where a single vineyard can include soils of sandstone, slate, <b>melaphyre</b> and porphyry. This region of the Nahe was modernized during the Flurbereinigung reforms of the late 20th century and is now characterized by steep, terraced vineyards {{along the banks of}} the Nahe planted mostly with Riesling. The climate of the region gets progressively warmer downstream with low amounts of annual rainfall that is favorable for the production of late harvest wines.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} lies in {{a hollow}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the Haschbach at the western foot of the Remigiusberg in the Western Palatinate, roughly 4 km southeast of Kusel. To the east lies the river Glan, into which the Haschbach ﬂows. The municipality’s elevation is roughly 260 m above sea level. The heights around the municipal area reach 375 m above sea level at the Langenberg to the west and 368 m above sea level at the Remigiusberg, which with its church and Michelsburg castle ruin is said to be a landmark of the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France. Found mainly in the Remigiusberg area are great <b>melaphyre</b> quarries. The municipal area measures 402 ha, of which 14.6 ha is built up and 83 ha is wooded.|$|E
50|$|The Yeti {{also appear}} in the 1995 Missing Adventure Millennial Rites by Craig Hinton, where the {{summoning}} of a creature from the universe to come goes wrong and instead sees the Great Intelligence merged with that entity. This creates an altered London based on contradictory physical laws and populated by demons and sorcerers, forcing altered versions of the Sixth Doctor and his companion Mel (transformed into the Valeyard and a technomancer named <b>Melaphyre)</b> to restore London before the reality tears itself apart. The novel also features the character Anne Travers from The Web of Fear. Millennial Rites follows the New Adventure All-Consuming Fire by Andy Lane, published in 1994, in identifying the Great Intelligence with H. P. Lovecraft's Yog-Sothoth, a being from the universe before this one. The Great Intelligence also appeared in a back-up comic strip in Doctor Who Weekly #31-#34. Yeti robots were also among the monsters to {{appear in the}} 1997 video game Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors.|$|E
50|$|The name “Oberstaufenbach” {{ends in the}} {{syllable}} —bach (German for “brook”), as do {{many other}} placenames in the region. Preﬁxed to this is the syllable stauf—, from the Middle High German word Stouf, deﬁned as “towering rock, comparable to an upended beaker without a bottom”. Historical forms of the name are, among others, Stauffenbach (1377), ober Stauffenbach (1393), Stauffenbach (1430), Oberstauffenbach (1567), Ober Stauffenbach (1593) and Oberstaufenbach (1824). The name is drawn from the former <b>melaphyre</b> deposit north of the village, which has now been quarried away. This towering mountain knoll {{was described as a}} Stouf in earlier times, giving the village part of its name. The brook that ﬂows by here may well have been called the Staufenbach at that time, and hence the name means a brook that ﬂows between stones and cliffs. Over the ages, however, the name Reichenbach came to be applied to the whole brook, a name drawn from the neighbouring village of Reichenbach. The preﬁx Ober— means “upper”, and now distinguishes Oberstaufenbach from nearby Niederstaufenbach.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, the populace earned its {{livelihood}} from farming, although besides working the land, {{there were also}} jobs in crafts. As farming declined, though, so did the old crafts that had been handed down from yore, blacksmith, metalworker, painter, saddler, cooper, shoemaker and tailor. Also worth noting is that within Hüfﬂer’s limits {{until the end of}} the 19th century, up to four collieries were being run for a time. The colliery “Am Berg” mined 8 554 t of coal between 1845 and 1880 with six employees. At the colliery on the Schindelberg, seven miners worked. Up to 1870, they mined 2 373 t of coal. Emperor Napoleon granted the pit on the land “auf der Hub” a certiﬁcate of concession on 1 November 1805. From old documents it is known that until 1879, there was a brewery in Hüfﬂer named “Hornung”. When the schoolhouse was being built in 1963, workers struck a beer cellar hewn in the sandstone. In 1912, stone quarrying was begun at the Am Isack ground, and work continued until the 1950s. The stone in question was intrusive bodies of <b>melaphyre</b> covered in sedimentary deposits such as sandstone, shale and carbonaceous shale. On a ring about 200 to 300 m across running round the intrusive body were once found sandstone quarries. This shows that the hot magma masses were thrust as high as this only in this area, while nearby they settled into layers farther below. When this intrusion happened is still not known. The age of the surrounding Rotliegend layers, however, is known to be roughly 240,000,000 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} lies on {{the river}} Lauter (also called the Waldlauter, to distinguish it from other rivers in German-speaking Europe named Lauter), southeast of the Königsberg in the North Palatine Uplands. Kreimbach {{lies on the}} river’s right bank at an elevation of some 198 m above sea level near where the namesake brook, the Kreimbach, ﬂowing by from the northeast, empties into the Lauter. The ﬂat lands before the slopes leading up the Kreimberg (390 m) and the Kreimbacher Kalmit (408 m) together with the Leisberghügel (hill) are broader than the Kaulbach floodplain on the left bank because {{the lower end of}} the Kreimbach cuts through them, coming from the east. The Kreimberg is “torn up” on its south side by a great hard-stone quarry covering some 44.4 ha. On the heights above the Kaulbach railway station, which has been out of service since late 2000, once lay within Kreimbach’s limits a smaller quarry, one that yielded sandstone, but this was given up even before the First World War. Another, bigger one was to be found on the Winterbach, which was shut down in the 1980s. It was from this pit that the stone for both the local churches was drawn, as well as for the old Kaulbach schoolhouse and, at least for a considerable amount of the work, for the reconstruction of Alexander’s Church (Alexanderskirche) in Zweibrücken after the Second World War. Both Kreimbach’s and Kaulbach’s southern limits touch Kaiserslautern. Above the quarries north of the Kreimbach, spreading across a high plateau, is the Heidenburg (“ Castle”), a prehistoric refuge castle or fortiﬁed living area where a tall lookout tower also stands. Kaulbach lies on the lower reaches of its own namesake brook, the Kaulbach, on the Waldlauter’s left bank. The Waldlauter thus runs between both the main centres, ﬂowing in a great bow as it passes. Kaulbach arose on a rather small ﬂoodplain between the mouth of the Kaulbach and the bank of the Lauter. The geological setting points to long forsaken quarries, a sandstone quarry south of the Kaulbach and to the west a <b>melaphyre</b> quarry. The sedimentary rock was used mainly for building houses, while the volcanic rock was mainly used for building roads and railways. The municipal area measures 904 ha, of which 434 ha is cropland and meadows, 5 ha is open water and 355 ha is wooded. Of the total, 372 ha is Kreimbach’s.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture. which {{originally}} deﬁned Rammelsbach’s commercial life, is nowadays {{of secondary}} importance. Limestone quarrying within Rammelsbach’s limits {{began in the}} village back in the Middle Ages. For a time there were 20 lime kilns and also brickworks, but after the Second World War, limestone quarrying was no longer worth the effort. Only the stone quarries, which had deﬁned the village for a century and still ensured income, still employ a few people even today, while the municipality lets out the 50 ha <b>melaphyre</b> quarry lands to earn money. Given its great importance in the past, the stone industry needs to be described more thoroughly. At {{the time when the}} road was built along the Kuselbach, the hard stone on the Rammelsbacher Kopf, or “Dimpel”, proved itself especially suitable for building roadbeds as far back as 1840. Not least of all for the quarrying and transport of this stone did the Nordpfälzische Eisenbahngesellschaft (“North Palatine Railway Company”) build the Landstuhl-Kusel railway, which opened in 1868. In that same year, the municipality of Rammelsbach concluded an agreement with the railway for using the yield from the quarries. Henceforth, stone would be quarried for railway ballast and crushed stone for roadbuilding, and also for making paving stones. In 1902, more than 900 people were working at the quarry, among them many women, too, who were expected to perform heavy work as surely as the men were. Year, after year, though, as advances came in mechanization, rationalization and automation, the number of quarrymen and quarrywomen shrank. Today, 40 workers can make the same amount of ballast and crushed stone that would have taken 100 workers in bygone years. Making paving stones was also an important activity until the onset of the Second World War. For decades now, however, a company right near the quarry has been making ready-mix concrete. New industries in past decades had to compensate for the potential of the labour force. In 1966, the ﬁrm Grundig set up a plant for making audio- and videotape. When this plant was shut down in the wake of rationalization measures at Grundig, the Japanese company TDK founded a new plant in 1986 that likewise made audio- and videotape, but also ceramic components for electronic devices. Employed at this plant in 2003 were more than 300 workers. However, TDK closed the Rammelsbach plant in March 2003, throwing 320 people out of work. Next came “Ritek Media Europe” (RME), a daughter company of Ritek Corporation Taiwan, which at ﬁrst used the empty factory building to stamp out and package CDs and DVDs, which only employed about 70 people. Since April 2005, this plant has been working with {{only a small fraction of}} its original staff complement, and it now only ships CDs and DVDs that have been made elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was based on}} filtration of the highly aggressive water through the <b>melaphyre</b> bed. The quartz bed was non-reactive reference material. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} ability of the <b>melaphyre</b> to remove aggressive CO 2 during the chemical reaction. It was noted that a decrease of acidity of the filtrate in comparison to the feed and an increase of its alkalinity and pH. It was calculated that until the moment of exhaustion of the de-acidifying properties of the <b>melaphyre,</b> maximum amount of bound CO 2 added to the water was 29. 7 g CO 2 /L of the bed, and maximum amount of the aggressive CO 2 removed from the water was 33. 3 g CO 2 /L of the bed. Regarding very high content of the aggressive CO 2 (116 mg/L average) in the feed only 28. 76 % of this component was subject to transformation into bound and affiliated CO 2 in the filtrate. For the <b>melaphyre</b> bed the CO 2 loss from the experiment system following from desorption was 7. 80 % of the total load of CO 2 added with the feed.

40|$|Variation in {{vegetative}} {{and reproductive}} performance and leaf mineral composition among 25 populations of Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron) from soils derived from six parent materials (limestone, marl, sandstone, greenstone, <b>melaphyre</b> and serpentine) in southwestern Poland has been investigated. The plant size (PS), total le-af area (TLA), leaf shape (LS), number of fruits per plant (NFP), number of seeds per plant (NFP), total weight seed per plant (TWSP) were estimated, and concentrations of seventeen elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Co, Cr, Mo) were analyzed in leaf and soil samples. In soil samples, also soil pH, {{organic matter content}} and sand, silt and clay content were determined. All soils (except <b>melaphyre</b> soil) contained elevated levels of Cr. Concentrations of soil Ni and Zn, Pb, Cd in serpentinite soil and polluted marl soils (respectively) {{were significantly higher than}} those of other examined soils. Meadow saffron leaves from all sites (except marl sites) contained elevated levels of Cr, Co and Ni. Statistical analysis, carried out with principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that a good correlation exists between the element content in leaves and plant performance traits and soil environment. The leaf Ca content and NFP were correlated and were much higher in populations from metal (except Cr) and nutrient-poor marl soils than in those from metal (except Ni in serpentine soil) and nutrient moderate rich soils derived from <b>melaphyre,</b> greenstones, serpentinite, limestones and sandstones and in those from metal-rich and nutrient-poor polluted marl soils. Meadow saffron plants tended to take up higher amounts of N, P, K, Mn, Cu and Na and lower amounts of S and had much higher TLA in populations from sandstone soils than those in populations from serpentinite, <b>melaphyre,</b> greenstone, marl and limestone soils. The leaf Co, Ni, Cr, Mg concentrations were correlated and were much higher in populations from serpentinite, <b>melaphyre,</b> greenstone, polluted marl and limestone soils than those from marl and sandstone soils. The pattern of variation in NFP and TLA across the different soil types was the opposite of that for leaf N, Cu, Na, Ni, Mg and S concentrations. Redundancy analysis (RDA) enables identification of the soil variables that best explain the variance pattern of plant response. The variation explained by the soil variables (15 soil elements and soil pH) was high (79 %). The forward selection of soil variables identified soil Co, Mo, Ni, Ca and Zn concentrations as significantly influencing the ordination plant traits. The variation explained by these selected variables was 55 %. Thus the five soil variables appeared to be the main factors determining the pattern variation of vegetative, reproductive and nutrient traits of Colchicum autumnale...|$|E
