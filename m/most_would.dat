5|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the prokaryotes is unknown, {{but may be}} very large. A May 2016 estimate, {{based on}} laws of scaling from known numbers of species against the size of organism, gives an estimate of perhaps 1 trillion species on the planet, of which <b>most</b> <b>would</b> be microorganisms. Currently, only one-thousandth {{of one percent of}} that total have been described.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% was put to pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the single most important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and <b>most</b> <b>would</b> have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E
5|$|Of the 71 {{words in}} this list, 67 are nouns, and <b>most</b> <b>would</b> {{generally}} be considered loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U {{and are not}} borrowed from another language are qiana, qwerty, and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this list {{are considered to be}} naturalised in English according to at least one major dictionary (see References), often because they refer to concepts or societal roles that do not have an accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words which occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included.|$|E

5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, <b>most</b> <b>would</b> have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|The main armour {{used was}} chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks {{may have been}} made of scales {{attached}} to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a band of metal extending down to protect the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round and made of wood, with reinforcement of metal. Horsemen had changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was a relatively new refinement and was probably not used at Hastings; the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both the infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and <b>most</b> <b>would</b> not have had armour.|$|E
