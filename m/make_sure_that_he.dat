5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster {{in level flight}} than the Japanese fighters they were up against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Barrientos {{went so far}} as to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{descended from}} {{converted}} Jews. However, the research's aim was to establish himself as an old Christian, with the goal of using this evidence to strengthen his ideological position: to defend converted Jews, but to attack unconverted Jews.|$|E
25|$|Ose {{has been}} Tobei's handler for 100 years. He was {{originally}} an angel. He was ordered by Lady Ema to follow Tobei {{in the human}} world as a dog to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn't disrupt {{the order of the}} natural world. He is often mistaken by other people as Tobei's pet.|$|E

The two of them rescue Tim together. Meanwhile, Dick enters an all out brawl with Jason {{which leads to a}} fight on top of Gotham's sky train system. Dick manages to defeat Jason, but the latter falls into Gotham River telling Dick that they'll be meeting soon enough. Dick then returns to the Batcave and assumes the mantle of Batman.|$|E

25|$|His speculations were {{in foreign}} currencies, {{equities}} and derivatives {{and he also}} signed loan agreements with governments not knowing where the funds would be coming from. For example, the majority stake he had bought in a chemical company in Griesheim, Germany returned 15 times his investment after two years when the company became part of I. G. Farben. Part of his attraction for investors were the high dividends Kreuger & Toll paid. Therefore, he also had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had money to pay those dividends.|$|E
25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|Mickey Mouse {{was created}} as a {{replacement}} for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz, a film producer who distributed product through Universal Studios. In the spring of 1928, with the series going strong, Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget. But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract. Angrily, Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch. The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator Ub Iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist, Les Clark, who together with Wilfred Jackson were among the few who remained loyal to Walt. One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owned all rights to the characters produced by his company.|$|E
50|$|Queen Genia (Genialina) {{suffers from}} melancholy. To cheer herself up, she asks her android Trull (a robotic {{engineer}} {{and a powerful}} supercomputer) to construct robots who can invent fairytales for her amusement.

However, Trull <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself is featured {{in every one of}} them.|$|R

I saw him yesterday,' and as {{she gazed}} as if the news were water to a thirsty soul---'he sent his love, and begged his mother and you to forgive the {{distress}} his precipitancy has caused.

50|$|After that, Ziggy, Z.E.R.O., Golden Wing, and Seattlite {{head into}} Metropolis, meet Seattlite's daughter, {{and go into}} Stargazer Great Artist's tower. After he is defeated, the Stargazer hacks the network and <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cannot be rebuilt and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will die human. Finding the tower devoid of any Superstars, they return to Metropolis and find a Superstar named No Future, who had been hiding in Metropolis.|$|R
500|$|The {{attention}} of the FDA triggered belligerent responses from Reich, who called them [...] "HiGS" [...] (hoodlums in government) and the tools of red fascists. He developed a delusion that he had powerful friends in government, including President Eisenhower, who he believed would protect him, and that the U.S. Air Force was flying over Orgonon to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was all right. On 29 July 1952 three inspectors arrived at Orgonon unannounced. Sharaf writes that Reich detested unannounced visitors; he had once chased some people away with a gun just for looking at an adjacent property. He told the inspectors they had to read his work before he would interact with them, and ordered them to leave.|$|E
500|$|In another twist Mercedes {{discovered}} that Silas {{would not be}} put on trial and would instead be put in an institute for the insane. Metcalfe said this left her alter ego feeling [...] "very let down" [...] as a trial would be the opportunity for Mercedes to [...] "tell the world about the terrible things Silas did and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got punished". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes felt like Silas was [...] "getting away with it". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes feared that Silas would escape and explained that Mercedes never recovered from her ordeal but did what she usually did: [...] "put it in a box and tried to forget about it. If Mercedes dwelt on all the bad things she's been through, she'd go crazy. That box must be full now".|$|E
500|$|Late in his life, Alf wrote a {{manuscript}} detailing {{his life story}} which he bequeathed to John. It was Alf's attempt {{to fill in the}} lost years when he had not been in contact with his son, and to explain that it was Julia, and not Alf, who had broken up their marriage. John later commented: [...] "You know, all he wanted was for me to hear his side of the story, which I hadn't heard." [...] By 1976, Alfred was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and Pauline contacted John via Apple Corps to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was aware that his father was dying. John sent a large bouquet of flowers to the hospital and phoned Alf on his deathbed, apologising for his (John's) past behaviour. On 1 April 1976, Alf Lennon died in Brighton.|$|E

500|$|After Kamo {{was arrested}} in Berlin and {{awaiting}} trial, he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity {{so that he would}} be declared unfit to stand trial. To demonstrate his insanity, he refused food, tore his clothes, tore out his hair, attempted to hang himself, slashed his wrists, and ate his own excrement. To <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not faking his condition, German doctors stuck pins under his nails, struck him in the back with a long needle, and burned him with hot irons, but he did not break his act. After all of these tests, the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that [...] "there is no foundation to the belief that [...] is feigning insanity. [...] He is without doubt mentally ill, is incapable of appearing before a court, or of serving sentence. It is extremely doubtful that he can completely recover." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Liz {{thinks she}} may be {{pregnant}} and is horrified when she discovers it is most likely the baby of her ex-boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters).

Nevertheless, she tells Jack that she is ready to have a child and wants to adopt. Kenneth learns of an opportunity to be an NBC page at the Beijing Olympics, however, head page Donny Lawson (Paul Scheer) tries to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not submit his essay on time.

He gives Frank, who has helped him, the prototype copy of the game.|$|E
500|$|Custine, as {{an aristocratic}} general, and his son, an up-and-coming diplomat, seemed natural targets of suspicion. In 1792, after {{spending}} {{part of a}} year in Berlin, the younger Custine found himself under suspicion, despite his careful and circumspect behavior in Berlin: he {{had gone out of}} his way to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> documented and reported any contact with the Prussians, and that all reports of his conversations were carefully and specifically annotated. He wrote to his mother-in-law that, by a miracle, he was not on the list of those to be arrested, and had avoided the September 1792 massacre at the Prison de l'Abbaye. He reported that he feared writing to his wife by the insecure post. [...] He languished in Paris over the winter, but eventually he secured a position in his father's command in the Army of the Rhine, joining that army in Frankfurt. By August 1793, though, following his father's arrest, young Custine found himself proscribed, that is, on the list of suspected royalists. The September Law of Suspects accelerated the son's trial. The chief evidence against him seemed to be a letter he had written to his father the previous spring, suggesting that he resign from the army, and this, as well as other lettersreal and forgedguaranteed his condemnation. He was condemned and guillotined a day later.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} Judge Garrity {{took so long to}} deliver his {{decision}} in this case was because <b>he</b> wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> what <b>he</b> decided was backed up by legal precedent.|$|R

Going aboard alone, Dunlop finds the printing press and the latest stash of money, but is knocked out by Torpedo's men, who lock him into a freezer and then sink the trawler to destroy the evidence. Upon his return to Police HQ, Dave is arrested following a trumped-up accusation by Rosie, who also <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> keeps seeing something red to prevent his escape from prison, though she could not do so {{during the first three}} execution attempts.|$|R

Lawyer Dharma Reddy (Kota) cheats on his client Sekhar and <b>makes</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gets 8-year imprisonment. Madhurima meets Geeta (Tabu) - an investigative journalist. As Madhurima and Geeta unite to get clues, the encounter specialists force Madhurima to commit suicide.|$|R
500|$|... "I Remember Larry" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Hilly Michaels, and {{it tells the}} tale of a {{neighborhood}} bully who, after myriad pranks, is brutally murdered by the narrator. At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, [...] "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands". [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy" [...] tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, {{at the end of the}} song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version was eventually released on the single for [...] "Amish Paradise". Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version. [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover's torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song. Finally, [...] "I'm So Sick of You," [...] a style parody of Elvis Costello in which the singer tells his girlfriend all the things he hates about her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rules of}} the air state that the Pawnee should {{have given way to}} the Phantom which was closing from the right. But it was {{accepted}} that at a closing speed of about [...] the time needed by the Pawnee pilot to assess the situation and execute a manoeuvre was minimal. It was also a requirement of the Phantom pilot to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not collide with the Pawnee but clearly in this accident the lack of time was an element. Also the military aircraft had only just turned on to the heading and with the Pawnee 15° to his left the view may well have been obstructed by the Phantom's canopy frame.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson [...] "Jack" [...] Rourke is a fearless street racer and a mechanic, {{who owns}} a garage in San Francisco. He is indebted to the mob as {{he is unable to}} repay them the money for {{starting}} his business. He attempts to hide, but they manage to locate and kidnap him. After escaping an attempt on his life in a car crusher (his first car, a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S), Jack, in desperation, goes to his former girlfriend and his current business partner Sam Harper at a restaurant in Chinatown. She recommends a way out: a massive illegitimate street racing event named [...] "The Run", which is a 3000-mile (4828km) journey across the continental USA, starting in San Francisco and ending in New York City. Sam manages Jack's $250,000 entrance fee for the race and promises him a 10% cut of the $25 million jackpot, but he has to defeat 210 other racers to win. To complicate things, he is in debt to both the police and the criminal organization, and both want to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never finishes the race.|$|E

His death later on in the story is something The Pigman cannot handle, as this has been one of his greatest friends for a very long time.
