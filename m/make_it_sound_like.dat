Josh Kun of Salon {{noted that the}} remix version, found on the triple box-set Anthology, has [...] "enough brass and string to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a Bacharach-penned ranchero." [...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called the recording an [...] "infectious cumbia [...]" [...] The recording has been released in several compilation albums including, Anthology (1998), Y Sus Inicios, Vol. 1 (2003), Y Sus Inicios, Vol. 2 (2004) and Classic Series, Vol. 1 (2006).|$|E
500|$|For the single's B-side, Lomax {{recorded}} his composition [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You". Produced by Harrison, {{the song was}} also recorded between 24 and 26 June. According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis, the musicians on the track comprised an [...] "ad hoc power trio" [...] of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar, Harrison on lead guitar and [...] "a couple of overdubs", and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated. Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part (played by a studio cleaner) and then manipulated the recording to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the call of an elephant.|$|E
500|$|The mixing {{started at}} Chalice Recording Studios, but moved to Grohl's house as {{engineer}} Alan Moulder {{said it was}} the way [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> your garage." [...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it sounds good on a lousy stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E

Cutting off the voice <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Voice is pre-recorded and Opener is simply switching on and off, like Macgillycuddy in Rough for Radio I, but this isn't the case.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} {{elements from}} various music genres, such as garage rock, punk rock, southern rock, power pop, blues and rockabilly. The recording utilizes a raw lo-fi <b>sound,</b> which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "it was recorded on a telephone". The album also juxtaposes hooks and choruses with highly dissonant guitars and screaming, which {{were compared to}} those of Black Francis of Pixies.|$|R
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony is you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
500|$|While touring on the Clash of the Titans tour {{to promote}} the 1990 studio album Seasons in the Abyss, {{separate}} sections of the Decade of Aggression album were recorded on October 14, 1990, March 8, 1991, and July 13, 1991, however, AllMusic said that Rick Rubin's production [...] "seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> this is all one gig." [...] Although it had a working title of Decade of Decadence, it would be released as Decade of Aggression after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album. It was released through Def American Recordings on October 22, 1991.|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II {{was listed}} at #64 in IGN's list of [...] "Top 100 NES Games". Reviewer Sam Claiborn {{said that the}} game was more {{expansive}} than its predecessor and that it featured many of the good graphics, gameplay, and usage of Middle English. He also noted that [...] "Fabio's bare-breasted likeness smoldering on IronSword's cover art that made this game a smash hit with kids and moms alike". Website GamesRadar praised the game's music, especially the title theme; Brett Elston said it set a serious tone for the game, saying [...] "its heavy, droning beats mix with a fantasy-minded melody that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a funeral dirge in the Shire".|$|E

"As someone who’s {{worked with}} cold-metal Helvetica, I can vouch {{for the fact}} that it’s never looked better...My sole {{criticism}} of the face is its ungainly name, which I’m regrettably certain will limit its visibility and hence its uptake. [...] "Neue Haas Grotesk" [...] <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a second cousin of Akzidenz Grotesk that’s just stumbled in from the hinterlands. But no, it is the rightful heir to the Helvetica throne. It should carry the Helvetica name.|$|R
5000|$|Karlsson has said: [...] "We {{always start}} with the song. We use guitar, piano, and bass lines we don't keep {{to figure out which}} clothes we're going to put on each melody and lyric. I think that's {{different}} than a lot of others in the dance scene. They have a beat they love and then force a top line on top of it. I feel <b>like</b> that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a remix. I'd rather do it our way, it's more fun too." ...|$|R

She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
500|$|Take Me Home {{was written}} in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. [...] "The Swedish-style songwriting: melody first" [...] was {{predominantly}} utilised, according to Time correspondent Douglas Wolk. Savan Kotecha, Yacoub, and Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm, Sweden, developing songs for the album, {{and were able to}} shape melodies around their tones. Kotecha reflected: [...] "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult". In addition, after viewing the international success of [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", the trio conceptualised songs [...] "that kids could play on guitar and cover on YouTube." ...|$|E
500|$|The tenth {{season was}} the second during which Mike Scully served as show runner (he had {{previously}} run the ninth season). As show runner and executive producer, Scully headed the writing staff and oversaw {{all aspects of the}} show's production. However, as he told UltimateTV in January 1999, he did not [...] "make any decisions without the staff's input. We have great staffs in all the departments from animation to writing. So I don't want to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a dictatorship." [...] Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom have praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin has said that he was [...] "quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for" [...] and [...] "a great manager of people". Scully's aim while running The Simpsons was to [...] "not wreck the show". In addition to his role as show runner during the tenth season, he co-wrote the episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday".|$|E

2500|$|... "Baby's in Black" [...] is {{performed}} at a 6/8 time signature with a moderate tempo that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> 3/4 (waltz-time). AMG described the song as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose {{than any previous}} Beatles' song." [...] Musicologist Alan W. Pollack notes that the song is relatively complex in format, with a refrain, bridge, and a guitar solo. He describes the song as having [...] "mishmash" [...] of stylistic elements—among them, [...] "bluesy" [...] chords and country music-inspired vocals.|$|R
2500|$|The show {{features}} a laugh track, something Ullman was hesitant about using. [...] "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate {{things like that}} on a show. But when we played it, it kind of worked. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> you're connecting with people. Comedy has gotten a bit cold lately, and neurotic and depressed. This is a nice BBC One family show. It's not too arch or bleak." [...] All laughter is genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at BBC Radio Theatre.|$|R
500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. views {{her work}} as reflective, pieced {{together}} in one piece [...] "so you can acquire it and hear it." [...] She states, [...] "All that information floats around where we are – the images, the opinions, the discussions, the feelings – they all exist, and I felt someone {{had to do something}} about it because I can't live in this world where we pretend nothing really matters." [...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs. Every bit of music out there that’s making it into the mainstream is really about nothing. I wanted to see if I could write songs about something important and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> nothing. And it kind of worked." [...] Censorship on MTV of [...] "Sunshowers" [...] proved controversial and was again criticised following Kala release [...] "Paper Planes". YouTube's block and subsequent age gating/obscuring of the video for [...] "Born Free" [...] from Maya due to its graphic violence/political subtext was criticised by M.I.A. as hypocritical, citing the Internet channel's streaming of real-life killings.

500|$|After {{having a}} {{potential}} contract with Apollo Records collapse when the label went bankrupt, Biondo and Dale {{decided that she}} should release her own live album. On January 2–3, 1996, the material for Live at Blues Alley was recorded at Blues Alley in Washington, DC. Due to a technical glitch {{on the first night}} of recording, only the second night's recording was usable. (The recording of the first night was eventually restored and released as Nightbird in 2015.) Unhappy with the way she sounded due to a cold, she was reluctant to release the album. She eventually relented, on the condition that the studio track [...] "Oh, Had I a Golden Thread", Cassidy's favorite song, would be included in the release, and that they start working on a follow-up studio album. Her apprehension appeared unfounded as local reviewers and the public responded positively. The Washington Post commented that [...] "she could sing anything— folk, blues, pop, jazz, R, gospel— and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> it was the only music that mattered." [...] The subsequent studio album she worked on was released posthumously as Eva by Heart in 1997. In the liner notes of Eva by Heart, music critic Joel E. Siegel described Cassidy as [...] "one of the greatest voices of her generation." ...|$|E
50|$|Little Man {{is often}} {{overlooked}} and disregarded {{as an independent}} and distinct fell due to its name which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a minor top of its parent fell Skiddaw which in fact lies 1.5 kilometres to the north west. With a topographical prominence of 61 metres, Little Man qualifies comfortably as a Hewitt and Nuttall hill and {{is regarded as a}} separate fell by renowned mountain writers Alfred Wainwright and Bill Birkett. The fell is actually called Little Man on Ordnance Survey maps and by many guide books.|$|R

500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a concept.|$|E
500|$|Thom Jurek, a {{staff writer}} for AllMusic, gave the album a rating of three out of five stars. Jurek gave notice to the album's sound quality, telling readers that it does not [...] "capture the sheer overblown {{intensity}} of the unit in a concert setting," [...] but that it comes closer than one may imagine. Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two-discs sound like it were recorded at one gig, writing [...] "Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> this is all one gig." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne said that it was an [...] "accurate aural snapshots of what it's like {{to be part of a}} crowd craning to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away." [...] Browne also said that [...] "they're perfect examples of the sad current state of the once-proud live rock album." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a star ("Honorable Mention is a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like."), saying, [...] "praise the Lord--I can hardly understand a word they're singing (Hell Awaits)." [...] Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer said that it was regarded as one of the best live albums released by a heavy metal band.|$|E
500|$|Moffat and Vertue became {{interested}} in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 film Atonement. The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. [...] "Cumberbatch", says The Guardian, [...] "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly Aspergerish". Cumberbatch said, [...] "There's a great charge you get from playing him, because {{of the volume of}} words in your head and the speed of thought—you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is {{one step ahead of the}} audience and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him." [...] Piers Wenger, head of drama at BBC Cymru Wales, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as [...] "a dynamic superhero in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police—everyone in fact". Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the pipe with multiple nicotine patches. The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like [...] "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that [...] "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture". Moffat turned the character [...] "more Victorian" [...] in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's [...] "beautiful voice" [...] to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "he's giving a lecture".|$|E
5000|$|These {{calculations}} {{are made}} on Schedule SE: Self-Employment Tax, although that is not readily apparent to novice self-employed taxpayers, owing to the schedule's rather opaque name, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{is part of the}} general federal income tax. Some taxpayers have complained that Schedule SE's title should be changed to something such as [...] "Self-Employment FICA Tax", so that its separateness from the general income tax is apparent, perhaps not realizing that the SE tax is not imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) at all, and that neither SE taxes nor FICA taxes are [...] "income taxes" [...] imposed under Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|R

John Dwyer was familiar with the band's work, and asked him to join when he was looking to expand the lineup of The Ohsees. Dammit's bass playing uncharacteristically involves using an ordinary electric guitar that is fed through an electronic device that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a bass guitar. His method of doing this is intentionally kept a secret. Dammit typically favors Fender Jazzmaster guitars for this task, but in Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion, he is also seen using a blue Italia Mondial without this manipulation, for songs that were not recorded with a bass guitar.|$|R

It's got a heavier guitar than an R&B song, but I think that's what <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Journey."Cain {{said the same thing}} in 1983: We wanted to write {{something}} rhythmic and still have a strong and haunting melody. We needed a main rhythm to run through the synthesizer and Steve Smith designed that kind of drum beat to let everything breathe. It's really a throwback to all of our roots and the Motown sound.
