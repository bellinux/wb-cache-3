40|$|Adjudication {{of complex}} {{criminality}} requires specific {{knowledge of a}} diverse set of complex and technical topics.

Therefore, opinions of experts are necessary to establish the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> a criminal trial. The use of expert opinions raises new questions. One of them is whether the expert may testify directly to the existence or non-existence of a constitutive fact; i. e. the ultimate issues. The basic principle of criminal law is that the judge finds the facts. The ultimate issue-rule derives from this principle that it is not permitted for an expert to express a conclusion on the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue.</b> It is doubtful whether the ultimate issue-rule is recognized as a rule of law in the Netherlands, although several scholars argue it is. I will defend that there is no ultimate issue-rule in the Netherlands and that experts are allowed to and do express their opinions about the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>In</b> my paper I will compare the law of England and the Netherlands and look at the jurisprudence of the High Court of the Netherlands...|$|R

50|$|The {{scheme of}} Chapter 3 of the Act deals with {{admissibility}} of evidence. Evidence which is relevant is generally admissible, and evidence which is irrelevant is inadmissible. Evidence is relevant {{if it is}} evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) {{the assessment of the}} probability of a <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the proceedings. As evidence which is relevant has the capability to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue,</b> it is “probative”. This determination is known as logical relevance. Logical relevance merely requires evidence have a logical connection to the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> issue.But neither s 55 nor s 56 of the Act requires that evidence be probative to a particular degree for it to be admissible. Evidence that is of only some, even slight, probative value will be admissible, just as it is at common law. Therefore, evidence is either relevant or it is not and if the evidence is not relevant then no further question arises about its admissibility. However, logical relevance isn't sufficient to establish the potential admissibility of the evidence and is still possible for the evidence to be inadmissible. This determination is known as ‘legal relevance’ as opposed to logical relevance and sets a demanding test for discretionary exclusion (but one that is not obligatory) where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial. Once the legal relevance of the evidence is established, the exclusionary principles and exceptions to those principles are also to be considered.|$|R

Since authors write in natural language, text mining {{is a great}} natural language processing challenge, which {{is far from being}} solved. We propose an alternative: If authors and editors summarize the <b>main</b> <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> a controlled natural language, text mining will become easier and more powerful. To demonstrate this approach, we use the language Attempto Controlled English (ACE). We define a simple model to capture the main aspects of protein interactions. To evaluate our approach, we collected a dataset of 459 paragraph headings about protein interaction from literature. 56 % of these headings can be represented exactly in ACE and another 23 % partially. These results indicate that our approach is feasible. ...|$|R

Forensic linguists are called in to help a court answer the questions pertaining to application of linguistic knowledge and techniques in the investigation of a crime. This paper addresses, from the perspective of Malaysia, the primary issue of relevancy of forensic linguistic evidence under the Evidence Act 1950. This paper further emphasizes on the issue of admissibility of such evidence in the courtroom to prove the <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the criminal trial.

In the course of each of these transgressive phases sediment layers have been deposited, which constitute the present surface of the polder plain.
