25|$|Productivity is a {{standard}} efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and motion study, predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.|$|E
25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering,</b> logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E

25|$|Todmorden has a Greek Revival {{town hall}} (built 1866–1875) which dominates {{the centre of}} the town. The {{building}} straddles the Walsden Water, a tributary of the River Calder, and was situated in both Lancashire and Yorkshire until the administrative county boundary was moved on 1 January 1888. Designed by John Gibson of Westminster, this imposing building has a northern end which is semi-circular. One interesting external feature of the town hall is the pediment to the front elevation, which reflects the fact that it straddled the boundary as it depicts the main industries of the two counties. The fine carved stonework has two central female figures on a pedestal. The left-hand sculpture represents Lancashire (cotton spinning and weaving industries), and the right-hand one Yorkshire (wool <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>engineering</b> and agriculture).|$|E
