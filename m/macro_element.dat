5000|$|Large {{number of}} crash {{simulations}} use {{a method of}} analysis called the Finite Element Method. The complex problems are solved by dividing a surface into a large but still finite number of elements and determining the motion of these elements over very small periods of time. Another approach to crash simulations is performed by application of <b>Macro</b> <b>Element</b> Method. The difference between two mentioned above methodologies is that the structure in case of <b>Macro</b> <b>Element</b> Method consists of smaller number of elements. The calculation algorithm of structure deformation is based on experimental data rather than calculated from partial differential equations. Pam-Crash started crash simulation and together with LS-DYNA is a software package which is widely used for application of Finite Element Method. This method allows detailed modeling of a structure, but the disadvantage lies in high processing unit requirements and calculation time. The Visual Crash Studio uses <b>Macro</b> <b>Element</b> Methodology. In comparison with FEM it has some modeling and boundary condition limitations but its application does not require advanced computers and the calculation time is incomparably smaller. Two presented methods complement each other. <b>Macro</b> <b>Element</b> Method is useful at early stage of the structure design process while Finite Element Method performs well at its final stages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computationally-effective <b>macro</b> <b>element</b> for predicting the complete shear response of RC deep beams. The element {{stems from a}} three-parameter kinematic theory (3 PKT) for the shear strength and deformation capacity of deep beams under double curvature. The <b>macro</b> <b>element</b> consists of two rotational springs and one transverse spring to simulate the nonlinear flexural and shear behaviour of deep shear spans. The element is applied to two deep beams tested to shear failure under three-point bending. The results are used to study the effect of unsymmetrical shear failures on the pre- and post-peak behaviour of nominally symmetrical members. It is found that the post-peak response is sensitive to the unloading path of the shear resisting mechanisms {{as well as to}} the global roughness of the critical diagonal cracks. Based on these analyses, modifications to the constitutive relationships of the shear mechanisms are proposed, and the <b>macro</b> <b>element</b> is applied to a continuous deep beam.

40|$|The {{computation}} of {{the magnetic}} field in electromagnetic devices - especially rotating electrical machines - usually excludes the effect of eddy currents in the multi-conductor windings. Eddy-current losses are frequently calculated from a magnetic field solution in which the effect of eddy currents is not considered. The aim of this research has been the development of efficient methods to consider the effect of eddy currents in multi-conductor windings accurately within electromagnetic field computation. There are methods, which take the effect of eddy currents on the magnetic field into account in multi-conductor windings but all those approaches have serious drawbacks. Analytical formulations lead to very complicated models while numerical analysis leads to enormously large problem size for many conductors or in small penetration depth cases. The thesis suggests a novel combination of the elimination of inner nodes method with the conventional finite element technique. Based on the magnetic linearity of the winding regions the creation of numerical macro elements is suggested. The Gauss elimination of the nodes inside the finite element model of the multi conductor winding resulted in significantly decreased problem size and in accelerated solution {{of the system of}} equations in the nonlinear iteration process.
