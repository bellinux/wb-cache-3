5000|$|The {{plant is}} {{extensively}} cultivated in India {{in order to}} make the morindone dye sold under the trade name [...] "Suranji". Morindone is used for the dyeing of cotton, silk and wool in shades of red, chocolate or purple. The colouring matter is found principally in the root bark and is collected when the plants reach three to four years of age. If the trees are allowed to mature then hardly any colouring substance remains. The small roots yield the most dye and those above about 1 cm diameter are discarded. The active substance is extracted as the glucoside known as morindin that upon hydrolysis produces the dye. Morindone is a <b>mordant</b> <b>dye</b> giving a yellowish-red colour with an aluminium mordant, chocolate with a chromium mordant, and dull purple to black with an iron mordant.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{in case of}} henna leaves dyed fabric, good {{levelness}} {{was found}} when no mordant was used, as the average ΔE value was found 0.21. But except the ferrous sulphate <b>mordanted</b> <b>dyed</b> sample, all the <b>mordanted</b> <b>dyed</b> samples showed the average ΔE value within 0.21 – 0.50 range i.e., good levelness. For ferrous sulphate <b>mordanted</b> <b>dyed</b> sample the average ΔE value was found highest (0.53). It {{can be interpreted as}} sample of poor levelness quality i.e., showing some kind of apparent unlevelness. Thus among the <b>mordanted</b> samples <b>dyed</b> with henna leaves extracts, the order of levelness found was: alum (0.27) > tin (0.28) > alum–tin (0.31) > ferrous sulphate–alum (0.33) > ferrous sulphate–alum–tin (0.38) > ferrous sulphate (0.53).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kinetics of {{destruction}} of acid and mordant dyes in Fenton reaction was {{investigated by the}} use of spectral method. Inhibition {{of destruction}} of some mordant dyes was observed. A simple theory for describing this phenomenon was proposed, which is based on consideration of participation of iron ions in complex formation with <b>mordant</b> <b>dye</b> ligands. By the use of chemical software JChem (ChemAxon) it was found that <b>mordant</b> <b>dye</b> exhibiting stability in Fenton solution bears hydroxyl group with high dissociation constant, pK= 2, 57. On the contrary, another dye bearing hydroxyl with low dissociation constant, pK 1 = 6, 65, does not exhibit any inhibition in oxidation process. UV-Vis spectral studies of the complexes of several mordant dyes prove correlations with their stability in Fenton reaction, however some dyes exhibit no relationship of this kind...|$|E
30|$|With this background, {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the degradation behaviors of the major coloring compounds of three different natural dye plants by thermally degrading them in 100 °C oven and analyzing the concentration of dye using a high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector and a mass selective detector (HPLC-DAD-MS). The plant dyes of interest were Phellodendron bark (hwangbek), madder, and indigo, and the investigation was conducted on their major coloring compounds- berberine and palmatine of Phellodendron bark, alizarin and purpurin of madder, and indigotin and indirubin of indigo plant. Coloring compounds of these dye plants were selected since the three dye plants represent the major dyes of the past which dyed fabrics into yellow, red, and blue colors, respectively. The three dye plants differ also in their dyeing mechanisms. Phellodendron bark is the most representative basic dye among the natural plant dye, madder is the most representative <b>mordant</b> <b>dye,</b> and indigo is the most representative vat dye.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to explore and}} utilize fresh mangosteen peel as an upcoming raw material {{for the production of}} natural dyes. The extract of fresh mangosteen peel is tested on cotton fabric by using alum as mordanting agent which processed by pre mordant dyeing procedure and fixation using 3 (three) different types of fixer. To obtain optimum interaction of fabric, <b>mordant,</b> <b>dye</b> and fixer, washing procedure has been performed using Turkish Red Oil (TRO) before mordanting stage with varying washing time and repeated dyeing procedure with varying frequency of dyeing. As a result, the application of pre mordanting dyeing method and fixation using iron (II) sulphate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O), alum (KAI (SO 4) 2. 12 H 2 O) and lime (CaO), produced very good color from  mangosteen peel dyes extract. Cotton fabric that has been through the pre-mordanting dyeing procedure using dyes extract of mangosteen peel consecutively bring green, light brown, and dark brown color each on the fixation result using iron (II) sulfate, alum, and lime. Preliminary evaluation and instrumentation allows us to determine whether the application of washing time varies, the repeated frequency of immersion, and the use of different fixer compound using dyes extract with similar concentration and dyeing procedure affect the color intensity of the fabric sample...|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{among the}} fabrics dyed {{with the three}} {{vegetable}} dyes, the noticeable trend found was unmordanted dyed sample showed better levelness than <b>mordanted</b> <b>dyed</b> samples and among the mardanted samples the levelness quality was comparatively better in case of alum <b>mordanted</b> <b>dyed</b> samples and the average ΔE value was found increased gradually when moved from alum to tin and finally to ferrous sulphate.|$|R

30|$|The mordant {{and methods}} of {{mordanting}} showed the significant variation in colour strength (K/S) of the dyed fabrics. The dye, mordants, methods, interaction of dye × <b>mordant,</b> <b>dye</b> × method, mordant × method and dye × mordant × method showed {{a significant effect on}} colour strength of the dyed fabrics. Among the selected fabrics, maximum colour strength values (K/S) 0.739 and 0.736 were recorded in pashmina fabric using Salix alba and Populus deltoides in post-mordanting method (Fig.  1 a, b), whereas, the lowest value (0.662) was recorded with Salix alba in simultaneous mordanting, highest colour strength (0.689) was recorded in wool fabric with Salix alba in post-mordanting and lowest value (0.602) was recorded with Populus deltoides in simultaneous mordanting. Cotton fabric does not show much affinity for the dye, mordant and their combinations. Silk fabric exhibited the highest value of 0.695 with Populus deltoides in post-mordanting (Fig.  2 b), while the lowest value (0.555) was recorded with Salix alba in pre- and post-mordanting (Fig.  2 a). The pashmina fabric recorded the maximum K/S value followed by the wool, silk and cotton fabrics. The mordants used in combination with the dyes and in isolation showed a significant change in the colour strength of the fabrics as per the type of the fabrics and method adopted. However, unmordanted samples also showed fair K/S values for each fabric and method. The relative colour strength followed the similar trend and altered as per the efficiency in the K/S of the dyed fabrics in different methods (Fig.  2 a, b; Fig. 3 a, b). The lower values of the colour strength of the cotton fabric can be related to the unsaturated moiety of the natural dyes bearing ionizable hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. Cotton by its nature is negatively charged in water, thus exhibiting poor absorption for natural dyes due to the repulsion effect which causes lower colour strength of the dye on the fabric (Kampeerapappun et al. 2010).|$|E

30|$|At present, {{customers}} are more conscious {{about the quality}} of clothing items. As a result, it becomes more challenging for the manufacturers to maintain the consistent dyeing quality. Unlevelness is generally unaccepted in commercial dyeing, except some cases such as stone-washed, acid-washed or pigment-dyed textiles. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the color levelness quality of fabric dyed with vegetable dyes. For this purpose, dyeing was carried out on silk fabric with the aqueous extracts of mango, guava and henna leaves. Then the levelness of colored fabric was evaluated by spectrophotometric measurements in terms of color difference, ∆E value. It was concluded that unmordanted dyed samples have better color levelness quality than the mordanted ones.
