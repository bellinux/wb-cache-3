5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a <b>mercury</b> <b>thermometer</b> since at least {{as far back as the}} late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype.|$|E

[...] Benjamin Franklin suspended a <b>mercury</b> <b>thermometer</b> from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf stream in the late eighteenth century. [...] SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface. [...] The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963. [...] These observations have a warm bias of around [...] due to the heat of the engine room. [...] This bias has led to changes in the [...] perception of global warming since 2000. [...] Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of [...] Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night. Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. [...] These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. [...] A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). [...] Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Niño phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|The coldest {{location}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{is not in the}} Arctic, but rather in the interior of Russia's Far East, in the upper-right quadrant of the maps. [...] This is due to the region's continental climate, far from the moderating influence of the ocean, and to the valleys in the region that can trap cold, dense air and create strong temperature inversions, where the temperature increases, rather than decreases, with height (Serreze and Barry, 2005). [...] The lowest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere is the subject of controversy, due to the type of instrumentation used. These temperatures were measured by spirit thermometer, which is less accurate than a <b>mercury</b> <b>thermometer.</b> [...] Measurement by spirit (alcohol) thermometers must be corrected (usually the correction is positive, being about 0.2°C, but it is not so simple). According to [...] "Climate of the USSR, issue 24, part I, Leningrad, 1956," [...] the coldest temperature of −67.7°C (−90°F) occurred in Oymyakon on 6 February 1933, as well as in Verkhoyansk on 5 and 7 February 1892, respectively.
