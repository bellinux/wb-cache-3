5000|$|The {{military}} chocolate had {{the official}} designation [...] "emergency rations" [...] (Notportion or ration de secours or razione <b>di</b> <b>soccorso</b> or raziun da reserva) in the Swiss army. It was black dark chocolate. It was packed in two white cardboard boxes, these cardboard boxes {{were covered with}} a transparent plastic film. They were {{about the size of}} a cigarette box. The two cardboard boxes were connected but could easily be separated by a perforation. This military chocolate was produced by several companies, e.g. From Villars-Maitre-Chocolatier or Chocolat Stella.For decades the military chocolate has been part of the basic rations for Swiss soldiers. In addition to the Military Biscuit, it is popular for schoolchildren who receive them from soldiers. The military chocolate thus achieved a certain cult status.|$|R

40|$|Il saggio rilegge il famoso scontro oratorio fra Marc’Antonio e Bruto (III. ii) nel Julius Caesar di William Shakespeare come un conflitto fra modi e mezzi della comunicazione assai diversi fra loro. Alla luce della teoria della “rimediazione” (Bolter e Grusin) si interpreta il palcoscenico elisabettiano come un ambiente “ipermediato” in cui <b>mezzi</b> <b>di</b> comunicazione diversi (qui l'oratoria classica e il teatro) vengono rappresentati in lotta fra di loro per conquistare il predominio e la fiducia del pubblico esibendo diversi gradi di vicinanza al vero. This essay {{argues that}} Shakespeare's Julius Caesar puts on stage the {{different}} media through which narration {{and in particular}} historical narration can be articulated, it shows how historical discourse comes to be built, with more or less success, by older and newer media and how these media enter in competition among themselves to win the audience’s trust. The argument is made through a close analysis of the rhetorical contest between Brutus and Antony (III. 2), where we witness a conflict between two different means of communication, namely classic Ars Oratoria (in the person of Brutus) and Theatre (in the person of Antony). Both are considered as media here since they are specific technologies of communication with their own established rule...|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} founded in March of 1895 when two Italian {{societies}} in Asunción (Società Italiana <b>di</b> Mutuo <b>Soccorso</b> and Società Femminile di Beneficienza Margherita di Savoia) decided to create a school for their descendants {{in the downtown area}} of Asunción, in the streets of 15 de Agosto and Estrella. The school was recognized by the Ministry of Education in 1909, and in 1929 the school moved to its current location in the streets of Alberdi and Humaitá, in the neighbourhood of La Encarnación. In 1981 the school inaugurated a second campus in the city of Fernando de la Mora.|$|R
50|$|There {{were more}} than 40,000 Catholic Italians in Istanbul {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, a figure which not only {{included}} the descendants of the local Genoese and Venetian merchants who lived here since the Byzantine and early Ottoman periods, but also the numerous Italian workers and artisans who came to the city from Italy during the 19th century. Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini came to Constantinople in 1832, and again in 1833. Garibaldi lived in Beyoğlu and taught Italian, French and Mathematics in the foreign schools of this district. Garibaldi also established the Società Operaia Italiana <b>di</b> Mutuo <b>Soccorso</b> on May 17, 1863, in Beyoğlu, and became its first President (Mazzini was the second President). The Società Operaia Italiana <b>di</b> Mutuo <b>Soccorso</b> is still active and is located in its original site, on a side street of İstiklal Avenue. The number of Istanbul's Italians decreased after the end of the Ottoman Empire for several reasons. The Turkish Republic no longer recognized the trade privileges that were given to the descendants of the Genoese and Venetian merchants, and foreigners were no longer allowed to work in Turkey in a wide number of sectors, including many artisanships, in which numerous Istanbulite Italians used to work. The Varlık Vergisi (Wealth Tax) of the World War II years, which imposed higher tariffs on non-Muslims and foreigners in Turkey, also played an important role in the migration of Istanbul's Italians to Italy - who still live in the city, but in far fewer numbers when compared with the early 20th century. The influence of the Italian community of Istanbul, however, is still visible in the architecture of many quarters, particularly Galata, Beyoğlu and Nişantaşı.|$|R

Meanwhile, some handicraft shops had become larger and were turned into factories that employed hundreds of workers: for instance, nail blacksmiths became big managers and started producing iron beds and furniture that were sold even abroad, so that San Giovanni in Persiceto merited the name of little Manchester of the Emilia. Over the last decades of the Ottocento public education was expanded, the traditional classical education was substituted by a technical school, the Società <b>di</b> mutuo <b>soccorso</b> (Company for mutual aid) among handicraft and factory workers was founded; during Carnival in 1874 the first fancy dress convoys were held, in 1876 the Società ginnastica Persicetana (Gymnastical Society of Persiceto); in 1877 the Cassa di Risparmio was {{opened to the public}} and ten years later the railway track between Bologna and the Persiceto of the railroad Bologna/Verona was opened.|$|R

The morphological configuration and the figurative contents of each chapel require a specific analysis addressing the four thematic layers of geometry, perspective, painted architecture and landscape. The buildings stress the relationship with the landscape in an original interpretation of perspective-based composition and painted decoration (the baroque quadratura), which conceals the shapes of the chapels’ interior. The aim of this study, part of a national search started in 2013 about illusory perspective in architecture, identifies the workflow to describe the perspectival geometries of the chapel entitled The Jesus' dispute with the doctors in the Temple, an application of painted perspective to the octagonal shape of the building to improve the perception of the space...|$|R
40|$|La formazione rappresenta uno strumento basilare nella promozione della lingua e della cultura italiana. L’argomento è articolato e complesso perché abbraccia diverse questioni. Da un lato va sostenuto l’utilizzo <b>di</b> <b>mezzi</b> adeguati, come quello telematico, che favoriscono e facilitano la diffusione all’estero. Dall’altro la proposta didattica di università e scuole deve essere riorganizzata alla luce delle nuove esigenze formative. Il ruolo degli atenei italiani potrebbe diventare più incisivo se si adeguassero maggiormente agli {{standard}} esteri, in modo da favorire la circolazione di studenti anche verso e non soltanto dall’Italia. Per quanto riguarda, invece, il tipo di formazione da sostenere, va riqualificata quella umanistica e tradizionale, non perché rappresenti la cultura nella sua totalità ma perché costituisce un patrimonio che caratterizza il nostro paese e non deve andare perso. Abbiamo parlato di queste tematiche con il Professor Roberto Greci, Preside della Facoltà di Lettere e Filosofia dell’Università di Parma e Presidente del Consiglio scientifico e didattico del Consorzio Interuniversitario ICoN, Italian Culture On the Net.     The role {{of training}} in the promotion of Italian language and culture. An interview with Professor Roberto Greci, Dean of the Literature and Philosophy Faculty at the University of Parma   Training represents a basic tool in promoting Italian language and culture.   The topic is complex because it encompasses diverse issues.   On the one hand appropriate means are needed, like telematic resources, which encourage and facilitate spreading abroad.   On the other, university and school courses need to be reorganized {{in light of the}} new training needs.   The role of Italian universities could to be stronger if they met foreign standards, to promote the circulation of students towards and not just away from Italy.   As far as regards the type of training to be undertaken, the humanistic, traditional approach needs to be requalified, not because it represents culture in its entirety but because it is a patrimony which characterizes ou country and should not be lost.   We talked about these topics with Professor Roberto Greci, Dean of the Literature and Philosophy Faculty at the University of Parma and President of the Scientific and Didactic Committee of the inter-university Consortium ICoN, Italian Culture On the Net. </p...|$|R
