5000|$|The {{algorithm}} {{requires the}} use of unique IDs (UID) for each process. The algorithm works in phases and sends its UID out in both directions. The message goes out a distance of 2Phase Number hops and then the <b>message</b> <b>heads</b> back to the originating process. While the <b>messages</b> are <b>heading</b> [...] "out" [...] each receiving process will compare the incoming UID to its own. If the UID is greater than its own UID then it will continue the message on. Otherwise if the UID is less than its own UID, it will not pass the information on. At the end of a phase, a process can determine if it will send out messages in the next round by if it received both of its incoming messages. Phases continue until a process receives both of its out messages, from both of its neighbors. At this time the process knows it is the largest UID in the ring and declares itself the leader.|$|R

"We {{have the}} {{opportunity}} with these beloved characters who have struggled together and who have loved together and who are exploring sexuality together to reach an audience that doesn't {{really want to be}} preached to, but wants to feel it." [...] — Executive Producer Wendy Riche on reaching young viewers. The couple also influenced viewers with their decision to abstain from sex. Executive producer at the time Wendy Riche explained her intent on showing the decisions about sex that teenagers are faced with, such as {{whether or not they are}} ready and using protection. Riche added that Elizabeth would portray the pressure young girls typically feel about agreeing to having sex. The characters were normal and relatable, making them a good choice to try to reach young viewers with a social <b>message.</b> <b>Head</b> writer at the time Robert Guza, Jr. explained to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "They are young people, but they are old beyond their age - very wise souls. (...) It's not like these are street kids who are irresponsible and deeply, deeply in love with each other. (...) What happens when you take a couple like that who are so connected and you bring up the question of sexuality as opposed to a couple who weren't as connected and would be talking to other people and pretending one thing to each other and something else with somebody else. That's not this dynamic at all. Liz and Lucky don't play games with one another." [...] Jackson spoke on the message of abstinence, stating he felt that viewers should not make decisions based on what television characters do, but that he hoped the story would encourage young viewers to discuss sex with their parents more, and to understand that they have options.|$|R
5000|$|Anan (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: [...] ) was a Babylonian amora of {{the third}} century, disciple of Mar Samuel (Yebamot 83b, Ḳiddushin 39a), and {{contemporary}} of Rav Huna and Mar 'Uḳba II. (Ketubot 69a). Anecdote and legend combine to illustrate Anan's renown for extreme conscientiousness {{in his capacity as}} judge in civil cases, as well as for his theosophic speculations. The book Tanna Devei Eliyahu ("Seder Eliyahu Rabbah" [...] and [...] "Seder Eliyahu Zuṭṭa") {{is said to have been}} composed during visitations Anan received from the prophet Elijah (Ketubot 106a). Anan was prominent as a teacher of civil law and of ritual; and though Rav Nachman once criticized one of his arguments — remarking, [...] "While attending Mar Samuel, you must have spent your time in playing at checkers" [...] (or [...] "chess," [...] Iskundré, Ḳiddushin 21b) — he highly respected him, and addressed him with the title of Mar ("Master," [...] Ḥullin 56a). Rav Huna, on his part, did not consider Anan his equal; and when the latter once addressed to him a <b>message,</b> <b>headed,</b> [...] "To Huna, our colleague, greetings," [...] he felt himself depreciated and replied in a manner that embarrassed Anan (Ketubot 69a). In the field of the Aggadah, Anan rarely appears, and then only as the transmitter of observations of his predecessors. But many of his teachings were probably incorporated with those of the students of the school that bore his name, Debe Rab Anan (Sukkah 49b; 'Erubin 54b). In addition to the above, he is also mentioned in Berakhot 30b; Shabbat 119a; Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat iii. 5c (compare Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 37a); Erubin 74b; Yebamot 97a; Jerusalem Talmud Yebamot ix. 10b; Ketubot 79a; Giṭṭin 44b; Shevu'ot, 40b; Ḥullin 4b, 38a; among other places.|$|R
