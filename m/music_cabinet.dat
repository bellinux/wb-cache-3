40|$|Jon Banks ‘Una povera fanciulla Tedesca’: the dulcimer {{player in}} Filippo Bonanni’s Gabinetto armonico Filippo Bonanni’s Gabinetto armonico (1722) {{was in its}} time the most {{extensive}} collection of musical iconography ever published. This article locates the work {{at the intersection of}} a number of traditions of representing music, including <b>music</b> treatises, <b>cabinets</b> of curiosities and virtual paper museums. Other non-musical sources with which Bonanni was clearly familiar are also taken into account, including travel writings and in particular the collection of Turkish costume illustrations published by Charles de Ferriol in 1714. This latter is proposed as a possible model for the unusual format of the Gabinetto, whereby each instrument is illustrated as part of a full-length portrait of a player. This procedure is wholly original in a book about music and its implications are explored in the reading of one particular image, that of a woman playing a dulcimer, which Bonanni calls ‘Salterio Tedesco’. The image is unusual first because the player is a woman and second because the accompanying text states that she was a poor vagrant, in marked distinction to other accounts of the instrument that stress its aristocratic and virtuosic nature. Bonanni’s claim that this person could be seen on the streets of Rome in his own time is unique in the Gabinetto and his credibility as an eye-witness is discussed, along with what his depiction reveals of his own attitude towards her...|$|R

This was performed in October 2010 at Snape Maltings. An album of this <b>music,</b> The Sea <b>Cabinet,</b> was released in May 2013 and launched {{in a series of}} concerts from 23 to 26 May at Wilton's Music Hall in London's East End. In a review of the album launch, The Guardians jazz critic John Fordham said that [...] "Herbert's imaginative narrative, and her casually commanding voice– whether softly nuanced as confiding speech or at full soaring-contralto stretch– were the central characters in an entertaining and often moving show that opens a new chapter in her creative story". Michal Boncza, in a review for the Morning Star of musical performances in 2013, [...] described it as a [...] "stand-out", admiring [...] "a voice that can effortlessly render any emotion with commanding ease. Every song is an impressively crafted and engrossing vignette of life's more difficult moments and they grab the attention time and again".|$|R

Describing a sheet <b>music</b> <b>cabinet,</b> Solo said, [...] "This piece is a very exciting piece of furniture. It was done by Gustav Stickley. It's a very early Gustav Stickley stamp, about 1903, 1904, right in there. But what's really interesting about this piece of furniture, what really is exciting about this piece of furniture, {{is the fact that}} it was designed by Harvey Ellis. And Harvey Ellis only worked for Gustav Stickley for about seven or eight months. He died in 1904, and this is one of the pieces that he produced. It has everything going on with it that you would like in a piece of Gustav Stickley- Harvey Ellis furniture." [...] The view of Ellis as designing the [...] "golden age" [...] of Stickley furniture is widespread. During Ellis' tenure, Craftsman designs showed a [...] "lighter note" [...] than later [...] "blunt, straightforward, and unadorned" [...] pieces after his death. A signature feature of the Ellis period is the use of purely decorative inlays, that disappear afterwards. He also introduced curved lower edges to horizontal rails that visually lightened Stickley's earlier designs. This [...] "light touch" [...] has been described as the influence of both Voysey and Mackintosh.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last two}} decades of the 19th century saw a revival of {{interest}} in Bach's organ music in France. There were public concerts on the new Cavaillé-Colle organ in the concert hall or Salle des Fêtes of the old Palais du Trocadéro, built for the third Paris exhibition in 1878. Organized by the organist Alexandre Guilmant, a pupil of Lemmens, in conjunction with Eugène Gigout, these started as six free concerts during the exhibition. Attracting huge crowds—the concert hall could seat 5,000 with sometimes an extra 2,000 standing—the concerts continued until {{the turn of the}} century. Guilmant programmed primarily the organ music of the two composers whom he referred to as [...] "musical giants", Bach and Handel, still mostly unknown to these mass audiences, as well as the works of older masters such as Buxtehude and Frescobaldi. The St Anne prelude and fugue featured in the concerts, Saint-Saëns playing it in one of the first in 1879 and Guilmant again in 1899, in a special concert to mark the twentieth anniversary of the series. The concerts represented a new fin de siècle cult of Bach in France. It was not without its detractors: the music critic Camille Bellaigue (1858-1930) described Bach in 1888 as a [...] "first-rate bore": Of all the great musicians, the greatest, that is to say he without whom music itself would not exist, the founder, the patriarch, the Abraham, the Noah, the Adam of music, Johann Sebastian Bach, is the most tedious. ... How many times, crushed under these four-square merciless rhythms, lost amid this algebra of sound, this living geometry, smothered by the answers of these interminable fugues, one wants to close one's ears to this prodigious counterpoint ... The chorale preludes of Bach were late to enter the French organ repertoire. César Franck, although only known to have performed one work by Bach in public, often set chorale preludes (BWV 622 and BWV 656) as examination pieces at the Conservatoire de Paris in the 1870s and 1880s. It was Charles-Marie Widor, Franck's successor on his death in 1890, who introduced the chorale preludes as a fundamental part of organ teaching there, where Bach's other organ works already provided the foundation stone.Widor believed that the music of Bach represented the emotion of the infinite and exalted, for which words are an inadequate expression, and which can find proper utterence only in art ... it tunes the soul to a state in which we can grasp the truth and oneness of things, and rise above everything that is paltry, everything that divides us. Unlike Saint-Saëns and his own teacher Lemmens, Widor had no objection to playing Bach organ music because of its Lutheran associations: [...] "What speaks through his works is pure religious emotion; and this is one and the same in all men, in spite of the national and religious partitions in which we are born and bred." [...] His student, the blind composer and organist, Louis Vierne later recalled: At the reopening of the class at the beginning of 1892, there occurred an event of considerable importance to our artistic development. I mean the discovery of Bach's chorale preludes. I mean [...] "discovery", and this is not an exaggeration, as you may judge for yourselves. At the first class in performance, Widor remarked with some surprise that since his arrival at the Conservatoire not one of us had brought in one of the celebrated chorales. For my part I was acquainted with three of them, published in Braille for the edition Franck had prepared for our school. They had seemed to me to have no technical difficulties and I had paid no further attention to them. My classmates did not even know that they existed. On looking through the <b>music</b> <b>cabinet</b> where there were several books in the Richault edition, we discovered three volumes, two of preludes and fugues and one of chorale preludes, the latter completely untouched, its leaves uncut. The Maître spent the entire class playing these pieces to us, and we were bowled over. The most overwhelming parts of the giant's organ works were suddenly revealed to us. We set to work on them at once, and for three months nothing else was heard in class. We all played chorale preludes at the examination in January, and the surprise of the jury was no less great than our own had been. Upon leaving the hall I heard Ambroise Thomas remark to Widor, [...] "What music! Why didn't I know about that forty years ago? It ought to be the Bible of all musicians, and especially of organists.|$|E
