25|$|After the war, LADA {{was run by}} a War Office {{department}} {{known as}} Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). ADGB {{was responsible for the}} defence of the entire British Isles during the 1920s and 30s. LADA became the Metropolitan Area, and ADGB expanded on Ashmore's system to deal with longer ranged and faster moving aircraft. Coloured markers matched coloured areas on a sector clock <b>marking</b> <b>off</b> five-minute intervals. As plots were called in, the plotters used markers with the colour pointed to by the clock, which produced multi-coloured paths of markers on the table making easily followed tracks; the freshness of the information could be determined the colour of the latest marker. An identical system was later set up in The Midlands.|$|E
500|$|... "Live Forever" [...] {{is in the}} key of G major (varispeeded up by {{less than}} half a semitone during mixing) and is based on a G–D–Am7–C–D chord progression, with the G chord {{becoming}} an Em during the pre-chorus, though the key changes to A minor following the last chorus. The song has no proper distinction between the verses or chorus section (with only a falsetto refrain of [...] "You and I are gonna live forever" [...] <b>marking</b> <b>off</b> sections), and the vocal melody only consists of a few notes. The simplistic arrangement of the song [...] "meant the song never resolved". Guitarist Paul Arthurs said, [...] "for me that song could keep going." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, Gordon {{was sent}} to {{delineate}} the frontier between Ottoman Armenia and Russian Armenia, the highlight of which was tobogganing down Mount Ararat. Gordon continued surveying, <b>marking</b> <b>off</b> the boundary into Asia Minor. During his time in Armenia, Gordon embraced the new technology of the camera to take what the Canadian historian C. Brad Faught called a series of [...] "evocative photographs" [...] {{of the people and}} landscape of Armenia. Throughout his life, Gordon was always a keen amateur photographer and was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society to honor him for his Armenian photographs. Gordon returned to Britain in late 1858, and was appointed as an instructor at Chatham. He was promoted to captain on 1 April 1859.|$|E
2500|$|Places {{of public}} {{entertainment}} are closed throughout Israel {{in recognition of}} the day. [...] Public commemoration of Yom HaShoah usually includes religious elements such as the recitation of Psalms, memorial prayers, and kaddish, and the lighting of memorial candles. [...] In Israel, the most notable observances are the State memorial ceremony at Yad Vashem and the sirens <b>marking</b> <b>off</b> a two-minute silence at 10:00 am. [...] Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jews generally participate in such public observances along with secular Jews and Jews who adhere to more liberal religious movements. [...] Outside Israel, Jewish communities observe Yom HaShoah in addition to or instead of their countries' Holocaust Memorial Days. Probably the most notable commemoration is the March of the Living, held at the site of Auschwitz-Birkenau, attended by Jews {{from all parts of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{references}} to the theatre throughout Resnais's filmmaking (Marienbad, Muriel, Stavisky, Mon oncle d'Amérique), but he first undertook the challenge of taking a complete stage work and giving it new cinematic life in Mélo (1986), an adaptation of Henri Bernstein's 1929 play of the same name. Resnais remained entirely faithful to the play (apart from shortening it) and he emphasised its theatricality by filming in long takes on large sets of evidently artificial design, {{as well as by}} <b>marking</b> <b>off</b> the acts of the play with the fall of a curtain. After an excursion into the world of comic books and cartoons in I Want to Go Home (1989), an ambitious theatrical adaptation followed with the diptych of Smoking/No Smoking (1993). Resnais, having admired the plays of Alan Ayckbourn for many years, chose to adapt what appeared the most intractable of them, Intimate Exchanges, a series of eight interlinked plays which follow the consequences of a casual choice to sixteen possible endings. Resnais slightly reduced the number of permuted endings and compressed the plays into two films, each having a common starting point, and to be seen in any order. Sabine Azéma and Pierre Arditi played all the parts, and the theatricality of the undertaking was again emphasised by the studio set designs for a fictional English village. Resnais returned to Ayckbourn in the following decade for his adaptation of Private Fears in Public Places to which he gave the film title of Cœurs (2006). Among the stage/film effects which contribute to its mood of [...] "cheerful desolation" [...] is the artificial snow which is continually seen through set windows until eventually it falls on the studio interior as well.|$|E

Thin mist drifted across the low ground in front, but some miles off a forest-covered ridge rose against the sky.

We advise him therefore, first, if he possibly can, to draw side by side and in corresponding positions the two things under consideration, and then, going over them in a methodical way, to state simply the difference between each homologous part. We append as examples three test answers actually submitted (with figures) in [...] "Correspondence" [...] work:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Let us {{consider}} two particular {{points on the}} train * travelling along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their distance apart.

It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train measures the interval by <b>marking</b> <b>off</b> his measuring-rod in a straight line (e.g. along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance.|$|E
