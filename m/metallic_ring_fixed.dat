40|$|Average {{persistent}} current over {{a set of}} diffusive <b>metallic</b> <b>rings</b> with <b>fixed</b> number of electrons is considered. We study the the case where the phase breaking time {{is much greater than}} an inverse average inter-level distance. In such a situation, many return events for an electron have to be taken into account. As a result, one arrives at a non-perturbative problem for a fixed by an external magnetic field Cooperon mode. This multi-Cooperon problem has been considered previously by Altland et al., Europhys. Lett., 2, 155 (1992) and in several following papers within the framework of supersymmetric approach. Such an approach involves very tedious calculations which were performed using computer algebra package. Here we solve the problem in question with the help of replica trick. It is demonstrated that the replica trick in combination with a proper analytical continuation in the replica space allows one to obtain the results in much more explicit way.

Homogeneous and realistic body models have been considered in the paper. Half wave dipole antenna is used as the excitation source operating at 0. 9 GHz and 1. 8 GHz. The <b>metallic</b> <b>ring</b> is modelled as conducting objects. The results have shown that the presence of human body near to the antenna significantly distorted the antenna radiation pattern. The antenna gain is decresed approximately 10 dB at 0. 9 GH and 25 dB at 1. 8 GHz in the direction of body. Nevertheless, the presence of <b>metallic</b> <b>ring</b> do not have any profound effect on antenna radiation pattern due to their size which is relatively small compared {{to the size of the}} human body. Additional <b>metallic</b> <b>ring</b> close to the human leg could alter the SAR and the effect varies depending on the size of the rings.

Ra The question of the magnetic properties of <b>ring</b> molecules and <b>metallic</b> <b>rings</b> has a long history. In analogy to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, i. e. the tuning of the interference pattern in a double slit experiment through the enclosed flux, it can be expected that the magnetization, or the corresponding “persistent current”, has a flux periodic contribution.

40|$|The {{infrared}} signal {{detected by}} a pyroelectric detector-modulator 1 superimposes over the carrier frequencies, fed through an annular <b>metallic</b> <b>ring</b> formed {{near the front}} electrode of the pyroelectric detector.

These solitary waves give rise to domain wall or electromechanical coupling. The electrical field of the carrier frequency causes growth of domains with polarisation aligned along carrier frequency field and the movement of the domain walls results in domain wall coupling. However, it is essential that the carrier frequency field should be greater than the threshold electric field of the ferroelectric crystal. In contrast to other modes of coupling, domain wall coupling is very efficient to modulate infrared signal through pyroelectric detector-modulator for remote transmission of the same...|$|R
