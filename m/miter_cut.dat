25|$|Miter gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These miter slots (or miter grooves) are used to position and guide either a miter gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The miter gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The miter gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a precisely controlled angle (a so-called <b>miter</b> <b>cut).</b>|$|E
50|$|Table {{swiveling}} in {{both directions}} is universal but most saws allow head tilting only in one direction (counter-clockwise), although some saws allow head tilting {{in both directions}}. Normally the workpiece is held flat {{on the table and}} so table swiveling will produce a <b>miter</b> <b>cut</b> (blade vertical and angled across work piece), head rotation a bevel cut (blade angled from vertical and square across work piece), and in combination a compound cut.|$|E

5000|$|Power {{compound}} miter saws, {{and especially}} the sliding type, have replaced radial arm saws for many woodworkers for <b>MITER</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{automatic}} saws rely on {{numerical control}} {{to not only}} cut faster, but {{to be more precise}} and perform more complex <b>miter</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Original {{miter box}} and saw - The {{original}} was a wood 3 sided box with 90° and 45° slots for guiding a hand saw into cutting <b>miter</b> <b>cuts</b> into the clamped lumber.|$|R
5000|$|Power miter saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple miter saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing <b>miters</b> to be <b>cut</b> in one plane. Compound miter saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound <b>miters</b> to be <b>cut.</b> <b>Miter</b> saws with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
5000|$|Electric {{miter saw}} or [...] "chop saw," [...] or [...] "cut-off saw" [...] or [...] "power miter box": for making {{accurate}} cross <b>cuts</b> and <b>miter</b> <b>cuts.</b> The basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90° {{angle to the}} vertical. A [...] "compound miter saw" [...] has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles. A [...] "sliding compound miter saw" [...] has a blade that can be pulled through the work, in an action {{similar to that of}} a radial-arm saw, which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} miter saw began to replace the radial arm saw, but only for crosscuts and <b>miter</b> <b>cuts</b> since <b>miter</b> saws are unable to perform rip cuts. The radial arm saw can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the radial arm saw can safely <b>cut</b> compound <b>miters</b> necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the {{compound miter saw}}, the radial arm saw can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to design skills, segmented turning demands precision woodworking skills {{as well as}} turning skills. Design and construction of a bowl blank—the wood piece mounted on the lathe for turning a vessel—requires angled <b>miter</b> joints <b>cut</b> to tolerances of {{as little as a}} tenth of one degree or better.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} ways to fashion inside corners. One {{is to use}} a {{compound}} <b>miter</b> saw to <b>cut</b> the ends of the corner pieces along two axes simultaneously. The other, called coping, is a two step process, first to <b>cut</b> a simple <b>miter</b> and then to use a coping saw to undercut the miters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>miter</b> saw makes <b>cuts</b> {{by pulling}} a {{spinning}} {{circular saw blade}} down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise cutting angle between {{the plane of the}} blade and the plane of the longest workpiece edge. In standard position, this angle is fixed at 90°.|$|R
