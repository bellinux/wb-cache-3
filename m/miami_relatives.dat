25|$|Attorney General Janet Reno {{ordered the}} return of Elián González to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
25|$|After González was {{returned}} to his father's custody, he remained in the U.S. while the <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> exhausted their legal options. A three-judge federal panel had ruled {{that he could not}} go back to Cuba until he was granted an asylum hearing, but the case turned on the right of the relatives to request that hearing on behalf of the boy. On June 1, 2000, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Elián was too young to file for asylum; only his father could speak for him, and the relatives lacked legal standing. On June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision. Later the same day, Elián González and his family returned home to Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{hours after}} he {{was taken from the}} house in Miami, González and his father were reunited at Andrews Air Force Base. The next day, the White House {{released}} a photograph showing a smiling González reunited with his father, which the <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> disputed by claiming that it was a fake González in the photograph. Later, González and his family were taken to the Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Center (formerly known as [...] "Wye Plantation"). The media was barred from access to the family.|$|E
30|$|The idea is {{that since}} the other {{metropolitan}} areas were not affected by the Mariel Boatlift in 1980, the evolution of fertility outcomes for these areas should, in principal, follow those of their synthetic controls closely. In other words, we should not see outcomes for these areas deviating from those of their synthetic versions in the post-treatment period. Hence, by comparing the estimated treatment effect for Miami to these placebo effects, one can ascertain the rarity {{of the magnitude of}} the treatment effect. The null hypothesis of zero treatment effects is rejected if there is clear indication that the changes in fertility outcome in <b>Miami</b> <b>relative</b> to its synthetic control after the Boatlift exceed in magnitude those pertaining to these other metropolitan areas. This inferential technique is akin to a permutation test because it allows one to assess if the effect estimated for <b>Miami</b> is large <b>relative</b> to the placebo effects estimated for some other metropolitan area drawn at random.|$|R
25|$|While {{the family}} was still at Andrews, New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith, escorting the <b>Miami</b> González <b>relatives,</b> was {{turned away from the}} base by guards. The May 5, 2000, Miami Herald {{reported}} that González was joined by his classmates (without their parents) and his teacher from his hometown, Cárdenas. Granma released pictures of Elián in the Young Pioneer uniform of Cuba's Communist youth league. On May 6, 2000, attorney Greg Craig took González and Juan Miguel to a dinner in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., hosted by Smith and Elizabeth Bagley.|$|R
40|$|Card's (1990) {{well-known}} {{analysis of}} the Mariel boatlift concluded that this mass influx of mostly less-skilled Cubans to Miami had little impact on the labor market outcomes of the city's less-skilled workers. This paper evaluates two explanations for this. First, consistent with an open-economy framework, this paper asks whether after the boatlift, Miami increased its production of unskilled-intensive manufactured goods, allowing it to "export" {{the impact of the}} boatlift. Second, this paper asks whether Miami adapted to the boatlift by implementing new skill-complementary technologies more slowly than would have otherwise been the case. Using a confidential micro data version of the Annual Surveys of Manufactures, I show that following the boatlift, <b>Miami's</b> <b>relative</b> output of different manufacturing industries trended similarly to other cities with similar pre-boatlift trends in manufacturing mix. The response of industry mix to the boatlift therefore appears to be small. Supporting the second type of adjustment, utilization of Cuban labor by Miami's industries rose proportionately to the supply increase generated by the boatlift. In addition, post-boatlift computer use at work was lower in Miami than in other cities with similar levels of computer-based employment before the event, even among non-Hispanic workers in the same detailed cells defined by industry, occupation, and education. This suggests the boatlift induced Miami's industries to employ more unskilled-intensive production technologies. The results suggest an explanation for why native wages are consistently found to be insensitive to local immigration shocks: markets adapt production technology to local factor supplies.

5000|$|He was {{a general}} {{assignment}} Metro reporter for the Miami Herald, where {{he worked on the}} staff that won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Coverage [...] "for its balanced and gripping on-the-scene coverage of the pre-dawn raid by federal agents that took the Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez from his <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> and reunited him with his Cuban father." [...] He also covered some of the biggest breaking stories in South Florida, including the murder of Gianni Versace.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} the previous sub-section revealed that actual fertility outcomes in <b>Miami</b> fell dramatically <b>relative</b> to the counterfactual outcomes predicted by the synthetic control in 1983 and 1986. Since the fertility trends exhibited by the synthetic control represent the counterfactual fertility path for Miami in the alternative world where the Boatlift did not occur, {{this suggests that the}} immigration shock led to a short-term decline in contemporaneous fertility during these years.|$|R
30|$|Borjas’ (2017 a) re-examination, which {{involved}} selecting {{the comparison group}} based on a data-driven method proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) (which will be detailed in Section 4.1), finds that the wages of the least-skilled workers in <b>Miami</b> fell <b>relative</b> {{to those in the}} control cities after the Boatlift, suggesting that the shock had a negative impact on the wages of Miami workers whose skills and occupational choices were most similar to the Mariel Cubans. 3 Borjas estimates that between 1977 and 1979 (pre-Boatlift) and 1981 and 1986 (post-Boatlift), the average wage of the least-skilled Miami workers declined substantially, by between 10 and 30 %. Interestingly, he finds the negative wage impact to be larger between 1984 and 1986 than between 1981 and 1983.4 Wage effects were found to weaken after 1986 and to disappear by 1990. This suggests that Miami residents—notably the least-skilled ones—could have perceived their labour market opportunities to be threatened by the arrival of the immigrants.|$|R
5|$|Bouncing back, Buffalo {{won their}} next five games. Against Army, Buffalo {{reversed}} {{the result of}} the Western Michigan game, coming back from a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime. Handling conference opponents Ohio and <b>Miami</b> (Ohio) with <b>relative</b> ease, Buffalo continued conference play by beating Akron in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43–40, in Akron's final football game at the Rubber Bowl. In their next game, against Bowling Green, the Bulls found themselves down 21–0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season. With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A; the final regular season game, a 24–21 loss to Kent State, was only a formality. The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7–5, 5–3 within the conference.|$|R

On March 3, 1845, the United States Congress passed the joint resolution that exempted Slocum and twenty-one of her <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> from removal to Kansas Territory. Her Miami relations in Indiana were among the 148 individuals who formed the nucleus of the present-day Miami Nation of Indiana. She is buried at Slocum Cemetery in Wabash County, Indiana.

5000|$|In April 2000, Redlener {{was engaged}} by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to provide {{strategic}} guidance regarding {{the management of}} the Elian Gonzalez case. He claimed in a letter to INS that based on a 40-second video of 7-year-old Elian, he “is now in a state of imminent danger to his physical and emotional well-being in a home that I consider to be psychologically abusive.” He urged that the government immediately remove the [...] "horrendously exploited” Elian from the “bizarre and destructive ambiance” of his <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives.</b> Eleven Cuban American doctors dismissed Redlener’s opinion for not “having obtained a medical history, performed a physical examination or other proper psychological evaluations of Elian." [...] Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said Dr. Redlener was [...] "neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist and who has never examined the young Cuban refugee." [...] Elian Gonzalez was returned to Cuba two months later, where he had permanent bodyguards assigned to him since the age of seven, enrolled in military school and in 2013 declared: [...] "“Fidel Castro is like a father to me. I don’t profess to have any religion, but, if I did, my god would be Fidel Castro." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2000, the Elián González {{affair was}} an {{immigration}} {{battle in the}} Miami area. The controversy concerned six-year-old Elián González who was rescued from the waters {{off the coast of}} Miami. The U.S. and the Cuban governments, his father Juan Miguel González, his <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives,</b> and the Cuban-American community of Miami were all involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000, seizure of Elián by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community. During the controversy, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County at the time, vowed that he would do nothing to assist the Bill Clinton administration and federal authorities in their bid to return the six-year-old boy to Cuba. Tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom were outraged at the raid, poured out into the streets of Little Havana and demonstrated. Car horns blared, demonstrators turned over signs, trash cans, and newspaper racks and some small fires were started. Rioters jammed a 10-block area of Little Havana. Shortly afterwards, many Miami businesses closed, as their owners and managers participated in a short, one-day boycott against the city, attempting to affect its tourism industry. Employees of airlines, cruise lines, hotels, car rental companies, and major retailers participated in the boycott. Elián González returned to Cuba with his father on June 28, 2000.|$|E
5000|$|On Saturday, December 25, 2010, Pérez {{was rushed}} to Mercy Hospital in Miami, where he died that same afternoon. The {{cause of death was}} {{initially}} reported as having been a heart attack, but was later referred to as [...] "respiratory failure". It later emerged that Blanca Rodríguez and Perez's four daughters and son learned of Perez's death from a news website, as neither Matos nor her daughters notified them of the loss. Chávez offered condolences, but commented that he hopes Pérez's way of governing would not return to the country: [...] "May he rest in peace. But with him ... may the form of politics that he personified rest in peace and leave here forever." [...] Pérez's relatives in Miami said that Pérez would be buried in Miami and that they have no intention of returning his remains to Venezuela until Chávez was no longer in office. Less than 24 hours before the burial, legal representatives for Blanca Rodríguez obtained a court order to stop the ceremony. The order was based on Blanca Rodríguez's legal right as Perez's widow to determine where he would be buried. It was reported that <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> agreed to her wish to return Pérez's body to Venezuela but later they denied having reached to an agreement.On October 4, 2011, the remains of Carlos Andrés Perez were returned to Venezuela, nine months after his death. the casket arrived in a flight originated from Atlanta, Georgia, escorted by Mayor of Caracas Antonio Ledezma, friend of Pérez and member of Democratic Action (AD). Once in Caracas it was transported to the Headquarters of AD, where over 5,000 people waited to see the hearse and the casket covered with the Venezuelan flag. Pérez remains were interred on Thursday October 6, 2011. Cecilia Matos died in Bogota (Colombia) of [...] "kidney and respiratory problems," [...] one of her daughters told Efe. She was 66. The death of Cecilia Matos comes 25 days after Perez was buried in Venezuela, following a prolonged family dispute about where his final resting place should be.|$|E
40|$|The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) {{is charged}} {{with the task of}} {{administering}} citizenship requests, providing for the proper documentation of temporary foreign workers, and apprehending illegal aliens. The apprehension of illegals, the most controversial duty of the INS, has placed the agency squarely in the headlines. The recent raid to seize Elian Gonzalez from his <b>Miami</b> <b>relatives</b> brought opprobrium upon the agency. The action, which involved 131 INS agents – some heavily armed – resulted in calls of discrimination from Miami’s Cuban community. This paper examines the inconsistent enforcement patterns of the INS and attempts to determine what factors may account for INS activity. We conjecture that the agency is influenced by political pressure and may practice discrimination against certain illegals...|$|E
