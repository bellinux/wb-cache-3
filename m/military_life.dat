5|$|Although {{he never}} {{finished}} the other works intended to comprise Scenes from a <b>Military</b> <b>Life,</b> Balzac {{returned to the}} people and politics of Les Chouans in later works. Corentin reappears in his 1841 novel Une Ténébreuse Affaire (A Murky Business), and Hulot is featured in 1843's La Muse du département (The Provincial Muse). Later novels mention additional royalist uprisings, connecting them thematically to Les Chouans.|$|E
5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to <b>military</b> <b>life</b> and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager {{to wake up in}} the mornings.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{the year at}} OSVIA, he decided to enrol at the military academy in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). He went there directly from Magelang, and told his brothers to inform their father, who disapproved of his son's choice. Soemohardjo initially attempted to bribe his son with 1,000 gulden to return to OSVIA, but eventually agreed to pay for Oerip's tuition. After his training, during which he found <b>military</b> <b>life</b> enjoyable, Oerip graduated from the academy in October 1914 and became a second lieutenant in the KNIL.|$|E

5|$|After {{the war he}} {{was offered}} a {{permanent}} commission, which he initially accepted. Having resigned his commission in March 1946 he re-enlisted briefly. After struggling to find a career that would support his family, Braham emigrated to Canada {{with his family and}} enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in 1952. Having held office at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Braham retired from <b>military</b> <b>life</b> and began working as a civilian for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. He continued to work there until his death from an undiagnosed brain tumor in 1974, aged 53.|$|E
5|$|Derrick did {{not join}} up when war broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. Derrick thrived on <b>military</b> <b>life,</b> but found discipline difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to <b>military</b> <b>life</b> until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{training}} period was for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was designed to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of {{the training}} was designed to help cadets adjust to <b>military</b> <b>life,</b> and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers. The cadets {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 40, with diverse civilian backgrounds from teachers and journalists to lawyers and technicians.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In 1947 he was {{promoted}} to air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Staff at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan. Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now Air Command). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954, and was knighted a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia—particularly Vietnam—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light supersonic bomber to replace the Air Force's English Electric Canberra. After retiring from <b>military</b> <b>life</b> in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in Sydney in 1989, aged 89.|$|E

5|$|Read {{retired from}} <b>military</b> <b>life</b> on 20 March 1975 and was succeeded by Air Marshal James Rowland, {{who later became}} Governor of New South Wales. Considered disdainful of {{bureaucracy}} {{and some of the}} trappings of high office, Read refused to sit for the traditional portrait painted of former Chiefs of the Air Staff. As CAS during the Whitlam Labor government, which was generally antipathetic to imperial knighthoods, he was not raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) until the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours, after the Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser had been returned to power. Originally from Vaucluse, in Sydney's east, by 2010 Read was living in Safety Beach, on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. He died at Woolgoolga and District Retirement Village on 17September 2014.|$|E
5|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline {{fall under the}} purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day, which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast. Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to <b>military</b> <b>life.</b> Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world. The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, Sapper, Pathfinder, etc.|$|E
