25|$|Strategic bombing during World War I {{introduced}} {{air attacks}} intended to panic civilian targets and led in 1918 to the amalgamation of British army and navy air services into the Royal Air Force. Its first Chief of the Air Staff Hugh Trenchard {{was among the}} military strategists in the 1920s like Giulio Douhet who saw air warfare as {{a new way to}} overcome the stalemate of trench warfare. Interception was nearly impossible with fighter planes no faster than bombers. Their view (expressed vividly in 1932) was that the bomber will always get through, and the only defence was a deterrent bomber force capable of <b>matching</b> <b>retaliation.</b> Predictions were made that a bomber offensive would quickly cause thousands of deaths and civilian hysteria leading to capitulation, but widespread pacifism contributed to a reluctance to provide resources.|$|E

50|$|Four South American nations {{participated in}} the 1994 World Cup: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia. Chile could not take part in {{qualification}} as it was still banned by FIFA; Bolivia had qualified {{for the first time}} since the 1950 tournament. The tournament saw the end of Diego Maradona's World Cup career, having played in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups. He was expelled from the tournament after he failed a drug test which uncovered ephedrine, a weight loss drug, in his blood. Colombia, despite high expectations due to their style and impressive qualifying campaign, disappointed in the tournament, failing to advance from the round robin. The team was supposedly dogged by influence from betting syndicates and drug cartels, with coach Francisco Maturana receiving death threats over squad selection. Defender Andrés Escobar was a tragic figure of this tournament, as in the group stage match against the United States national team, he scored an own goal which eliminated his team 2-1. Escobar was later shot to death outside a bar in a Medellín suburb only ten days after the <b>match,</b> apparently in <b>retaliation</b> for the own goal.|$|R
