The case histories indicate that spondylolysis had developed in the pathological bone {{as a result of}} increased stress and that it is an acquired lesion. <b>Marble</b> <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> was first described early in the 20 th century (Albers-Schonberg 1904; 1907) although it appears to have occurred even in prehistoric man (RegOly-M#{ 233 }rei 1962). About 200 to 300 cases ofthis rare condition have been reported (Johnston et al. 1968; Aegerter and Kirkpatrick 1975). The term osteopetrosis was first used by Karshner in 1926. Osteopetrosis is characterised by increased density and widening of the bones. Essentially, the lesion is one which involves the failure of resorption of calcified fetal chondroid and of primary bone, which prevents replace-ment by mature lamellar bone. Many authors have reported its clinical features and described its histopath-ology (Krompecher 1940; Cohen 195 1; Johnston et a!. 1968). Shapiro et al. in 1980 confirmed that the cause of the disease is impaired function ofosteoclasts. The exact molecular biology is not yet known. There is no effective treatment, and pathological fractures are an important complication. Their treat-ment may be difficult because of the abnormal bone structure and an increased susceptibility to bone infection.

40|$|ClC- 7 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} chloride {{channel that}} is mainly localized in late endosomes and lysosomes. Clcn 7 / mice show a severe osteopetrosis (<b>marble</b> <b>bone</b> <b>disease)</b> that becomes apparent shortly after birth (Kornak et al. 2001. Cell. 104 : 204 – 215). Although osteoclasts {{are present in}} normal numbers, they fail to resorb bone. In osteoclasts, ClC- 7 is highly expressed in the ruffled membrane that is formed by the fusion of H -ATPase containing late endosomal vesicles. We could show that chloride ions conducted by ClC- 7 provide the necessary countercharge to allow the H -ATPase to efficiently pump large amounts of protons into the resorption lacuna. The murine phenotype closely resembles human infantile malignant osteopetrosis. A screening for mutations in the human gene, CLCN 7, was performed in 18 patients suffering from this disease. Two patients were compound heterozygous for a nonsense mutation and two different missense mutations. Two of these mutations lead to a complete loss of the ClC- 7 protein in cultured patient fibroblasts corresponding {{to the loss of}} ClC- 7 in Clcn 7 / mice. Recently, mutations in CLCN 7 were found to cause also the much milder autosomal dominant form of osteopetrosis (ADOII) (Cleiren et al. 2001. Hum. Mol. Gen. 10 : 2861 – 2867). Investigation of primary osteoclasts from several ADOII patients revealed that ClC- 7 levels and subcellular localization are not detectably altered. Nevertheless, their resorptive activity is diminished. was increased in the channel open state.

40|$|The {{recessive}} {{genetic defect}} of osteopetrosis (<b>marble</b> <b>bone</b> <b>disease)</b> in Red Angus cattle {{has been defined}} by a mutation in the bovine SLC 4 A 2 gene located on Bos Taurus chromosome 4. The mutation was discovered in a joint effort by the Red Angus Association of America (RAAA), University of Illinois, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Wyoming, and the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-ARS). The information is available for public use without restriction, {{taking into account the}} disclaimers and caveats described below. The causative mutation is a deletion of ~ 2721 bp of the SLC 4 A 2 gene. This deletion encompasses the entirety of exon 2 and the 5 ’ portion of exon 3. A diagnostic assay that has been used for screening several hundred Red Angus animals is based on the amplification of a normal amplicon and a deletion-only amplicon using a trio of PCR primers (see below). Screening for other sequence variation along this portion of the gene among cattle populations has not been completed, so the potential for alleles that do not produce amplification products due to SNP under the primers exists. This likelihood is reduced for the allele containing the deletion (i. e. lower chance of false negatives) since they share a common haplotype, but the precise likelihood of false negative is not known at present. Conversely, the probability of SNP under the primers in SLC 4 A 2 alleles with normal function is higher, such that the appearance of apparently homozygous mutant but unaffected animals is not negligible due to failure of the normal functioning allele to amplify. However, we have not observed any of this class in the approximately 1000 animals in the test populations...|$|E
40|$|ClC- 7 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} chloride channel whose {{function was}} unknown so far. Mice deficient for ClC- 7 were generated using two different gene targeting strategies. Whereas targeting construct C 7 A abolished expression of ClC- 7 completely, the LacZ gene was fused in frame into exon 7 of Clcn 7 {{as a reporter}} gene in construct C 7 B. Using the reporter gene to assess the expression pattern of ClC- 7, we detected strong signals in osteoclasts, dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglion, retina, spinal cord and brain beside a ubiquitous basal expression level. These findings were corroborated by in situ hybridization. Clcn 7 -/- mice of both knockout-strains show the same severe osteopetrosis (<b>marble</b> <b>bone</b> <b>disease)</b> that becomes apparent shortly after birth, leading to an increased early postnatal lethality. Life expectancy of the surviving animals was reduced to maximal 45 days. Those mice were anemic and much smaller than wildtype mice. Additionally, there was progressive neurodegeneration in the retina and the brain. It could be excluded that this degeneration was secondary to osteopetrotic changes in Clcn 7 -/- mice. An accumulation of a lipofuscine-like material was detected in cerebral neurons, whereas no such material {{could be seen in}} the retina. Although osteoclasts are present in normal numbers, they fail to resorb bone because they cannot acidify the extracellular resorption lacuna. In osteoclasts, ClC- 7 is highly expressed in the ruffled membrane that is formed by the fusion of H + -ATPase containing vesicles and that secretes protons into the lacuna. In the proximal tubule of the kidney ClC- 7 probably resides in late endosomes and lysosomes. The murine phenotype closely resembles human infantile malignant osteopetrosis. Therefore, in 12 patients suffering from this disease a screening for mutations in the human gene, CLCN 7, was performed. One patient was compound heterozygous for a nonsense and a missense mutation. These mutations lead to a complete loss of the ClC- 7 protein from cultured fibroblasts of the patient. It is concluded that ClC- 7 provides the chloride conductance required for an efficient proton pumping by the H + -ATPase of the osteoclast ruffled membrane. The insufficient acidification in Clcn 7 -/- mice therefore prevents bone resorption. A similar acidification defect in lysosomal compartments may cause neuronal storage because of decreased degradati on. </body...|$|E

The plasma intact parathyroid hormone of low turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> in hemodialysis patients was 127. 0 ± 105. 7 ng/L and that of non-low-turnover was 290. 4 ± 161. 1 ng/L (p= 0. 033). The thresholds of plasma intact parathyroid hormone for distinguishing osteodystrophy and sensitivity, specificity of plasma intact parathyroid hormone were analyzed by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under receiver operating characteristic of plasma intact parathyroid hormone in diagnosing of hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> and low turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> was 0. 84 and 0. 82, respectively.
