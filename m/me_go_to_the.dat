500|$|For Thriller 25, The Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am remixed the {{demo version}} of [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)". The singer commented on Jackson and the project, [...] "You always just dream of meeting him, let alone working with him. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it. I {{grew up in}} the projects in East Los Angeles and Thriller was filmed about two blocks from my house, but my mother was really strict and she wouldn't let <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> factories—she didn't care who was filming a video there; but I'm on the 25th anniversary, 25 years later—that's pretty awesome." [...] Entitled [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) 2008", the remix was well received by Rolling Stone. The publication described the track, along with [...] "The Girl Is Mine 2008", as being one of the best songs on the album. They noted that will.i.am [...] "updates the songs' original sound to make them dancefloor-worthy twenty-five years after their release".|$|E
2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't {{care if they}} say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing {{off the edge of}} the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd let <b>me</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E

6000|$|... "But, my dear madam," [...] said I, [...] "you don't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town, and you won't {{allow me}} to have any cooking done here. What am I to do?" ...|$|R
