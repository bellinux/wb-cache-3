5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} the <b>machine</b> was a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens {{to build a}} similar <b>machine,</b> using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} <b>machine</b> to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's <b>machine</b> appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette.

5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from the <b>machine</b> gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The <b>machine</b> gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from the}} concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for <b>machine</b> gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the <b>machine</b> gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium <b>machine</b> guns were also largely used in the same manner as light <b>machine</b> guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E

5|$|Autocannons {{are often}} found in aircraft, where they {{replaced}} <b>machine</b> guns and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as they provide greater destructive power than <b>machine</b> guns.|$|E
5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a <b>machine</b> gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a <b>machine</b> gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than <b>machine</b> guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. <b>Machine</b> guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
