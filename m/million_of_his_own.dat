5|$|Schumacher and Lloyd Webber {{restarted}} {{development for}} The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002. It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. {{in an attempt}} to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money. The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $55 million budget. A further $15 million was used for marketing, bringing the final budget to $70 million.

50|$|The movie spent a {{long time}} in {{pre-production}} (during which it was also known as Go North) and was delayed by the writers strike and Wayne's involvement in making The Alamo (1960), a passion project <b>of</b> <b>his</b> that ended up costing the actor <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money. Shooting on North to Alaska did not start until May 1960.|$|R
50|$|Wealthy {{real estate}} {{developer}} Jim Pederson declared his intention to challenge Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona on September 14, 2005. Pederson served as Arizona Democratic Party Chairman from 2001 to 2005 while spending <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money to help Democrats modernize and to elect Janet Napolitano as governor. Kyl got an unexpected boost when TIME listed {{him as one of}} the Ten Best Senators. While polling in October showed Pederson catching up, Kyl was re-elected 53%-44%.|$|R

25|$|In the November general election, Buchanan faced Democrat Christine Jennings, {{a banking}} executive. There were 216,000 {{registered}} Republicans and about 155,000 registered Democrats in the district, but Jennings polled ahead of Buchanan up to election day.

25|$|In May 2005, Accel Partners {{invested}} $12.7 {{million in}} Facebook, and Jim Breyer added $1 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money. A high-school {{version of the}} site was launched in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step. (At the time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.) Facebook also expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{took off}} when wealthy U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican representing San Diego, California, announced on May 6 {{that he would}} use his personal money to push the effort. All told, he contributed $1.7 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost a sure thing. The only question was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election {{to take place in}} late 2003 rather than in March 2004.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Richie {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the film Shoreditch, into which he had reportedly invested half a <b>million</b> pounds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money. The film received negative reviews and was not widely seen.|$|R
50|$|Ellen becomes {{engrossed in}} a major case that Hewes & Associates is pursuing. Patty has been {{retained}} in a class action lawsuit by the former employees of billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson). In a case reminiscent of the Enron scandal, Frobisher is accused of insider trading and lying to his employees about his company's health even as he unloaded hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> stock, depriving <b>his</b> employees <b>of</b> their retirement funds and benefits. Early in the season, Patty shows she is {{willing to go to}} extreme, unethical, and illegal lengths to win her case. As the season progresses, Ellen becomes increasingly involved in the case and in Patty's tradecraft.|$|R
5000|$|By 2002, Quepasa shares had {{declined}} in value {{under the leadership}} of Trujillo. In media reports, Trujillo blamed the decline in Quepasa's market value on unfavorable market conditions and the [...] ".com bubble". The Chicago Tribune wrote that even with Internet Winter blowing cold wind across the digital landscape, many experts were surprised to hear the death rattle of America's once successful hispanic-centered Web operation, Quepasa.com. Later that year, Peterson led a group of investors through a proxy fight and hostile takeover of Quepasa, reportedly investing <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money. Shortly after the takeover, Peterson was again named Chairman and Chief Executive of Quepasa.|$|R
25|$|In September, he {{qualified}} for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, {{he announced his}} intention to re-enter the presidential race. He said that Republican operatives had wanted to reveal compromising photographs of his daughter, which would disrupt her wedding, {{and he wanted to}} spare her from embarrassment. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money. Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} election, Bloomberg {{received}} Giuliani's endorsement. He {{also had a}} huge spending advantage. Although New York City's campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one. One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering {{from the effects of}} the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.|$|E
25|$|After selling Pure Software, Hastings {{found himself}} without a goal. He became {{interested}} in educational reform in California and enrolled in the Stanford Graduate School of Education. In 2000, Governor Gray Davis appointed Hastings to the State Board of Education, and in 2001, Hastings became its president. Hastings spent $1 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money together with $6 million from Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr to promote the passage of Proposition 39 in November 2000, a measure that lowered the level of voter approval for local schools to pass construction bond issues from 66 to 55 percent.|$|E
50|$|The film {{portrays the}} {{political}} career and personal {{life of the}} former leader of the Soviet Union, Georgian-born Ioseb Jughashvili, who later adopted the name Joseph Stalin demonstrating his rule {{and how he was}} able to bring the Soviet Union to a place of great power on the world stage, but at a consequence: in this case, the destruction <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family as well as the mass murder <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Revolutionary partners and ultimately <b>his</b> acts <b>of</b> corruption in the Communist Party. The focus is on the behaviour of Stalin and the after effects. The story is as narrated by Stalin's daughter, who defected to the United States in 1967.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{before the}} deadline, Rick Scott {{jumped into the}} primary fight. Scott started dumping <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{personal}} fortune into the race. The race quickly {{became one of the}} most expensive and [...] "nasty" [...] primary campaigns in recent Florida history. Scott and McCollum lashed out with very negative attacks against each other. Scott ran as a political [...] "outsider", and led some early polls, but McCollum re-took the lead in polls just before primary day. Scott benefited in the absentee voting, while McCollum expected to make up the difference based on turnout. On primary day, Scott won the nomination with just over 46% of the vote. The dejected McCollum team reluctantly conceded after midnight.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2009 Flores {{entered the}} Republican primary for the 17th District, held by 10-term Democratic {{incumbent}} Chet Edwards.

The second highest total raised was by Rudy Giuliani, who got $14.4 million before {{dropping out of the}} race. Mitt Romney raised $9 million in the fourth quarter from contributors, but lent himself $18 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money, giving him the largest total. According to the campaign, Paul's donations average $100 per donor Compared to Democratic candidates, Paul's fourth quarter total was close to Hillary Clinton's, who raised approximately $20 million.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the merger meetings, Ridley focused on a compromise with the Demons Alternative to ensure that Melbourne could continue as a viable business. His board co-opted Gutnick and Mark Jenkins onto the board and a truce of sorts was struck between all parties. In the months following the 1996 merger vote, the businessman and Joseph Gutnick became president. He put $3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money into the club, and sacked Balme as coach midway through the 1997 season. In 1998, under new coach Neale Daniher, the club spent most of the season in the top eight and beat the eventual premiers Adelaide in the Qualifying Final. Melbourne also eliminated St Kilda, but lost to North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final. In 1999 Melbourne finished in the bottom three.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-four-year-old Spitzer {{decided to}} run as a Democratic {{candidate}} in the 1994 election for Attorney General, as did Koppell, Brooklyn Family Court Judge Karen Burstein, and Kings County DA Charles J. Hynes. At the time, Spitzer was a young and relatively unknown defense attorney representing white-collar criminals. When he announced his campaign Spitzer suggested that, if elected, he would use the state's antitrust laws to pursue corporate polluters. Spitzer was the only candidate to support the death penalty. In a televised debate among the candidates, Spitzer was criticized for financing his campaign using $3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and family money. Despite heavy funding from his own family, he placed last among the four Democratic candidates for the nomination, receiving just 19% of the vote. Burstein, the only woman and gay candidate, won the primary with 31% of vote. Burstein subsequently lost {{in the general election}} to Republican Dennis Vacco, part of a nationwide Republican sweep, that included the election of Republican George Pataki as the new Governor of New York displacing the Democratic incumbent, Governor Mario Cuomo.|$|E

25|$|In April 1993, Yanni {{released}} his eighth studio album, In My Time, on the Private Music label. He supported the album with a concert tour that visited 40 cities worldwide which included three sell out performances at the Herodes Atticus Theatre by the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, his first {{to take place}} in his native country. After he moved to the United States in 1972, returning to Greece to perform at the Acropolis became one of his career goals. The event took over {{a year and a half}} to organise, and recalled his experience of meeting with the local archaeological committee, the mayor, and ministers of culture and tourism as his effort to gain their trust and permission to perform, promising not to cause any damage. For the occasion, Yanni wanted to record and film the concerts for a live album and home video. Without sufficient financial backing, Yanni risked $2 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money on its production in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music. Despite being advised by his management and Private Music personnel not to proceed with the concert due to the high costs, Yanni proceeded regardless and by the end of it, was left with an estimated $50,000 to his name.|$|E
500|$|Ham {{promptly}} countersued, {{blaming the}} initial lawsuit on poor advice Black received {{from his new}} personal assistant, his mother-in-law Jonni Hartman. [...] His lawyer told the press that [...] "Mr. Ham invested $1 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money in Clint Black's career {{at a time when}} nobody else would do so. For that commitment, Mr. Black should show a little gratitude and honor his contracts".|$|E

50|$|A lifelong Republican, Davis {{switched}} to the Democrats after being kicked out of a fundraiser headlined by Dick Cheney in 2003 {{when he tried to}} ask Cheney questions about free trade policies. He then ran for the U.S. Congress seat in his home district, NY-26, in 2004, 2006 and 2008 as a self-funded candidate, pouring in <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> funds and coming close to beating the incumbent Republican Thomas Reynolds in 2006. In the 2008 election, however, he came in third out of three in the Democratic primary. He switched his affiliation back to Republican with the election of fellow wealthy industrialist Chris Lee, becoming an ally and supporter of Lee. After Lee's abrupt departure from Congress in February, 2011 Davis tried and failed to get the Republican nomination to replace Lee, then decided to run as an independent on a newly created Tea Party line.|$|R
500|$|Bevin financed {{his primary}} {{campaign}} with over $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money, representing 95% {{of the money}} he spent, and the National Journal opined that attracting donors from supporters of Comer, Heiner, Scott, and McConnell would be critical to his success in the general election. Almost immediately after his primary win, Bevin was asked about his support for McConnell, telling reporters, [...] "I literally know of no other elected official in this state who went to more events between May and November in support of candidates and support of Mitch McConnell and other down ticket races than I did. I knocked on doors, I made phone calls, I wrote checks myself, and I physically attended fundraiser after fundraiser." [...] Federal Election Commission records showed no evidence of contributions by Bevin to McConnell's campaign, and a McConnell advisor cited by Bevin to corroborate his support refused to do so when contacted by Insider Louisville.|$|E
500|$|By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed United We Stand to [...] "influence the debate." [...] At this point, Perot had spent $12 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.|$|E
500|$|Throughout April, {{the draft}} efforts continued, and Perot {{appeared}} on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During {{an appearance on}} Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, {{and that he was}} willing to spend $100 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared on Face the Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E
