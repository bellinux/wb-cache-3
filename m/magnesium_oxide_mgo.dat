[...] However, its high melting temperature (1723°C) and viscosity {{make it difficult to}} work with. [...] Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> (<b>MgO)</b> and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E

After a 3 -day incubation, the viability and oxidative stress markers including cellular mitochondrial activity, caspase- 3 and - 9 activities, total antioxidant power, lipid peroxidation, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were measured. Also, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as inflammatory index, along with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were measured. Statistical differences were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett′s multiple comparison tests. Results: It is indicated that CP-exposed lymphocytes treated with MgO NPs resulted in a substantial reduction in the pace of mortality as well as the stages of oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Also, MgO NPs (100 μg/mL) meaningfully restored CP-induced increase of TNF-α (P < 0. 001) and decrease of AChE activity (P < 0. 001) and were capable of preventing CP-treated human lymphocytes from apoptosis (P < 0. 001).
