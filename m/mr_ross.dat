He was orphaned at age thirteen and {{was put in}} the care of his father's brother-in-law, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross.</b> Williams took an apprenticeship under <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> and studied his profession in the Clerk's office of Frederick, eventually taking charge of the office. At age eighteen, Williams moved to Baltimore and undertook a similar trade. Williams returned to Frederick in 1774 and entered into a commercial life.|$|E

He would come over and watch us play golf, {{and most of the}} time the captain and colonel hauled me over there. They didn't know who <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> was, but the other fellow walking with him was JC Penney, and they all knew him." ...|$|E

60|$|After dinner <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross</b> came in. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross</b> lived down on {{the shore}} road and made a living {{for herself and her}} two {{children}} by washing and doing days' work out. She was not a very cheerful person and generally spoke as if on the point of bursting into tears. She looked more doleful than ever today, and lost no time in explaining why.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross,</b> {{you know}} all I know; and I leave it to your {{discretion}} how much, if any of it, you will tell Miss Trelawny." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> disregarded {{her letter}} for ten days, then so {{urgently}} telephoned {{her to come}} and see him that she took a taxicab clear to the Pemberton Building in Long Island City. After paying a week's lunch money for the taxicab, it was rather hard to discover why <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> had been quite so urgent. He rolled about his magnificent mahogany and tapestry office, looked out of the window at the Long Island Railroad tracks, and told her (in confidence) what fools all the Gas Gazette chiefs had been, and all his employers since then. She smiled appreciatively, and tried to get in a tactful remark about a position. She did discover that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> had not as yet chosen his secretary at Pemberton's, but beyond this Una could find no evidence that he supposed her to have come for any reason other than to hear his mellow wisdom and even mellower stories.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} are come, for I have {{something}} to tell you. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> has been up to see me, you know, and he has a letter from Guy.' ...|$|E
60|$|She was <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross's</b> daughter, a {{strapping}} {{young woman}} with handsome features and remarkably handsome black eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross</b> {{shook her}} head scornfully, as if drink was a {{weakness}} beneath the weakest of Island McGill.|$|R
60|$|It {{was from}} the skipper of a Glasgow tramp, as {{passenger}} from Colombo to Rangoon, that I had first learned {{of the existence of}} Island McGill; and it was from him that I had carried the letter that gave me entrance to the house of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross,</b> widow of a master mariner, with a daughter living with her and with two sons, master mariners themselves and out upon the sea. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross</b> did not take in boarders, and it was Captain Ross's letter alone that had enabled me to get from her bed and board. In the evening, after my encounter with Margaret Henan, I questioned <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ross,</b> and I knew on the instant that I had in truth stumbled upon mystery.|$|R
6000|$|Jennie {{gave him}} a shove. [...] "Go dress for dinner. The Colonel {{and his wife and}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> are coming in to congratulate you, and you must pretend to be overjoyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad to do so, at once. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> has kindly told me that I am at liberty to resign my post, under him, as soon as I like." ...|$|E
60|$|HAVING made a {{very fine}} and {{interesting}} collection of the birds of Labuan Tring, I took leave of my kind host, Inchi Daud, and returned to Ampanam to await an opportunity to reach Macassar. As no vessel had arrived bound for that port, I determined to make an excursion into {{the interior of the}} island, accompanied by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross,</b> an Englishman born in the Keeling Islands, and now employed by the Dutch Government to settle the affairs of a missionary who had unfortunately become bankrupt here. Mr. Carter kindly lent me a horse, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> took his native groom.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> {{said they}} had been having a long talk, and she listened, smiling the while that hopeless smile. Then the father rose and said: [...] "Where is Aunt Sarah? I want {{to go down to the}} {{telegraph}} office." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> shook hands. He was {{not exactly}} uncivil, but he was cool--very cool. [...] "I have heard of Mr. Clement," [...] he said. He {{softened}} a little as he {{got a good look}} at the powerful, clear-eyed young fellow.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> {{knew she}} {{meant that he}} must better {{understand}} her loss, {{because he was a}} widower, and was greatly touched, though he only answered by a blessing, a farewell, and a promise to come very soon to see her again.|$|E

60|$|There were {{limits to}} his insanity, {{and he did}} not follow the girl out on the veranda, but when <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> came down a few minutes later to get a cigar Clement plucked the {{proprietor}} of the hotel by the arm.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the persons}} {{who spent a}} forlorn autumn was <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross,</b> though his {{troubles}} were not quite of the same description as those of his young parishioners. He missed his daughter very much; all his household affairs got out of order; the school-girls were naughty, and neither he, nor Miss Edmonstone, nor the mistress, could discover the culprits; their inquiries produced nothing but a wild confusion of mutual accusations, where the truth was undistinguishable. The cook never could find anything to make broth of, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> could, never lay {{his hands on the}} books he wanted for himself or anybody else; and, lastly, none of his shirts ever had their buttons on.|$|E
6000|$|After the service, {{they stood}} talking with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ross</b> and Mary, for some little time. Amy held apart, and Mary saw how it was. As {{they were about}} to turn homewards, Amy said quickly, 'Come and walk a little way home with me.' ...|$|E
