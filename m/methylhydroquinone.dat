40|$|The {{phototransformation}} of 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol was studied using distilled water, solutions of humic {{substances and}} natural waters. Samples were irradiated at 280 nm, with polychromatic lamps emitting within the wavelenght ranges 290 - 350 and 300 - 450 nm or exposed to sunlight. The photolysis of 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol at 280 nm in pure aerated water leads to methylbenzoquinone {{as the main}} primary photoproduct; the quantum yield of the direct photolysis is equal to 0. 66. When 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol is irradiated alone by polychromatic light or exposed to solar-light, <b>methylhydroquinone</b> and methylhydroxybenzoquinone are found as main photoproducts because secondary photolysis of methylbenzoquinone occurs. Humic substances enhance the rate of photodegradation of 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol at lambda > 300 nm. In these conditions, 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol is transformed into <b>methylhydroquinone,</b> methylhydroxybenzoquinone essentially via direct photolysis and into 3 -chloro-trans-trans and cis-trans- 1 -methyl- 1 -one- 2, 4 -hexadienoic acids through photoinduced reactions. These four photoproducts are found when 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenol is irradiated in natural waters at lambda > 300 nm.

The {{goal of this}} study is to engineer toluene monooxygenases to explore different hydroxylation reactions for making industrially-important singly- or doubly-hydroxylated aromatic products such as 1 -naphthol (15, 000 ton/yr market). It was discovered that wild type toluene 4 -monooxygenase (T 4 MO) from Pseudomonas mendocina KR 1, toluene para-monooxygenase (TpMO, formally toluene 3 -monooxygenase) from Ralstonia pickettii PKO 1, and toluene ortho-monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia G 4 perform three successive hydroxylations of benzene. To control these successive hydroxylations, two-phase reactors have also been designed to produce phenol from benzene and 2 -naphthol from naphthalene using T 4 MO. In addition, toluene 3 -monooxygenase was discovered to hydroxylate monosubstituted benzenes predominantly at the para position, instead of the meta position as was reported previously, and was renamed as TpMO. Hence, the toluene degradation pathway was modified for R. pickettii PKO 1 to explain the physiological significance of the different hydroxylation pattern. ^ T 4 MO was discovered here to oxidize nitrobenzene to 4 -nitrocatechol, to oxidize naphthalene to 1 -naphthol (52 %) and 2 -naphthol (48 %), to oxidize o-cresol to 3 -methylcatechol (91 %) and <b>methylhydroquinone</b> (9 %), to oxidize m-cresol and p-cresol to 4 -methylcatechol (100 %), as well as to oxidize o-methoxyphenol to 4 -methoxyresorcinol (87 %), 3 -methoxycatechol (11 %), and methoxyhydroquinone (2 %). T 4 MO and TpMO mutants capable of synthesizing hydroxylated products with high efficiency and different regiospecificity were discovered through protein engineering via directed evolution and saturation mutagenesis at various positions of the α subunits TmoA and TbuA 1 (I 100, G 103, A 107, T 201, F 205, A 213, and E 214).

Quinones alone are relatively benign to bacteria, but in combination with copper, they become toxic by a mechanism that leads to intracellular thiol depletion.

The operon is {{under the control of}} CopR, which also regulates expression of the copRZA copper resistance operon as well as other L. [*]lactis genes. Expression of the yahCD-yaiAB operon is induced by copper but not by quinones. Two of the proteins encoded by the operon appear to play key roles in alleviating quinone/copper stress: YaiB is a flavoprotein that converts p-benzoquinones to less toxic hydroquinones, using reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as reductant; YaiA is a hydroquinone dioxygenase that converts hydroquinone putatively to 4 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde in an oxygen-consuming reaction. Hydroquinone and <b>methylhydroquinone</b> are both substrates of YaiA. Deletion of yaiB causes increased sensitivity of L.

The photo-oxidation of <b>methylhydroquinone</b> and 4 -methylcatechol, two intermediates detected in the photodegradation of cresols, also leads to total mineralization to CO 2.

However, the microbial degradation of 3 M 4 NP at molecular and biochemical levels remains unknown. Here, methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (MBQ) and <b>methylhydroquinone</b> (MHQ) ，rather than catechol proposed previously, were identified as the intermediates before ring cleavage during 3 M 4 NP degradation by Burkholderia sp. strain SJ 98. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that the pnpABA 1 CDEF cluster involved in para-nitrophenol (PNP) and 2 -chloro- 4 -nitrophenol (2 C 4 NP) catabolism was also likely responsible for 3 M 4 NP degradation in this strain. Purified PNP 4 -monooxygenase (PnpA) is able to catalyze the monooxygenation of 3 M 4 NP to MBQ and exhibited an apparent Km value of 20. 3 ± 2. 54 μM for 3 M 4 NP, and pnpA is absolutely necessary for the catabolism of 3 M 4 NP by gene knock-out and complementation. PnpB, a 1, 4 -benzoquinone reductase catalyzes the reduction of MBQ to MHQ, and also found to enhance PnpA activity in vitro in the conversion of 3 M 4 NP to MBQ. By sequential catalysis assays, PnpCD, PnpE and PnpF were likely involved in the lower pathway of 3 M 4 NP catabolism. Although NpcCD, NpcE and NpcF are able to catalyze the sequential conversion of MHQ in vitro, these enzymes are unlikely involved in 3 M 4 NP catabolism because their coding genes were not upregulated by 3 M 4 NP induction in vivo. These results revealed that the enzymes involved in PNP and 2 C 4 NP catabolism were also responsible for 3 M 4 NP degradation in strain SJ 98. This fills a gap in our understanding of the microbial degradation of 3 M 4 NP at molecular and biochemical levels and also provides another example to illustrate the adaptive flexibility in microbial catabolism for structurally similar compounds...|$|E

This confirms the distinctive feature of PPOs, especially tyrosinase, in exhibition of catecholase activity, and enhances the link to POs that were described for their ability in oxidizing ortho-dihydroxylated compounds. When comparing A. chroococcum PO-comprising crude extracts and P. cinnabarinus PO preparations, similar activities towards methyl-, methoxy- and alkyl substituted catechols were determined. Hydroquinoid substrates belonging to group 4 that were designated as substrates for explicit differentiation of PO activity from PPO activity were found to be oxidized by A. chroococcum as well as P. cinnabarinus crude PO. In this respect, tyrosinase was interestingly determined to be active in the oxidation of 1, 4 -dihydroxylated compounds such as <b>methylhydroquinone,</b> methoxyhydroquinone and tert-butylhydroquinone. Despite the aforementioned differences of POs and PPOs on the basis of activity towards 1, 2 - and 1, 4 -dihydroxylated substrates, with the examined model compounds of group 4 in conjunction with bacterial and fungal crude PO; we observed an extended time range in which measurements must be conducted due to lower activities when compared to ortho-dihydroxylated substrates. Generally, 2, 6 -dimethoxy-hydroquinone was the most preferred compound of A. chroococcum crude PO as well as P. cinnabarinus PO preparations, whereby other tested hydroquinoid compounds revealed two to seven-fold diminished activity for PO-containing extracts of A. chroococcum. With melanin-precursors and related compounds (group 5) A. chroococcum crude PO was able to activate the monophenolic compound 4 -hydroxyindole as well as 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine (L-DOPA) and dopamine with comparable activity, whereby fungal PO preparations revealed slightly lower values. In comparison to both POs, tyrosinase from mushroom exhibits up to seven times increased activity rates when using L-DOPA and dopamine as substrates. This observation confirms that these ortho-dihydroxylated compounds are appropriate substances for determining catecholase activity expressed by tyrosinases, whereby tyrosine is the sole substrate that was converted by mushroom tyrosinase during the herein described spectrophotometric examinations. As expected, activity towards tyrosine could not be monitored with A. chroococcum and P. cinnabarinus enzyme preparations.|$|E

Macular dystrophies such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) are characterized by the accumulation of a mixture of components called lipofuscin. The accumulation of lipofuscin has been correlated with exposure to ambient radiation and loss of photoreceptors. The main fluorescent component of lipofuscin is a compound called A 2 -E, which is a derivative of all- trans-retinal and ethanolamine. The exact details of the mechanism of formation of lipofuscin are not fully understood, including the role that ambient radiation plays in the process, though photooxidative mechanisms are thought to be involved. The bulk of this work consists of investigations of the photooxidative properties of all-trans-retinal and the photophysical and photochemical properties of HIDD and PE-HIDD (isolated from ABCR knockout mouse retinas), condensation products of all-trans-retinal and ethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. These compounds are likely precursors for A 2 -E formation, as is A 2 -PE. The data for PE-HIDD are preliminary, as are data from a study of optimum synthetic conditions for A 2 -PE. Time resolved and steady state techniques have been used to examine the photophysical properties of HIDD, protonated HIDD (HIDD-H+) and PE-HIDD and to determine the photoreactivities of these compounds and RAL towards several suitable substrates.

Here, the largest enhancements in V 350 F and V 350 M activity were for the synthesis of methoxyhydroquinone from o-methoxyphenol and <b>methylhydroquinone</b> from o-cresol. For the first time, random mutagenesis of a nitroarene dioxygenase was performed. ^ Saturation mutagenesis of the naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Ralstonia sp. strain U 2 at position F 350 of the α-subunit (NagAc) created variant F 350 T that was able to degrade 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (26 DNT) to 3 -methyl- 4 -nitrocatechol (3 M 4 NC), aw well as 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrotoluene (2 A 46 DNT) to 3 -amino- 4 -methyl- 5 -nitrocatechol (3 A 4 M 5 NC) and 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrobenzyl alcohol (2 A 46 DNBA) (wild-type NDO has no activity on these two substrates). DNA shuffling of NDO nagAcAd generated the beneficial NagAc mutations G 407 S, which enhanced the reactions catalyzed by the NagAc variant F 350 T 3 -fold, and L 225 R, which increased the degradation rate of 4 -amino- 2 -nitrotoluene, generating 4 -amino- 2 -nitrobenzyl alcohol and 4 -amino- 2 -nitrocresol, and 23 DNT, generating 2, 3 -dinitrobenzyl alcohol and 4 -methyl- 3 -nitrocatechol. For the first time, random mutagenesis of NagAc discovered two new residues, G 407 and L 225, which influence the regiospecificity of Rieske, non-heme dioxygenases. ^ Combining two different terminal oxygenase components with single electron transfer components, we created novel hybrid dioxygenase systems for the degradation of aromatic pollutants. In the presence of naphthalene, the engineered orthric dioxygenase NDO-R 34 DDO (nagAa-dntAcAd-nagAbAcAd) increased the formation rate of 4 M 5 NC from 24 DNT 2 -fold relative to R 34 DDO alone (NDO does not oxidize 24 DNT). The construct R 34 DDO-NBDO (dntAa-nbzAcAd-dntAbAcAd) generated 3 A 4 M 5 NC and 2 A 46 DNBA from 2 A 46 DNT 4 -fold and 3 -fold faster, respectively, than NBDO alone and formed 3 A 6 M 5 NC from 4 A 26 DNT (R 34 DDO alone has no activity on 4 A 26 DNT). This is the first report to describe a Rieske dioxygenase system capable of simultaneously degrading mixtures of 24 DNT/naphthalene or 2 A 46 DNT/ 4 A 26 DNT, and to expand the substrate range of a Rieske dioxygenase by investigating the compatibility of the ferredoxin subunit with a dual terminal dioxygenase system. ^ Through chemical mutagenesis methods, the Burkholderia sp. strain DNT variant DNT- 8 was generated with a 2 -fold increase in the rate of 24 DNT degradation, a 3 -fold increase in the formation rate of 4 M 5 NC, and a 2 -fold increase in the nitrite release rate compared wild-type strain DNT. In addition, the variant DNT- 8 was able to degrade 4 M 5 NC 6 -fold faster than wild-type DNT. This is the first report to enhance the degradation of nitroaromatic compounds through random chemical mutagenesis. ...|$|E
