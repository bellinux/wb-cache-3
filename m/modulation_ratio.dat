50|$|Fluorescence lifetimes can be {{determined}} in the frequency domain by a phase-modulation method. The method uses a light source that is pulsed or modulated at high frequency (up to 500 MHz) such as an LED, diode laser or a continuous wave source combined with an electro-optic modulator or an acousto-optic modulator. The fluorescence is (a.) demodulated and (b.) phase shifted; both quantities {{are related to the}} characteristic decay times of the fluorophore. Also, y-components to the excitation and fluorescence sine waves will be modulated, and lifetime can {{be determined}} from the <b>modulation</b> <b>ratio</b> of these y-components. Hence, 2 values for the lifetime {{can be determined}} from the phase-modulation method. The lifetimes are determined through a fitting procedures of these experimental parameters.

This bar is named as 0 reference pulse (or simply 0 pulse). The oscillogram of the 0 pulse is a pulse with a level more than the maximum level of the CVS. Taking the level difference between the sycn tip and the 0 pulse as % 100, the maximum CVS should be 10% or 12.5%. The adjustment of the modulation index is simply the level adjustment of the modulating signal (CVS) at the input of the modulator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, short- and {{long-term}} temporal dynamic information is investigated {{for the blind}} measurement of room acoustical parameters. In particular, estimators of room reverber-ation time (T 60) and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) are proposed. Short-term temporal dynamic information is ob-tained from differential (delta) cepstral coefficients. The statistics computed from the zeroth-order delta cepstral sequence serve as input features to a support vector T 60 estimator. Long-term temporal dynamic cues, on the other hand, are obtained from an auditory spectrotemporal representation of speech {{commonly referred to as}} modulation spectrum. A measure termed as rever-beration-to-speech <b>modulation</b> energy <b>ratio,</b> which is computed per modulation frequency band, is proposed and serves as input to T 60 and DRR estimators. Experiments show that the proposed estimators outperform a baseline system in scenarios involving reverberant speech with and without the presence of acoustic background noise.

The case of high and low switching frequency for the converter cells are investigated and the interaction between voltage and current harmonics is analyzed.
