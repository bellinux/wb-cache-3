5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|Lytle {{also stated}} that he was [...] "burnt out on touring" [...] and cited his fears over his drug and alcohol {{problems}} {{as a factor in}} the band's split, and in 2009 he expressed his preference for being solo, saying that he was [...] "a bit of a loner", and, referring to his former bandmates, stated: [...] "The main thing is not having four girlfriends to lug around with <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time." ...|$|E

At the time, he did not reveal that this was for research, and instead pretended to have a dying relative. According to Maxtone-Graham, the tour helped him find out [...] "all about urns versus coffins, and cremation. I asked sort of questions about, 'Well, do the bodies smell?' They were very nice and gave <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> answers. It was quite fascinating." ...|$|E

500|$|On 3December 1954, Cresswell led a {{formation}} of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires {{in the shape}} of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its return from Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. His successor as commanding officer of the conversion unit took over on 27March 1956. Cresswell was posted to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as Director of Air Staff Policy. The position put him in line for promotion to group captain but, as he admitted later, [...] "I had itchy feet and I felt the Service had already given <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> operational flying I was likely to get." [...] He decided to resign his commission in December 1956, and was discharged from the RAAF on 30April 1957.|$|E

But Heikkinen viewed his size as an asset: “My size had been a help rather than a hindrance. It is easier for a small man {{to pull out of}} the line and run interference than a big one. I had no trouble out-charging big men; it was the small men who gave <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> trouble.” ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{continues}} with another verse and subsequent chorus, when the bass finally enters. After the next verse an E major seven chord again marks a break {{before the start}} of the chorus.

[...] After Kiedis cues [...] "One time," [...] a choir, whose presence was added to make the ending sound more epic, sings [...] "Under the bridge downtown," [...] in which Kiedis sings [...] "Is where I drew some blood/I could not get enough/Forgot about my love/I gave my life away" [...] in between. As the choir, Kiedis and drums stop, Frusciante and Flea play the outro until the song ends.|$|E

I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable aspect of Johnson's game was his {{blocking}} abilities, for which he received heavy praise. He took pride in it, saying [...] "It {{gave me a chance}} to hit all those people who hit <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time." [...] Quarterback Bobby Layne, a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers, listed Johnson as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. [...] "By 'mean,' I mean vicious, unmanageable, consistently tough," [...] said Layne. [...] "I don't mean dirty." [...] Layne also called Johnson his [...] "bodyguard," [...] saying [...] "Half the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them around long enough.

500|$|Like its predecessor, {{the second}} {{deputation}} went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 Exposition Universelle was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon {{for the first}} time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. [...] "High up in mid-air", he recalled, [...] "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way home." [...] The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal [...] "to remind me of my journey through the air". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.|$|E

She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have {{found it hard to}} do. I've known Ace {{for a long time and}} we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way through."

500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to {{a consent form}} and sign a document authorizing the abortion. [...] She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus. Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E

As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building.

500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
