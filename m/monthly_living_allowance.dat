40|$|SummaryPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to measure {{knowledge}} and attitude about aging and life satisfaction among older Korean adults and to examine the influence of attitude and knowledge about aging on these adults' life satisfaction. MethodsA cross-sectional and correlational design was used. A total of 405 older adults were surveyed using a written questionnaire at six elderly welfare centers in a metropolitan city in South Korea in mid April 2011. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple regression. ResultsThe score of knowledge on aging was below the medium level. Attitude about aging was neutral, and life satisfaction was at the medium level. Variables such as female sex, age, economic status, <b>monthly</b> <b>allowance,</b> <b>living</b> with a spouse, self-rated overall health, knowledge and attitude about aging accounted for 33. 8 % of the total variance in predicting life satisfaction of the older adults. Older age and lower economic status reduced life satisfaction. Being female, having a monthly income of 300, 000 Korea Republic Won or more, living with a spouse, and better knowledge and attitude about aging were associated with enhanced life satisfaction. ConclusionThe effect of knowledge and attitude about aging on life satisfaction is significant. Economic status, living with a spouse and self-rated overall health status are also predictive factors in life satisfaction. Consequently, nursing interventions for education and psychological support to increase knowledge about aging and induce a positive attitude towards it should be developed to improve older adults' life satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|All of {{the grants}} and {{allowances}} paid to students {{by the government}} (State or Com-monwealth) can be classified under one of two categories: expense <b>allowances</b> or <b>living</b> <b>allowances.</b> The article begins by stating the case or need for such direct payments to students. It soon becomes clear that both categories of allowances are provided to equalise opportunity. In the case of expense allowances, the need varies from State to State depending upon the particular State's policies in making free schooling accessible to all students. Living allowances, provided {{to meet the needs}} of the socially and economically disadvantaged, constitute part of a government's package of measures designed to reduce the inequalities of private welfare that exist in our society. The article then focuses briefly on the apparent inequality in <b>living</b> <b>allowance</b> support given to high school students relative to tertiary students. Given the increasing concern for the rate at which students from a disadvantaged home environment drop out of senior schooling, the comparison appears particularly incongruous. In conclusion, the article argues for the identification of expense allowances with State governments and <b>living</b> <b>allowances</b> with the Commonwealth. This would link th...|$|R
