40|$|AbstractUsing {{annual data}} for {{a sample of}} {{developing}} countries, the time-series evidence indicates the allocation of monetary policy shocks, both expansionary and contractionary, between price inflation and output growth. Subsequently, cross-country regressions evaluate factors that underlie the difference in these allocations and their implications. The real effects of monetary shocks increase as the elasticity of aggregate demand increases with respect to monetary shocks. Nonetheless, capacity constraints hamper the output adjustment to monetary shocks and increase price inflation. Across countries, trend output growth increases with the output response to monetary shocks. Consistent with the stabilizing function of monetary policy, the variability of output growth decreases {{in the face of}} <b>monetary</b> <b>fluctuations</b> across countries.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters which examine topics {{at the intersection of}} financial markets and macroeconomics. Two of the sections relate to the valuation of U. S. Treasury and corporate debt while the third understands the role of banking frictions on equity markets. ^ More specifically, the first chapter asks the question, {{what is the role of}} <b>monetary</b> policy <b>fluctuations</b> for the macroeconomy and bond markets? To answer this question we design a novel asset-pricing framework which incorporates a time-varying Taylor rule for monetary policy, macroeconomic factors, and risk pricing restrictions from investor preferences. By estimating the model using U. S. term structure data, we find that <b>monetary</b> policy <b>fluctuations</b> significantly impact inflation uncertainty and bond risk exposures, but do not have a sizable effect on the first moments of macroeconomic variables. <b>Monetary</b> policy <b>fluctuations</b> contribute about 20 % to the variation in bond risk premia. ^ Models with frictions in financial contracts have been shown to create persistence effects in macroeconomic fluctuations. These persistent risks can then generate large risk premia in asset markets. Accordingly, in the second chapter, we test the ability that a particular friction, Costly State Verification (CSV), has to generate empirically plausible risk exposures in equity markets, when household investors have recursive preferences and shocks occur in the growth rate of productivity. After embedding these mechanisms into a macroeconomic model with financial intermediation, we find that the CSV friction is negligible in realistically augmenting the equity risk premium. While the friction slows the speed of capital investment, its contribution to asset markets is insignificant. ^ The third chapter examines how firms manage debt maturity in the presence of investment opportunities. I document empirically that debt maturity tradeoffs play an important role in determining economic fluctuations and asset prices. I show at aggregate and firm levels that corporations lengthen their average maturity of debt when output and investment rates are larger. To explain these findings, I construct an economic model where firms simultaneously choose investment, short, and long-term debt. In equilibrium, long-term debt is more costly than short-term debt and is only used when investment opportunities present themselves in peaks of the business cycle. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a stochastic international growth {{model with}} money and country-specific forcing processes for productivity and money growth rates. Monies are required due to cash-in-advance constraints for consumption goods but the liquidity constraints need not be binding for all periods. An individual can trade claims on future currency units for both countries through government bond markets. Each country specializes {{in the production of}} one of the goods but individual agents can invest, subject to installation costs, in any available technology. Two versions of the model are simulated in order to compare different degrees of international mobility of physical capital. The moments of the forcing processes are calibrated to a sample of U. S. and Canadian data. A perfectly pooled equilibrium solution is computed numerically, using the Marcet method of parameterized expectations and the moments of the endogenous variables are compared to those for the actual data. The interdependence implied by the model is illustrated by a series of impulse responses. Particular attention is focused on the implications of capital mobility, the asymmetry of the forcing processes across countries, the implications of the liquidity constraints, and the interaction between the real and nominal components of the model. For example, with endogenous production, we find that <b>monetary</b> <b>fluctuations</b> cause business cycle behavior in consumption and investment while the effect on goods and asset prices can be substantially different from that in endowment models. We also find that the effects of monetary policy are transmitted to other countries via exchange rate and terms of trade adjustments. ...|$|R

On 22 February 1982, the Belgian government unilaterally decided to devalue the Belgian franc, casting aside the agreement which required a joint decision with its UEBL partner. Luxembourgish authorities were faced with a fait accompli, and were only able to bring about a reduction of the percentage of the devaluation. At one point, the Luxembourgish government contemplated withdrawing from the monetary union. Pierre Werner asked Jelle Zylstra, the former governor of the Nederlandse Bank, to study the viability of a purely national monetary system. Unlike Hjalmar Schacht, who was consulted on the same question in the 1920s, Zylstra concluded that Luxembourg had the capacity to create a separate and independent Luxembourgish monetary entity. However, the currency association remained the centrepiece of the UEBL, which retained great political importance. The Luxembourgish government settled for an expansion of its right to print Luxembourgish notes, and took advantage of the circumstances to pass a law creating an Institut monétaire luxembourgeois (IML) in May 1983. The IML assembled in one institution various powers which had previously been dispersed, such as the printing and management of banknotes and coins, monitoring the financial and banking sector, as well as representing the Grand Duchy in international bodies. The creation of the IML responded to the Luxembourgish government's desire to enter as a full-fledged partner in the decision-making instances which were put in place in the framework of the future European monetary union.|$|R

40|$|What {{caused the}} mid- 2000 s world {{commodity}} price “bubble” {{and the recent}} commodity price growth during the economic recovery after the 2007 - 2009 recession? The classical “supply and demand” interpretation offered by some observers suggests that rapid global industrial growth {{over the past decade}} – the so-called “demand channel” – is the key driver of price growth. Others have argued that recent bouts of commodity price growth were directly related to central banks, especially the U. S. Federal Reserve, injecting too much money or “liquidity” into the financial system. They assert that high commodity prices are a result of excessively loose monetary policy. This paper extends the current research in this area by incorporating emerging economies, the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) nations specifically, into global measures. It is hypothesized that factoring BRIC nations into the analysis provides useful information for examining the relationship between commodity prices and global liquidity that is not captured by advanced country data alone. The statistical model in this paper accounts for the two-way relationships that can exist between output, price, and monetary variables in a globally interconnected system. Various tests of the model consistently suggest that the “demand channel” plays a large part in explaining commodity price growth whether BRIC countries are included or excluded from the analysis. However, excess liquidity may also play a part in explaining price growth. In addition, factoring in BRIC country data leads to the conclusion that unexpected movements in liquidity eventually explain more of the variation in commodity prices than unexpected demand shocks. This specific result is not caught in the sample that only incorporates advanced economies. Therefore, policymakers and researchers should not ignore emerging markets when examining commodity prices and monetary factors in a global context.

The method of estimation of the cyclical components {{is based on the}} application of the Hodrick-Prescott filter to the unobserved trend-cycle components estimated from reduced-form univariate models. The method used to estimate cyclical components offers two advantages over the procedures usually found in the literature. First, the cyclical component is extracted from time series that have been previously seasonally-adjusted using a method which explicitly takes into account the specific characteristics of the data generating process. Second, given that irregular components are excluded from the estimation of the final cyclical components, correlations considered in the characterization of the business cycle are not affected by non-systematic oscillations (noise) in the data. Overall, the pattern observed in the cyclical comovements of the aggregate supply and demand components as well as their levels of relative variability are similar to those observed for other countries. However, some features seem to be specific to the Uruguayan economy: procyclical and low volatility public sector expenditure, cyclical lag of <b>monetary</b> aggregate <b>fluctuations</b> and countercyclical interest rates.

To highlight the genuine uncertainty surrounding the lessons to be drawn, the paper examines recent experience through two intentionally polarised perspectives, viz. the "continuity" and "new-environment" views. These perspectives lead to somewhat different conclusions regarding the nature of the challenges central banks are likely to face in the current economic landscape and the policy responses that may be appropriate. While the continuity view stresses the reliability of traditional policy benchmarks, the newenvironment view suggests that it may be worth considering assigning greater weight to the build-up of financial imbalances when calibrating policy. Such an approach could be consistent with current policy frameworks, but it would point to a somewhat longer horizon for evaluating policy alternatives as well as greater attention to the balance of risks to the outlook. business <b>fluctuations,</b> <b>monetary</b> stability, financial imbalances, inflation, monetary policy, financial stability...|$|R

Another implication of the variable-time-preference model is that, unlike the fixed time preference model, the business cycle features in high inflation and low inflation economies can be very different. The contribution of <b>monetary</b> shocks to <b>fluctuations</b> increases partly because endogenous time preference accentuates inflation-tax effects, which are already present in the standard framework {{because of the presence of}} cash-in-advance constraints.
