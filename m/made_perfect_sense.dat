She {{went on to}} perform the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Clear Channel Communications's Stripped. Swift performed [...] the song on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to July 2010. During each performance, Swift escorted a silver sparkly dress and black boots and played an acoustic guitar as floral patterns with a moving butterfly were projected on the stage. Alice Fisher of The Observer attended the May 7, 2009 concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and said that while Swift drifted off during the performance, it [...] "clearly <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense</b> to {{the girls in the}} audience." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reported that the audience loudly sang along to the performance of [...] "Fearless" [...] at the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The song is also performed on the Speak Now World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense.</b> Out {{in the middle of}} the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E

50|$|The Georgia Railroad {{decided to}} extend the Madison branch to Terminus (Atlanta) and thereby compete with the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia (later the Central of Georgia Railroad), which {{together}} with the Macon & Western Railroad, was competing for traffic through Charleston's rival port of Savannah, Georgia. By 1850, this railroad had built 213 mi of track and was up to 232 mi by 1860. At the time, goods from the Mississippi and Ohio valleys had to go by riverboat to New Orleans and then via coastal steamships around the Florida Keys, {{to get to the}} big population centers in the Northeast. Shipping cross-country by rail to the ports of Charleston and Savannah <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> economic <b>sense.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a 1973 {{interview}} Vonnegut {{discussed his}} inspiration {{to write the}} book: I was working for General Electric at the time, right after World War II, and I saw a milling machine for cutting the rotors on jet engines, gas turbines. This was a very expensive thing for a machinist to do, to cut what is essentially one of those Brâncuși forms. So they had a computer-operated milling machine built to cut the blades, and I was fascinated by that. This was in 1949 and the guys who were working on it were foreseeing all sorts of machines being run by little boxes and punched cards. Player Piano was my response to the implications of having everything run by little boxes. The idea of doing that, you know, <b>made</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense.</b> To have a little clicking box make all the decisions wasn't a vicious thing to do. But it was too bad for the human beings who got their dignity from their jobs. [...] In the same interview he acknowledges that he [...] "cheerfully ripped off the plot of Brave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's We." ...|$|R

2500|$|But in late 1990, {{while driving}} in Arizona {{en route to}} a show in Las Vegas, Nevada, the group's tour bus crashed, and drummer Andy Galeon was {{critically}} injured, needing more than a year to recover. Cavestany said at the time that [...] "n a way, it <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense</b> to have a major accident right now, it really fit the story line. We've been pushing so hard for 8 years and just not getting that far, and getting so frustrated with not being where we should be after so long, it was time for something climactic to happen!" [...] Following the accident, Geffen Records and the band's manager pressured the group to hire another drummer and immediately go back to work. The band performed a few shows in Japan with drummer Chris Kontos, but when they declined to hire a long-term replacement, Geffen Records dropped them.|$|E
2500|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of the English army caught the Norwegians by surprise. [...] Their response was to deploy rapidly [...] in a defensive circle. If the Norwegians were located at Battle Flats, {{there is no good}} explanation as to why they deployed into this formation. However, if they were located {{on the east side of}} the Derwent, the deployment <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense.</b> [...] By the time the bulk of the English army had arrived, the Vikings on the west side were either slain or fleeing across the bridge. The English advance was then delayed by the need to pass through the choke-point presented by the bridge itself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has it that a giant Norse axeman (possibly armed with a Dane Axe) blocked the narrow crossing and single-handedly held up the entire English army. The story is that this axeman cut down up to 40 Englishmen and was defeated only when an English soldier floated under the bridge in a half-barrel and thrust his spear through the planks in the bridge, mortally wounding the axeman.|$|E
2500|$|One early {{reviewer}} of The Marvelous Land of Oz {{noted that}} some details in the book clearly appeared to be designed for stage production—in particular, [...] "General Jinjur and her soldiers are only shapely chorus girls." [...] Since the stage adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz had been a huge hit, with two companies still touring the country as the second book was published, the reviewer's suspicion was both natural and accurate: Baum wrote a stage adaptation called The Woggle-Bug that was produced in Chicago the summer of 1905. (The detail of Tip/Ozma's sex change, which can raise a range of psychological speculations in modern readers, <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense</b> in terms of early twentieth-century stage practice, since the juvenile male role of Tip would have been played by an actress {{as a matter of}} course.) The musical score was composed by Frederic Chapin, and Fred Mace played the Woggle-Bug. (Baum had wanted Fred Stone and David Montgomery to reprise their roles as the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman for the second show, but the two refused, fearing typecasting, and the characters were omitted completely from the play.) The play was not successful.|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey's death shocked Laura Morgan from All About Soap, {{who could}} not believe that she was writing about her death. She felt that it was so {{unexpected}} she would never have foreseen the scenario [...] "in a million years". Sarah Ellis from rival magazine Inside Soap shared Morgan's sentiments, branding it [...] "the mother of all shocks". Ellis said that she did not see it coming and concluded that she would miss Lynsey, who was on the path of becoming one of her [...] "favourite Hollyoaks characters". Heat columnist Sophie Wilkinson felt that the episode dealing with the aftermath of Lynsey's death was a [...] "shocker" [...] and questioned [...] "Who could kill butter-wouldn't-melt nurse Lynsey?" [...] Langford also expressed shock at her exit, saying that soaps rarely ever surprise him due to there predictability. He wrote that he did not [...] "see Lynsey's death coming because it was so sudden. One moment she was there and the next she was gone. It was swift and out of nowhere, yet her death not only <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense,</b> it has galvanized this show in a way that has been missing for so long. Because of Lynsey's death, various disparate storylines and plots are finally coming together under one intriguing umbrella arc".|$|E
2500|$|The latter-day line-up of The Byrds, {{featuring}} McGuinn, White, Parsons, and Battin, {{was regarded}} by critics and audiences as being much more accomplished in concert than previous configurations of The Byrds had been. This being the case, it <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense</b> {{to capture the}} band's sound in a live environment and so, in February and March 1970, two consecutive New York concert appearances were recorded. The first of these was the band's performance at Queens College's Colden Center Auditorium on February 28, 1970, with the second being their performance at the Felt Forum on March 1, 1970. (Untitled) featured recordings from both of these concerts, spliced together {{to give the impression}} of a single continuous performance. Of the seven live tracks featured on the album, [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star", [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "Mr. Spaceman", and [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] were drawn from the Queens College performance, while [...] "Lover of the Bayou", [...] "Positively 4th Street", and [...] "Nashville West" [...] originated from the Felt Forum show. The appearance on the live LP of the band's earlier hit singles [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star", and [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] had the effect of forging a spiritual and musical link between The Byrds' current line-up and the original mid-1960s incarnation of the band.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{outlined}} for automatically designing sensors from the specification of a robot 2 ̆ 7 s task, its actions, and its uncertainty in control. The sensors provide precisely the information {{required by the}} robot to perform its task, despite uncertainty in sensing and control. The key idea is to generate a strategy for a robot task by using a backchaining planner that assumes <b>perfect</b> <b>sensing</b> while taking careful account of control uncertainty. The resulting plan indirectly specifies a sensor that tells the robot when to execute which action. Although the planner assumes <b>perfect</b> <b>sensing</b> information, the sensor need not actually provide perfect information.

50|$|After his death, Hodge's {{work had}} {{for the most part}} fallen into obscurity and had been forgotten. Then, in 1983, a large cache of his watercolors was found in a {{battered}} and dusty red album and bought from an African antiques dealer peddling his wares at the Camden Lock Market. Many of the paintings were subsequently offered for sale at Sotheby's in 1985.

50|$|Another {{reason for}} {{operating}} separate airlines under one parent company {{was the fact}} that German law does not permit flight attendants to fly more than two different types of aircraft families. During fleet transition periods, however, airlines are allowed to have flight attendants qualified on up to three aircraft. At the time LTU Süd was opened, LTU already flew Tristar L1011s and MD11s. In 1994 LTU started acquiring A330-300s to replace the aging Tristars. It <b>made</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>sense</b> for LTU to operate LTU Süd with smaller more efficient 757/767 aircraft with a separate group of employees.|$|E
