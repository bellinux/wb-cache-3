5|$|Along the route, if a settler {{needed the}} BX to stop, they simply raised a white flag along the {{riverbank}} and the steamer would pull over and land. A white flag was never ignored, it <b>might</b> <b>only</b> be a settler wanting to ship some produce to market, {{or it could}} be a sick child that needed emergency transportation to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings <b>might</b> <b>only</b> be {{as old as the}} early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their horses to sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth <b>might</b> <b>only</b> have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise <b>might</b> <b>only</b> affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|Several {{strands of}} the SAF {{in the eastern}} region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward–Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault {{exhibits}} fault creep, {{but it also has}} potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward earthquake that occurred on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a ~M6.5 shock that occurred in 1911, the central and southern segments <b>might</b> <b>only</b> produce smaller events and fault creep.|$|E
5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it <b>might</b> <b>only</b> be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E

5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. Within sight of the U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it <b>might</b> <b>only</b> apply to those in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she <b>might</b> <b>only</b> serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E

25|$|Males do {{not form}} territories or compete over females; {{interference}} between males <b>might</b> <b>only</b> happen when two males present their abdomens simultaneously. On the other hand, females do not choose between males. Mating {{is more or}} less random; therefore, male reproductive success is directly related to courtship frequency.|$|E
25|$|As a {{practical}} approach, not all {{elements in the}} Internet of things run in a global, public space. Subsystems are often implemented to mitigate the risks of privacy, control and reliability. For example, Domestic Robotics (Domotics) running inside a smart home <b>might</b> <b>only</b> share data within and be available via a local network.|$|E

25|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} such as deep {{vein thrombosis}} and pulmonary embolism are relatively common following hip replacement surgery. Standard treatment with anticoagulants is for 7–10 days; however treatment for more than 21 days may be superior. Research from 2013 has {{on the other hand}} suggested that anticoagulants in otherwise healthy patients undergoing a so called fast track protocol with hospital stays under five days, <b>might</b> <b>only</b> be necessary while in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|A {{repeat of}} the thorium-experiment using the {{superior}} method of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) failed to confirm the results, despite a 100-fold better sensitivity.

It is still possible that traces of unbibium <b>might</b> <b>only</b> exist in some thorium samples, although this is unlikely.|$|E

25|$|Such an assumption, however, is {{questioned}} as neighbourhoods gatherings <b>might</b> <b>only</b> be {{attended by}} {{a small number of}} constituents. However, it has been noted that the regular visits by the MP during the Courtesy Campaign have allowed the MPs to come into more regular contact with the constituents, widening his or her scope of contact, ultimately creating a closer working relationship between the MPs, representing the government and the people.|$|E
25|$|Investment bank {{securitize}}rs {{were more}} willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed {{the performance of their}} MBSs, private securitizers generally did not, and <b>might</b> <b>only</b> retain a thin slice of risk. Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps, making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern.|$|E

On certain Great Feasts (and, according to some traditions, every Sunday) a special All-Night Vigil (Agrypnia) will be celebrated from late at night {{on the eve of the}} feast until early the next morning. Because of its festal nature it is usually followed by a breakfast feast shared together by the congregation.|$|E
