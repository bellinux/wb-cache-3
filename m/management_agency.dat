5|$|Shortly after, on July 13, two Disaster Recovery Centers {{opened to}} provide {{information}} {{to those who have}} suffered damage. The next day, state and federal community relations teams were deployed into Alabama’s disaster-declared counties, to assist residents who suffered from Dennis. The Alabama Emergency <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (AEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (FEMA) had 20federal community relations specialists and their state counterparts working in the disaster areas. Subsequently, three more Disaster Recovery Centers became scheduled to open on July 16.|$|E
5|$|A Red Cross shelter at Seldon Park, Brunswick, Georgia, {{opened for}} two days {{following}} the storm to temporarily house those whose houses were flooded. Tammy's remnant low was absorbed a larger extratropical low which tracked north {{and contributed to the}} Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005, which killed ten people and caused significant damage. As a result of the flooding, the Federal Emergency <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> paid $44million in losses.|$|E

40|$|Why does {{overfishing}} {{persist in}} the face of regulation?” The author argues that over fishing,a fundamental cause of the crisis facing our oceans, {{is the result of the}} failure of our fishing <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> (ultimately our politicians and communities) to embrace a small suite of powerful tools (more correctly strategic approaches) which have been developed to account for uncertainty. Broad success in managing fisheries to achieve sustainability goals will only come if these tools are enthusiastically applied. This will not happen until organisational cultures within fishery <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> undergo a major shift leading to an asset-based biodiversity conservation, rather than resource exploitation, to be placed at the centre of ocean governance. This thesis examines these issues in the context of case studies covering regional, national and provincial (State) fishery <b>management</b> <b>agencies.</b> With the exception of the case study of a regional fishery (the southern ocean krill fishery) all case studies are drawn from Australian experiences. The central recommendation of the thesis is that fishery <b>management</b> <b>agencies,</b> worldwide, should be replaced by biodiversity asset <b>management</b> <b>agencies.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|According to the Federal Emergency <b>Management</b> <b>Agency</b> (FEMA), 1,464 residences {{throughout}} Texas {{were affected}} by Hurricane Humberto. Of these, 25 were destroyed, 96 sustained major damage and 240 sustained minor damage.

In terms of per capita income, Jefferson County sustained the most impact, decreasing by $22.38.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} in progress paper investigates {{the potential of}} Social Media in Australian natural disasters. In social context, the functional needs of disaster <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> and communities are segregated into three dimensions including agency to agency interaction, agency to community interaction and community to community interaction. A framework proposed in this paper explores (a) the nature of interaction and (b) the ability of Social Media in facilitating the functional needs of interaction involving disaster <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> and communities before, during and after a disaster. On {{the next stage of}} this research, multiple case studies with disaster <b>management</b> <b>agencies</b> and focus groups with communities will be conducted to validate the proposed framework...|$|R
