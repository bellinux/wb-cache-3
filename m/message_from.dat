When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a {{prerecorded}} <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Gerald broadcasts: he programmed the ARK to collide with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.|$|E

Actor configurations have receptionists that can receive <b>messages</b> <b>from</b> outside {{and may have}} the addresses of the receptionists of other Actor configurations. In this way two Actor configurations can be composed into another configuration whose subconfigurations can communicate with each other. Actor configurations have the advantage {{that they can have}} multiple Actors (i.e. the receptionists) which receive <b>messages</b> <b>from</b> outside without the disadvantage of having to poll to get <b>messages</b> <b>from</b> multiple sources (see issues with getting <b>messages</b> <b>from</b> multiple channels).|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Lambert {{received}} a <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Hamelin, promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and Iphigenia were both surrendered without resistance. The message also threatened that if Lambert refused, the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force. Recognising that food supplies were low, reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were almost empty, Lambert agreed to the terms. Lambert later received a <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin. Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him, but eventually agreed to accept {{the terms of the}} surrender as well. The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated, although the remainder of the prisoners were placed in a cramped and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which, despite the terms of the surrender, they were not released until British forces captured the island in December.|$|E

Here, in June 1922, he received a <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's untimely death.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the books}} that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A <b>Message</b> <b>from</b> God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E

Although Beaujeu delivered a <b>message</b> <b>from</b> La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having made peace with Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E

Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
