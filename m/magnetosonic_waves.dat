5000|$|The ESA Cluster {{mission has}} enabled {{to find the}} first direct {{evidence}} of cross-scale energy transport between fluid and ion-scale waves, explaining why Earth's magnetic environment is so hot. A Nature Physics paper reveals. The Earth's internal magnetic field creates a giant protective bubble called the magnetosphere, necessary for life to develop. This magnetic bubble helps deflecting more than 99% of the incoming solar wind expelled by the Sun. Due to this interaction, the magnetosphere has a bullet-like shape (see left panel of Figure 1). At its border, the magnetopause, the matter, called plasma, is 50 times hotter inside the Earth's magnetic environment than just outside; a problem that has puzzled scientists {{since the beginning of}} the space age. Why is Earth's environment so hot? How plasma gets heated in a medium where no particles collides? One of the few physical processes enabling solar wind plasma to enter the magnetosphere is called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This instability is ubiquitous in space and on Earth. Such K-H waves have been detected in various media including the surface of oceans, in clouds (see bottom right panel of Image 1), in the solar corona (see top right panel) or in the atmosphere of giant planets. Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves can form at Earth's magnetopause, mainly due to the velocity difference between the plasma flowing outside at higher speed than inside the magnetosphere. Back in 2004, the multi-spacecraft Cluster mission revealed that these waves can roll-up, turning into giant vortices of about 36,000 km size, i.e. about 6 times the Earth's radius (Hasegawa et al., 2004). A new article, published in Nature Physics this month, presents a detailed study of small-scale (ion-scale) wave packets captured by Cluster within such a macroscopic (fluid-scale) Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex. This study reveals for the first time that these wave packets in the eye of the vortex are <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> with sufficient energy to account for the observed level of ion heating. In other words, these waves can heat the cooler ions of magnetosheath origin; magnetosheath is the boundary layer located just outside the magnetopause. These observations may be evidence for cross-scale energy transport in space plasmas. It may have universal consequences in understanding the energy transport from fluid to ion scales, and can play a role in a variety of plasma systems with a velocity shear.|$|E

Propagation both slow magnetosonic wave and Alfven wave {{can easily be}} canalized along the magnetic field line direction. The main {{difference between the two}} is that slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> dissipate strongly due to their interaction with the background plasma ions, whose temperature is above the electron temperature. In Earth’s magnetosphere, however, there is a region where the dissipation of slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> can be weak—the inner plasmasphere.

30|$|As an {{important}} plasma wave mode in the geospace, <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> can interact with both radiation belt electrons and protons, thereby impacting {{the dynamics of}} magnetospheric particles. Based on the Doppler-shifted resonance condition and the cold plasma dispersion relation, we investigate the profiles of resonance zone and resonant frequency of the Landau resonance between radiation belt electrons and <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> and the cyclotron resonances with protons. The results demonstrate that resonant interactions between <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> and magnetospheric charged particles largely rely on L-shell, wave normal angle, and kinetic energy and equatorial pitch angle of particles. Resonance zones for the Landau resonance between <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> and radiation belt electrons are confined to a very narrow (mostly less than 1 °) extent of magnetic latitude, which tends to shift to lower latitudes with increasing equatorial pitch angle and decreasing electron energy. Landau resonance frequencies also increase with magnetosonic wave normal angle. In contrast, higher order cyclotron resonances of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> with protons are much easier to occur in {{a broad range of}} magnetic latitude. As the resonance order increases, the coverage of the resonance zone shrinks overall and occupies the geomagnetic equatorial region. In addition, resonant frequencies increase with resonance order. Corresponding to higher order cyclotron resonances, protons are more likely to interact with <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> at intermediate to high frequencies.

Propagating slow and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> are launched upwards in a lower uniform layer.

The slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> can only be coupled to resonant slow continuum waves. For the fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> there are three possibilities as they can be coupled to resonant Alfvén continuum waves alone, resonant Alfvén continuum waves combined with resonant slow continuum waves, and resonant slow continuum waves alone. The present paper focuses on the absorption of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> by coupling to resonant slow continuum waves either alone or in combination with resonant Alfvén continuum waves. The results show that the resonant absorption of slow and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> at the slow resonance position strongly depends on the characteristics of the equilibrium model and of the driving wave.

30|$|In recent years, {{further studies}} have shown that space plasma waves, {{including}} <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves,</b> can significantly affect the dynamics of the magnetospheric particles (e.g., Horne et al. 2007; Xie et al. 2007; Li et al. 2008; Gu et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2013; Xiao et al. 2015). Based on the Cluster wave observations, Horne et al. (2007) established a model of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> for adoption to compute their quasi-linear bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients. Their results indicated that the Landau resonance caused by <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> is an important potential mechanism to accelerate the radiation belt electrons. Subsequent studies (Mourenas et al. 2013) developed a simplified formula to calculate the quasi-linear diffusion coefficients of radiation belt electrons by <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves.</b> They also reported that the pitch angle scattering effect of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> is weak for electron precipitation losses, but the momentum diffusion is relatively strong for electron energization. Xiao et al. (2015) found that the combined effect of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> and chorus waves with radiation belt electrons can lead to the diffusion of electrons from high pitch angles of ~ 90 ° to intermediate pitch angles, resulting in “butterfly-like’’ electron distributions (Gannon et al. 2007). The significance of Landau resonant scattering by equatorial <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> has been further recognized to account for the formation of energetic electron butterfly distributions in the inner magnetosphere from {{the outer edge of the}} inner zone to much higher L-shells (e.g., Li et al. 2016 a, b; Ma et al. 2016). In addition, magnetosonic wave-induced bounce resonance has been proposed in terms of test particle simulation as a responsible mechanism for the rapid modulation of butterfly distributions (Maldonado et al. 2016). All of the above work focused on the interaction between <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> and radiation belt electrons. In contrast, there was little work about the interaction processes between <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> and protons. A recent study by Xiao et al. (2014) explored the potential contribution of magnetosonic wave scattering to the generation of the proton aurora. Our study clearly demonstrates that radiation belt electrons and protons can undergo resonant interactions with MS waves at the latitudes away from the geomagnetic equator, distinguishing it from most previous studies that focus on MS waves at the equatorial region.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} systematic {{study of the}} equatorial <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> in the Earth's inner magnetosphere, addressing important issues which include the global distribution, energy source, propagation properties, and potential scattering effects. Equatorial <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> are highly oblique whistler-mode electromagnetic emissions between the proton gyrofrequency and the lower hybrid resonant frequency, widely distributed in the Earth's inner magnetosphere, and may potentially cause electron acceleration in the radiation belts. The recent equatorial spacecraft THEMIS and the Van Allen Probes provide excellent observations on equatorial plasma waves. A global survey of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> is performed using THEMIS wave data products. The statistics show that the most intense <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> are distributed near the dayside outside the plasmapause, with maximum root-mean-square averaged wave amplitudes between 50 and 100 pT and occurrence rates between 10 % and 40 %. An instability analysis is performed on a typical magnetosonic wave and locally observed ion ring distribution event. The unstable ion ring distribution could provide free energy for the wave excitation outside the plasmapause or in the outer region of the plasmasphere. Although <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> cannot be excited deep inside the plasmapause, the waves observed there can originate from the outer region and remain trapped in the plasmasphere. The wave perpendicular propagation analysis demonstrates the importance of wave trapping in explaining the wave existence in the plaspasphere.
