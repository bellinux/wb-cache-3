When {{a portion of}} a molecular cloud reaches a critical size, mass, or density, it begins to collapse under its own gravity. As this collapsing cloud, called a solar nebula, becomes denser, random gas motions originally present in the cloud average out in favor of the direction of the nebula's net angular <b>momentum.</b> <b>Conservation</b> <b>of</b> angular <b>momentum</b> causes the rotation to increase as the nebula radius decreases. This rotation causes the cloud to flatten out - much like forming a flat pizza out of dough - and {{take the form of a}} disk. This occurs because centripetal acceleration from the orbital motion resists the gravitational pull of the star only in the radial direction, but the cloud remains free to collapse in the vertical direction. The outcome is the formation of a thin disc supported by gas pressure in the vertical direction [...] The initial collapse takes about 100,000 years. After that time the star reaches a surface temperature similar to that of a main sequence star of the same mass and becomes visible.|$|R

Instead, particles exert forces on electromagnetic fields, and fields exert forces on particles, but particles do not directly exert forces on other particles. Therefore, two nearby particles do not always experience equal and opposite forces. Related to this, Maxwell electrodynamics predicts that the laws <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum</b> and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> angular <b>momentum</b> are valid only if the <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> particles and the <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> surrounding electromagnetic fields are taken into account.

40|$|In a {{continuum}} setting, the energy-momentum tensor embodies {{the relations between}} <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> energy, <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>momentum,</b> and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> angular <b>momentum.</b> The well-defined total energy and the well-defined total momentum in a thermodynamically closed system with complete equations of motion are used to construct the total energy-momentum tensor for a stationary simple linear material with both magnetic and dielectric properties illuminated by a quasimonochromatic pulse of light through a gradient-index antireflection coating. The perplexing issues surrounding the Abraham and Minkowski momentums are bypassed by working entirely with conservation principles, the total energy, and the total momentum. We derive electromagnetic continuity equations and equations of motion for the macroscopic fields based on the material four-divergence of the traceless, symmetric total energy-momentum tensor. We identify contradictions between the macroscopic Maxwell equations and the continuum form <b>of</b> the <b>conservation</b> principles. We resolve the contradictions, which are the actual fundamental issues underlying the Abraham-Minkowski controversy, by constructing a unified version of continuum electrodynamics {{that is based on}} establishing consistency between the three-dimensional Maxwell equations for macroscopic fields, the electromagnetic continuity equations, the four-divergence of the total energy-momentum tensor, and a four-dimensional tensor formulation of electrodynamics for macroscopic fields in a simple linear medium.

Mathematical modeling is how to be able to doing mathematical analysis on the jump shot technique.

40|$|Marsh {{vegetation}} {{is widely}} considered to offer protection against coastal storm damage, and vegetated flow has thus become a key area of hydrodynamic research. This study investigates the utility of simulated Spartina alterniora marsh vegetation as storm protection using an ADV measurement technique, and {{is the first to}} apply jet self-similarity analysis to characterize the overall mean and turbulent flow properties of a three-dimensional axisymmetric jet through a vegetated array. The mean axial flow of a horizontal axisymmetric turbulent jet is obstructed by three configurations of staggered arrays of vertical rigid plant stems. The entire experiment is repeated over five sufficiently high jet Reynolds number conditions to ensure normalization and subsequent collapse of data by nozzle velocity so that experimental error is obtained. All self-similarity parameters for the unobstructed free jet correspond to typical published values: the axial decay coefficient B is 5 : 8 +/- 0 : 2, the Gaussian spreading coefficient c is 85 +/- 5, and the halfwidth spreading rate eta_(1 / 2) is 0 : 093 +/- 0 : 003. Upon the introduction of vegetation, from partially obstructed to fully obstructed, B falls from 5 : 1 +/- 0 : 2 to 4 : 2 +/- 0 : 2 and finally 3 : 7 +/- 0 : 1 for the fully obstructed case, indicating that vegetation reduces axial jet velocity. Cross-sectionally averaged momentum for the unobstructed free jet is M=M 0 = 1 : 05 +/- 0 : 07, confirming <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum.</b> Failure <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum</b> is most pronounced in the fully obstructed scenario ? M=M 0 = 0 : 54 +/- 0 : 05. The introduction of vegetation increases spreading of the impinging jet. The entrainment coefficient alpha for the free jet case is 0. 0575; in the fully obstructed case, alpha = 0 : 0631. Mean advection of mean and turbulent kinetic energy demonstrates an expected reduction in turbulence intensity within the vegetated array. In general, turbulent production decreases as axial depth of vegetation increases, though retains the bimodal profile of the free jet case; the fully vegetated case, however, exhibits clear peaks behind plant stems. Turbulent transport was shown to be unaffected by vegetation and appears to be primarily a function of axial distance from the jet nozzle. An analysis of rate of dissipation revealed that not only does the cumulative effect of upstream wakes overall depress the magnitude of spectral energy density across all wavenumbers but also that plant stems dissipate large anisotropic eddies in centerline streamwise jet flow. This study, thus, indicates that sparse emergent vegetation both reduces axial flow velocity and has a dissipative effect on jet flow. Typically, however, storm surge does not exhibit the lateral spreading demonstrated by an axisymmetric jet; therefore, {{the results of this study}} cannot conclusively support the claim that coastal vegetation reduces storm surge axial velocity...|$|R
40|$|Early civilisations built {{drainage}} systems in urban areas to handle storm runoff. The Romans, in particular, constructed elaborate systems that drained also the wastewaters from the public baths. Reforms saw the constructions of sewer systems in major cities, like Paris, London and in North-America during the 1850 s to 1900 s, and later the generalisation of sewer systems in smaller cities and towns. The primary role of sewers is to carry the wastewaters, or sewage, to a treatment plant. Most large sewer channels operate as free-surface flows. In these open channel flows, the free surface rises and falls in response to changes in discharges, channel slope and width. The driving force of the flow motion is primarily gravity (e. g. sloping channel), sometimes in combination with pressure (e. g. in an inverted siphon). For a given flow rate, the primary unknowns are {{the location of the}} free surface (or flow depth) which is not known beforehand and the flow velocity. The fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering are the equations <b>of</b> continuity or <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> mass, <b>of</b> <b>momentum</b> or <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>momentum,</b> and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> energy. Another equation is the Bernoulli equation which may be derived from the differential form <b>of</b> the <b>momentum</b> principle. Open channel hydraulics is possibly the most complicated field in fluid mechanics. For a given flow rate, there is an infinity of solutions depending upon the bed slope, boundary friction and channel cross-sectional shape. Further the three-dimensional turbulent flow motion is complicated, in particular in non-rectangular channels. But even so, traditional clear-water hydraulics cannot predict the cross-sectional changes of sewer channels caused by the sediment transport processes (deposition, blockage, erosion). It is now recognised that sediment motion is characterised by strong interactive processes between water runoff, sediment erosion resistance, topography of the channel, and stream discharge. In sewers, sediments include a wide range of particle sizes ranging from tens of microns to tens of centimetres. The particles can be inorganic or organic in nature, and their chemical and biological features present significant variations. Sewage sludge and wastewater treatment residues exhibit non-Newtonian characteristics, including thixotropy. Such non-Newtonian behaviour is very rarely accounted for in open channel hydraulic calculations and numerical modelling, although sediment mass flux predictions are intricately linked with the sediment sludge properties, including yield stress, apparent viscosity and degree of jamming. In open channels including sewers, numerous failures resulted from the inability of engineers to predict sediment motion and mass fluxes despite recent advances. In sewer management, the predictions of the mass fluxes remain challenging. The calculations need to be validated and checked with field measurements of both water discharges and sediment fluxes despite the limitations of instrumentation and the limited accuracy...|$|R
