PCC-OFDM is a variation of OFDM in which data is mapped onto adjacent subcarrier pairs. As a result intercarrier interference (ICI) in adjacent subcarriers is cancelled. Phase noise in OFDM causes both ICI and common phase error (CPE). PCC-OFDM reduces the ICI component, but the CPE is unchanged. Theoretical and simulations results for bit error rate (BER) are presented for M-QAM OFDM and PCC-OFDM systems over Rayleigh fading channels. The performance with and without CPE correction at the receiver is considered. It is shown that PCC-OFDM has a lower BER in all cases.

Some examples are conductivity measurements in nanowires, deflection of cantilevers and spectroscopy of plasmonic nanoparticles. The fact that these techniques are based on the special properties of nanostructural entities provides for extreme sensor miniaturization since a single structural unit often can be used as transducer.

As a counterweight to the current research trend, it is argued that in many real world applications, better performance is achieved if the active sensor is larger than that in typical nanosensors. Although there are certain specific sensing applications where nanoscale transducers are necessary, it is argued herein that this represents a relatively rare situation. Instead, it is suggested that sensing on the microscale often offers a good compromise between utilizing some possible advantages of miniaturization while avoiding the complications.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} data detection in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems operating under a time-varying multipath fading channel. Op-timal detection in such a scenario is infeasible, which makes the introduction of approximations necessary. The typical joint data-channel estimators are decision directed, that is, assume perfect past data decisions. However, their performance is subject to error propagation phenomena. The variational Bayes method is employed here, which approximates the joint data and channel distribution as a separable one, greatly simplifying the problem. The data detection part of the resulting algorithm provides soft data estimates that are used for channel tracking. The channel itself is modeled as an autoregressive process allowing for a Kalman-like tracking algorithm. According to the developed algorithm, both data and channel estimates are exchanged and updated in an iterative manner. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulations. Furthermore, since OFDM is extremely sensitive {{to the presence of}} phase noise, the algorithm is extended to operate under severe phase noise conditions, with moderate performance degradation.

For the UWB transceivers to coexist with nearby devices, it is necessary to design efficient UWB receivers whose operation is robust to narrowband interferences (NBI). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis to establish the impacts of NBI on the performance of an OFDM-UWB receiver. A comprehensive study to assess the effects of NBI on the quantization noise in the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), timing, and carrier acquisition is presented. The analytical results show that the efficiency of the ADC is degraded by NBI, although this problem could be slightly remedied by an adaptive autogain controller (AGC). It is also found that, compared with the conventional autocorrelation-based acquisition scheme, the pseudonoise (PN) sequence matched-filtering-based acquisition scheme presents higher robustness to NBI. Nevertheless, both these two acquisition schemes fail at high interference levels. As a conclusion, it is critical to develop novel and low-complexity NBI mitigation schemes for OFDM-UWB receivers that take into account the impacts introduced by NBI.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the most}} severe {{impairments}} that affect co-herent optical systems employing high-order modulation formats is phase noise due to transmit and receive lasers. This is especially detrimental in uncompensated links, where an ideal compensator for channel distortions and laser phase noise should first eliminate receive phase noise, then equalize channel distortions, and only later compensate for transmit phase noise. Unfortunately, the si-multaneous presence of transmit and receive phase noise makes very difficult to discriminate between them, even {{in the presence of}} a pilot tone. Moreover, the picture is different for optical systems using single-carrier or orthogonal frequency divisionmultiplexing, where transmit and receive phase noise components may have a different impact. All these aspects are analyzed and discussed in this paper. A novel digital coherence enhancement (DCE) tech-nique, able to significantly reduce the phase noise of transmit or receive lasers by using an interferometric device plus a very simple electronic processing, is also described. The performance of this technique and the statistical properties of the residual phase noise are analytically derived and verified by simulations, showing a high increase of the maximum bit-rate-distance product.

The use of short pulses poses several prob-lems {{as a result}} of group velocity dispersion (GVD), intersymbol interference (ISI) (due to avalanche photodiode (APD) buildup time), and receivers limited bandwidth. In this paper, an OCDM system employing code-shift keying (CSK) and overlapping pulse-position modulation (OPPM) signaling is proposed and theoreti-cally investigated. By using CSK while maintaining same data rate, the chip duration can be increased to counteract the GVD effect in 2 D OCDM systems. Moreover, by increasing the chip duration, the chip rate is decreased and the stringent requirement on receiver bandwidth is relaxed. In addition, using overlapping property in OPPM allows for further chip duration increase. We consider using correlation receivers with hard-limiters and APDs at the receiver side. The bit error probability (BEP) of the proposed system is derived taking into account the impacts of APD noise, thermal noise, GVD, ISI, and multiple-access interference (MAI). A performance comparison between OOK-, PPM-, OPPM-OCDM and the proposed system is carried out.
