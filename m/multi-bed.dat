The motion focused primarily on facilitating personal choice on dying at home and also on making end-of-life care a core hospital competence. The motion was based on the Irish Hospice Foundation's Audit of End of Life Care. The audit documented that over half the 1000 patients profiled died in <b>multi-bed</b> rooms, only 20-30% of persons received specialist palliative care, and that as many as 25% may have died alone. Speaking to the motion Mullen claimed that [...] "implicit sometimes in our thinking on this issue is the view that policy focus should centre on those with the majority of their lives ahead of them; that dying is a taboo subject better skirted around for the sake of avoiding awkwardness and offence; and that as people gradually lose memory, consciousness, bodily control and even hope, they also lose their dignity".|$|E

30|$|Since non-dominated sorting {{was first}} adopted in NSGA in 1995, most {{evolutionary}} algorithms have employed non-dominated sorting {{as one of}} the major criteria in their environmental selection for solving <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of non-dominated sorting in <b>multi-</b> and many-objective evolutionary algorithms. The effectiveness of non-dominated sorting is verified by considering two popular evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II and KnEA, which were designed for solving <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization problems, respectively. The efficiency of non-dominated sorting is evaluated by comparing several state-of-the-art non-dominated sorting algorithms for <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization problems. These results provide important insights to adopt non-dominated sorting in developing novel <b>multi-</b> and many-objective evolutionary algorithms.|$|R
40|$|The {{interests}} in <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization have been rapidly increasing in the evolutionary computation community. However, most studies on <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization {{are limited to}} small-scale problems, {{despite the fact that}} many real-world <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization problems may involve a large number of decision variables. As has been evident in the history of evolutionary optimization, the development of evolutionary algorithms for solving a particular type of optimization problems has undergone a co-evolution with the development of test problems. To promote the research on large-scale <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization, we propose a set of generic test problems based on design principles widely used in the literature of <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization. In order for the test problems to be able to reflect challenges in real-world applications, we consider mixed separability between decision variables and non-uniform correlation between decision variables and objective functions. To assess the proposed test problems, six representative evolutionary <b>multi-</b> and many-objective evolutionary algorithms are tested on the proposed test problems. Our empirical results indicate that although the compared algorithms exhibit slightly different capabilities in dealing with the challenges in the test problems, none of them are able to efficiently solve these optimization problems, calling for the need for developing new evolutionary algorithms dedicated to large-scale <b>multi-</b> and many-objective optimization...|$|R

To test the effectiveness of our proposed approaches on real test data, we enlarged the training data. First, a DNN acoustic model (denoted as C-T) was trained using 1000 -h close-talking speech. Then two multi-condition DNN models using 2000 -h data were generated, denoted as <b>Multi-</b> 1 and <b>Multi-</b> 2. <b>Multi-</b> 1 was trained using 1000 -h close-talking plus 1000 -h reverberant speech simulated from high-quality clean speech. The only difference of <b>Multi-</b> 2 from <b>Multi-</b> 1 is that the 1000 -h reverberant speech was simulated from the 1000 -h close-talking speech. For simulating the reverberant data, all real and synthetic RIRs were used. We randomly chose 1000 sentences from the training set as our development data.|$|R

50|$|Droplet {{precautions}} {{are intended}} to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation {{are not required to}} prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which droplet precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A and include B. pertussis, influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, N. meningitides, and group A streptococcus (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single patient room is preferred for patients who require droplet precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Spatial separation of > 3 feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in <b>multi-bed</b> rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on droplet precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.|$|E
50|$|Aris {{was then}} {{promoted}} to Technical Officer, where {{he began working}} on chromatography. He utilized results from a paper on dispersion written by Geoffrey Taylor, and extended its results, ultimately writing a paper in 1955 that applied the method of moments to Taylor's approach. He submitted the paper to the Proceedings of the Royal Society, with help from Taylor (who was a Fellow of the Royal Society). Aris communicated with Taylor regarding dispersion and diffusion. In the meantime, however, he was transferred to a different division, where he began working on chemical reactor design. Frustrated with the transfer and with the proprietary nature of his commercial work, which made publishing work very difficult, he {{decided to move to}} a university, applying for several lectureship positions during 1954 and 1955 without success. Aris continued to work at ICI, focusing much of his efforts on mathematical modeling of adiabatic <b>multi-bed</b> reactors, a topic that was the central focus of an M.S. student at the University of Minnesota. In 1955, Neal Amundson of the University of Minnesota, who was on sabbatical at Cambridge, visited the ICI Research Department, where Aris was working. Amundson suggested to ICI, during his visit, that Aris be sent to the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis for a year of study. Several months later, Aris later met Amundson at Cambridge and told Amundson of his plans to leave ICI for academia, plans that he had not revealed to his superiors at ICI. Amundson offered Aris a research fellowship at the University of Minnesota, which Aris accepted. After notifying ICI of his intent to leave, he moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota at the end of 1955.|$|E

5000|$|Homeless {{advocate}} and urban designer Michael E. Arth proposed building a Pedestrian village for the adult homeless in Volusia County near Daytona Beach, Florida in 2007. As of 2009, Arth {{was still working}} toward trying to consolidate most of the scattered 19 local agencies into an attractive community that would be designed to more effectively {{address the needs of}} the chronically adult homeless and the temporarily adult homeless, as well as others who may be having difficulty fitting into the pervasive, automobile-dominated culture. He writes that the current [...] "piecemeal approach" [...] inefficiently spreads out services and work opportunities, and aggravates the problem by polarizing citizens who might otherwise be inclined to help. In response to critics who say that such a village would be like a concentration camp, Arth points out that the U.S. already concentrates their citizens into prisons at 7-8 times the rate of Canada or Europe. [...] "There should be alternative between living on the street and being locked up that addresses the needs of the chronically and temporarily adult homeless." [...] His proposed [...] "Tiger Bay Village" [...] would have a community garden and orchard, a place to hire certified workers, and a work crew to help build and maintain the village. [...] "Little shops in the village center could process and rehabilitate donated clothes and furnishings to be sold to the public." [...] Housing would range from <b>multi-bed</b> barracks to small Katrina cottages depending on a person's contributions to the village, special needs, and income. Arth claims that this would cost less and be far more effective {{than any of the other}} solutions tried elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The gas {{chromatograph}} {{is the most}} commonly used instrumentation for the analysis of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs) worldwide. Recent estimates place the number of GCs currently in use at over 300, 000 instruments. Analysis of ambient atmospheric vapor samples for VOC’s is relevant in industrial safety compliance monitoring, environmental quality monitoring and the diagnostic analysis of human breath. The usefulness of a <b>multi-bed</b> sorption trap using discrete beds of carbon-based sorbents and its use in inlet systems for {{gas chromatograph}}y and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography is demonstrated in this work. The experimental studies presented in this work address different uses of the <b>multi-bed</b> sorption trap for various analyses. These include the analysis of volatile organics in air, the analysis of human breath, and a inlet system designed for pyrolysis-preconcentration with GCxGC. 	Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) is well suited to the analysis of complex samples and is used in the analysis of human breath in this work. Comprehensive two-dimensional separations are achieved by connecting in series two capillary columns using stationary phases of different selectivity by means of a concentration-modulator interface. 	The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate inlets using the sorption-based, <b>multi-bed</b> preconcentrator to solve specific problems relating to the analysis of volatile and semi-volatile compounds. 	Results of the studies presented in this work demonstrate the development of a functional <b>multi-bed</b> sorption based preconcentrator able to collect and inject analytes over a wide range of functionalities and volatilities. Through the addition of a length of thick film capillary column in series with the <b>multi-bed</b> preconcentrator, the effective usable range of the preconcentrator was extended from C 14 to at least C 24.

40|$|The {{metastability}} of inhibitory serpins (serine proteinase inhibitors) {{is thought}} to {{play a key role}} in the facile conformational switch and the insertion of the reactive center loop into the central β-sheet, A-sheet, during the formation of a stable complex between a serpin and its target proteinase. We have examined the folding and inhibitory activity of a very stable variant of human α 1 -antitrypsin, a prototype inhibitory serpin. A combination of seven stabilizing single amino acid substitutions of α 1 - antitrypsin, designated <b>Multi-</b> 7, increased the midpoint of the unfolding transition to almost that of ovalbumin, a non-inhibitory but more stable serpin. Compared with the wild-type α 1 -antitrypsin, <b>Multi-</b> 7 retarded the opening of A-sheet significantly, as revealed by the retarded unfolding and latency conversion of the native state. Surprisingly, <b>Multi-</b> 7 α 1 - antitrypsin could form a stable complex with a target elastase with the same kinetic parameters and the stoichiometry of inhibition as the wild type, indicating that enhanced A-sheet closure conferred by <b>Multi-</b> 7 does not affect the complex formation.

40|$|It was {{the goal}} of this project to {{increase}} the basic understanding of the system dynamics for a class of processes which are characterized by the periodically driven movement of concentration and temperature fronts in fixed beds. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) has been chosen as a typical representative for this class since it is industrially important and - due to the complex interactions between transport and chemical equilibrium - it is so far not sufficiently analyzed and understood. The mathematical modeling and the experimental analysis of non-isothermal pressure swing adsorption systems has been studied using the example of oxygen separation from air. The analysis covered the detailed theoretical analysis and the experimental determination of pure component and multi-component equilibrium. The method-of-lines concept was used for numerical simulation of the fixed-bed dynamics. For <b>multi-bed</b> PSA processes a flexible simulation strategy was developed which allowed the efficient simulation of different <b>multi-bed</b> configurations. Based upon dynamic simulations the basic understanding of the dynamic interactions of <b>multi-bed</b> process could be substantially improved. This led to better design concepts for PSA processes. From the system dynamics point of view the development and adjustment of methods for the efficient analysis of periodically driven processes played an important role. New techniques for a sensitivity analysis of coupled periodic steady state solutions and for a stability analysis of these solutions have been developed using simplified example processes. A Newton-based approach for the direct calculation of the cyclic steady state proved to be particularly suited. Based upon these techniques an efficient analysis, design and optimization of periodically driven fixed-bed processes like pressure swing adsorption will be possible in subsequent projects. (orig.)

40|$|Background Vascular calcified plaque, {{a measure}} of {{subclinical}} cardiovascular disease (CVD), {{is unlikely to be}} limited to a single vascular bed in patients with multiple risk factors. Consideration of vascular calcified plaque as a global phenomenon may allow for a more accurate assessment of the CVD burden. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the utility of a combined vascular calcified plaque score in the prediction of mortality. Methods Vascular calcified plaque scores from the coronary, carotid, and abdominal aortic vascular beds and a derived <b>multi-bed</b> score were examined for associations with all-cause and CVD-mortality in 699 European-American type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) affected individuals from the Diabetes Heart Study. The ability of calcified plaque to improve prediction beyond Framingham risk factors was assessed. Results Over 8. 4 ?. 3 years (mean? tandard deviation) of follow-up, 156 (22. 3 %) participants were deceased, 74 (10. 6 %) from CVD causes. All calcified plaque scores were significantly associated with all-cause (HR: 1. 4 - 1. 8; p?<? 1 x 10 - 5) and CVD-mortality (HR: 1. 5 - 1. 9; p?<? 1 ױ 0 - 4) following adjustment for Framingham risk factors. Associations were strongest for coronary calcified plaque. Improvement in prediction of outcome beyond Framingham risk factors was greatest using coronary calcified plaque for all-cause mortality (AUC: 0. 720 to 0. 757, p?=? 0. 004) and the <b>multi-bed</b> score for CVD mortality (AUC: 0. 731 to 0. 767, p?=? 0. 008). Conclusions Although coronary calcified plaque and the <b>multi-bed</b> score were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality and CVD-mortality respectively in this T 2 D-affected sample, carotid and abdominal aortic calcified plaque scores also significantly improved prediction of outcome beyond traditional risk factors and should not be discounted as risk stratification tools.
