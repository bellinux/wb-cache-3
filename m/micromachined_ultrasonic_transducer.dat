40|$|ABSTRACT: Representing a new {{approach}} to ultrasound generation and detection, study on piezoelectric <b>micromachined</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> (pMUTs) has been a growing research area in recent years. Intensive research work has been directed on the deposition of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films on silicon substrates for their excellent piezoelectric coefficients and electromechanical coupling coefficients. However, the high processing temperature required for PZT crystallization results in a low device yield and also makes it difficult to integrate with control circuits. In this paper, a fabrication technology of pMUTs based on piezoelectric P(VDF-TrFE) 70 / 30 copolymer films has been adopted, with the maximum processing temperature not exceeding 140 °C allowing for post-IC compatibility. The entire processing procedures are simple and low cost, as compared with those of capacitive <b>micromachined</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> (cMUTs) and ceramic-based pMUTs.

40|$|Abstract — A {{piezoelectric}} <b>micromachined</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> (pMUT) {{has enabled}} numerous exciting ultrasonic applications. However, residual stress and initial buckling may worsen the transmitting sensitivity of a pMUT, and also limit its application and commercialization. In this paper, we report a new innovative pMUT with a perfectly flat membrane, i. e., zero-bending membrane. Leveraging on the stress-free AlN thin film, framelike top electrode layout, and integrated vacuum cavity, the initial deflection of suspended membrane is significantly suppressed to only 0. 005 %. The transmitting {{sensitivity of the}} zero-bending pMUT is measured as 123 nm/V at a resonant frequency of 2. 21 MHz, which is 450 % {{higher than that of}} the reference pMUT with slightly non-zero initial deflection. Compared with the simulation results, the measured data of zero-bending pMUT achieve 94. 5 % of its ideal transmitting sensitivity. It is solid evidence that our approach is an effective and reliable way to overcome the residual stress and the initial buckling issue.

40|$|Abstract — Photoacoustic imaging is a {{promising}} complement to pulse-echo ultrasound imaging {{because it provides}} contrast between areas with different light absorption characteristics. Specifically, regions with higher blood concentration can be identified, which is useful for imaging vascularization and the early detection of cancer. Here we present volumetric photoacoustic images of a vessel-like phantom. The phantom consists of three 1. 3 -mm diameter tubes inside a tissue mimicking material. The center tube is filled with ink to provide optical contrast. A two-dimensional capacitive <b>micromachined</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> (CMUT) array is used for acoustic detection. The use of a two-dimensional transducer array eliminates the drawbacks of a mechanically scanned system and enables volumetric imaging. CMUT technology enables new types of transducer arrays that would benefit photoacoustic imaging. Fully populated two-dimensional arrays, annular ring-arrays, and high-frequency arrays have all been demonstrated using CMUT technology and have advantages for photoacoustic imaging systems. Other advantages of CMUT technology for photoacoustic imaging include a wider bandwidth than comparable piezoelectric devices and ease of integration with electronics.

40|$|Abstract — Because the {{collapse}} voltage determines the operating {{point of the}} capacitive <b>micromachined</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> (CMUT), {{it is crucial to}} calculate and control this parameter. One approach uses parallel plate approximation, where a parallel plate motion models the average membrane displacement. This usually yields calculated collapse voltage 25 percent higher than the actual collapse voltage. More accurate calculation involves finite element method (FEM) analysis. However, depending on the required accuracy, the computation time may require many hours. In this paper, we propose a fast numerical algorithm for the calculation of collapse voltage. The algorithm uses the parallel plate method to approximate the force distribution over the membrane, and then applies an analytical solution for the plate equation, loaded by the approximated force distribution. Using this method, we are able to calculate {{the collapse}} voltage in a couple of seconds, within 0. 1 percent accuracy. We report on the collapse voltage calculation results using our method for four different design structures. While computation time of our method is about three orders of magnitude less than the finite element method, the percentage error of collapse voltage calculation is, nevertheless, less than four percent in all the design structures. The proposed algorithm is also suitable for the inclusion of any external force distribution on the membrane, such as atmospheric pressure.
