At that point some speculated that the next iPad released would be of a smaller size. Further speculations emerged in July 2012 when DigiTimes, with the help of unspecified sources, claimed that Apple made small revisions to the then upcoming iPad and scheduled its release for late 2012. On October 16, 2012, Apple announced a <b>media</b> <b>event</b> scheduled for October 23 at the California Theatre in San Jose, California.

40|$|Currently, {{numerous}} studies on Japanese prewar <b>media</b> <b>events</b> were merely {{focused on the}} perspectives of cultural and media management, rather than its propaganda function. However, propaganda function of Japanese prewar <b>media</b> <b>events</b> {{is not hard to}} be observed on the Japanese prewar event phenomena, for instance, the New Eight Views of Japan selection event held in 1927 (Showa 2 year) is a typically representative case. Combined with its historical background, based on the analysis on reports of <b>media</b> <b>events</b> from its host organizations (newspaper offices) at that time, in this paper, the propaganda function of <b>media</b> <b>events</b> during the Japanese prewar period has been confirmed and the study viewpoint in the relationship between <b>media</b> <b>events</b> and political propaganda has been extended to the Japanese prewar period...|$|R

40|$|Focusing on {{the rescue}} of the Chilean miners, this article problematizes some current {{perspectives}} on <b>media</b> <b>events,</b> particularly in relation to disasters. An analysis of the narratives constructed during the live broadcast of the rescue by the Chilean government, and a national and a global television station, suggests that <b>media</b> <b>events</b> theories should go beyond the categories of “integrative” and “disruptive”. Additionally, {{it appears that the}} apparent polyphony of <b>media</b> <b>events</b> introduced by global media organizations is not a guarantee of alternative voices. Finally, this story is a powerful reminder that disasters can be used for political purposes, overlooking in this case the responsibility of the company owning the mine and the communicative controls imposed by the authorities...|$|R
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a <b>media</b> <b>event</b> to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco.

Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a <b>media</b> <b>event</b> on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016.

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} okapi is Okapia johnstoni. It was first described as Equus johnstoni by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name Okapia derives from the Lese Karo name o'api, while the specific name (johnstoni) is {{in recognition of the}} British Governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the Ituri Forest while repatriating a group of Pygmies to the Belgian Congo. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887. Remains of a carcass were later sent to London by the English adventurer and colonial administrator Harry Johnston and became a <b>media</b> <b>event</b> in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{received}} criticism {{after an}} incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro line following the 2012 WWDC. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors {{instead of the}} newer E5 series. The line also lacked then-current technologies like SATA III, USB 3, and Thunderbolt, the last {{of which had been}} added to every other Macintosh at that point. An email from Apple CEO Tim Cook promised a more significant update to the line in 2013. Apple stopped shipping the first-generation Mac Pro in Europe on March 1, 2013 after an amendment to a safety regulation left the professional Mac non-compliant. The last day to order was February 18, 2013. The first generation Mac Pro was removed from Apple's online store following unveiling of the redesigned second generation Mac Pro at a <b>media</b> <b>event</b> on October 22, 2013.|$|E

5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's <b>media</b> <b>event,</b> it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening {{to break away from}} the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Phát and Đức.|$|E
50|$|Dayan and Katz {{suggest that}} <b>media</b> <b>events</b> are an {{expression}} of a “neo-romantic desire for heroic action”, meaning that <b>media</b> <b>events</b> produce leaders who inspire collective action with belief in the “power of the people” to change the world. Benefit concerts, therefore, {{have the potential to}} raise enormous sums of money for a cause because of the para-social interaction that occurs between the performing celebrities (the leaders) and the spectating fans (the people).|$|R
5000|$|Large-scale benefit concerts attract {{millions}} of viewers {{and are usually}} broadcast internationally. As powerful means of mass communication, they can be highly effective at raising funds and awareness for humanitarian causes. Media scholars Dayan and Katz classify benefit concerts as “media events”: shared experiences that unite viewers {{with one another and}} their societies. In fact, in their book Media Events: The Live Broadcasting of History, the authors suggest that the song synonymous with the Live Aid benefit concert, “We Are the World,” might as well be the theme song for <b>media</b> <b>events,</b> as it nicely encompasses the tone of such occasions: “these ceremonies (<b>media</b> <b>events)</b> are so all-encompassing that there is nobody left to serve-as out-group”. [...] Dayan and Katz define <b>media</b> <b>events</b> as shared experiences that unite viewers and call their attention to a particular cause or occasion. They argue that <b>media</b> <b>events</b> interrupt the flow people’s daily lives, and that such events create a rise of interpersonal communication or “fellow feeling”. Furthermore, they propose that <b>media</b> <b>events</b> transform the ordinary role of the viewer into something more interactive where they adhere to the script of the event. All these principles of <b>media</b> <b>events</b> are true of benefit concerts. Benefit concerts interrupt the routine of people’s lives because they occur (in most cases) for only for one night or for one week-end. Furthermore, they are broadcast as television spectacles that interrupt the regular scheduled programming on a given television network. Often, this kind of announced interruption has television viewers discussing the event with others beforehand, generating excitement around the event. Moreover, benefit concerts encourage audiences to adhere to their script, such as by phoning in donations or signing an online pledge.|$|R

40|$|This article {{suggests}} a new methodological {{model for the}} study of hybrid <b>media</b> <b>events</b> with global appeal. This model, developed in the project on the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, was created specifically for researching digital media - and in particular, Twitter. The article is structured as follows. Firstly, the methodological scope is discussed against the theoretical context, e. g. the theory of <b>media</b> <b>events.</b> In the theoretical discussion, special emphasis is given to i) disruptive, upsetting, or disintegrative <b>media</b> <b>events</b> and hybrid <b>media</b> <b>events</b> and ii) the conditions of today's heterogeneous and globalised media communication landscape. Secondly, the article introduces a multi-method approach developed for the analysis of hybrid <b>media</b> <b>events.</b> In this model, computational social science - namely, automated content analysis (ACA) and social network analytics (SNA) - are combined with a qualitative approach - specifically, digital ethnography. The article outlines three key phases for research in which the interplay between quantitative and qualitative approaches is played out. In the first phase, preliminary digital ethnography is applied to provide the outline of the event. In the second phase, quantitative social network analytics are applied to construct the digital field for research. In this phase, it is necessary to map a) what is circulating on the websites and b) where this circulation takes place. The third and final phase applies a qualitative approach and digital ethnography to provide a more nuanced, in-depth interpretation of what (substance/content) is circulating and how this material connects with the ‘where’ in the digital landscape, hence constituting links and connections in the hybrid media landscape. In conclusion, the article reflects on how this multi-method approach contributes to understanding the workings of today's hybrid media events: how they create and maintain symbolic battles over certain imagined constructs of social imaginaries of solidarity, belonging, contestation, and exclusion, a topic of core value for the theory of <b>media</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
