5000|$|A storm {{hits the}} town and causes a power outage the next morning while water begins to flood the mansion. That night, Steve remembered Megan's phone {{and asked if she}} has already {{retrieved}} it. He goes to get it alone while the others were fixing candles and putting buckets in leaking areas. Father Anthony noticed Allison, Steve and Jack's disappearance and Jessie volunteered to look for them. A chandelier suddenly dropped on the floor and injured Father Anthony's legs rendering him immobile. On the confessional, Steve retrieves Megan's phone and decided to listen if there were voices recorded. He listened to the recording and was frightened when Jaime's ghost appeared pointing at something. He tried to escape but was caught by another violent ghost. His tongue was then severed and he was killed. Jessie found Jack who was revealed to be cheating on her with Allison. Jessie runs away but stumbles into Steve's dead body, which they carry back to the house. They find Megan's phone in his pocket which Mrs. Gonzalez uses to call for help. Faye and Jacob accompanied her. While making the call, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> accidentally listened to Veronica's voice recording and Jaime appeared pointing at something. <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> suffered from an asthma attack and orders Jacob to grab her inhaler. Faye stays with <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> and decides to listen to the voice recording as well. Jaime appeared once again pointing at something. Suddenly, the ghost who killed Steve appeared and threw Faye and <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> to a wall injuring them severely. Ella and the others hear their screams and when they ran to help them, they find their corpses with their tongues ripped out. Jacob told everybody that he saw <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> freaking out over something she heard from the phone. Father Anthony advises them to listen to the recorded message as they might learn something about the killings.|$|E

5000|$|The next night, Ella was {{haunted by}} the ghost of Jaime and ended up fainting in fright. Thinking it was another prank pulled by Megan, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> and the others made the group stay for another day in the mansion to work out their {{differences}} while their classmates and Ms. Taas went home ahead as a huge storm was on its way. Ella then confessed to Adrian that she {{has the ability to}} see ghosts and when she was younger, caused her father to be killed, to which she blamed herself for. That night, while <b>Ms.</b> <b>Gonzalez,</b> Father Anthony and the caretakers were asleep, Megan, Jessie, Allison, Jack and Steve decided to hunt ghosts, Jacob, Ella, Adrian and Faye warned them not to but they continued. They decided to leave Megan's cellphone plugged in a battery pack in the confessional in hopes that they will record The Black Lady's (Veronica) voice.|$|E
