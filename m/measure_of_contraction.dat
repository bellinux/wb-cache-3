40|$|Brain atrophy is {{a typical}} feature of many {{neurological}} conditions. Therefore, quantitative evaluation and spatial characterization of atrophy are potentially useful for monitoring the evolution of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this study, a method for measuring atrophy of the major white matter (WM) fiber bundles in the brain using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI data is developed. To this end, an atlas was created from sets of diffusion anisotropy images from normal subjects, and the deformations necessary to match single subject anisotropy images to this atlas were then computed. Because diffusion anisotropy images were used, this approach should be sensitive to fiber bundle volume changes {{in the same way}} that using T 1 -weighted images allows gray matter volume changes to be measured. The Jacobian determinant of the deformation field for each subject was then used as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> or expansion of the tissue at each image voxel. An overview of the nonlinear registration problem is given; then an optimization of the parameters for the chosen algorithm is performed and the method for producing the atlas is described. The effectiveness of the method was then tested on data from five patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 2030...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of hot deformation conditions on hot ductility and σ-ε curves of C-Mn-B steel. Design/methodology/approach: The force – energetic parameters of hot – working were determined in hot tensile tests performed in a temperature range of 700 to 1200 °C by the use of Gleeble 3800 thermo – mechanical simulator with strain rate 0. 01 s- 1 and 6. 5 s- 1 After rupture the contractions of samples were measured. Samples were taken from columnar and equiaxed grains zone of continuously cast billet. Findings: Hot ductility curves as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> in function of temperature of deformation for given strain rate and shape of the grains were established. At strain rate 6. 5 s- 1 there was no minimum of hot ductility for columnar grains and for equiaxed grains minimum of hot ductility was temperature 800 – 850 °C (40 %). At strain rate 0. 01 s- 1 and equiaxed grains minimum of the hot ductility (23 %) was between 800 – 900 °C and for columnar grains between 850 - 950 °C at about 40 %. Minimum of the hot ductility was usually in the vicinity of Ar 3 temperature. Research limitations/implications: To determine in detail the hot ductility behaviour of C-Mn-B steel, a SEM investigations of rupture should be done. Practical implications: The obtained stress-strain curves can be useful in determination of power-force parameters of hot-rolling. Originality/value: The hot ductility behaviour of new-developed low carbon steel containing Boron microaddition was investigated...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the micro-structure of crystalline polymers, particularly as revealed by electron microscopy, {{and also the}} effect of the electron beam on the radiation sensitive specimens under various conditions. Polymer single crystals grown from dilute solution were used for the radiation damage studies, as they are thin (100 andAring;), and a single preparation may contain 10 8 crystals of uniform properties. Preparations of polyethylene (PE), polyoxymethylene (POM), poly- 4 -methylpentene- 1 (P 4 MP), nylon 6 and polyethylene oxide were characterized in the transmission electron microscope, confirming previous work for the most part. The scanning electron microscope, operating in its normal mode, showed even the thinnest single crystals clearly, when they were sedimented onto a metal coated substrate. Attempts to observe the 3 -D pyramidal structure of PE single crystals were unsuccessful. The crumpling seen when crystals floating on glycerol, or freely suspended from a fine mesh, are irradiated in an electron microscope indicates that even if the structure were preserved, by freeze drying or however, {{it would be difficult to}} observe. Thicker, complex, crystals seemed more stable in the scanning electron microscope, and cannot be seen well in the transmission microscope. A chart recorder, picoammeter and special faraday cup were fitted to a Siemens Elmiskop 1 for accurate beam current measurements, and dynamic recording of the varying intensity of polymer crystal images. Reproducible curves for the variation of intensity of one spot in the diffraction pattern were obtained for POM and PE. There was a period, p, of very variable intensity, followed by an exponential decay. The very variable intensity is due to the diffraction contrast of detail, so after p no information could be gained from the crystal, although the diffraction pattern shows it to be largely crystalline at that point. For the particular preparations described, at 100 kV, andnbsp; PE POM andnbsp; p 43 andplusmn; 5 34 andplusmn; 4 values in Coulombs/sq. m. Diff. Pattern Decayed 92 andplusmn; 10 70 andplusmn; 7 It is shown that in the electron microscope, heating and ionic bombardment are negligible effects compared to the electron irradiation. An energy loss analysing microscope applied to PE crystals showed that 1 Coulomb/sq. m. is equivalent to 42 Mrads. at 100 kV in agreement with theory. The density of PE increases sharply on irradiation, and the final product seems much like amorphous carbon. Radiation damage mechanisms are discussed, with special reference to polymers and to conditions in an electron microscope. For POM, PE and P 4 MP the variation in radiation damage rate with beam voltage between 30 kV and 100 kV was found to be accurately andprop;andnbsp;(electron velocity) andminus; 2 as predicted by theory, both simple and complex. With exactly similar samples of PE and POM in the 1 MV electron microscope at U. S. Steel, the trend was the same up to 1 MV. Between 700 kV and 1 MV there was a deviation from proportionality towards even slower damage. Absolute measurements differed by 30 andndash; 50 %. Adapting the scanning electron microscope to transmission, the damage of POM could be studied down to 3 kV. There was a steady increase of damage rate as the voltage was reduced, but it was not possible to compare the results with those at higher voltages. The effect of specimen temperature on damage rate was investigated with a liquid helium cooled specimen stage. In going from room temperature to andlt;andnbsp; 30 anddeg;K the rate was reduced by a factor of 2 (2. 2 andplusmn; 0. 8). This is not enough to outweigh practical difficulties. There is a fundamental noise limit to resolution with a decaying crystal. This has been calculated, and found to be well below anything practically realized. For example random structure 50 andAring; across, and periodic structure of 20 andAring; should be resolvable in a POM crystal, 85 andAring; thick imaged in bright field at 100 kV and 13, 000 times magnification. The real limits are image instability and focus, and there is no good way round either. There is no advantage to be gained from higher beam voltages. Ease of rapid operation of the microscope is the most important factor. Image intensifiers, if easy to use, may be a great help, allowing more manipulation of specimens, and presenting more of the information that is obtained. Thin films of PE and POM were cast from slurry and observed in the electron microscope. PE gives complex crystallographic diffraction contrast which rapidly disappears but another, stronger, contrast builds up showing another structure, and this is retained however large the dose. This beam-induced image looks just like what one might expect from undamaged material, in this case, banded spherulites. Detailed study of the changes, combined with optical microscopy and experiments on single crystals leads to the following conclusion: The beam-induced contrast is due to anisotropic deformation caused by radiation damage. Each crystalline unit expands along a, and contracts along c, while the third dimension, along b, remains constant. This explanation supports the current view of spherulite structure, a collection of radiating twisting lamellae, and may well apply to other polymers and structures. Thin films of PE were drawn at room temperature and annealed at 120 anddeg;C. On irradiation, the drawn regions retracted by around 30 %a, but this is not a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> along c (predicted as andgt;andnbsp; 25 %) because of the unknown behaviour of interlamellar material. The fibrils seen in drawn PE after irradiation were found to be the radial lamellae, homogeneously deformed, whenever the spherulite structure persisted enough for measurements to be made. An ultra-thin PE film which became in the limit, an open network, was produced in an uncontrolled way. Normal spherulite structure was not observed. Areas seemingly undrawn gave a single crystal type of diffraction pattern, and drawn ribbons looked like a 'shish-kebab', transverse platelets on a fine thread. The plates were 200 andplusmn; 25 andAring; thick, separated by 200 andplusmn; 75 andAring;. The centre to centre period was 380 andplusmn; 40 andAring;. Diffraction indicated that the orientation was very good, with b and c in the specimen plane, and c along the ribbon. The film was quite stable, and diffracting units could be identified with individual platelets. This was a fascinating demonstration of an ideal drawn PE, but it could not be made to order, or investigated systematically. The POM films degraded to a featureless film in the electron microscope with andlt; 20 % of the mass remaining. Optical microscopy showed coarse textured spherulites, beginning to organise into banded spherulites with radial period andgt; 10 andmu;. Initial contrast in the electron microscope showed a radiating structure from well spaced centres. The radiating units gave a single crystal type of diffraction pattern, with a { 101 and# 773; 0 } growth direction. It seems that because of the coarse texture of POM spherulites, a thicker film is needed to give information about the bulk. This would need a high voltage microscope. </p...|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{finger and}} wrist flexion based actions using single channel surface {{electromyogram}} {{have a number}} of rehabilitation, defence and human computer interface applications. These applications are currently infeasible because of unreliability in classification of sEMG when the level <b>of</b> muscle <b>contraction</b> is low and when there are multiple active muscles. The presence of noise and cross-talk from closely located and simultaneously active muscles is exaggerated when muscles are weakly active such as during maintained wrist and finger flexion. It has been established in literature that surface electromyogram (sEMG) and other such biosignals are fractal signals. Some researchers have determined that fractal dimension (FD) is related to strength <b>of</b> muscle <b>contraction.</b> On careful analysis of fractal properties of sEMG, this research work has established that FD is related to the muscle size and complexity and not to the strength <b>of</b> muscle <b>contraction.</b> The work has also identified a novel feature, maximum fractal length (MFL) of the signal, as a good <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the muscle. From the analysis, it is observed that while at high level <b>of</b> <b>contraction,</b> root mean square (RMS) is an indicator <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the muscle, this relationship is not very strong when the muscle contraction is less than 50 % maximum voluntary contraction. This work has established that MFL is a more reliable <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> compared to RMS, especially at low levels <b>of</b> <b>contraction.</b> This research work reports the use of fractal properties of sEMG to identify the small changes in strength <b>of</b> muscle <b>contraction</b> and the location of the active muscles. It is observed that fractal dimension (FD) of the signal is related with the properties of the muscle while maximum fractal length (MFL) is related to the strength <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the associated muscle. The results show that classifying MFL and FD of a single channel sEMG from the forearm it is possible to accurately identify a set of finger and wrist flexion based actions even when the muscle activity is very weak.

During each session on-line <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> level and tonic stretch reflex sensitivity from the biceps brachii muscle were shown to the subject on meter displays. Subjects were asked to attempt to control the displays. They were given goals such as: (1) reduce both contraction level and reflex sensitivity displays to zero and (2) increase the contraction level display to 10 % of maximum while keeping the reflex sensitivity display at a minimum. Achievement of goals was automatically sensed and used to activate a cassette tape of the subject's favourite music. Contraction level and reflex sensitivity scores were averaged over one-minute intervals to provide a record of long term progress. Elbow-angle and IEMG data were recorded on FM tape for off-line analysis. All four subjects learned to suppress involuntary muscle activity and resting tonic stretch reflex responses. They also learned to produce a two or three-fold variation in action tonic stretch reflex sensitivity while sustaining 10 % maximum voluntary contraction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors {{increase}} myocardial contractility {{and decrease}} left ventricular (LV) afterload. We studied whether these effects altered LV {{response to an}} increase in cardiac load and affected length-dependent regulation of myocardial function. METHODS: Before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, a high-fidelity pressure catheter was positioned in the left ventricle and the left atrium in 10 coronary surgery patients. LV response to an increased cardiac load, caused by leg elevation, was assessed during baseline conditions and after administration of milrinone at a dose of 20 micrograms kg- 1 over 15 min. Effects on contraction were measured by changes in maximal rate of pressure development (dP/dtmax). Effects on relaxation were assessed by analysis of changes in maximum rate of pressure decrease and by analysis of the load dependency of myocardial relaxation (R = slope of the relation between the time constant of isovolumic relaxation and end systolic pressure). RESULTS: Milrinone increased dP/dtmax but <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> relaxation were unaltered. Leg elevation had more effect on <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and relaxation after milrinone than at baseline. The relationship between R and changes in dP/dtmax shifted downwards and to the right with milrinone, whereas the relationship between R and changes in end diastolic pressure (EDP) shifted downwards and to the left. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that milrinone improved contraction, reduced the load dependency of LV pressure decrease, and reduced the change in EDP after leg elevatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the relationship between poststroke upper limb muscle weakness and cocontraction, and clinical <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> upper limb motor impairment and physical disability. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the paretic and nonparetic wrist flexors and extensors of 26 chronic stroke survivors were record-ed during isometric wrist flexion and extension. The root mean square (RMS) of the EMG signal was used as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>contraction.</b> A ratio <b>of</b> RMS of antagonist and agonist muscles was used as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> cocontraction. Upper limb motor impairment and physi-cal disability were assessed with the Fugl-Meyer motor assessment (FMA) and the arm motor ability test (AMAT), respectively. The strength <b>of</b> muscle <b>contraction</b> was sig-nificantly stronger in the nonparetic limb (P < 0. 001). The degree of cocontraction was significantly greater in the paretic limb (P < 0. 001). The strength of muscle con-traction in the paretic limb correlated significantly with FMA (r = 0. 62 to 0. 87, P ≤ 0. 001) and AMAT (r = 0. 66 to 0. 80, P ≤ 0. 001) scores. Similarly, the degree of cocon-traction correlated significantly with FMA (r = – 0. 70 to – 0. 64, P ≤ 0. 001) and AMAT (r = – 0. 72 to – 0. 62, P ≤ 0. 001) scores.

Hence, they have a wide range of potential applications in areas such as robotics, bio-robotics, biomechanics, and artificial limb replacements. In addition to the similarity to biological muscle, air muscles have the advantages of good power-to-weight ratio, being compliant, and low cost. This thesis primarily quantifies the relationship between velocity <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> air muscles and the force applied on it, which is a key characteristic of biological skeletal muscle. First, an experimental test rig was used to <b>measure</b> the velocity <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> air muscles as a function of applied force, supply pressure, and supply volumetric flow rate. Second, a theoretical model is proposed to quantify the relationship between the velocity <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and force applied on it and to explain the experimental results. Three air muscles having different lengths and diameters were tested for loads ranging from 0 to 6 kg at 20 psi, 40 psi and 60 psi at two different flow rates. All three air muscles were made up of latex tubing sheathed with the Techflex, FlexoPet braided sleeve. The primary air muscle was 5 inches long, with the diameter of the inner tube measuring 3 / 4 of an inch. The second muscle had half the length (2. 5 inches) and was the same diameter as the primary air muscle.

The velocity <b>of</b> the <b>contraction</b> was <b>measured</b> {{with the help of the}} linear potentiometer.

This thesis {{describes a}} novel approach to cardiocyte contractility assessment based on biomechanical properties of the cardiac cells, energy conservation principles, and information content <b>measures.</b> The <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>contraction</b> is defined as being {{the distance between the}} shapes of the contracting cell, assessed by the minimum total energy of the domain deformation (warping) of one cell shape into another. To guarantee a meaningful vis-`a-vis correspondence between the two shapes, both a data fidelity term and a regularization term are employed. The data fidelity term is based on nonlinear features of the shapes while the regularization term enforces the compatibility between the shape deformations and that of a hyper-elastic material. The approach was tested by assessing the contractile responses in isolated adult rat cardiocytes and contrasted these measurements against two different methods for contractility assessment in the literature.

40|$|Previously, a novel {{technique}} was proposed {{to quantify the}} relationship between the muscle stiffness and its nonfatigue contraction intensity. The method extended the <b>measured</b> range <b>of</b> isometric <b>contraction</b> to 100 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) using an ultrasonic shear wave measurement setup. Yet, it has not been revealed how this relationship could be affected by factors like age or sex. To clarify these questions, vastus intermedius (VI) stiffness of 40 healthy subjects was assessed under 11 step levels <b>of</b> isometric <b>contraction.</b> The subjects were divided into four groups: young males, young females, elderly males, and elderly females (n = 10 for each). In a relaxed state, no significant difference was observed between the male and female subjects (p = 0. 156) nor between the young and elderly subjects (p - 0. 221). However, when performing isometric contraction, the VI stiffness of males was found to be significantly higher than that of females at the same level (p Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcr...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We are {{exploring}} {{the viability of}} a novel approach to cardiocyte contractility assessment based on biomechanical properties of the cardiac cells, energy conservation principles, and information content measures. We define our <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>contraction</b> as being {{the distance between the}} shapes of the contracting cell, assessed by the minimum total energy of the domain deformation (warping) of one cell shape into another. To guarantee a meaningful vis-à-vis correspondence between the two shapes, we employ both a data fidelity term and a regularization term. The data fidelity term is based on nonlinear features of the shapes while the regularization term enforces the compatibility between the shape deformations and that of a hyper-elastic material. Results We tested the proposed approach by assessing the contractile responses in isolated adult rat cardiocytes and contrasted these measurements against two different methods for contractility assessment in the literature. Our results show good qualitative and quantitative agreements with these methods as far as frequency, pacing, and overall behavior <b>of</b> the <b>contractions</b> are concerned. Conclusions We hypothesize that the proposed methodology, once appropriately developed and customized, can provide a framework for computational cardiac cell biomechanics {{that can be used to}} integrate both theory and experiment. For example, besides giving a good assessment of contractile response of the cardiocyte, since the excitation process of the cell is a closed system, this methodology can be employed in an attempt to infer statistically significant model parameters for the constitutive equations of the cardiocytes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Strips of {{urinary bladder}} smooth muscle were {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} quick release measurements. Each measurement consisted of several releases and resets to the original length, made during one contraction. The complete length-force characteristic of series elasticity was quantified by estimating H, the amplitude of quick release necessary to reduce the active force to exactly zero, and Db, a measure for the deviation of the characteristic from a straight line. By <b>measuring</b> a series <b>of</b> <b>contractions</b> at increasing stretched strip lengths, the length dependence of these parameters was studied. It was found that H depends linearly on stretched strip length. On average H/length amounted to 0. 04. Db decreased when strips were stretched, i. e. a straight line was more closely approximated. Both parameter dependencies support the concept of two separate elastic mechanisms, a linear true passive elasticity in series with a non-linear elasticity in the cross-bridges. For the latter, H amounts to 3. 8 % of the initial strip length...|$|R
40|$|Our lab has {{developed}} a way to <b>measure</b> the <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) using the reinforcing fibers themselves as sensing elements. We achieve this by using electrically-conductive wire to form the fiber braid. The inductance of this “Smart Braid” increases as the actuator contracts. We are interested in using these sensors for the feedback control of fluid systems that rely on PAM actuators. Toward that end, we have begun to explore highly portable inductance measurement techniques. Here, we demonstrate the force-compensated tracking of a rotary joint angle at 1 kHz. This {{is an important step}} towards the utilization of these sensors in feedback control systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{reversal}} of slcuronium by edrophonium 1 mgkg" 1 or neostigmine 35. 7 figkg~l was compered in 23 patients undergoing elective ophthalmic sorcery. Neuromuscular transmission {{was assessed by}} <b>measuring</b> the force <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the adductor pollkis muscle in response to train-of-four supramaximal stimuli (2 Hz, 0. 2 ms duration) delivered via surface electrodes to the ulnar nerve every 10 s. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with Althesin, and patient * were ventilated to oormocarbia with 67 % nitrous oxide in oxygen. Neuromuscular blockade was induced with alcuronium 0. 2 - 0. 3 mgkg" 1 and antagoniimi was attempted when the train-of-four ratio had recovered spontaneously to 0. 1. Recovery <b>of</b> the first <b>contraction</b> response <b>of</b> the train-of-four and of fade were more rapid after edrophonium. Although most patients were monitored for at least 30 min no re-curarization was seen. Comparison of the relative rates of recovery <b>of</b> the first <b>contraction,</b> and the response to train-of-four stimuli, suggests that edrophonium has a greater prejunctional effect than neostigmine. Despite the frequent use of alcuronium, the ant-agonism of neuromuscular blockade produced by this agent has not been examined fully. Although neostigmine remains the most popular anticholines-terase, recent studies demonstrating the efficacy of large doses of edrophonium (Bevan, 1979; Kopman, 1979) have prompted a revival of interest in its pharmacological actions (Foldes et al., 1981; Morri...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new Qual VAR model for incorporating information from qualitative and/or discrete variables in vector autoregressions. With a Qual VAR, {{it is possible}} to create dynamic forecasts of the qualitative variable using standard VAR projections. Previous forecasting methods for qualitative variables, in contrast, only produce static forecasts. I apply the Qual VAR to forecasting the 2001 business recession out of sample and to analyzing the Romer and Romer (1989) narrative <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> monetary policy <b>contractions</b> as an endogenous variable in a VAR. Out of sample, the model predicts the timing of the 2001 recession quite well relative to the recession probabilities put forth at the time by professional forecasters. Qual VARs [...] which include information about the qualitative variable [...] can also enhance the quality of density forecasts of the other variables in the system.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to <b>measure</b> the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> stress <b>of</b> three composite resin restorative materials during photo-polymerization: a micro-hybrid composite (Filtek Z 250, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA); a nano-filled composite (Filtek Supreme, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA); and a low-shrinkage composite (Ælite LS, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA). Methods: Curing shrinkage stress was measured using a stress-analyzer. Composites were polymerized with a halogen-curing unit (VIP, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) for 40 s. The contraction force (N) generated during polymerization was continuously recorded for 150 s after photo-initiation. Contraction stress (MPa) was calculated at 20, 40, 60 and 150 s. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: The low-shrinkage composite Ælite LS exhibited the lowest stress values compared to other materials (p < 0. 05). Statistical analysis did not show significant differences between Filtek Z 250 and Filtek Supreme. Significance: The low-shrinkage composite showed lower contraction stress than micro-hybrid and nano-filled composite. Ideally, non-shrinking resins would represent the ultimate solution to overcome polymerization contraction and stress-related problems...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Uterine contractions during labor can be {{monitored}} by external tocodynamometry {{or by the}} use of an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC). Since an IUPC <b>measures</b> the frequency <b>of</b> <b>contractions</b> as well as their strength and duration, it is thought to be more accurate than external tocodynamometry. However, limited evidence on this subject suggests that IUPC may not improve maternal or perinatal outcomes. Moreover, the use of IUPC may cause fetal complications. CASES: We describe the placement of an IUPC during induction of labor with oxytocin in two cases, one presenting with a singleton pregnancy and the other a twin pregnancy. After introduction of the IUPC, both cases were complicated by blood loss and signs of fetal distress on cardiotocography. An emergency cesarean section was performed in both cases. In the first case, extramembranous placement of the IUPC was observed, whereas in the second case, the IUPC had lacerated an arteriovenous anastomosis in the membranes, resulting in perinatal death. CONCLUSION: Placement of an intrauterine pressure catheter instead of external tocodynamometry has a small risk for serious fetal complication...|$|R
