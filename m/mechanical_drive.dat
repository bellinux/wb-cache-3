2500|$|Whatever its {{ultimate}} source, the initial {{version of the}} Fokker synchronization gear (see illustration) very closely followed, not Schneider's patent, as claimed by many (including Schneider himself) but Saulnier's. Like the Saulnier patent, Fokker's gear was designed to actively fire the gun rather than interrupt it, and (like the later Vickers-Challenger gear developed for the RFC) it followed Saulnier in taking its primary <b>mechanical</b> <b>drive</b> from the oil pump of a rotary engine. [...] The [...] "transmission" [...] between the motor and the gun was by a version of Saulnier's reciprocating push-rod. The main difference was that instead of the push rod passing directly from the engine to the gun, which would have required a tunnel through the firewall and fuel tank (as shown in the Saulnier patent drawings), it was driven by a shaft joining the oil pump to a small cam {{at the top of}} the fuselage. This eventually proved unsatisfactory, as the oil pump's <b>mechanical</b> <b>drive</b> spindle was insufficiently robust to take the extra load.|$|E

50|$|Conceptually, {{electric}} drive {{is only a}} segment of the propulsion system (it does not replace the nuclear reactor or the steam turbines). Instead it replaces reduction gearing (<b>mechanical</b> <b>drive)</b> used on earlier nuclear-powered submarines.

50|$|Industrial gas {{turbines}} {{that are used}} solely for <b>mechanical</b> <b>drive</b> or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets {{in that they are}} often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to single shaft.

40|$|Catheter {{ablation}} {{has become}} the curative treatment for various cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, leading to more challenging procedures, prolonged fluoroscopy exposure {{and the need for}} stable and reproducible catheter movement. In the last decade, remotely-controlled catheter ablation has emerged as a novel concept to improve catheter manoeuvrability and stability. This has the potential to increase procedural success, decrease procedure time and minimise catheter-related complications. To date, two remote navigation systems (Niobe from Stereotaxis and Sensei from Hansen Medical) are commercially available based on magnetic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>driven</b> forces, respectively. Both have shown promise but also shortcomings during clinical evaluation. Recently, two new systems, CGCIMaxwell from Magnetecs and Amigo from Catheter Robotics, have shown promising results in animals. They are under clinical evaluation and are also based on magnetic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>driven</b> forces, respectively. This article describes the basic principles of the systems, summarises their respective published experiences during mapping and ablation procedures, their current clinical applications and future directions...|$|R
