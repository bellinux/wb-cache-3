This is a highly heated debate in communication in general and in advertising in particular, where academics and managers are still divided about the opportunities of using a standardized communication or an adapted one in local markets. Despite all that has been written there are few general conclusions and even less consensus. The main objective of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the international communication in the Portuguese market through the characterization of communications strategies that are being actually run by multinationals present in Portugal. For this purpose it was developed a qualitative research in the five sectors with highest advertising investment in Portugal in 2003 : Food, Personal Care, Communication and Equipments, Automobile and Drinks (<b>Marktest).</b> It was possible to conclude from the inquired multinational companies that they reveal a growing tendency to standardize their advertising at a regional level (European). The main motives are essentially economic, despite some local contingencies that require a certain adaptation like competition activity, Portuguese advertising laws, different life cycle stadiums of products and markets, as well as different consumer profiles. Nevertheless, local requirements are solved through the adaptation of advertising tactical elements (copy and image). The standardization benefits (economies of scale) counterbalance the results of a greater market adaptation, particularly in markets with small volume sales, like the Portuguese one when compared to the stronger European countries.
