50|$|In their cover business, Pfandbrief banks grant {{property}} finance, public sector, {{ship and}} aircraft loans. Pfandbriefe {{have an average}} maturity of about five to seven years. While Pfandbriefe tend {{to be associated with}} asset-backed securities they are fundamentally different. Pfandbrief cover-assets remain on the bank's balance sheet. By contrast, asset-backed securities are typically off-balance-sheet transactions. Another difference: Pfandbrief cover pools are dynamic. Their composition can and usually does change over time, depending on the maturities and on the newly registered cover assets. Due to the stringent legal provisions that govern their issuance Pfandbriefe are deemed particularly safe. An independent cover pool trustee appointed by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) records cover assets and cover asset replacements in the cover register. In the event of the Pfandbrief issuer's insolvency, Pfandbrief investors have a preferential claim on the cover assets in the cover register because cover pool assets are not included in insolvency proceedings. There has not been a Pfandbrief default since 1901. Property financings may be included in the cover pool only up to 60% of the prudently calculated <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> <b>value.</b> The same holds true for ship and aircraft financings. Public sector loans are 100% eligible for cover.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the effect of}} the share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> by individual banks (together with some control variables) on two measures of financial stability - the bank Z-score and the nonperforming loan ratio - for a sample of 212 banks in 19 emerging Asian economies for 2007 - 2013 from the Bankscope database. We find some evidence that an increased share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> is positive for financial stability, specifically by lowering the probability of default by financial institutions and reducing the nonperforming loan ratio, at least in noncrisis periods, for levels of mortgage shares up to 30 %- 40 %. For higher levels of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> shares, the impact on financial stability turns negative. We also find that the share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> can be a useful measure of both financial development and financial inclusion. This finding most likely reflects the effect of a higher share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> in diversifying the mix of banks' assets and, thereby, reducing overall risk. However, if the share of <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> is too high, then the diversification effect diminishes. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the expected improvement in financial stability due to asset diversification against negative impacts that might result from easier lending standards or overly rapid increases in <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> that could trigger a bubble in the housing market. This highlights the need for prudent monetary policy and macroprudential policy measures to forestall the development of such bubbles...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{financial}} crash and the commercial property market downturn, this paper examines the basis of valuation used in the UK commercial property lending process.   Post-crisis there is discussion of countercyclical measures including the monitoring of asset prices; however there is no consideration of a different approach to property valuation.   This paper questions this omission, given the role that valuations play in the bank regulatory process.   The different bases of valuation available to lenders within International Valuation Standards are identified as Market Value (MV), <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Lending</b> <b>Value</b> (MLV) and Investment Value (IV), with MV being the most used in the UK.   Using the different bases in the period before the financial crisis, the UK property market is modelled at a national office, retail and industrial/warehouse sector level to determine the performance of each alternative valuation basis within {{the context of}} counter-cyclical pressures on lending.   Both MLV and IV would have produced lower valuations and could have provided lenders with tools for more informed and prudent lending.   The paper concludes by recognising some of the practical issues involved in adopting the different bases for the bank lending role but recommends a change to IV.

40|$|AbstractThe {{burst of}} the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis affected {{on a large scale}} the Italian real estate industry. The Italian real estate market underwent and is still undergoing a severe stagnancy due to the credit crunch worsened by the banking system and the resulting lack of liquidity. In financing real estate property investments, security packages play an extremely important role and guarantees have become a major tool for risk management and financial innovation in order to facilitate credit enhancement and hedging of risks. In this context the evaluation of guarantees and collaterals becomes extremely important. A robust measure of the value of collaterals is more than a key issue in times of financial crisis, when the value of the guarantees is questioned.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the long lasting crisis that begun in 2006, the evaluation of collaterals and guarantees become a key issue. The global financial crisis had actually a heavy relapse on loans supply. The decrease of new granted mortgages was mainly related to the weakness and decline of the housing market and the negative phase of the economic cycle, characterized by an increase in the unemployment rate and a reduction in household incomes. In this context, robust risk assessment procedures and proper evaluation of collaterals are required for lending institutions to the granting of loans. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether assets used as collaterals are overestimated and how much of the <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> <b>value</b> (VC) can be recouped by the property forced sale price (VF). The present study analyses the Italian foreclosed homes market, by surveying 89 forced sales, which occurred between 2006 and 2014 in the provinces of Treviso, Venice and Padova...|$|E
40|$|Using {{detailed}} information on lobbying and <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> activities, we find that lenders lobbying more on issues related to <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> (i) had higher loan-to-income ratios, (ii) securitized more intensively, and (iii) had faster growing portfolios. Ex-post, delinquency rates are higher in areas where lobbyist'' lending grew faster and they experienced negative abnormal stock returns during key crisis events. The findings are robust to (i) falsification tests using lobbying on issues unrelated to <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending,</b> (ii) a difference-in-difference approach based on state-level laws, and (iii) instrumental variables strategies. These results show that lobbying lenders engage in riskier lending.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been marked}} by cycles of {{excessive}} boom and bust in the housing market. However, not all countries have experienced high volatility in their house prices. Indeed, Germany has been unique in retaining flat price levels over the whole period and failing to respond to any of the macroeconomic shocks. The main reason for this stability can be found in real estate finance and in the existence of a sophisticated rental market. While in other countries monetary stimuli are effectively transmitted to the real economy via the housing market, the German insistence on prudential lending isolates the housing market from financial market distortions. By demanding high deposits, aligning lending to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> <b>value</b> instead of the market value and by offering predominantly fixed-rate mortgages, banks reduce the risk of defaults and thus contribute to stability in the market. This system has evolved as a result not of regulations but of a sophisticated rental market which enables households to save their own funds for house purchases. This, in turn, explains the preference for fixed-rate mortgages. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} review the German <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> <b>value</b> (MLV) and to adapt it in order to find a new concept that could serve as the basis for an internationally accepted standard for valuations for lending purposes. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a critical review of existing practices and literature and applies developments in the area of risk management tools, modern valuation techniques as well as the results of the consultation for Basel II in order to find an improved method. Findings – It was found that a value-at-risk approach and the implementation of simulation helps to understand the concept of MLV. The results also indicate that the German system of calculating the MLV has to be improved. Practical implications – Banks are in need of tools, reliable instruments and a strong theoretical basis when evaluating their collateral. The valuation of real estate for long-term loans has always been a problem. This paper indicates a strong basis for the implementation of tools in every day business. Originality/value – Value-at-risk concepts and the concepts of maximum/maximum potential loss within a (future) time period have until today not been integrated in the valuation of real estate serving as collateral...|$|E

Based on different basic ideas of property law between Germany and China, this thesis tries to explore what are the causes of differences of both mortgages. This thesis takes the German and Chinese legal, political economic background into consideration too, in order to explain the causes of differences between German and Chinese mortgage. In addition to principle, content, extra forms and liquidation of mortgage this comparative analysis is also divided into the following parts: <b>mortgage</b> <b>lending</b> <b>value</b> of mortgage object, mortgage of construction contractor and mortgage in bankruptcy. In order to reach a better mutual understanding of legal systems between German and Chinese reader, {{the rules and regulations}} in both Germany and China are compared in detail to set out the different contents and peculiarities concerning mortgage. Over a few hundred years´ development, mortgage in Germany has achieved successes in practice. In China, there are similar system and structure to German mortgage. So the future development of Chinese mortgage can use the successful experience of German mortgage theory for reference. The author hopes this research can provide aid for the future development of Chinese mortgage.
