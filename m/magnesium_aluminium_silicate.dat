3000|$|Open {{image in}} new window Montmorillonite {{is a very}} soft {{phyllosilicate}} mineral that typically forms in microscopic crystals, forming clay (Jaafar 2006). Montmorillonite, {{a member of the}} smectite family, has 2 : 1 expanding crystal lattice. The smectite group refers to a family of non-metallic clays primarily composed of hydrated sodium calcium <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate,</b> a group of monoclinic clay-like minerals with general formula (Ca, Na, H)(Al, Mg, Fe, Zn) 2 (Si, Al) 4 O 10 (OH) 2 ·nH 2 O (Grim 1962). Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium <b>aluminium</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydroxide (Na,Ca) x (Al,Mg) 2 (Si 4 O 10)(OH) 2 ·nH 2 O. Potassium, iron and other cations are common substitutes and the exact ratio of cations varies with source (Jaafar 2006). The basic structural unit is a layer consisting of two inward-pointing tetrahedral sheets with a central alumina octahedral sheet. The layers are continuous in the length and width directions, but the bonds between these layers are weak and have excellent cleavage, allowing water and other molecules to enter between the layers causing expansion in the highness direction. Isomorphous substitution gives the various types of smectite and causes a net permanent charge balanced by cations in such a manner that water may move between the sheets of the crystal lattice, giving a reversible cation exchange and very plastic properties (Grim 1962).|$|R

MAS changed the physico-mechanical properties of the composite formulations causing a decrease in mechanical hardness, collapsed wafer pores, increased roughness of film surface, increase in crystallinity and decreased mucoadhesion of the wafers. However, MAS increased swelling in both films and wafers as well as interaction between NIC and SA, which increased drug-loading capacity. Further, MAS resulted in rapid and slow release of NIC from wafers and films respectively.

Initial studies on material ob-tained by glass route reveal that these samples are superior to those obtained from sintered route in respect of their high voltage breakdown strength and outgassing behaviour.

To this end, the performance of three commonly used fillers namely: lactose, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 102; MCC), and pre-gelatinized starch, Starch 1500 PGS), were evaluated against Veegum®. The physico-mechanical properties of the tablet matrices were studied along with dissolution studies to determine the effect of single or binary mixtures of the excipients on the drug release pattern. A DSC hydration methodology was also employed to characterize the states of water present in the tablet matrices and to determine any impact on drug release. Formulations containing MAS alone produced compacts with the lowest hardness (4. 5 kp) whereas formulations containing MCC alone produced the hardest tablets (17. 2 kp). Dissolution studies suggested that matrices containing MAS alone released the theophylline quickest as compared to lactose, MCC or PGS.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the use of propranolol-magnesium aluminium silicate intercalated complexes as drug reservoirs in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose tablets. The matrix tablets containing the complexes were prepared and characterised with respect to propranolol release and were subsequently compared with those loading propranolol or a propranolol-magnesium aluminium silicate physical mixture. Additionally, the effects of varying viscosity grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, compression pressures and calcium acetate incorporation on the drug release characteristics of the complex-loaded tablets were also examined. The results showed that the complex-loaded tablets have higher tablet hardness than those containing propranolol or a physical mixture. The drug release from the complex-loaded tablets followed a zero-order release kinetic, whereas an anomalous transport was found in the propranolol or physical mixture tablets. The drug release rate of the complex tablet significantly decreased with increasing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose viscosity grade. Increase in the compression pressure caused a decrease in the drug release rate of the tablets. Furthermore, the incorporation of calcium ions could accelerate propranolol release, particularly in acidic medium, because calcium ions could be exchanged with propranolol molecules intercalated in the silicate layers of <b>magnesium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate.</b> These findings suggest that propranolol-magnesium aluminium silicate intercalated complexes show strong potential for use as drug reservoirs in matrix tablets intended for modifying drug release...|$|E

It {{has been}} reported that crystallization occurs in aqueous suspensions of metronidazole benzoate, a bland-tasting prodrug of metronidazole, as a result of conversion from the anhydrous to the monohydrate form, thereby compromising the stability and clinical efficacy of the substance due to the particle size growth (Hoelgaard & Moller, 1983). A generic South African based pharmaceutical company commenced formulation of an aqueous metronidazole benzoate suspension and experienced problems with crystallization that occurred in products stored at 2 to 8 °C. This study aimed to continue development of the product in order to identify a formulation that prevents formation of the hydrate form of metronidazole benzoate and the accompanying crystal growth. A variety of metronidazole benzoate suspensions were manufactured on a laboratory scale using a number of natural and synthetic suspending agents, including <b>magnesium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate,</b> povidone K 90, xanthan gum and Avicel® RC- 591 (microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium), over a range of concentrations. Analytical quantification methods were developed and validated, and the physicochemical properties of the raw material and finished products were fully characterized. Rheological tests were performed in order to characterize the suspension flow properties. Real-time and accelerated stability studies and a temperature cycle study were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Conversion of metronidazole benzoate to the monohydrate form took place in suspensions containing xanthan gum 0. 65 percent m/v under real-time and accelerated storage conditions. The suspensions containing Avicel® RC- 591 were found to be physically and chemically stable after the temperature cycle and over the 12 -week period whilst stored at 25 ºC / 60 percent RH and 5 ºC. The suspensions were chemically stable whilst stored at 40 ºC / 75 percent RH but showed sedimentation at this accelerated condition. The metronidazole benzoate contained in these products remained in the anhydrous state under all storage conditions and were consequently concluded to be the most stable formulations out of all the products analyzed in the current study. The suspending agent system consisting of microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium thus shows promise in preventing the conversion of metronidazole benzoate from the anhydrate to the monohydrate form, thereby inhibited the subsequent increase in particle size due to crystal growth...|$|E

The application of a powder injection moulding process {{to the production of}} fully sintered hardmetal components has been studied. Salient, highly interdependent process variables investigated include; powder and binder characteristics, mixing techniques, feedstock rheological characteristics, mould design features, moulding parameters, debinding and sintering parameters. Fundamental studies were conducted to determine the effect of powder and binder characteristics on the powder loading capacity of feedstocks. Various methods of mixing were investigated. The most favourable methods were identified from the rheological response of their respective feedstocks as determined by capillary rheometry. Thermogravimetric analyses were used to; (a) identify binders and feedstocks essig beneficial debinding kinetics, (b) in the study of suitable debinding atmospheres and (c) to develop thermal debinding profiles for selected feedstocks. A spiral mould was used to assess the mouldability and optimum moulding parameters of selected feedstocks. Feedstock properties and mould design features which promoted moulding defects were identified and solutions developed. It was found that the maximum hardmetal powder loading achievable in a given feedstock was dependent on the powder size, size distribution and level of agglomeration. Low viscosity binders with high dielectric permittivities were found to promote highly loaded feedstocks. Feedstock viscosity increased with powder concentration. This relationship was modelled by a simple exponential power function over a narrow range of shear and powder concentration. Compounding methods utilising high shear melt mixing principles were found most effective in producing low viscosity feedstocks of consistent rheological response. Feedstock compositions of high powder concentrations and based on single, crystalline, wax binder systems were found to exhibit a high thermal dependence of viscosity, high activation energies of viscous flow, a high shear sensitivity and tended to segregate when subjected to shear. Such propensities were found detrimental to moulding behaviour. Spiral mould analysis revealed feedstock compositions were sensitive to changes in thermal parameters. Compositions based on multi-component binder systems were found most preferential in producing defect free mouldings of sound integrity and offered favourable debinding characteristics. Thermal debinding of mouldings was only completely effective by careful control of heating rates and when performed in hydrogen rich atmospheres. The reaction order and activation energy of the binder volatilisation was found to be dependent on the level of binder decomposition. Melt wicking was most effective using a hydrated <b>magnesium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> substrate.

These properties are suitable not only for replacing the conventional materials but also embark new fields which can satisfy the technical demands especially in aerospace applications. However, this work is primarily focusing on the fabrication of glass ceramic matrix composites. Since these glass ceramics are reported to have good thermo-mechanical properties, the study embarked upon the fundamentals of processing of MAS and LAS glass ceramic fibres, in order to open a new avenue for advanced glass fibre composites in high temperature applications. The present work aims to develop fundamental information for fabrication of MAS and LAS glass ceramic fibres and development of the glass ceramic fibre reinforced polymer (GCFRP) composite. The thesis gradually evolves in the direction of this goal by developing suitable bulk glass ceramics, glass ceramic fibres and glass ceramic fibre reinforced polymer composites. In the first part, the bulk MAS and LAS glass ceramics were prepared using melting and casting process. This was followed by controlled heat treatments at different temperatures. The crystallisation behavior of both glass ceramics showed that the temperature increase enhanced the rigidity of the glass structure, thereby superior and reliable properties such as density, nanohardness and reduced Young's modulus were successfully derived in the MAS and LAS system prepared at different annealing and subsequent heat-treatment regimes. The thermo-mechanical properties were correlated to the crystalline phases present in the system. SEM analysis showed that there was a significant variation in morphology of the crystalline phases with the changes in the heat treatment temperatures. In the second part, the mechanical properties of <b>magnesium</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>silicate</b> (MAS) and lithium aluminium silicate (LAS) single fibres were investigated. The fibres were prepared using different methods namely melt drawing (MAS) and continuous drawing (LAS) respectively. The glass ceramic fibres were subjected to the optimised thermal treatments and the physical appearance observed indicated an absence of distortion before being tested using single fibre test (SFT). Relations between the properties of glass ceramic fibres and heat treatment conditions were clearly demonstrated by changes in density and Young's modulus. The latter was obtained with an acoustic approach which was successfully used in both systems. The glass and glass ceramic fibre selected were tested using the SFT and showed that different methods in fibre manufacturing process and different gauge lengths in the single fibre tests generate significantly different values in the mechanical properties of glass and glass ceramic fibres. The fibre strength distributions were strongly correlated with the diameter values of the tested fibres, and variation of the Weibull parameters depended on the gauge lengths. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of the fracture surfaces revealed the presence of fracture-inducing flaws located at the surface or in the interior of the fibre. Finally, an analysis of the fibrous glass ceramic MAS and LAS system was further developed towards the application in advanced composite materials.
