40|$|Regression {{analysis}} was used to determine the ability of a number of biological parameters to predict economic efficiency. Detailed feed, financial, and production records were maintained by a random sample of eighteen Prince Edward Island (PEI) swine producers (each producing over 1000 <b>market</b> hogs <b>per</b> year). Relative economic efficiency of the operations was measured using return to management and labor (RML). Of the routinely monitored biological parameters, RML on PEI farrow-finish operations was best predicted (R 2 = 64. 8 %) by: <b>marketed</b> <b>per</b> square meter per year (p = 0. 008) and <b>marketed</b> <b>per</b> sow per year (p = 0. 096). Regression of fixed costs revealed that biological parameters had limited ability to predict fixed costs per hog on farrow-finish operations (R 2 = 30. 7 %). The only parameter contributing to the prediction of the fixed cost component of RML was feeder hog density (p = 0. 077). The variable cost component of RML on farrow-finish operations was predicted (R 2 = 94. 3 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 000), and <b>marketed</b> <b>per</b> sow per year (p = 0. 044). The routinely recorded biological parameters on feeder farms had only limited ability to predict RML in this study (R 2 = 43. 7 %). The only parameter of any importance was <b>marketed</b> <b>per</b> square meter per year (p = 0. 106). Prediction of the fixed cost component of RML on feeder farms (R 2 = 67. 4 %) was best realized by measuring feeder hog density (p = 0. 045). The variable cost component of RML on feeder farms was reasonably well predicted (R 2 = 74. 7 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 012). Although this parameter is difficult to monitor from records currently maintained on most farms, it points out the need to monitor feed consumption on swine farms.
