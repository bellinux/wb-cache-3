5|$|The East River Bridge is a <b>multi-span</b> {{bridge in}} Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia that carries Trunk7 over the Northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour. It {{replaced}} a {{bridge of the}} same name that was built in 1956 and demolished in 2016. Construction began on the current bridge in September 2014 and was finished on 17December 2015, with a bridge walk commemorating the closing of the old East River Bridge and the opening of the new bridge. The old structure was a green arch bridge with a half-through, two-hinge type arch that was built in 1956, but was nearing the end of its lifespan leading to plans for construction of a new bridge funded by the federal and provincial governments. Nova Scotia had considered repairs to the old bridge in an effort to extend its lifespan, but ultimately elected to construct a new bridge.|$|E

40|$|During co-translational integration, the transmembrane (TM) {{sequence}} of a nascent membrane protein moves laterally into the ER lipid bilayer upon reaching the translocon. Our lab has previously shown that this movement is a multistep process, {{but it was}} not clear whether the observed photocrosslinking of the TM segment to translocon proteins resulted from specific interactions or simply from TM-translocon proximity. If the latter, the TM &# 945;-helix will be oriented randomly with respect to translocon proteins, whereas, if the former, a specific TM helix surface would face TRAM and/or Sec 61 &# 945;. Integration intermediates were prepared by in vitro translation of truncated mRNAs {{in the presence of a}} Lys-tRNA analog with a photoreactive moiety attached to the lysine side-chain. When photoadduct formation was monitored as a function of probe location within the TM &# 945;-helix, we found that the extent of photocrosslinking to TRAM and Sec 61 &# 945; was non-random. Thus, the TM sequence occupies a distinct location within the translocon, a result that can only be achieved through protein-protein interactions that mediate the lateral movement, positioning, and integration of the TM sequence. In the case of <b>multi-spanning</b> membrane proteins, it was unknown how multiple hydrophobic regions integrated into the ER membrane. By placing photoprobes within each of several TM domains of a <b>multi-spanning</b> membrane protein, we were able to determine at what stage of integration each TM segment was no longer adjacent to translocon proteins. Using this approach we were able to establish a mechanism of integration for <b>multi-spanning</b> membrane proteins co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane...|$|R

25|$|The Classical Revival {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Nathan C. Wyeth, an architect {{in private practice in}} the city, and Major Max C. Tyler, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers. The legislation authorizing the bridge's construction required that the United States Department of War consult with the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) {{in the design of the}} bridge. Subsequently, the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers asked the CFA for a list of architects whom the CFA believed would be competent to design an aesthetically pleasing bridge. The CFA swiftly provided a list, and in July 1916 Tyler met with the CFA to discuss a short list of potential architects. The CFA and Tyler also conferred on the bridge's orientation, design, and approaches. Tyler selected Wyeth. The plans were nearly complete by September. Wyeth and Tyler's initial design for the bridge was a double-deck structure with a single, high span. But with World War I erupting in Europe, inflation made this structure too costly. Wyeth then submitted a design for a single-deck, single-span bridge on January 12, 1917. The CFA asked Wyeth to design a <b>multi-span</b> bridge, or, failing that, to construct non-structural decorative elements that would make it look as if the bridge had multiple spans. Wyeth agreed, and the CFA approved the bridge design.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{targeting}} {{and integration}} of proteins into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, two types of signals can be distinguished: those that translocate their C-terminal sequence (cleavable signals and signal-anchors) and those that translocate their N-terminus (reverse signal-anchors). In addition to the well established effect of flanking charges, also the length and hydrophobicity of the apolar core of the signal as well as protein folding and glycosylation contribute to orienting the signal in the translocon. In <b>multi-spanning</b> membrane proteins, topogenic determinants are distributed throughout the sequence and may even compete with each other.

40|$|The Sec 61 translocon of the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) membrane forms an aqueous pore, allowing polypeptides {{to be transferred}} across or integrated into membranes. Protein translocation into the ER can occur co- and posttranslationally. In yeast, posttranslational translocation involves the heptameric translocase complex including its Sec 62 p and Sec 63 p subunits. The mammalian ER membrane contains orthologs of yeast Sec 62 p and Sec 63 p, but their function is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the effects of excess and deficit Sec 63 on various ER cargoes using human cell culture systems. The overexpression of Sec 63 reduces the steady-state levels of viral and cellular <b>multi-spanning</b> membrane proteins in a cotranslational mode, while soluble and single-spanning ER reporters are not affected. Consistent with this, the knock-down of Sec 63 increases the steady-state pools of polytopic ER proteins, suggesting a substrate-specific and regulatory function of Sec 63 in ER import. Overexpressed Sec 63 exerts its down-regulating activity on polytopic protein levels independent of its Sec 62 -interacting motif, indicating {{that it may not}} act in conjunction with Sec 62 in human cells. The specific action of Sec 63 is further sustained by our observations that the up-regulation of either Sec 62 or two other ER proteins with lumenal J domains, like ERdj 1 and ERdj 4, does not compromise the steady-state level of a <b>multi-spanning</b> membrane reporter. A J domain-specific mutation of Sec 63, proposed to weaken its interaction with the ER resident BiP chaperone, reduces the down-regulating capacity of excess Sec 63, suggesting an involvement of BiP in this process. Together, these results suggest that Sec 63 may perform a substrate-selective quantity control function during cotranslational ER import...|$|R

Both transmembrane (TM) segments are inserted into the membrane by the Sec 61 channel. While the ®rst, long and hydrophobic TM segment (TM 1) inserts into the lipid bilayer on its own, the second, shorter TM anchor (TM 2) collaborates with TM 1 during its inte-gration. TM 1 diffuses away from the Sec 61 complex in the absence of TM 2, but is close to Sec 61 when TM 2 arrives inside the channel.

Interestingly, a commonly used fusion protein that contains the amino-terminal region and the first transmembrane domain of LBR exhibits reduced mobility at the nuclear envelope, but behaves similarly to full-length LBR in the endoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, carboxy-terminally truncated mutants that retain the first four transmembrane domains and a part or {{the whole of the}} amino-terminal region of LBR are generally hyper-mobile.
