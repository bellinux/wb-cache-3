As of September 2015, 500 personnel were deployed on Australia's northern approaches in <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> operations, forming Operation Resolute. ADF units undertake periodic deployments in the South China Sea and South West Pacific.|$|E
5|$|During the deployment, {{the battle}} group participated in passage {{exercises}} with the navies {{of the countries}} visited. The 'Passage Exercises' focussed on <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> cooperation, which included humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) operations and 'Visit, Board, Search and Seizure' (VBSS) drills for anti-piracy operations. These exercises aimed to increase naval inter-operability, enabling the two navies to function with enhanced coordination during possible HADR operations. In addition, during the port visits, the Fleet Commander along with the Commanding Officers of the ships met high-ranking officials of the navy, state administration, port management, coastal security organisation, police, and other stakeholders of <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> in the countries visited, to share professional experiences and exchange best practices in areas of mutual interest.|$|E

Along the coast of Sindh province, bathing and swimming were banned for several days. There were minor power outages in Karachi due to heavy rainfall from Nilofar.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, it was {{announced}} that the Navy's Westland Lynx helicopters would be retired in favour of an all-Merlin fleet. However, the subsequent 2010 SDSR stated that the future naval helicopters would be the Merlin and the Wildcat, a derivative of the Lynx. Royal Navy Merlins have seen action in the Caribbean, on counter-narcotics and hurricane support duties, as well as <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> duties in the Persian Gulf. Merlins have also seen active duty in Iraq, providing support to British and coalition forces based in the region.|$|E
5|$|Many of Dalhousie's faculties and {{departments}} focus on marine research. The Faculty of Engineering operates the Ocean Research Centre Atlantic, which {{is dedicated to}} research and tests in naval and off-shore engineering. Schulich School of Law also operates the Marine & Environmental Law Institute, which carries out research and conducts consultancy activities for governmental and non-governmental organizations. The school's Department of Political Science similarly operates the Centre for Foreign Policy Studies, which is primarily concerned with the fields of Canadian and American foreign, security, and defence policy, including <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> policy.|$|E

5|$|The ADF makes a {{significant}} contribution to Australia's domestic <b>maritime</b> <b>security.</b> ADF ships, aircraft and Regional Force Surveillance Units conduct patrols of northern Australia in conjunction with the Australian Border Force (ABF). This operation, which is code-named Operation Resolute, is commanded by the Maritime Border Command which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and ABF. This operation involves a considerable proportion of the ADF's assets, with the forces assigned typically including two major naval vessels, multiple patrol boats, Regional Force Surveillance Unit patrols and AP-3 Orion aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international <b>Maritime</b> <b>security</b> operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E
5|$|The ADF {{currently}} has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's {{contribution to the}} Military intervention against ISIL makes up the largest overseas commitment with 780 personnel deployed as part of Operation Okra. As of November 2015, six F/A-18A Hornets, one E-7A Wedgetail and one KC-30A tanker were deployed to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Approximately 380 personnel were deployed to Iraq {{as part of an}} international effort to provide training and other forms of assistance to the Iraqi military. Deployments in Afghanistan number 250 personnel in Operation Highroad, a non-combat training mission supporting the Afghan National Army. A frigate is also deployed to the Middle East in <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> operations in and around the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces. Australian personnel also form part of peacekeeping missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to support operations in the region.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maritime</b> Safety and <b>Security</b> Teams (MSSTs) are Anti-terrorism (Force-Presence) units created {{under the}} <b>Maritime</b> Transportation <b>Security</b> Act of 2002 (MTSA) in {{response}} to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The eleven MSSTs provide waterborne anti-terrorism and shoreside Anti-terrorism, force protection for strategic shipping, high interest vessels, and critical infrastructure. MSSTs are a quick response force capable of rapid worldwide deployment via air, ground or sea transportation {{in response to}} changing threat conditions and evolving <b>Maritime</b> Homeland <b>Security</b> (MHS) mission requirements. Multi-mission capability facilitates augmentation for other selected Coast Guard missions. Other federal agencies that MSST's train with are U.S. Navy VBSS Teams, FBI, and their local SWAT Teams.|$|R

5|$|During {{this period}} Australia {{continued}} to retain forces in Malaysia {{as part of}} the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack, with this commitment initially including significant air, ground and naval forces. However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973, and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft. Australian submarines reportedly undertook a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the Orions have continued to participate in <b>maritime</b> <b>security</b> operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and <b>maritime</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E
