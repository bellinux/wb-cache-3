50|$|Congenital <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma,</b> while rare, is {{the most}} common kidney {{neoplasm}} diagnosed {{in the first three months}} of life and accounts for 3-5% of all childhood renal neoplasms. This neoplasm is generally non-aggressive and amenable to surgical removal. However, a readily identifiable subset of these kidney tumors has a more malignant potential and is capable of causing life-threatening metastases.

Diagnosis and therapy are carried out according to a joint European protocol, whereby the pathological evaluation and therapy are carried out according to international guidelines.

Particular attention was given to the adjacent renal tissue in which various histological features were noted: vacuolated and dysplastic tubules; cysts; and subcapsular epithelial tumourlets. The findings had aspects in common with both dysplastic kidneys and nephroblastoma. Classification of the tumours as normocellular and hypercellular was attempted, but there was considerable overlap. The behaviour of the tumour was good in all cases, although follow up was relatively short on some patients, and deaths from non-neoplastic causes occurred...|$|R

40|$|Cytogenetic and {{molecular}} {{analyses were performed}} on three cellular (atypical) congenital <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephromas</b> (CMNs). Two cases had trisomy 11; in one, it was the sole karyotypic abnormality, and the other had additional numerical changes {{as well as an}} isochromosome for the long arm of chromosome 1. Markers for the 11 p 13 and 11 p 15 loci were present in three copies in these two CMNs. In the third CMN, two apparently normal copies of chromosome 11 were present together with additional numerical and structural chromosome changes. Because loss of heterozygosity was observed for both 11 p 13 and 11 p 15 markers, we assume that mitotic recombination occurred. Duplication and loss of imprinting of genes at 11 p 15 has also been observed frequently in Wilms' tumor. We therefore propose that CMN and Wilms' tumor might share common genetic pathway...|$|R
40|$|Background: KIT is a transmembrane {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor, expressed in high amounts in various normal cells. In addition, c-kit mutation or activation {{is a major}} pathogenetic event in certain tumours (such as gastrointestinal stromal tumours). There are only limited data {{in the literature on}} the expression of KIT in normal and neoplastic renal tissues. Aims: To investigate KIT expression in normal and neoplastic renal tissues. Methods: KIT expression was evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry in paraffin wax embedded sections from 67 tissue samples. Results: Eight of eight fetal kidneys, and 10 of 10 normal adult kidneys revealed cytoplasmic staining of renal tubules. The three cases of renal dysplasia studied expressed KIT in their normal and aberrant tubules. Two of 13 conventional renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), two of seven papillary type RCCs, four of seven chromophobe type RCCs, none of six nephroblastomas, seven of seven oncocytomas, two of two <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephromas,</b> and two of four angiomyolipomas were positive.

40|$|Sixty-six solid {{neoplasms}} {{occurring in}} neonates treated at the Red Cross Childrens Hospital over a 34 -year period (1957 - 1991) were reviewed and recalled for long-term follow-up (mean 10. 4 years). Associated congenital abnormalities were rare, but chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 3 patients, {{one of which}} was familial. Teratomatous germ-cell tumours predominated, followed by neuroblastomas and soft-tissue tumours; 23 had malignant morphologic appearances and 43 were morphologically non-malignant. Seventy-nine per cent presented within the 1 st week of life, 41 % of these within the first 24 h. Although most sacrococcygeal teratomatous germ-cell tumours were benign, malignancy was present in 2 patients (1 of these presented during the 1 st week of life). A further 11 sacrococcygeal teratomas were found on light microscopy to include immature elements and had unpredictable clinical behaviour; 2 of these later metastasized despite adequate surgical clearance. All 4 patients with <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephromas</b> and 1 with a neonatal Wilm's tumour survived. In addition, 6 of the 10 patients with a neuroblastoma survived long-term. One of 3 patients with a rhabdomyosarcoma survived as well as 1 of 2 with a hepatoblastoma. Congenital fibrosarcomas, although morphologically aggressive, had an excellent outcome. Surgical excision was performed in all cases, and overall patient survival on long-term follow-up was 66 % (44 patients). These survivors included 10 (41 %) of those with malignant tumours and 24 (84 %) with potentially malignant tumours. Metastatic spread or secondary tumours were shown to occur at variable stages, and early, frequent, and regular fellow-up is recommended. Complications of extensive surgery resulted in 3 temporary and 2 long-term problems.

50|$|In infants, {{fibrosarcoma}} (often termed congenital infantile fibrosarcoma) {{is usually}} congenital. Infants presenting with this fibrosarcoma usually {{do so in}} the first two years of their life. Cytogenetically, congenital infantile fibrosarcoma is characterized by the majority of cases having a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15 (notated as t(12;15)(p13;q25)) that results in formation of the fusion gene, ETV6-NTRK3, plus individual cases exhibiting trisomy for chromosomes 8, 11, 17, or 20. The histology, association with the ETV6-NRTK3 fusion gene as well as certain chromosome trisomies, and the distribution of markers for cell type (i.e. cyclin D1 and Beta-catenin) within this tumor are similar to those found in the cellular form of <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma.</b> Indeed, <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> and congenital infantile sarcoma appear to be the same disease with the exception that mesoblastic lymphoma originates in the kidney whereas congenital infantile sarcoma originates in non-renal tissues.|$|E
5000|$|Wilm's tumor is {{the most}} common {{childhood}} kidney neoplasm, representing some %85 of cases. Unlike <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma,</b> <2% of Wilm's tumor patients present at under 3 months of age and most present in patients of >3 years of age. Bilateral kidney tumors, concurrent birth defects, and/or metastatic disease at presentation favor a diagnosis of Wilm's tumor.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1998 found that congenital <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> tissues taken from some patients contained an acquired mutation, the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. This gene {{results from a}} translocation of genetic material from the ETV6 gene located on the short arm (designated p) of chromosome 12 at position p13.2 (i.e. 12p13.2) to the NTRK3 gene located on the long arm (designated q) of chromosome 15 at position q25.3 (i.e. 15q25.3). This ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion is notated as t(12;15)(p13;q25) and consists of the 5' end of ETV6 fused to the 3' end of NTRK3. In consequence, the chimeric protein product of this gene lacks ETV6 protein's transcription factor activity while having NTRK3 protein's tyrosine kinase in an unregulated and continuously active form. Either event can drive the malignant growth of cells {{but in most cases}} the chimeric protein's tyrosine kinase activity appears responsible for doing so. Based on a limited number of genetic studies (a total of 65 patients), the ETY6-NTRK3 fusion gene appears to occur in most cases of the cellular and some cases of the mixed but no cases of the classical types of congenital mesolastic nephroma. However, a more recent study of 19 patients detected the fused gene in all 8 cases of cellular, 5 of 6 cases of mixed, and 0 of 5 cases of classic <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma.</b> This suggests that expression of this fused gene may be more common in cellar and mixed <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> than previously appreciated.|$|E
5000|$|Rhabdoid tumor, which {{accounts}} for 5-510% of childhood kidney neoplasms, occurs predominantly in children from 1 to 2 years of age. Unlike <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma,</b> rhabdoid tumors may present with tumors in other tissues including in ~13% of cases, the brain. Rhabdoid tumors have a distinctive histology and abnormalities (i.e. loss of heterozygosity, single nucleotide polymorphism, and deletions) in chromosome 22.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> patients with lymph node involvement or recurrent disease might benefit by adding the ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, either larotrectinib or entrectinib, to surgical, radiation, and/or chemotherapy treatment regimens. These drugs inhibit NTRK3's tyrosine kinase activity. Crizotinib has proven useful in treating certain cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that are associated with the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene while larotrectinib and entrectinib have been useful in treating various cancers (e.g. a metastatic sarcoma, papillary thyroid cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, mammary analog secretory carcinoma, and colorectal cancer) that are driven by mutated, overly active tyrosine kinases. Relevant to this issue, a 16-month-old girl with infantile fibrosarcoma harboring the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene was successfully trated with larotrectinib. The success of these drugs, howwever, will likely depend on the relative malignancy-promoting roles of ETV6-NTRK3 protein's tyrosine kinase activity, the lose of ETV6-related transcription activity accompanying formation of ETV6-NTRK3 protein, and the various trisomy chromosomes that populate <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the ETV6 gene {{are also}} {{associated}} with solid tumors. In particular, the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene occurs in and is thought or proposed to drive certain types of cancers. These cancers include secretory breast cancer (also termed juvenile breast cancer), mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of the parotid and other salivary glands, congenital fibrosarcoma, congenital <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma,</b> inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma.|$|E
5000|$|Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, {{which is}} {{responsible}} for 5-10 of childhood pediatric tumors, occurs predominantly in children from 2 to 3 years of age. Unlike meoblastic nephorma, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney presents with metastasis, particularly to bone, in 5-6% of cases; it histology is diverse and has been mistaken for <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma.</b> One chromosomal translocations t,(10;17)(q22;p13), has been repeatedly reported to be associated with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.|$|E
50|$|Trisomy, i.e. {{pathological}} {{presence of}} an extra chromosome, also occurs in these neoplasms. Trisomy of chromosome 11 (e.g. trisomy 11) {{appears to be the}} most commonly found trisomy in this disease, being detected in 7 of 13 genetically studied cases. Individual case reports have also found trisomy 8 (9 cases), 17 (4 cases), 20 (4 cases), 7 (3 cases), 10 (3 cases), 18 (2 cases), 2 (2 cases), and 9 (2 cases) associated with the disease. The contribution of these trisomies to the development of <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> is unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Infantile myofibromatosis is a fibrous tumor of infancy and {{childhood}} most commonly presenting {{during the first}} 2 years {{of life as a}} single subcutaneous nodule {{of the head and neck}} region or less commonly as multiple lesions of skin, muscle, bone, and in ~33% of these latter cases, visceral organs. All of these lesions have an excellent prognosis and can regress spontaneously except for those in which there is visceral involvement where the prognosis is poor. While infantile myofibromatosis and classic <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> have been suggested to be the same diseases because of their very similar histology, studies on the distribution of cell-type markers (i.e. cyclin D1 and Beta-catenin) indicate that they have different cellular origins.|$|E
50|$|Most {{children}} (>80%) with BWS do {{not develop}} cancer; however, children with BWS {{are much more}} likely (~600 times more) than other children to develop certain childhood cancers, particularly Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma), pancreatoblastoma and hepatoblastoma. Individuals with BWS appear to only be at increased risk for cancer during childhood (especially before age four) and do not have an increased risk of developing cancer in adulthood. If 100 children with BWS were followed from birth until age ten, about 10 cases of cancer would be expected in the group before age four, and about 1 case of cancer in the group would be expected between age four and ten.In addition to Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma, children with BWS have been shown in individual case reports to develop ganglioneuroma, adrenocortical carcinoma, acute lymphoid leukemia, liver sarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma.</b>|$|E
50|$|Congenital <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> {{typically}} (76% of cases) presents as an abdominal mass {{which is}} detected prenatally (16% of cases) by ultrasound or by clinical inspection (84% of cases) either at birth or by 3.8 {{years of age}} (median age ~1 month). The neoplasm shows a slight male preference. Concurrent findings include hypertension (19% of cases), polyhydramnios (i.e. excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac) (15%), hematuria (11%), hypercalcemia (4%), and elevated serum levels of the kidney-secreted, hypertension-inducing enzyme, renin (1%). Congenital anomalies {{have been reported in}} 11 patients: 6 with genitourinary anomalies, 2 with gastrointestinal anomalies, 1 with hydrocephalus, and 1 with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The vast majority of patients present with localized (i.e. non-metastatic) disease. Most patients' disease is classified at presentation as stage I or II (i.e. localized), few patients present with stage III (i.e. locally advanced/infiltrating), and virtually no patients present with stage IV (metastases present or V (i.e. tumors in both kidneys) disease (see staging of renal cancer).|$|E
5000|$|Infantile myofibromatosis (also {{known as}} [...] "Congenital {{generalized}} fibromatosis," [...] and [...] "Congenital multicentric fibromatosis") {{is the most}} common fibrous tumor of infancy, in which eighty percent of patients have solitary lesions with half of these occurring on the head and neck, and 60% are present at or soon after birth. Less commonly, infantile myofibromatosis presents as multiple lesions of skin, muscle, and bone with about 1/3 of these cases also having lesions in their visceral organs. All of these cases have an excellent prognosis with their tumors sometimes regressing spontaneously except for those cases in which there is visceral involvement where the prognosis is poor.. Infantile myofibromatosis and the classic form of <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma</b> have been suggested to be the same disease because of their very similar histology. However, studies on the distribution of cell-type markers (i.e. cyclin D1 and Beta-catenin) indicate that the two neoplasms likely have different cellular origins.|$|E
5000|$|ETV6-NTRK3 {{gene fusion}} is the {{translocation}} of genetic material between the ETV6 gene {{located on the}} short arm (designated p) of chromosome 12 at position p13.2 (i.e. 12p13.2) and the NTRK3 gene located on the long arm (designated q) of chromosome 15 at position q25.3 (i.e. 15q25.3) to create the (12;15)(p13;q25) fusion gene, ETV6-NTRK3. This new gene consists of the 5' end of ETV6 fused to the 3' end of NTRK3. ETV6-NTRK3 therefore codes for an chimeric oncoprotein consisting of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein dimerization domain of the ETV6 protein fused to the tyrosine kinase (i.e. PTK) domain of the NTRK3 protein. The ETV6 gene codes for the transcription factor protein, ETV6, which suppresses the expression of, and thereby regulates, various genes that in mice are required for normal hematopoiesis {{as well as the}} development and maintenance of the vascular network. NTRK3 codes for Tropomyosin receptor kinase C a NT-3 growth factor receptor cell surface protein that when bound to its growth factor ligand, neurotrophin-3, becomes an active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine residues on, and thereby stimulates, signaling proteins that promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of their parent cells. The tyrosine kinase of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein is dysfunctional in that it is continuously active in phophorylating tyrosine residues on, and thereby continuously stimulating, proteins that promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of their parent cells. In consequence, these cells take on malignant characteristics and are on the pathway of becoming cancerous. Indeed, the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene appears to be a critical driver of several types of cancers. It was originally identified in congenital fibrosarcoma and subsequently found in secretory breast cancer (also termed juvenile breast cancer), Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary glands (also termed MASC or MASCSG), congenital fibrosarcoma, congenital <b>mesoblastic</b> <b>nephroma,</b> rare cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, ALK-negative Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma.|$|E
