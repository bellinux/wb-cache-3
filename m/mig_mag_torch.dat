40|$|International audienceThe work {{presented}} in this paper relates to the optimization of operating parameters of the welding by the experimental design approach. The welding process used is the hybrid laser-MAG welding, which consists in combining a laser beam with an <b>MAG</b> <b>torch,</b> to increase the productivity and reliability of the chamfer filling operation in several passes over the entire height of the chamfer. Each pass, providing 2 mm deposited metal and must provide sufficient lateral penetration of about 0. 2 mm. The experimental design method has been used in order to estimate the operating parameters effects and their interactions on the lateral penetration on one hand, and to provide a mathematical model that relates the welding parameters of welding to the objective function lateral penetration on the other hand. Furthermore, in this study, we sought to the identification of the set of optimum parameters sufficient to comply with a constraint on the quality of weld bead. This constraint is to simultaneously obtain a total lateral penetration greater than 0. 4 mm and an H/L ratio less than 0. 6. In order to obtain this condition, the multi-objective optimization (for both response functions) of a weld bead by the implementation of the plans method using two categories of Experiments Plans, on two levels has been used: the first is a complete experimental design (CED) with 32 tests and the second a fractional experimental design (FED) with 8 tests.

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of narrow groove wall fusion, {{improving}} the weld formation, the welding test of different oscillation width and frequency is carried out by adopting the narrow high-speed swing <b>MAG</b> welding <b>torch.</b> On the basis of measuring the macro metallographic to determine the weld cross section size, the curve fitting of the variation trend of the weld section size with the swing width and the swing frequency is carried out. The effect of the high speed swing arc narrow groove welding MAG parameters on weld formation is studied. The results show that increasing the swing width or frequency can reduce the weld penetration and increase lateral wall penetration; when the swinging width makes side spacing greater than - 0  5 mm and less than 1 mm, good weld forming will be gained; when the oscillation frequency increases to more than 5 Hz, weld finger penetration can be eliminated, but when it is above 9 Hz, increasing the swing frequency cannot cause obvious change of the dimension of weld. The effects of these oscillating parameters on weld formation can provide guidance for the selection of welding parameters...|$|R

40|$|Atualmente a soldagem dos aços de baixo e médio carbono está literalmente difundida nas indústrias do setor metal-mecânico. Para os aços classificados como médio carbono (0, 3 % a 0, 6 %), muitas vezes, é necessário realizar algum processo térmico antes ou após a soldagem para evitar defeitos, como no caso de trincas induzidas por microestruturas frágeis. Assim este trabalho apresenta a soldagem MIG/MAG do aço SAE 1045, utilizando o processo de pré-aquecimento antes da soldagem. Este se enquadra na faixa dos aços de médio carbono, {{conforme}} classificação da norma SAE, podendo possuir entre 0, 43 % a 0, 50 % de carbono no material. Na análise comparativa entre os processos, observou-se que o uso do pré-aquecimento influencia positivamente na penetração da solda. Tal como, a tenacidade e ductibilidade da junta soldada tiveram um sensível aumento, por ter ocorrido uma taxa de extração de calor menor, influenciando no aumento do tamanho de grão na ZTA. Para análise comparativa, foram realizados ensaios de tração, ensaios de impacto Charpy-V, ensaios de dobramento, microdureza, além do ensaio metalográfico com objetivo de analisar a influência do pré-aquecimento nas principais propriedades mecânicas e metalúrgicas de uma junta soldada do aço SAE 1045. Currently {{the welding}} steels of low and medium carbon is literally {{widespread in the}} industries of the metal-mechanic sector. For steels classified as medium carbon (0. 3 % to 0. 6 %), oftentimes, {{it is necessary to}} defeat some thermal process before or after welding to avoid problems in the welding, {{as in the case of}} cracks induced by fragile microstructures. This work presents the <b>MIG</b> / <b>MAG</b> welding of SAE 1045 steel, using the preheating process before welding. This is the range of medium carbon steels, according to SAE classification, and may have between 0. 43 % and 0. 50 % carbon in the material. In the comparative analysis between the processes, it was observed that the use of the preheating influences positively the penetration of the weld. As the toughness and ductility of the welded joint had a significant increase, due to a lower heat extraction rate, influencing the increase of the grain size in the ZTA. For the comparative analysis, tensile tests, Charpy-V impact tests, folding tests, microhardness, of the metallographic test will be carried out to analyze the influence of preheating on the main mechanical and metallurgical properties of SAE 1045 steel welded joints...|$|R

Foram feitas as soldagens com os seguintes processos e materiais: processo eletrodo revestido (SMAW), tubo e calha em aço ASTM A 335 P 5, metal de adição AWS E 8018 -B 8 (experimento "F"). Processos MIG/MAG pulsado (GMAW-P) e arame tubular auto-protegido (FCAW-S), tubo e calha em aço API 5 L X 70, metais de adição AWS ER 80 S-G e AWS E 71 T- 11, respectivamente (experimento "R"). Para detectar as trincas a frio foram realizados exame visual e a inspeção com líquidos penetrantes. Adicionalmente as soldas foram avaliadas por macrografia e medição de dureza. Não foram detectadas trincas, apesar da utilização de metais de base e de adição com alto carbono equivalente e da junta com alta restrição, com o objetivo de aumentar as tensões. Admite-se que não houve fissuração devido ao uso de processos e/consumíveis com baixo teor de hidrogênio.
