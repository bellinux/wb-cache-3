40|$|Contemporary {{movements}} for {{the reform}} of global institutions advocate greater transparency, greater democracy, and greater accountability. Of these three, accountability is the <b>master</b> <b>value.</b> Transparency is valuable as means to accountability: more transparent institutions reveal whether officials have performed their duties. Democracy is valuable as a mechanism of accountability: elections enable the people peacefully to remove officials who have not done what it is their responsibility to do. “Accountability,” it has been said, “is the central issue of our time. ” The focus {{of this paper is}} accountability in international development aid: that range of efforts sponsored by the world’s rich aimed at permanently bettering the conditions of the world’s poor. We begin by surveying some of the difficulties in international development work that have raised concerns that development agencies are not accountable enough for producing positive results in alleviating poverty. We then examine the concept of accountability, and survey the general state of accountability in development agencies. A high-altitude map of the main proposals for greater accountability in international development follows, and the paper concludes by exploring one specific proposal for increasing accountability in development aid...|$|E

40|$|While {{weighted}} automata {{provide a}} natural framework to express quantitative properties, many basic properties like average response time cannot be expressed with weighted automata. Nested weighted automata extend weighted automata and {{consist of a}} master automaton {{and a set of}} slave automata that are invoked by the master automaton. Nested weighted automata are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e. g., average response time can be expressed with nested weighted automata), but the basic decision questions have higher complexity (e. g., for deterministic automata, the emptiness question for nested weighted automata is PSPACE-hard, whereas the corresponding complexity for weighted automata is PTIME). We consider a natural subclass of nested weighted automata where at any point at most a bounded number k of slave automata can be active. We focus on automata whose <b>master</b> <b>value</b> function is the limit average. We show that these nested weighted automata with bounded width are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e. g., average response time with no overlapping requests can be expressed with bound k= 1, but not with non-nested weighted automata). We show that the complexity of the basic decision problems (i. e., emptiness and universality) for the subclass with k constant matches the complexity for weighted automata. Moreover, when k is part of the input given in unary we establish PSPACE-completeness.

Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{visions of}} the good life in America through the lens of what middle-class parents from Liberal Protestant, Evangelical Protestant, Roman Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, and Atheist communities want for their children. In the book Habits of the Heart, Robert Bellah and associates famously posit that the dominant moral language of America today is one of utilitarian and expressive individualism. In this dissertation, I measure the degree to which parents in America are guided by that individualism {{and the degree to which}} they speak alternative languages that encourage concern for others and for the common good. Through participant observation, interviews, and a letter-writing task with eighty-three New England parents connected with particular congregations, as well as twelve comparable non-attending parents, I look at religious traditions, some of them with long histories in America, and others more recently prominent on the religious landscape, to see how religion shapes parental values. To what extent do parents from these traditions agree on what a good life looks like? And to what extent do we find divergence based on social location, ethnic background, and the beliefs and practices of their traditions? 	I find that parents across traditions hold five <b>master</b> <b>values</b> for their children [...] health, happiness (both in childhood and in adulthood), altruism, groundedness in identity, and autonomy. With a few important exceptions, parents see religion as having relatively little to do with the values of health and happiness, which turn out to be influenced more by social class. Religion plays a much greater role in parents' discussion of altruism, with various traditions expressing different forms of the Golden Rule. Parents from all groups also find that they cannot take for granted the transmission of religious identity within a materialistic, pluralistic, and increasingly secular culture. Religious identity is largely an achieved status, and all contemporary American religious communities are, to some degree, sectarian. Finally, parents want their children to be autonomous, but find that they often have to weigh this against other <b>master</b> <b>values.</b> These findings should encourage researchers to take more seriously both the contextual and the conflicting nature of human values...|$|R

The idea that ineffective moral education in schools may contribute to widespread corruption does not appear frequently in media or academic discussions. The study aims to explore the perceptions of teachers on the effectiveness of values clarification techniques versus traditional moral education methods currently used in Romanian education, after receiving training and applying the new techniques. It also aims to estimate motivation of teachers and willingness of students to participate in making moral education more effective. Qualitative analysis of individual written reports has been used to identify teachers’ perceptions and judgements, motivation for improving moral education, as well as relevant comments and suggestions after selecting and using in classroom one of the five values clarification techniques they received training on. Analysis identified what techniques teachers decided to use, the rationales underlying their decisions, the judgements both teachers and students made on the effectiveness of techniques, feelings and motivation of teachers and students to use such techniques in the future. Teachers understand that the current traditional moral education methods do not work. They are able to <b>master</b> <b>values</b> clarification techniques and successfully apply them in classroom. They value the training programs they took and are willing to acquire new information and skills on moral education. They are a real resource in implementing programs to make moral education more effective.
