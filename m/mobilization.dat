5|$|The {{debate over}} the {{proposed}} national constitution became moot when news of Italian troop movements in Tyrol and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial <b>mobilization</b> in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full <b>mobilization.</b> Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, {{and the next day}} he began full-scale <b>mobilization.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers <b>Mobilization,</b> a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers <b>Mobilization</b> and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of October 5/6, Zvi Zamir went to Europe to meet {{personally}} with Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian double agent. Marwan informed Zamir that a joint Egyptian-Syrian attack was imminent. Combined with other warnings and incidents, Marwan's warning finally convinced Zvi Zamir of the imminence of war. Eli Zeira, the director of Aman, sent a definite warning of war to the Israeli leadership at 04:30 on October 6. Aman erred when it concluded the Arabs were to attack at 18:00, an estimation in fact four hours late. Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir met with Defence Minister Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar at 08:05 for over an hour. Meir asked both men to present their views, which were conflicting: Dayan continued to believe war was not a certainty, while Elazar believed otherwise, arguing for a preemptive air strike against Syria. Dayan also proposed a partial <b>mobilization</b> of reserves, while Elazar favored a <b>mobilization</b> of the entire Air Force, and four armored divisions, totaling around 100,000–120,000 troops. Meir concluded the meeting by stating that no preemptive strike would be launched, {{in order to ensure}} the backing of the United States, but she sided with Elazar on the issue of <b>mobilization,</b> and orders were issued to reservists to mobilize.|$|E
40|$|The present volume offers {{historical}} {{perspectives on}} social <b>mobilizations</b> related to communication, information and culture as human rights (part I and II) {{in order to}} put contemporary <b>mobilizations</b> (part III) in perspective. It does so through an intergenerational and multi-vocal dialogue: different generations of scholars, activists and practitioners who have been engaged with <b>mobilizations</b> at different times, present their views; some adopting a more academic style, others reflecting autobiographically on personal experiences. In line with recent analyses that reflect awareness of the global dimension of contemporary social <b>mobilizations</b> around communication, the book aims at showing that locally-grounded <b>mobilizations</b> have been active in different geographical and cultural contexts for a long time: by moving beyond the prominent focus on the North American context that can be found in most studies in the field, the book aims at acknowledging the plural geo-cultural roots that compose what have in recent years become transnational <b>mobilizations</b> (part II on regional roots of <b>mobilizations).</b> Finally, the book intends to clarify the language and conceptual frames that accompany <b>mobilizations</b> also by positioning historically aware contributions in the transformed context in which <b>mobilizations</b> occur today - global, digitally mediated, multi-actors transnational policy making – and reflecting on new and transformed challenges (section III) ...|$|R

25|$|Takembeng <b>mobilizations</b> are {{the latest}} in a long history of female <b>mobilizations</b> in the Western grassfields of Cameroon. Sociologist Susan Diduk divides these <b>mobilizations</b> into three {{different}} periods (with prior forms continuing to exist in later periods). The first period of women exercising moral guardianship involved women in rural communities mobilizing to shame individuals who violated key community moral standards. A second period involved women from multiple communities connecting with one another to protest colonial and post-independence policies, primarily agricultural, from the 1950s on. Takembeng is the name for <b>mobilizations</b> which begun in the early 1990s and often took place with the opposition party to the government, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). Some sources claim that Takembeng is a long-standing practice in Ngemba communities and that it does not grow from the practices in the various communities.|$|R

These <b>mobilizations</b> continued through January 1991 and included task organized detachments {{of hundreds of}} Marines from across the Group and also approximately 32 individuals from the Group headquarters. They served in both CONUS and OCONUS locations, including Operation DESERT STORM. The vast majority of these mobilized reservists had deactivated by July 1991.|$|R

The Russian Empire ordered a partial <b>mobilization</b> one day later and the German Empire mobilized on 30 July 1914.

First, a unique up-to-date labour movement history based around the tension between authoritarianism and libertarianism – which the authors argue to be a fundamental axis {{in the organization of}} social life. Second, an empirical account and analysis of the potential of four recent high profile labour <b>mobilizations</b> to further libertarianism. Of particular interest is the role of social media in aiding these <b>mobilizations.</b> Four case studies of labour <b>mobilizations</b> are covered: Justice for Janitors (JFJ) in the USA; Justice for Cleaners (JFC) in the UK; Fast Food Forward (FFF) in the USA; and domestic workers in Hong Kong and Singapore. </p...|$|R
