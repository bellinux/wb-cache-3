2500|$|After Thusis {{was reached}} from Chur, the {{construction}} of the Albula Railway began on 15 October 1898. [...] Unlike the Bernina Railway, which was opened a good ten years later, and operated in fully electrified form right from the start, the Albula Railway was still a steam railway at its conception. [...] Moreover, (and again unlike the Bernina Railway), it was intended to be universally available, particularly for the transport of goods. [...] As the steam locomotives of the time were still not particularly powerful, and in order to permit the highest possible speeds, the <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> were restricted to 3.5%, and the minimum curve radius was also generously defined. [...] Thus, the Albula Railway, in the interests of maximising its effectiveness, did not test the technical bounds of an adhesion railway. However, such an architectural style required a variety of engineering structures. [...] So, for example, the viaducts were exclusively solidly constructed. Especially problematical was the ascent of the valley between Bergün/Bravuogn and Preda, where, in a distance of 5km as the crow flies, a difference in altitude of over 400m needed to be overcome. To stay within the maximum gradient parameters, the project supervisor, , devised an intricate alignment, which lengthened the line's formation by 12km. [...] Two , three , and a number of bridges overcame the engineering problem, by winding the track around like the thread of a screw. [...] On this part of the line, {{the construction of}} the 660m long [...] in particular led to problems, because the 4°C cold mountain water hampered the activities of the workers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engineer}} was John Cass Birkinshaw, {{the assistant}} engineer Alfred Lamert Dickens. In {{addition to the}} mainline from New Malton (on the York and Scarborough Railway) to Great Driffield (on the Hull and Selby Bridlington branch) the plans included a [...] branch from Frodingham Bridge on the River Hull.

50|$|The {{course for}} the last stage prior to the second rest day was again crushingly difficult, {{featuring}} five climbs. There were three first-category climbs, one second-category climb, and the Cima Coppi climb (the name given to the highest point in the race) of the Passo Giau. Each of the four climbs prior to the summit finish featured a lengthy descent, meaning that this stage contained the most vertical climbing of any in the race.

5000|$|The {{line was}} {{essentially}} straight along its length, the average curve being [...] radius. The ground was mainly marl and clay. Apart from the Lickey Incline, the <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> were 1-in-300 (0.3%). Of the Lickey, Whishaw writes in 1840: [...] "If this is satisfactorily effected, it will throw {{a new and}} useful light on the laying out of railways, and will save a vast original outlay in future works. We have long considered that the present system of making the 16 feet gradient the minimum, is far from desirable." ...|$|E
50|$|Freudenstadt, {{which is}} {{situated}} {{high above the}} upper Murg valley, had in 1879 received a connection towards Stuttgart with {{the completion of the}} Gäu Railway, part of the Württemberg rail network. Because of the difficult topographical conditions, the station, now Freudenstadt Central Station (Freudenstadt Hauptbahnhof), is located well to the south of the centre of the town. In order to improve the integration of Freudenstadt and serve the upper Murg valley better, the parliament of Württemberg decided in 1898 to build a branch line from the Freudenstadt central station via Baiersbronn to Reichenbach Priory (Klosterreichenbach).Because of the large differences in height between Freudenstadt and Baiersbronn, the routing of the line was difficult. Finally, the Freudenstadt Central Station-Freudenstadt Stadt-Baiersbronn section was adopted, with <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> of up to 5.0 percent, as a rack railway using the Riggenbach-Klose system. The station buildings were built according to various types of standardised designs to limit costs. The Royal Württemberg State Railways started operations to Klosterreichenbach on 20 November 1901.|$|E

This highway section, with an average gradient of 5.8% (and <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> over 6%), {{is one of the}} steepest stretches of motorway in the Swiss national road network. After the ascent portion, the canyon of Veveyse de Fégire is crossed by a bridge. Once reaching the plateau of Haute Veveyse, {{at the foot of the}} Alps, the road has only small differences in height. The culminating point is located, at an altitude of 866 m above sea level, at Weiler Prayoud northeast of Chatel-Saint-Denis. Here are the main European watershed between the Rhone with the catchment area of the Veveyse, and passes the Rhine (with the catchment areas of Broye and Sarine).|$|E

As a result, three optimum schemes are induced in this paper for 220 kV transmission lines. Parameters of compact lines and their unbalance, surge impedance, electric field distribution under the line, corona loss and radio noise level are also evaluated. EMF field management and field minimization over the right-of-way (ROW) of the optimum schemes are also presented. EMF fields are analyzed, evaluated and compared to attainable fields of standard compact and conventional lines...|$|E

Two sets of hills, with <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> (slopes) of 0. 2 (10 °) and 0. 4 (20 °), were considered. The flow remained attached in the former case while separation occurredin the latter. Characteristics of the mean flow and turbulence statistics are discussed and compared with profiles over a flat surface covered with the same roughness as the hills. Comparisons are made with linear theory predictions for the flow in the inner region and aloft. Accurate measurements of the surface pressure were also made, enabling the comparison between the measured pressure drag and predictions from theoretical and computational work with different turbulent closure schemes. Organised secondary flow in the spanwise direction, observed previously in both experimental and computational studies, was also observed here over the small hills...|$|E
40|$|The Ultraviolet Spectrometer and Polarimeter on the Solar Maximum Mission spacraft has {{observed}} {{for the first}} time the longitudinal component of the magnetic field by means of the Zeeman effect in the transition region above a sunspot. The data presented here were obtained on three days in one sunspot, have spatial resolutions of 10 arcsec and 3 arcsec, and yield maximum field strengths greater than 1000 G above the umbrae in the spot. The method of analysis, including a line-width calibration feature used during some of the observations, is described in some detail in an appendix; the line width is required for the determination of the longitudinal magnetic field from the observed circular polarization. The transition region data for one day are compared with photospheric magnetograms from the Marshall Space Flight Center. Vertical gradients of the magnetic field are compared from the two sets of data; the <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> of 0. 41 to 0. 62 G/km occur above the umbra and agree with or are smaller than values observed previously in the photosphere and low chromosphere...|$|E
40|$|The article reviews {{specific}} features of its fault-block {{structure of the}} Baikal-Yenisei fault in view of safe operations of nuclear energy facilities in the Krasnoyarsk region, Russia. The fault {{is located at the}} junction of the Siberian platform and the West Siberian plate. Velocities of neotectonic movements in the fault zone and adjacent territories are estimated from data on the current positions of fluvial terraces of the Yenisei river valley, peneplanation planes varying in ages and erosional incision depths. It is revealed that <b>maximum</b> <b>gradients</b> of recent movement velocities vary not higher than 10 – 8 to 10 – 9. Average velocities of relative displacements amount to 0. 1 – 0. 2 mm per year for intra-fault blocks bounded by regional faults and do not exceed 0. 02 – 0. 03 mm per year for intra-fault blocks bordered by local faults. There are grounds to conclude that recent geodynamic activity in the zone of the Baikal-Yenisei fault zone is weak and thus does not affect the safety of nuclear energy facilities operating in the region, including FGUP GKhK (Mining and Chemical Combine). </span...|$|E
