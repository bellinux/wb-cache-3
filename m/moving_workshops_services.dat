40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 This yearlong ethnographic {{case study}} {{documented}} {{the implementation of}} a 'moving' writing workshop at {{the first year of the}} Barnette Magnet School. This study focused on selected students in the 5 / 6 grades at the magnet school. In the <b>moving</b> writing <b>workshop,</b> the students changed rooms and worked in a variety of writing rooms that coincided with the writing process. The traditional writing process steps are prewriting/brainstorming, drafting, revise and response, editing, and publishing. The classroom teachers and staff at the school assisted students in the various writing rooms. This study looked at the benefits students gained by participating in the <b>moving</b> writing <b>workshop.</b> It addressed whether or not participation in the <b>moving</b> writing <b>workshop</b> improved the students' quality of writing and attitude toward writing. The writing quality and attitude of the students in the study did improve. However, after analyzing the data, with the research that was conducted, it was impossible to determine whether moving during the writing process was the factor that caused the improvements. The data did however show that the physical act of moving mostly had a positive impact on the students' writing...|$|R
