50|$|PolyCola is a <b>metasearch</b> <b>engine.</b> A <b>metasearch</b> <b>engine</b> {{is a tool}} {{which lets}} you submit a word or phrase in the search box. Then it sends your search {{concurrently}} to other individual search engines which then sends it to its own databases. Within couple of seconds, you receive the result from several search engines. A <b>metasearch</b> <b>engine</b> only sends your search terms to databases of individual search engines; {{it does not have}} its own database of web pages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> are {{not capable}} of {{decoding}} query forms or able to fully translate query syntax. The number of links generated by <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> are limited, and therefore do not provide the user with the complete results of a query.The majority of <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> do not provide over ten linked files from a single search engine, and generally do not interact with larger search engines for results. Sponsored webpages are prioritised and are normally displayed first.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> are {{so named}} as they conduct {{searches}} across multiple independent search <b>engines.</b> <b>Metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> often {{make use of}} [...] "screen scraping" [...] to get live availability of flights. Screen scraping {{is a way of}} crawling through the airline websites, getting content from those sites by extracting data from the same HTML feed used by consumers for browsing (rather than using a Semantic Web or database feed designed to be machine-readable). <b>Metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> usually process incoming data to eliminate duplicate entries, but may not expose [...] "advanced search" [...] options in the underlying databases (because not all databases support the same options).|$|R

The local search engines did not achieve higher recall than the global search <b>engines</b> or <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines,</b> but no search engine achieved more than 45 % recall. Despite the theoretical advantage of searching the databases of several individual search <b>engines,</b> <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> did not achieve higher recall. 36 % of relevant pages for the queries were outside the. nz domain. Implications for searching for geographically specific information, and for evaluation of search engines, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> {{submit the}} user query to several under- lying search engines and then merge their {{retrieved}} results {{to generate a}} single list that is more e®ective to the users information needs. According to the idea behind <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines,</b> it seems that merging the results retrieved from di®erent retrieval models will improve the search coverage and precision. In this study, we have investigated the e®ect of fusion of di®erent retrieval techniques {{on the performance of}} Persian retrieval. We use an extension of Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) operator called IOWA and a weighting schema, NOWA for merging the results. Our ex- perimental results show that merging by OWA operators produces better MAP...|$|R

50|$|Multisearch {{is a way}} to take {{advantage}} of the power of multiple search engines with a flexibility not seen in traditional <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines.</b> To the end user, a multisearch may appear to be just a customizable search engine; however, its behind-the-scenes technology enables it to put a face to the search process and to retrieve and display also a results set which has been classified by a human during a multisearch session and automatically included in the documents index.There are additional features available in many search <b>engines</b> and <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines,</b> but the basic idea is the same: reducing the amount of time required to search for resources by improvement of the accuracy and relevance of individual searches as well as the ability to manage the results.|$|R

5000|$|It is a {{major problem}} for <b>metasearch</b> <b>engines</b> because it tampers with the search robot’s {{indexing}} criteria, which are heavily relied upon to format ranking lists.
