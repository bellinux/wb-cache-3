50|$|<b>Moprolol</b> is a beta-adrenergic antagonist, or beta blocker. Typically <b>moprolol</b> is {{prescribed}} to treat hypertension, high blood pressure, anxiety, and glaucoma. <b>Moprolol</b> {{was first introduced}} by SIMS, or S.p.A Societa Italiana Medicinali e Sintetici, in 1982. SIMS is a private Italian company that has been present in the pharmaceutical industry since 1937. In 1972 SIMS first submitted a Drug Master file to the US FDA and has continued to do so over the years. In addition to formulating <b>moprolol</b> SIMES has also manufactured Omeral and Levotensin, derivatives of <b>moprolol.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Moprolol</b> {{has been}} the subject for many {{clinical}} trials to study the effect <b>moprolol</b> has on both blood pressure and glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|In many {{hypertension}} {{and blood pressure}} studies the <b>moprolol</b> is prescribed as a tablet given once a day, typically on a schedule. For glaucoma studies <b>moprolol</b> is typically prescribed as an ophthalmic solution where ½ a drop of 1% <b>moprolol</b> solution was given 2-3 times a day. The specific dosages and concentrations can {{vary depending on the}} severity of the condition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moprolol</b> was {{prominent}} in both literature and clinical trials {{up until the}} 1990s. At this point <b>moprolol</b> was pulled from the market. This could have been {{for a number of}} reasons, including FDA recalls and ineffective formulations. Through some clinical trials it was seen that <b>moprolol</b> was not as effective for treating blood pressure as originally thought, and this will be covered in the clinical section.|$|E
50|$|As {{previously}} mentioned <b>moprolol</b> is currently off the market, most {{likely due to}} the SIMS facility being in violation of US good manufacturing practices. This means that currently there are no sales being brought in by <b>moprolol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Moprolol</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} by SIMS in 1987 under US patent number 4647590. In this patent SIMS states that <b>moprolol</b> {{can be used}} to treat glaucoma when administered locally as well as arterial hypertension. Then it goes into the studies conducted that proved the effectiveness of <b>moprolol</b> to treat these conditions without having the side effects of treatments on the market. This led to many other patents over the years, a few of which are listed in the table below: ...|$|E
50|$|One {{significant}} {{clinical study}} in hypertension ran in 2013 using non-selective beta-blocker {{to study the}} effects on lowering blood pressure. In this study 30 participants were given 75 mg of <b>moprolol</b> twice a day. Through this study {{it was found that}} <b>moprolol</b> had no significant effect on lowering the heart rate.|$|E
5000|$|Levomoprolol is a beta {{adrenergic}} antagonist. [...] It is the (S)-enantiomer of <b>moprolol.</b>|$|E
50|$|That {{being said}} {{there is still a}} huge market for <b>moprolol,</b> both for {{hypertension}} and glaucoma treatment. A similar beta-blocker, metoprolol, that is very popular both overseas and in the US brought in an estimated €2.2 million in 2010 in Europe. Metoprolol is also sold for $2.93-$0.76 per pill here in the US. Since <b>moprolol</b> and metoprolol both treat hypertension the market and estimated sales should be the same, all of which is reasonable for this type of non-invasive treatment.|$|E
50|$|Before {{being pulled}} from the market <b>moprolol</b> was a {{prescription}} drug, meaning it must be prescribed from a doctor, {{and could not be}} given over the counter.|$|E
50|$|Both {{studies show}} that <b>moprolol,</b> or its derivatives, has some effect at {{lowering}} blood pressure but may not {{have an effect on}} the heart rate. This opens a way for future studies, especially in the treatment for glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though there}} were no {{specific}} FDA recalls issued for <b>moprolol,</b> the FDA has issued warnings to SIMS. In 2000 the FDA and the United States Department of Health and Sciences issued a warning letter to the SIMS facility. In this letter it stated that during a routine inspection of the SIMS facility {{it was found that}} there were significant deviations from the US good manufacturing practices when manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients. SIMS was then notified that until these deviations were corrected and another FDA inspection was completed the FDA will disapprove any applications for active pharmaceutical ingredients from the SIMS facility.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{clinical trial}} {{for the treatment of}} glaucoma with <b>moprolol</b> was conducted in 1994. This was a double-blind prospective trial to test the efficacy of lowering intraocular pressure when using l-moprolol alone and in combination with dipivefrin. In this study 27 patients that had glaucoma or ocular hypertension were given l-moprolol eye drops twice a day for 4 weeks. After this a combination of l-moprolol and dipivefrin eye drops were given for another 4 weeks. Through this study it was found that l-moprolol was a good treatment for glaucoma but that a treatment consisting of a combination of hypertension medications can have a greater effect at lowering ocular pressure.|$|E
