40|$|Abstract: A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation for analyzing heat transfer and fluid flow patterns in a plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> is presented in this study. Based on CFD and heat transfer theory, the numerical model of the nozzle in the plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> is developed, and the coupled simulation of the flow fluid and heat transfer is carried out with the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) method. The distributions of the current density, velocity and temperature in the plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> and the torch’s pressure are demonstrated. The present study provides a new means of research in this filed, which could be helpful {{in the future of}} plasma <b>cutting</b> and welding <b>torches...</b>|$|R

25|$|By the 1920s, most banks avoided using safes {{and instead}} turned to gigantic, heavy vaults with walls and doors several feet thick. These {{were meant to}} {{withstand}} not only robbers but also angry mobs and natural disasters. Despite the new security measures, these vaults were still vulnerable to yet another new invention, the <b>cutting</b> <b>torch.</b> Burning oxygen and acetylene gas at about , the torch could easily cut through steel. It was in use as early as 1907, but became widespread with World War I. Robbers used <b>cutting</b> <b>torches</b> in over 200 bank robberies in 1924 alone. Manufacturers learned to sandwich a copper alloy into vault doors. If heated, the high thermal conductivity of copper dissipates the heat to prevent melting or burning. After this design improvement, bank burglaries fell off and were far less common {{at the end of}} the 1920s than at the beginning of the decade.|$|R
30|$|Cantoro et al. [108] {{also used}} windowed {{standard}} deviation and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) approach {{to map the}} variance intensity of the turbulence in each region close to the plasma jet. They used a 450  W xenon arc lamp and a z-type schlieren setup to analyze a 25 A <b>cutting</b> <b>torch.</b> Prevosto et al. [27] proposed a technique based on the reconstruction by Abel inversion of refractive index, arc temperature and ionized-species density profiles. Their reconstruction method requires knowledge of the pressure {{in the region of}} investigation; so they focused at 3.5  mm below the nozzle on the torch axis, far beyond the shock front of a typical plasma <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> and a position where atmospheric pressure could be assumed. They investigated a 30 A <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> on a rotating anode by using a z-type schlieren system with a vertical knife edge and a 20  mW continuous laser source (main wavelength 632.8  nm) with a bandwidth filter to block the arc light. The same authors [109] improved their technique by using an additional laser source (main wavelength 514  nm), another bandwidth filter and a beam-splitter to allow the use of both laser sources. As the refractive index of the electrons is strongly dependent on the light wavelength of the probe beam, using two different light sources and modified two-temperature Saha equations the authors were able to separately evaluate the electron and the heavy particle temperatures.|$|R

30|$|Comment: Another false choice, but {{the main}} {{problems}} here are: (a) <b>Manual</b> <b>cutting</b> is sometimes required by circumstance, but it is neither technically nor economically feasible to do the required thinning at adequate pace and scale with <b>manual</b> <b>cutting</b> alone or as the primary method. (b) The scale of open burning required by Ingalsbee’s proposal would produce amounts of smoke and additional hazards not acceptable to current populations, especially when much cleaner and safer disposal could be done if most of the material were made into lumber or burned in biomass power plants. (c) It is disingenuous to imply that herbicide use is the alternative to <b>manual</b> <b>cutting</b> and prescribed burning. Herbicides can’t remove existing fuel, they can only add dead vegetation to the fuel load, so neither mechanical nor manual thinning would likely need or use herbicides in the initial treatments. And for longer term maintenance of acceptable fuel loads, the same herbicide issues would arise whether those fuel loads were initially established by hand or machine methods.|$|R

50|$|The {{reason the}} bridge {{did not fall}} was the shape charges lifted the bridge {{slightly}} when they went off and the bridge settled back down in the same exact spot.
