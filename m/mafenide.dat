40|$|For {{regenerative}} medicine to gain clinical acceptance, {{the effects of}} commonly used treatment regimens on bioengineered organs must be considered. The antibiotics <b>mafenide</b> acetate (<b>mafenide)</b> and neomycin plus polymyxin (neo/poly) are routinely used to irrigate postoperative skin grafts on contaminated wounds. The effects of these clinically used antibiotics were investigated using tissue-engineered human skin substitutes generated with primary human keratinocytes or the near-diploid human keratinocyte cell line, Near-diploid Immortal Keratinocytes. Following topical or dermal treatment, the skin substitutes were assayed for viability, tissue morphology, glycogen content, and the expression of active caspase 3. <b>Mafenide,</b> but not neo/poly, induced morphological and biochemical changes in tissue-engineered skin substitutes. Kerati-nocytes in all histological layers of mafenide-treated skin substitutes exhibited ballooning degeneration and glycogen depletion. Mafenide-treatment also triggered separation of basal keratinocytes from the underlying dermis. None of the antibiotic treatments induced apoptosis, as measured by active caspase 3 immunostaining.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{an explanation}} for in vitro sulfonamide enhancement by high-pressure oxygen (HPO) and the reported absence of enhancement with in vivo therapy, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures were exposed to selected antifolate antimicrobials {{in the presence of}} 1. 87 atm absolute of O 2 and compared with non-HPO treated controls. Under these conditions, HPO alone retarded growth. Trimethoprim, a non-sulfonamide which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, was not bactericidal, nor did HPO enhance existent bacteriostatic activity. The sulfonamide, sulfisozazole, was not bactericidal, but HPO enhanced bacteriostatic activity twofold; bacteriostasis was mitigated in HPO-treated and control cultures by p-aminobenzoate but not by a mixture of compounds involved in folate-mediated “ 1 -C” biosynthesis. <b>Mafenide,</b> a unique sulfonamide, at high concentrations with HPO, was synergistically bactericidal; non-HPO-treated cultures were bacteriostatically inhibited. Bacteriostatic activity of lower <b>mafenide</b> concentrations was also enhanced at least twofold by HPO. These inhibitory effects of <b>mafenide,</b> acting with or without HPO, were mitigated by the above mixture, but not by p-aminobenzoate. This may explain the lack of in vivo HPO-mafenide enhancement in burn-wound sepsis where exudates would contain such a mixture. Lastly, HPO itself was largely bactericidal at 2. 87 atm absolute of O 2. This was reversed to various degrees by the above mixture, or its components, or by folic, folinic, or p-aminobenzoic acids.

40|$|Background: Topical {{antimicrobials}} {{are employed}} for prophylaxis {{and treatment of}} burnwound infections despite no established susceptibility breakpoints, which are becoming vital {{in an era of}} multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. We compared two methods of determining topical antimicrobial susceptibilities. Methods: Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus (ABC) from burn patients were tested using broth microdilution and agar well diffusion to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zones of inhibition (ZI). Isolates had systemic antibiotic resistance and clonality determined. MDR included resistance to antibiotics in three or more classes. Results: We assessed 22 ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, 20 ABC (75 % MDR), 20 P. aeruginosa (45 % MDR), and 20 MRSA isolates. The most active agents were mupirocin for MRSA and <b>mafenide</b> acetate for the gram-negatives with moderate MICs/ZI found with silver sulfadiazene, silver nitrate, and honey. MDR and non-MDR isolates had similar topical resistance. There was no clonality associated with resistance patterns. Conclusion: Despite several methods to test bacteria for topical susceptibility, no defined breakpoints exist and standards need to be established.

40|$|Polymorphonuclear leukocytes from burned {{patients}} exhibit suppressed chemotaxis possibly {{related to}} the susceptibility of such patients to opportunistic infection. This study assesses the effect of normal serum upon burn-suppressed leukocytes {{and the effects of}} three commonly used topical chemotherapeutic agents upon the chemotaxis exhibited by granulocytes from normal controls. In vitro incubation with normal serum restored chemotaxis to normal in the suppressed granulocytes from burned patients. The serum factor responsible for this restoration was heat labile. Serum albumin alone did not exhibit this effect. Both <b>mafenide</b> and silver sulfadiazine suppressed the chemotactic function of granulocytes obtained from normal controls, while silver nitrate exhibited no such activity. Studies of the chemotactic function of control granulocytes after incubation with sera from burned patients yielded similar results; only the sera from patients treated with silver nitrate failed to suppress normal leukotaxis. The chemotactic impairment found in leukocytes from burned patients, however, while related to burn size and predictive of prognosis, did not vary with the agent used for the topical therapy. These data suggest the presence of a reversible intrinsic defect in leukotaxis consequent to burn injury, related to some factor deficient in burn serum. In addition, extrinsic impairment of normal granulocyte leukotaxis by two commonly used chemotherapeutic agents is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|CHAPTER 1 : Chapter 1 {{presents}} a comprehensive literature review on the biological applications of cationic clay minerals. Cationic clay minerals with many benefits towards human health {{have been used}} since prehistoric times. Although, clay minerals are abundant in nature, few synthetic clay minerals have also been synthesized. Synthetic cationic clay minerals manufactured to achieve the special requirements of some industries such as pharmaceutical industry. These requirements include high purity, specific particle size and clay mineral enriched with specific element like Fe or Zn. Apart from being natural or synthetic, clay minerals have been also modified with organic substrates {{in order to create}} new materials in combination with polymers. Clay polymer nano-composites (CPN) have been used in medical diagnostic and therapeutic devices, implants, regenerative medicine and controlled drug delivery devices. In this review, the application of natural or synthetic, modified or unmodified cationic clay minerals alone or in combination with polymers in biological systems will be discussed. These applications include drug delivery systems, wound dressing, tissue engineering, biosensors and biomedical devices. In following chapters each of mentioned applications will be discussed. This chapter has been prepared to submit to the journal of “RSC advances” under the title, “Cationic clay minerals for biological applications”. Authors: M. Ghadiri, W. Chrzanowski, and R. Rohanizadeh. CHAPTER 2 : In the second chapter application of Laponite in polymer/clay nano-composite was studied. Hybridizing clay minerals with polymers have recently received considerable attention due to the creation of new nano-composites with enhanced properties. Addition of clay minerals to polymers improves the performance of polymers for biomedical applications. For example, it can improve mechanical property, biodegradation, and even cellular responses of polymers. In this study Laponite added to the natural polysaccharide, alginate, to create an injectable biomaterial for load bearing areas. This hybridization has improved both physicochemical and biological properties of alginate/Laponite nano-composite. Three different ratios of alginate/Laponite nano-composite hydrogels were prepared to modulate the mechanical properties of alginate, as well as tunable injectability feature. This study demonstrated that combining Laponite with alginate improved alginate’s mechanical modulus, swellabilty, and viscosity without hindering the injectability of alginate. The biological effect of this hybridazation was also investigated. Research findings demonstrated that presence of Laponite in alginate film is not toxic for osteoblast cells and also support the cell attachment to the film. This Chapter is published in “Applied Clay Sciences, 2014, 85, 64 - 73 ” under the title “Physicochemical, mechanical and cytotoxicity characterizations of Laponite/alginate nano-composite” Authors: M. Ghadiri, W. Chrzanowski, W. H. Lee, A. Fathi, F. Dehghani, and R. Rohanizadeh CHAPTER 3 : Although clay minerals have gained much interest in recent years as potential sustained drug delivery vehicles, they have not yet been utilized or assessed as a local drug delivery device. In this chapter, Laponite tested for in situ drug delivery of tetracycline as an injectable gel for periodontal application. In this study, the effect of pH on the intercalation kinetics of tetracycline between the Laponite layers was studied to determine the optimal pH that maximizes intercalation of tetracycline. Then the release of tetracycline from the Laponite-tetracycline composite was investigated in a simulated saliva solution over 72 hours. The effectiveness of released tetracycline was assessed on gram positive and gram negative bacteria with MIC test and zone of inhibition. Results indicated that tetracycline successfully intercalated between the layers of the Laponite® regardless of pH. Intercalation also confirmed with XRD and FT-IR analysis. Moreover, tetracycline intercalated in Laponite interlayer was biologically active and inhibited growth of S. aureus and E. coli. Release study showed that, the extent of tetracycline release was slightly higher for the samples prepared at pH 4 compared to pH 3 and 6. The results from release study illustrated that the charge of intercalated tetracycline differs in all three formulation due to the various pH of intercalation medium. Different charge of intercalated tetracycline resulted in different release rate. This Chapter is published in “RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 20193 - 20201 ” under the title “Laponite clay as a carrier for in situ delivery of tetracycline” Authors: M. Ghadiri, H. Hau, W. Chrzanowski, H. Agus, and R. Rohanizadeh CHAPTER 4 : In this chapter, wound dressing application of Laponite gel, was studied. Drug carrier capacity of Laponite in conjunction with its ability to form a gel was utilized to prepare a wound dressing material. It has been established that infections may delay healing, cause failure of healing, and even cause wound deterioration. Therefore, for proper wound healing, it is necessary to provide an optimal environment which is free of infection. Thereby, an antibiotic eluting gel was produced to tackle infection problem. Laponite, a synthetic nanoclay and <b>mafenide,</b> an antibiotic were selected for this purpose. Laponite/mafenide (Lap/Maf) gel was formulated in 3 different ratios of Lap/Maf 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3. Intercalation rate of <b>mafenide</b> into the layers of Laponite nanoparticles and physicochemical properties, including wound dressing characteristics of materials were studied using various analytical methods. Release profile of <b>mafenide</b> was investigated in the simulated wound exudates fluid and the antibacterial effectiveness of the eluted <b>mafenide</b> was tested on a range of bacterial species. The cytotoxicity of materials was also evaluated in skin fibroblast cells. This chapter is published in “J Mater Sci: Mater Med, 2014, 25 (11), 2513 - 2526 ”, under the title, “Antibiotic eluting clay mineral (Laponite) for wound healing application; an in-vitro study”. Authors: M. Ghadiri, W. Chrzanowski, and R. Rohanizadeh. CHAPTER 5 : In following chapter, Laponite was functionalized with four different amino acids. Surface modification of cationic clay mineral with four different amino acids with acidic, basic and aliphatic side chains was investigated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The release profile of amino acid in the simulated wound exudate fluid demonstrated the highest release from Laponite/lysine group with up to 50...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcinetobacter baumannii is an {{increasingly}} {{common cause of}} infection in intensive-care units throughout the world, and the occurrence of multiresistant A. baumannii is increasing. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether a highly purified polyphenol, (–) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), from green tea (Camellia sinesis), had antimicrobial effects against multiresistant clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Standard microplate assays were performed to determine the MIC of EGCG for 21 clinical isolates of A. baumannii. MICs ranged from 0. 078 to 0. 625 mg/mL, with MIC 50 and MIC 90 of 0. 312 mg/mL and 0. 625 mg/mL, respectively. All of the isolates of A. baumannii tested were killed by EGCG. In time-kill assays, EGCG resulted in a 3 -log reduction in CFU/mL of A. baumannii after 5 h of incubation with the polyphenol. Synergy between the commonly used topical agent 5 % <b>mafenide</b> acetate (Sulfamylon) and EGCG was noted for one clinical isolate, and partial synergy was noted for three other isolates. These findings demonstrate that EGCG is an effective bactericidal agent against antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii clinical strains in laboratory settings.

40|$|Background: The {{recent report}} of {{high numbers of}} Acinetobacter baumannii {{bloodstream}} infections among service members injured in Iraq and Afghanistan during the period January 2002 through August 2004 has prompted an investigation into their etiology. A review of the current guidelines for open combat casualty wounds {{as part of this}} broad investigation was not mentioned in the report. Objective: The objective of this study was 2 -fold: to ascertain the susceptibility of A baumannii to currently available topical antibacterial agents and (2) to propose an alternative, effective treatment protocol for contaminated combat-related wounds so as to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of the wound serving as the source of A baumannii infection or septicemia. Methods: A standardized antimicrobial susceptibility study of 43 strains of A baumannii collected from a tertiary care burn center was conducted using 2 commonly used topical antibacterial agents, 1 % silver sulfadiazine cream (Silvadene) and 5 % <b>mafenide</b> acetate solution (5 % Sulfamylon Solution). Results: Both were effective, but 5 % Sulfamylon Solution demonstrated significantly greater antibacterial activity. Conclusion: Five percent Sulfamylon Solution, initially developed for wartime use, and currently limited by the Food and Drug Administration to soaks following meshed split-thickness autografts following excision of second-degree and third-degree burns, has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and extensive off-label applicability. It is an ideal agent for use in the treatment of war wounds, and should be considered as a superior replacement for normal saline in the current guidelines for open combat casualty wound...|$|E

The assay is initiated by illuminating the cells and is stopped by turning the light off and killing the cells with acid. Enzyme activity was estimated from acid-stable radioactivity. With bovine CA, 1. 5 Wilbur-Anderson units (WAU) was consistently measured at 5 - to 6 -fold above background. Sonicated whole cells of air-adapted wild-type C. reinhardtii had 740 [plus or minus] 12. 4 WAU/mg chlorophyll (Chl). Sonicated chloroplasts from a mixotrophically grown wall-less strain, cw- 15, had 35. 5 [plus or minus] 2. 6 WAU/mg Chl, whereas chloroplasts from wall-less external CA mutant strain cia 5 /cw- 15 had 33. 8 [plus or minus] 1. 9 WAU/mg Chl. Sonicated chloroplasts from the wall-less mutant strain cia- 3 /cw- 15, believed to lack an internal CA, had 2. 8 [plus or minus] 3. 2 WAU/mg Chl.
