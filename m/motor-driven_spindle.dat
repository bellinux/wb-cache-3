40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an articulated arm robot-type device for handling a payload, comprising a robot arm (R), which {{is attached to}} a base (1) that can be rotated about a first axis (A 1), and at least two arm elements (2, 3), which are arranged one behind the other {{in the form of a}} kinematic chain and a first arm element (2) of which is mounted on the base (1) in a pivotal manner about a second axis (A 2) that is oriented orthogonally relative to the first axis and a second arm element (3) of which is attached to the first arm element (1) in a pivotal manner about a third axis (A 3) that is oriented parallel to the second axis (A 2). The device also comprises a central hand (4) which is attached to the end of the kinematic chain. A first linear actuator (4) is provided which pivots the first arm element (2) about the second axis (A 2) and which is operatively connected to the base (1) and to the first arm element (2) via a first coupling transmission (K 1), and a second linear actuator (5) is provided which pivots the second arm element (3) about the third axis (A 3) and which is operatively connected to the base (1), the first arm element (2), and the second arm element (3) via a second coupling transmission (K 2). The first and the second linear actuator (4, 5) are each designed in the form of a spindle drive, each spindle drive providing a <b>motor-driven</b> <b>spindle</b> nut unit (41, 51) which is engaged with a spindle (42, 52) in the form of a threaded rod, wherein the threaded rod is mounted in a pivotal manner about a pivot axis (SA 4, SA 5) which is oriented parallel to the second axis (A 2). The invention is characterized in that the first coupling transmission (K 1) is operatively connected to the <b>motor-driven</b> <b>spindle</b> nut unit (41) of the first linear actuator (4) in a pivotal manner via a first universal joint (4 K), and the second coupling transmission (K 2) is operatively connected to the <b>motor-driven</b> <b>spindle</b> nut (51) of the second linear actuator (5) in a pivotal manner via a second universal joint (5 K); the first and the second universal joint (4 K, 5 K) each has a pivot axis which is oriented parallel to the second axis (A 2) and a pivot axis which is oriented orthogonally to the second axis (A 2); the second coupling transmission (K 2) has a first coupling means (8) and a second coupling means (9), each of which transmits pulling and pushing forces; the first coupling means (8) is a ternary transmission element in the form of a rigid triangular structure, the first coupling means (8) being mounted on each corner of the triangular structure about a pivotal axis such that the coupling means (8) is connected to the spindle nut unit (51) in a pivotal manner about a first pivot axis, which is a pivot axis of the second universal joint (5 K), to the first arm element (2) in a pivotal manner about a second pivot axis (SA 51), and to the second coupling means (9) in a pivotal manner about a third pivot axis (SA 53); and the second coupling means (9) is designed in the form of a rigid connecting brace, one end of which is connected to the first coupling means (8) in a pivotal manner about the third pivot axis (SA 53) and the other end of which is connected to the second arm element (3) in a pivotal manner about a pivot axis (SA 52) ...|$|E
