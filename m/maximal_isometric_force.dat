40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine if creatine supplementation assisted with reducing the amount of exercise induced muscle damage and if creatine supplementation aided in recovery from exercise induced muscle damage. Two groups of subjects (group 1 = creatine; group 2 = placebo) participated in an eccentric exercise protocol following 7 and 30 days of creatine or placebo supplementation (20 g. d- 1 for 7 d followed by 6 g. d- 1 for 23 d = 30 d). Prior to the supplementation period, measurements were obtained for maximal dynamic strength, <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force,</b> knee range of motion, muscle soreness, and serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Following 7 days of creatine supplementation, on day 8, subjects began consuming 6 g. d- 1 of creatine for 23 days.

Aims: The aims {{of this study is to}} determine, the manner of <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> production, at the level ofvertebral column, in relation with consequent preferential utilization of right and left superior and inferior limbs,in Romanian female subjects. Methods: This study used 16 Romanian sedentary females (8 subjects with right superior and inferior dominantlimbs and 8 subjects with left superior and inferior dominant limbs), white caucasian, with age between 30 and 40 years old. Body height was estimated with an error of 0, 5 cm. and body weight was evaluated with a calibrated digital scale,with an error of 0. 05 kilograms. The body fat percentage was estimate using a bioelectric impedance method(Omron BF- 306). <b>Maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> of the lumbar/thoracic column was measured with special machinesin all three planes – flexion with David F 130 Lumbar/Thoracic Flexion at 30 º angle and extension with DavidF 110 Lumbar/Thoracic Extension at 30 º angle, in sagittal plane – right lateral flexion and left lateral flexion withDavid F 150 Lumbar/Thoracic Lateral Flexion at 0 º angle, in frontal plane – right lateral rotation and left lateralrotation with David F 120 Lumbar/Thoracic Rotation at - 30 º angle, in transversal plane. Results: Subjects with right superior and inferior dominant limbs, generates maximal isometric forcesignificantly higher for left lateral flexion, then right lateral flexion (t= 4, 59) and for right lateral rotation, thenleft lateral rotation (t= 4, 408).

40|$|The {{functional}} task test is a multi-disciplinary study investigating how space-flight {{induced changes}} to physiological systems impacts functional task performance. Impairment of neuromuscular function {{would be expected}} to negatively affect functional performance of crewmembers following exposure to microgravity. This presentation reports the results for muscle performance testing in crewmembers. Functional task performance will be presented in the abstract "Functional Task Test 1 : sensory motor adaptations associated with postflight alternations in astronaut functional task performance. " METHODS: Muscle performance measures were obtained in crewmembers before and after short-duration space flight aboard the Space Shuttle and long-duration International Space Station (ISS) missions. The battery of muscle performance tests included leg press and bench press measures of isometric force, isotonic power and total work. Knee extension was used for the measurement of central activation and <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force.</b> Upper and lower body force steadiness control were measured on the bench press and knee extension machine, respectively. Tests were implemented 60 and 30 days before launch, on landing day (Shuttle crew only), and 6, 10 and 30 days after landing. Seven Space Shuttle crew and four ISS crew have completed the muscle performance testing to date. RESULTS: Preliminary results for Space Shuttle crew reveal significant reductions in the leg press performance metrics of <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force,</b> power and total work on R+ 0 (p< 0. 05). Bench press total work was also significantly impaired, although <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> and power were not significantly affected. No changes were noted for measurements of central activation or force steadiness. Results for ISS crew were not analyzed due to the current small sample size. DISCUSSION: Significant reductions in lower body muscle performance metrics were observed in returning Shuttle crew and these adaptations are likely contributors to impaired functional tasks that are ambulatory in nature (See abstract Functional Task Test: 1). Interestingly, no significant changes in central activation capacity were detected. Therefore, impairments in muscle function in response to short-duration space flight are likely myocellular rather than neuromotor in nature...|$|E

Additionally, the relationship between the biomechanically relevant Strength-Strain-Index (SSI, density weighted polar section modulus) obtained by pQCT and the <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> and the torque at the distal radius was evaluated in a clinical study. In the experimental aspect of the work, 12 non fixated human radii were extracted post mortem and investigated. The samples were normalized in length and fixed in especially prepared bearings. The diaphyseal region was investigated by pQCT. Two strain gauge chains each were fixed at the ventral and dorsal side of the samples. In (a) a four point bending test the samples were bended inside the elastic range of the material (2000 µstrain) and thereafter (b) fractured in a three point fracture test. The bending stiffness was calculated and the fracture load was detected. Both parameters were highly correlated (r all > 0. 9;. p< 0. 0001) with the stiffness parameters (I and R) calculated by the pQCT measurements. The clinical aspect of this work was a stratified cross-sectional investigation of 79 women. The radius was examined by pQCT at 4 % and 20 % of the radial length. The <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> of the forearm was measured and the torque (<b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> multiplied by the length of the arm) calculated.

The <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> of the elbow flexors of fourteen young male volunteers was measured at five different elbow angles between 50 degrees and 160 degrees. Subjects were then divided into two groups: the eccentric group (ECC, n= 7) and the isometric group (ISO, n= 7). Subjects in the ECC group performed 50 maximal voluntary eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer (30 degrees x s(- 1)), while subjects in the ISO group performed 50 maximal voluntary isometric muscle contractions with the elbow flexors at a lengthened position. Following the ECC and ISO exercise protocols, <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> at the five angles, muscle soreness, and the relaxed (RANG) and flexed (FANG) elbow angles were measured at 24 h intervals for 4 days. All results were presented as the mean and standard error, and a quadratic curve was used to model the <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> data obtained at the five elbow angles. This approach not only allowed us to mathematically describe the angle-force curves and estimate the peak force and optimum angle for peak force generation, but also enabled us to statistically compare the shift of the angle-force curves between and within groups. A large and persistent shift of the angle-force curve towards longer muscle lengths was observed 1 day after eccentric exercise (P< 0. 01). This resulted in a approximately 16 degrees shift of the optimum angle for force generation, which remained unchanged for the whole observation period. A smaller but also persistent shift of the angle-force curve was seen after isometric exercise at long muscle length (P< 0. 05; shift in optimum angle approximately 5 degrees). ECC exercise caused more muscle damage than ISO exercise, as indicated by the greater changes in RANG and ratings of muscle soreness (P< 0. 05). It was suggested that the shift in the angle-force curve was proportional to the degree of muscle damage and may be explained by the presence of overstretched sarcomeres that increased in series compliance of the muscle...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A current {{doctrine}} in the dynamometric approach to determine lateralization of hand function states that in 10 % of cases, the non-dominant hand will be {{stronger than the}} dominant hand. In this study, a novel MRI based modelling approach {{was applied to the}} first dorsal introsseus muscle (FDI), to determine whether the 10 % rule may be applied to the FDI and may be partially explained by the arrangement of the anatomical components of the FDI. Methods Initially the force generated by the thumb segment during an isometric pushing task in the horizontal plane was measured from 25 strongly right-handed young males. Nine of these participants then had structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) of the thumb and index osseous compartment. A modelling technique was developed to extract the muscle data and quantify the muscle line of action onto to the first metacarpal bone segment in order to quantify the muscle force at the point of momentary rotation – equilibrium. Results Eight of 25 subjects exhibited stronger force from the left hand. Six out of nine subjects from the MRI possessed significantly greater angles of attachment of the index osseous compartment on the left (non-dominant) hand. These six subjects also generated greater <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>forces</b> from the FDI of the left side. There was a significantly greater muscle volume for the right FDI muscle as compared to the left as measured from the reconstructed MRI slice data. Conclusions The calculated force produced by the muscle is related to the angle of attachment of the muscle to bone in the index osseous compartment.

One recommended treatment is a strengthening exercise of the quadriceps muscle, which may be performed in closed or open kinetic chains. This study was designed to compare the effect of straight leg raise (SLR) and semi-squat exercises on the {{treatment of}} patellar chondroma-lacia, which has not been done to date. Material and methods: 32 female university students with a diagnosis of patellar chondromalacia were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: SLR and semi-squat exercise. Before starting exercise protocols, Q angle, <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> voluntary contraction <b>force</b> (MIVCF) of quadriceps, crepitation, circumference of thig...|$|R
40|$|Strength training, or {{resistance}} training, {{is a form}} {{of physical}} conditioning used to increase the ability to resist force. Since muscular strength is required for success in many sports, it is logical to assume that stronger and more powerful young athletes will achieve better results. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the effects of strength training on young athletes. An eight-week strength training program for developing muscle strength was performed in this study. Training protocol was designed specifically for young adolescent’s athletes. The program consisted of exercises for lower and upper body, abdominal and lower back muscles. The programs did not involve the maximal (1 - 3 repetitions maximum) and other very hard intensity exercises that may had negative effect on young athletes. The results showed that strength training program had positive effects on <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> muscle <b>force</b> (Fmax) and motor skill. The increase presents the combined influence of strength training and growth...|$|R
40|$|Mentor: Kimberly HueySpinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) results in loss of muscle {{function}} {{due to the}} rapid breakdown of muscle contractile proteins and high incidence of inflammation that directly hinder rehabilitation. Glutamine is an amino acid that plays {{a critical role in}} muscle integrity and in reducing inflammation, however, impaired glutamine synthesis occurs under stressful conditions. Glutamine supplementation can improve clinical outcomes from acute infection to sepsis, but its effects on skeletal muscle function in the early stages after a SCI are unknown. Based on glutamine’s benefits and clinical applicability these experiments tested the hypothesis that glutamine treatment can preserve muscle mass, strength, and fatigue resistance in a mouse model of SCI. Changes in muscle mass, <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force,</b> and fatigability will be measured 7 days after sham or spinal cord transection (ST) surgery in mice receiving either placebo or glutamine (n= 3 - 5 /group). ST significantly reduced gastrocnemius mass independent of saline or glutamine treatment. <b>Maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> normalized to body or muscle mass was not different among groups. Fatigue resistance was reduced with ST + saline, however, glutamine supplementation prevented the loss of fatigue resistance (38 ± 9 vs. 57 ± 5 % of max force, respectively). Preliminary results suggest that 7 days after a SCI significant reductions in muscle fatigue resistance can be reversed by glutamine supplementation. Additional studies can continue to establish the protective effects of glutamine on muscle endurance with SCI, underscoring the importance of glutamine as a therapeutic intervention to accelerate the recovery of muscle function after a SCI.

40|$|Compliance of {{the series}} elastic {{component}} (SEC) of rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle-tendon complex was measured using quick length decreases (0. 2 mm within 3 ms) during isometric contractions. Extension of tendinous structures at <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> level was measured by means of photography. These data allowed us to distinguish between series elastic compliance of tendinous structures and muscle fibres (cross-bridges). Using mathematics, similar as in the Alpha method (MORGAN, 1977), a force dependent component and a constant component of series elastic compliance could be distinguished. Extension values of SEC in the cross-bridges of about 1. 5 % of fibre length were found, which is close to values found for isolated frog muscle fibres. The force dependent compliance was significantly higher (3 %). Therefore, it is concluded {{that part of the}} force dependent compliance resides within the tendinous structures, even beyond the toe-region. Thus, at high force levels compliance of tendinous structures is not constant. Direct measurements on isolated GM tendon confirmed this conclusion. Functional consequences of these tendinous properties are discussed. For both EDL and GM, about 85 % of SEC extension at <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> (F.) appeared to be located in the tendinous structures. However, tendinous compliance, normalised with respect to its length, is higher for GM. For GM the free tendon is more compliant than aponeurosis, whilst EDL has a rather uniform distribution of normalised compliance along free tendon and aponeurosis. Differences of tendinous compliance may be related to functional differences between the muscles...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of free-weight and machine-based exercises to increase different strength and speed-strength variables. One hundred twenty male participants (age: 23. 8 ± 2. 5 years; body height: 181. 0 ± 6. 8 cm; body mass: 80. 2 ± 8. 9 kg) joined the study. The 2 experimental groups completed an 8 week periodized strength training program that included 2 training sessions per week. The exercises that were used in the strength training programs were the parallel barbell squat and the leg press. Before and after the training period, the 1 -repetition-maximum in the barbell squat and the leg press, the squat jump, the countermovement jump and unilateral isometric force (<b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> and the rate of force development) were evaluated. To compare each group pre vs. post-intervention, analysis of variance with repeated measures and Scheffé post-hoc tests were used. The leg press group increased their 1 -repetition-maximum significantly (p < 0. 001), while in the squat group such variables as 1 -repetition-maximum, the squat jump and the countermovement jump increased significantly (p < 0. 001). The <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> showed no statistically significant result for the repeated measures factor, while the rate of force development of the squat group even showed a statistically significant decrease. Differences between the 2 experimental groups were detected for the squat jump and the countermovement jump. In comparison with the leg press, the squat might be a better strength training exercise for the development of jump performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{decline in}} <b>isometric</b> <b>force,</b> {{swelling}} of sarcoplasmic reticulum {{and loss of}} desmin was measured in semimembranosus lateralis muscle of male Wistar rats immediately after a short series of brief (500 ms) <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> contractions. For the active muscle, the series ended below (protocol A) and just over muscle optimum length (protocol AA). In one protocol, the muscle remained passive and was extended to lengths just over muscle optimum length (protocol P). After all experimental protocols, no loss of desmin was observed and sarcomere appearance was normal. Protocol A produced swelling (87 %) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum but no decline in <b>isometric</b> <b>force.</b> Protocol AA produced larger swelling (147 %) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and an <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> decline (< 49 %) at short muscle lengths. Swelling of sarcoplasmic reticulum was observed mainly in the periphery of muscle fibres. Protocol P {{did not result in}} swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and <b>isometric</b> <b>force</b> decline. It is concluded that swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the periphery of muscle fibres after brief <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> contractions is associated with muscle force and not muscle length...|$|R
40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} were to compare the effects of a single bout of {{preventive}} or regenerative foam rolling (FR) on exercise-induced neuromuscular exhaustion. Single-centre randomised-controlled study was designed. Forty-five healthy adults (22 female; 25 ± 2 yrs) were allocated to three groups: 1) FR of the lower limb muscles prior to induction of fatigue, 2) FR after induction of fatigue, 3) no-treatment control. Neuromuscular exhaustion was provoked using a standardized and validated functional agility short-term fatigue protocol. Main outcome measure was the <b>maximal</b> <b>isometric</b> voluntary <b>force</b> of the knee extensors (MIVF). Secondary outcomes included pain and reactive strength (RSI). Preventive (- 16 %) and regenerative FR (- 12 %) resulted in a decreased loss in MIVF compared to control (- 21 %; p 0. 8, p < 0. 1). Differences over time (p < 0. 001) between groups regarding pain and RSI did not turn out to be clinically meaningful. A single bout of foam rolling reduces neuromuscular exhaustion with reference to maximal force production. Regenerative rather than preventive foam rolling seems sufficient to prevent further fatigue...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine a course of force {{potentiation}} and/orinhibition during maximal voluntary eccentric action. Maximal voluntary force (MVC) of elbow flexion of ten healthy male volunteers was measured during isometric and isokinetic eccentric action starting from 80 ° or 110 ° andending at 140 ° elbow angle. Surface EMG was recorded from biceps brachii (BB) and brachioradialis (BR) muscles. Maximal voluntary eccentric force during the first 10 ° of the movement was higher (P< 0. 001) than the <b>maximal</b> voluntary <b>isometric</b> preactivation <b>force</b> both in 80 ° and in 110 ° starting position at all three velocities (1, 2, and 4 rad s- 1). The relative force potentiation was velocity dependent being smallest at the lowest stretching speed (P< 0. 01). Average EMG (aEMG) of BB and BR decreased as the joint angle increased both in eccentric and in isometric actions but the decrease in a EMG towards extension was somewhat higher in eccentric actions as compared to isometric. It was concluded that the force measured during the first 10 ° of eccentric contraction always exceeded the <b>maximal</b> voluntary <b>isometric</b> preactivation <b>force</b> regardless of the joint angle or of the movement velocity. When maximal voluntary preactivation preceded the stretch, the relative force potentiation seemed to be greater at higher stretching velocities (velocity dependent) while at lower preactivation levels, the velocity dependence was not observed. Decreased muscle activation and lower maximal voluntary force towards the end of the movement suggested inhibition during maximal voluntary eccentric actions...|$|R
