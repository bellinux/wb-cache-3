Several deleted scenes were restored to the episode, bringing its total running time to 37 <b>minutes,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> one-hour timeslot. It gained a rating of 5.8/10, averaged across 40 stations. This made Friends the third-highest-rated off-network syndicated sitcom to air at that time, behind Home Improvement and Seinfeld.|$|E

25|$|On September 12, 1952, the New York Central's last steam-powered train {{run in the}} {{metropolitan}} area ran on the Harlem Division, being replaced by diesel locomotives, which could run on both electricity and diesel fuel, eliminating the need to change at North White Plains, saving a few <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. However, they began wearing out in the 1970s, leading to a decline in service.|$|E
25|$|The B–T {{system was}} also widely used by {{military}} forces {{to determine the}} location of enemy radio broadcasters. This required some time to perform, often {{on the order of}} several <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good fix. This led to various systems to speed the broadcast of messages to make such operations difficult. An example was the German Navy's Kurzsignale code system which condensed messages into short codes, and the fully automated burst encoding Kurier system that sent a Kurzsignale in only ½ a second.|$|E
25|$|April Fools' Day 2017 {{featured}} another {{social experiment}} based around /r/place. The subreddit contained a collaborative pixel art canvas, where a user could place a pixel {{every five minutes}} (the timer was temporarily ten and twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few hours on April 1). Many people worked together to create large graphics, such as flags or symbols. Often subreddits would come together as a group to add a graphic from that community to place.

25|$|The State Street Subway {{opened on}} October 17, 1943, {{providing}} two new tracks bypassing the Loop tracks and {{the portion of}} the North and South Side 'L' lines not equipped with express tracks. By providing an express route free of the most restrictive curves on the Chicago 'L' and shorter than the old line it supplemented, the subway reduced running time by as much as eleven <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> one-way trip. The route was placed in operation on October 17, 1943, for a portion of the through north-south trains, although other trains continued to use the 'L' both on through trips and on services circling the Loop and returning to the point of origin.|$|E
25|$|Originally serials were {{broadcast}} as fifteen-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, As the World Turns and The Edge of Night, both {{produced by}} Procter & Gamble Productions, debuted {{as the first}} half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes {{by the end of}} the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length {{by the end of the}} decade (Another World even expanded to 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2012, three of the four US serials air one hour episodes each weekday; only The Bold and the Beautiful airs 30-minute episodes.|$|E
25|$|PATH {{operates}} 24hours a day, {{seven days}} a week. During weekday hours, PATH operates four train services, using three terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan. Each line is represented by a unique color, which also corresponds {{to the color of}} the lights {{on the front of the}} trains. The Journal Square – 33rd Street (via Hoboken) service is the only line represented by two colors (orange and blue), since it is a late-night hours combination of the Journal Square – 33rd Street and Hoboken – 33rd Street services. During peak hours, trains operate every four to eight minutes on each service. Every PATH station except Newark and Harrison is served by a train every two to three <b>minutes,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> peak-hour service of 20 to 30 trains per hour.|$|E

25|$|The mandibular stylet tips {{have small}} teeth, and through {{alternately}} moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts {{a path through}} tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel. Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes. The bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts {{it back into the}} labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place. It takes between five and ten <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bed bug to become completely engorged with blood. In all, the insect may spend less than 20 minutes in physical contact with its host, and does not try to feed again until it has either completed a moult or, if an adult, has thoroughly digested the meal.|$|E
25|$|From Townsville, Queensland to Bendigo, Victoria is 1,800 {{miles and}} the MCC played {{the second of}} three {{consecutive}} upcountry games. The Victoria Country XI batted first and were out for 110, big David Larter taking 4/31 and Ken Barrington's leg-spin 4/29. Colin Cowdrey was in charge {{and by the end}} of the day he was 95 not out, having seen Barrington out for 90 as the MCC more than doubled the local score with a tally of 225/4. He reached his century (111) the next day and Tom Graveney made 59 not out before he declared on 360/8 after the Country XI used 9 bowlers. The locals had to bat 172 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> draw and did this easily enough even after being 19/2 one F. Watts making 63 and the day ending with the 159/4.|$|E
25|$|Richards {{was born}} in Durban, Natal Province, Union of South Africa and {{attended}} Clifton Preparatory School and the Durban High School and for many years played club cricket for DHS Old Boys' Club. He played in the Natal Nuffield week side from 1961 to 1964, and for South African schools from 1962 to 1964, scoring a century against the Western Province first class team. The national selectors had their eyes on him early, and he played for a South African Colts XI against the touring MCC side in 1964–65, scoring 63, {{and later in the}} tour for an Invitation XI. When the Australians toured in 1966–67, he scored 107 in 160 <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> strong South African XI against them before the First Test, but despite several failures by the top-order batsmen in the Test series, he was unable to break into the national side.|$|E

25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} {{forget to}} touch in or touch out, {{are unable to}} find the yellow readers {{or it may be}} too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
25|$|Under content codes {{issued by}} the Media Development Authority, {{political}} advertising is not permitted on radio or television. Instead the Authority arranges for pre-recorded party political broadcasts {{to be made on}} radio and TV, one on the day after nomination day and the other on the eve of polling day. Only political parties fielding at least six candidates at an election are eligible to make a broadcast; independent candidates may not do so. Party political broadcasts must be delivered by candidates, and each broadcast must consist of a single script {{in each of the four}} official languages of Singapore: Malay, Mandarin, Tamil and English. The duration of the permitted broadcast depends on the number of candidates each party is fielding, and ranges from two and a half <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> party fielding six or seven candidates, to 12 minutes for one fielding between 80 and 87 candidates. The number of candidates fielded also determines the order of broadcasts, with the broadcast of the party fielding the smallest number of candidates on first and that of the party fielding the largest number last.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} round (i.e., round of 64) of the NCAA Tournament, Duke {{defeated}} 16th seeded Robert Morris 85–56. Quinn Cook scored 22 points and Jahlil Okafor added 21. In the third round (i.e., round of 32), Duke beat San Diego State 68–49 behind 26 points by Okafor to reach the Sweet 16 (i.e., the South regional semifinals). Duke next faced off with 5th seeded Utah. A strong defensive performance limited Utah, the top three-point field goal shooting team in the Pac-12, to four-for-16 (25 percent) on three-point field goal attempts and 57 points overall. Okafor struggled against Utah's double teams, but Duke pulled away in the final <b>minutes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 63–57 win. Justise Winslow had a double-double, with 21 points and 10 rebounds for Duke. In the Elite Eight (i.e., the South regional final), Duke had another strong defensive performance, limiting 2nd seeded Gonzaga to two-for-10 (20 percent) on three-point field goal attempts. Point guard Tyus Jones earned six assists while committing 0 turnovers, and repeatedly scored in the lane as Duke pulled away from a 66–52 victory. Okafor, Winslow, Jones combined for 38 points. Jones earned regional Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors, as he averaged 15 points and 4.5 assists.|$|E
