5|$|A cap copying the French Kepi was the {{prescribed}} headgear {{for all three}} branches of the land service, adorned with the various branch of service colors, but Confederates preferred the slouch hat and surviving photographs show that as many or <b>more</b> <b>men</b> wore some type of slouch hat than wore {{the prescribed}} cap, especially as the War progressed.|$|E
5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, {{he might have been}} able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train <b>more</b> <b>men</b> before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.|$|E
5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British. After the British were in the hollow way, the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 <b>more</b> <b>men.</b> All of the troops were stationed {{too far away from}} one another to do much damage.|$|E

5|$|A larger crowd {{attended}} on {{the second}} day, including <b>more</b> <b>men.</b> Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took {{a seat in the}} upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as chair in front of both men and women.|$|E
5|$|After Jon {{discusses}} the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering <b>more</b> <b>men</b> and predicts that Ramsay will defeat them. Jon {{insists that the}} army is the largest one possible. When Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him if he dies in battle, she {{says that it is}} up to the Lord of Light. Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and acknowledge that they may have served the wrong king all along. Davos discovers the pyre where Shireen and the wooden stag he carved for her were burned.|$|E
5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up <b>more</b> <b>men</b> and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E

5|$|Although Blake {{was himself}} {{a member of}} the Spanish Regency, he was junior to Castaños in the {{military}} hierarchy (but senior to Ballasteros). He consequently did not protest when General Castaños agreed that Marshal Beresford, who was also junior to Castaños in rank, should command the combined Allied armies in any battle because there were <b>more</b> <b>men</b> in the Anglo-Portuguese force.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} day dawned, the 9th SS Panzer Division {{continued}} to reinforce the German blocking line. Krafft's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler's line, coming under his command. Spindler's force was now becoming so large as <b>more</b> <b>men</b> and units arrived at the new front, that {{he was forced to}} split it into two battle groups: Kampfgruppes Allworden and Harder. The defensive line now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and had closed the gap exploited by Frost alongside the river the previous evening.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or <b>more</b> <b>men.</b> The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E

The detachment established good relations with the Muslim population of the area, with a number of Muslims from Kozarac joining the Partisans. On 21December at Lisina, Pucar held a meeting with the communists of Kozara. At the meeting, Stojanović presented a short history of the uprising in Kozara. Pucar stated that the 2nd Krajina was the best-organised detachment in Bosanska Krajina.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1471, Edward's army {{landed at}} Ravenspurn. Gathering <b>more</b> <b>men</b> as they went, the Yorkists moved inland towards York. Edward's march was unopposed at the {{beginning}} because he was moving through lands {{that belonged to the}} Percys, and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king for the return of his northern territory. Furthermore, Edward announced that he was returning only to claim his father's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown. The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edward's march, could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV)—later to become known as the Home Guard. Far <b>more</b> <b>men</b> volunteered than the government expected {{and by the end of}} June, there were nearly 1.5million volunteers. There were plenty of personnel for the defence of the country, but there were no uniforms (a simple armband had to suffice) and equipment was in critically short supply. At first, the Home Guard was armed with guns in private ownership, a knife or bayonet on a pole, Molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, 1827, McKenney and Whistler's force {{arrived at}} the Portage. On September 3, two Ho-Chunk leaders, Waukon Decorah and Carymaunee, {{surrendered}} Red Bird and Wekau to the Americans. Carymaunee asked the Americans not to put irons on Red Bird and Wekau; this request was granted. He then offered to give the Americans twenty horses {{in exchange for the}} prisoners, but this was declined. The Ho-Chunks turned in four <b>more</b> <b>men</b> involved in the uprising in the following weeks.|$|E
5|$|Once Heilbronn {{had been}} secured, the 100th Division, and the 824th with it, moved south towards Stuttgart. On 25 April, the 824th was reassigned to the 103rd Division, which was moving eastwards through Bavaria towards Austria; it {{finished}} the war, on VE Day, outside Innsbruck. After {{the end of}} hostilities, six men were awarded the Silver Star, and twenty-two <b>more</b> <b>men</b> were awarded Bronze Stars – one posthumously – bringing the battalion's total to six Silver Stars and thirty-one Bronze Stars.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{a copy of}} the {{withdrawal}} plan was sent across the river for Urquhart's consideration. Despite the obviously frustrating content, Urquhart knew there was little other choice and radioed Thomas at 08:00 to agree to the plan on the condition it went ahead that night. Meanwhile, the Airborne forces would need to endure another day in their perimeter. <b>More</b> <b>men</b> were evacuated from the aid posts throughout the day, but there was no official truce and this was sometimes done under fire.|$|E

5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite of what the Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; <b>more</b> <b>men</b> answered the German conscription call.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing six <b>more</b> <b>men</b> aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, {{using his}} bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E
