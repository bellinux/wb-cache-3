25|$|After being overrun deep in hostile territory, Paige and her Generation Next fleet {{team members}} were {{believed}} to be dead. Paige survived the battle and was enslaved by the inmates of the Seattle Core until Apocalypse's regime fully collapsed. Husk was eventually found by her siblings and was taken to Sinister, who brainwashed her and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> revenge for the X-Men leaving her behind. Husk infiltrated the ranks of the X-Men as a mutant named Xorn and kidnapped Charles Lensherr; she even battled alongside the other Guthries, but was ultimately killed by Wolverine's daughter, Kirika.|$|E
500|$|Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media praised its {{composition}} {{and noted that}} the disco and gospel genres are where middle-aged woman can [...] "thrive", whereby Carey [...] "fits in unsurprisingly well". He was, however, critical {{of the decision to}} include Wale on the song. Similarly, Aisha Harris of Slate Magazine praised the song's production and Carey's vocals too, but also thought that Wale's rap verses were not required. Conversely, fashion designer Donatella Versace, a friend of Carey's, told Vogue that she thought Carey's singing and Wale's rapping complimented each other on the song, describing it as [...] "poetry", and that it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to get up and dance [...] "all summer".|$|E
500|$|Zoe Williams for The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} {{restaurant}} {{a rating of}} nine out of ten, saying that the meat fruit <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to [...] "stand up and cheer", but again said that although everything served was of the highest quality, the meal {{did not have a}} surprise like courses can sometimes have at The Fat Duck. For the same newspaper, Matthew Norman described it as a [...] "theatrical tour de force". He described the restaurant's opening as flawless and described it as the [...] "hottest ticket in town {{for a very long time}} to come" [...] with a rating of ten out of ten.|$|E
30|$|All of the {{participants}} {{who did not want}} to play or decided to quit a sport connected one reason to the uniform style and fit. In most cases (girls n =  9; boys n =  7) it was because the uniform for that sport was too tight. Rebecca explained that her baseball pants were too tight around the waist and this <b>made</b> <b>her</b> not <b>want</b> to play. She did continue to play, but said she mostly felt uncomfortable.|$|R
5000|$|It was his {{emotional}} withdrawal from his father, according to MacLaine, that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> brother <b>want</b> {{to become a}} filmmaker, sometimes writing, producing, directing and starring in his films: [...] "That's why he's more comfortable behind the camera," [...] she says. [...] "He's in the total-control aspect. He has to have control over everything. Beatty doesn't deny that need; in speaking about his earliest parts, he said [...] "When I acted in films I used to come with suggestions about the script, the lighting, the wardrobe, and people used to say 'Waddya want, to produce the picture as well?' And I {{used to say that}} I supposed I did." ...|$|R
50|$|This theme {{continues}} {{throughout the}} book, with Kenneth accepting his difficulties with women. He also introduces his mother, {{a woman who}} allowed her husband to step out, and only left after realizing {{that he did not}} understand what <b>made</b> <b>her</b> happy. She <b>wanted</b> intellectual stimulation of a literary style, whereas he bought her materialistic goods to make up for his infidelities. To atone for receiving the goods she did not need, Kenneth’s mother is now living among refugees in Africa.|$|R
500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which {{proved to be the}} sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|When {{making the}} song, Ochi {{wanted to make}} it the {{signature}} song on Force, as well as creating a work similar to her 2008 single [...] "Ai o Komete Hanataba o", that had been used for her previous tie-up with a TBS drama, Edison no Haha. After creating the song, Ochi felt the song was very representative of how she felt as a person at that moment. The song, as well as much of the Force album, was inspired by someone close to Ochi who <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to expose more of her true self.|$|E
60|$|A little later, {{running up}} to put her hat on, she {{wondered}} why it was that Hilary always <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to comfort him. Stephen never affected her like this.|$|E
60|$|Jem was in camp on Salisbury Plain and {{was writing}} gay, cheery letters home {{in spite of}} the mud. Walter was at Redmond and his letters to Rilla were {{anything}} but cheerful. She never opened one without a dread tugging at her heart that it would tell her he had enlisted. His unhappiness <b>made</b> <b>her</b> unhappy. She <b>wanted</b> to put <b>her</b> arm round him and comfort him, as she had done that day in Rainbow Valley. She hated everybody who was responsible for Walter's unhappiness.|$|R
60|$|My {{mother was}} a great reader, and with ten minutes to spare before the starch was ready would begin the ‘Decline and Fall’—and finish it, too, that winter. Foreign words in the text annoyed <b>her</b> and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> bemoan <b>her</b> <b>want</b> of a {{classical}} education—she had only attended a Dame’s school during some easy months—but she never passed the foreign words by until their meaning was explained to her, and when next she and they met it was as acquaintances, which I think was clever of her. One of her delights was to learn from me scraps of Horace, and then bring them into her conversation with ‘colleged men.’ I have come upon her in lonely places, such as the stair-head or the east room, muttering these quotations aloud to herself, and I well remember how she {{would say to the}} visitors, ‘Ay, ay, it’s very true, Doctor, but as you know, “Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume, labuntur anni,”’ or ‘Sal, Mr. So-and-so, my lassie is thriving well, but would it no’ be more to the point to say, “O matra pulchra filia pulchrior”?’ which astounded them very much if she managed to reach the end without being flung, but usually she had a fit of laughing in the middle, and so they found her out.|$|R
50|$|Five years later, Kang-wook {{finishes}} his sentence, but Yeol-joo is now engaged to Tae-hyun. Still unaware {{that she is}} the real killer, both Kang-wook and Tae-hyun work together to protect her from the truth. Later learning what sacrifice he has <b>made</b> for <b>her,</b> Yeol-joo <b>wants</b> to return to Kang-wook, but this time Kang-wook is not alone—Ja-kyung, his former classmate and currently a radio program host, is beside him. The circumstances hamper Yeol-joo from loving Kang-wook, but she is desperate to help him recover the lost five years and become a top-notch cook.|$|R
60|$|He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered {{over his}} face and looked from his narrowed eyes, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to hide, to hide herself {{away from him and}} watch him from somewhere unseen.|$|E
6000|$|Owen stared. [...] "To Waterbath? She was to {{have spent}} the night in town, don't you know? But when she left me, after our talk, I said to myself that she would take an evening train. I know I <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to get home." ...|$|E
60|$|As she sat so, {{a feeling}} of joy, of {{realization}} of the abounding goodness and sweetness of living, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to thank something--to give praise. She moved her lips in a little prayer of thanks to the sun, as his first glittering rim of light came above the low hills.|$|E
60|$|Guy {{was so much}} {{diverted}} at {{the idea}} of <b>her</b> <b>wanting</b> a lecture on wife-like deportment, that he had no time to be angry at the impertinence, and he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> laugh also by his view that was all force of habit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fourth and}} final stanza talks about the girl’s death. She {{ultimately}} died trying to be as perfect as her Barbie Doll, a cookie cutter woman molded by society. She died trying to reach something that was unattainable, yet encouraged, {{which is where the}} real problem in lies. She was displayed in her casket, all dolled up. Society had finally <b>made</b> <b>her</b> who it <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to be, but at the cost of her life. Now that she was covered in makeup, reconstructed, and nicely dressed, she was considered pretty. The stanza finishes with the line “to every woman a happy ending." [...] This shows that in the end, this was all the girl wanted. She strived and strived to meet society’s unrealistic expectations and when she died trying, she finally did. Being viewed as pretty by society was her goal, and she accomplished it.|$|R
50|$|Mina {{received}} a full academic scholarship to attend Syracuse University. She {{started as a}} Political Science major {{and picked up a}} communications major in the first semester after becoming involved with the college radio station WJPZ-FM Z89.1. Her experience at the station <b>made</b> <b>her</b> decided she <b>wanted</b> to pursue a career in radio. Mina decided to dual major in Television, Radio & Film at the very respected S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and also had a Music Business minor in the College Of Visual & Performing Arts both at Syracuse University. At WJPZ, she started with a Friday night on air shift and eventually got her own daily show 2p-6p. She eventually became the stations Vice President Of Programming overseeing a staff of 150 people.|$|R
60|$|Alvina was wavering. For one thing, mere curiosity <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> {{to see the}} ring. She half {{lifted her}} hand. And but for the {{knowledge}} that he would kiss her, she would have given it. But he would kiss her--and against that she obstinately set her will. She put her hand behind her back, and looked obstinately into his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm {{glad you}} are not going quite yet," [...] whispered Beth, {{embracing}} her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.|$|E
6000|$|Then he clambered {{into the}} boat. Oh, {{and the beauty}} of the {{subjection}} of his loins, white and dimly luminous as he climbed {{over the side of the}} boat, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to die, to die. The beauty of his dim and luminous loins as he climbed into the boat, his back rounded and soft--ah, this was too much for her, too final a vision. She knew it, and it was fatal The terrible hopelessness of fate, and of beauty, such beauty! ...|$|E
5000|$|Ophelia {{was born}} in a Tamil middle-class family in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. <b>Her</b> father <b>wanted</b> to give <b>her</b> a [...] "rare name" [...] and named her after Ophelia, the {{character}} from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Her father is a retired Traffic Manager of Metropolitan Transport Corporation, while her mother works for Bharat Petroleum. She has a younger brother. Ophelia did her schooling at Holy Angels Convent, T. Nagar and graduated in commerce from Stella Maris College. During her college days, the joy of performing on stage for cultural events and plays <b>made</b> <b>her</b> realize she <b>wanted</b> to be in media, and she went on to do her post-graduation in mass communication from M.O.P. Vaishnav College for Women. She has said that even then she was afraid of talking to strangers, and it was her internship at the Indian Express that helped overcome the fear. In 2006, she was one of four radio jockeys selected by the then upcoming 92.7 BIG FM after a two-month audition process of thousands of candidates.|$|R
50|$|Her father, a {{chartered}} accountant, <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> {{to follow}} in his footsteps, but {{she was interested in}} acting. She <b>made</b> <b>her</b> debut with director Hansal Mehta's Hindi film CityLights, alongside Rajkumar Rao.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may have}} a piece of <b>her</b> if you <b>want</b> to, 'cause you haven't got any of your own," [...] said Betty with a pitiful look which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> blue eyes as sweet as two wet violets.|$|R
60|$|Rachel {{knew there}} was {{something}} very sad in his eyes and voice. She longed to kiss him again and comfort him. But suddenly he began to laugh, and then he rummaged out some goodies for her to eat, sweetmeats more delicious than she had ever imagined. While she nibbled them he took down an old violin and played music that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to dance and sing. Rachel was perfectly happy. She wished she might stay forever in that low, dim room with all its treasures.|$|E
60|$|He {{was like}} a faun pleased when she would go with him over his hothouses, {{to look at the}} green and pretty plants, at the pink primulas nodding among their leaves, and cinarrias flaunting purple and crimson and white. She asked about everything, and he told her very exactly and minutely, in a queer pedantic way that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to laugh. Yet she was really {{interested}} in what he did. And he had the curious light in his face, like the light {{in the eyes of the}} goat that was tethered by the farmyard gate.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} for it now, but contemptuous, {{resistant}} indifference. All the world was lapsing into a grey wish-wash of nothingness, she had no contact and no connection anywhere. She despised and detested the whole show. From {{the bottom of her}} heart, from the bottom of her soul, she despised and detested people, adult people. She loved only children and animals: children she loved passionately, but coldly. They <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to hug them, to protect them, to give them life. But this very love, based on pity and despair, was only a bondage and a pain to her. She loved best of all the animals, that were single and unsocial as she herself was. She loved the horses and cows in the field. Each was single and to itself, magical. It was not referred away to some detestable social principle. It was incapable of soulfulness and tragedy, which she detested so profoundly.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{her first}} appearance, Moon commented that Mo would have [...] "a big secret" [...] that would keep viewers guessing. When she arrived at Holby, Mo was heavily pregnant. Tara Lo (Jing Lusi) {{initially}} assumed that Jonny was the baby's father, but Mo assured {{her that he was}} not. She refused to reveal the true identity of the father and Akudolu said it was a secret. Akudolu also commented that the pregnancy would not slow Mo down. The actress told Moon that she loved wearing the prosthetic baby bump on set and that it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel broody. <b>Wanting</b> to work until she was ready to give birth, Mo went into premature labour during a shift at the hospital. Initially, Mo thought she was suffering Braxton Hicks contractions, but {{it soon became clear that}} the labour was real. Akudolu explained [...] "With Mo if she could, she would have the baby, then go back to work the next day. It's her first child and she knows nothing about childbirth, but she thinks she can just give birth and everything's going to be fine and she'll be back to normal." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{hated her}} bitterly {{at that moment}} because he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> suffer. Love her! She knew he loved her. He really belonged to her. This about not loving her, physically, bodily, was a mere perversity on his part, because he knew she loved him. He was stupid like a child. He belonged to <b>her.</b> His soul <b>wanted</b> <b>her.</b> She guessed {{somebody}} had been influencing him. She felt upon him the hardness, the foreignness of another influence.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> sister <b>wanted</b> {{to tear up}} {{her letter}} {{as a piece of}} affectation, but this she would not allow. It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel despairing to think of {{spending}} two hours more over it, and she hoped that she would be satisfied with the argument that the familiar style employed by Mrs. Martindale towards an old friend might not be suited to Annette Moss when rejecting his suit.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the fall}} of night we the Domremy {{contingent}} of the personal staff were with the father and uncle at the inn, in their private parlor, brewing generous drinks and breaking ground for a homely talk about Domremy and the neighbors, when a large parcel arrived from Joan to be kept till she came; and soon she came herself and sent her guard away, saying she would take one of her father's rooms and sleep under his roof, and so be at home again. We of the staff rose and stood, as was meet, until she made us sit. Then she turned {{and saw that the}} two old men had gotten up too, and were standing in an embarrassed and unmilitary way; which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to laugh, but she kept it in, as not wishing to hurt them; and got them to their seats and snuggled down between them, and took a hand of each of them upon her knees and nestled her own hands in them, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Tina {{had kept}} her room all that day, and had been {{carefully}} tended as an invalid, Sir Christopher having told her ladyship how matters stood. This tendance was so irksome to Caterina, she felt so uneasy under attentions and kindness that {{were based on a}} misconception, that she exerted herself to appear at breakfast the next morning, and declared herself well, though head and heart were throbbing. To be confined in her own room was intolerable; it was wretched enough to be looked at and spoken to, but it was more wretched to be left alone. She was frightened at her own sensations: she was frightened at the imperious vividness with which pictures of the past and future thrust themselves on her imagination. And there was another feeling, too, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to be down-stairs and moving about. Perhaps she might have an opportunity of speaking to Captain Wybrow alone--of speaking those words of hatred and scorn that burned on her tongue. That opportunity offered itself in a very unexpected manner.|$|E
6000|$|Most {{often of}} {{all it was}} a thought that was not foolish and unreal like the rest. It was {{the thought that the}} Last Judgment might be about to begin. But Kate did not use that thought as {{it was meant to be}} used when we are bidden to [...] "watch." [...] If she had done so, she would have striven every morning to [...] "live this day as if the last." [...] But she never thought of it in the morning, nor made it a guide to her actions; or else she would have dreaded it less. And at night it did not make her {{particular}} about obedience. It only <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>want</b> to keep Josephine; as if Josephine and a candle could protect her from that Day and Hour! And if the moment had come, would she not have been safer trying to endure hardness for the sake of obedience--with the holy verses Mr. Wardour had taught her on her lips, alone with her God and her good angel--than trying to forget all in idle chatter with her maid, and contrary to known commands, detaining her by foolish excuses? ...|$|E
