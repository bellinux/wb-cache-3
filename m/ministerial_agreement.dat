40|$|Romania {{is one of}} the signatories of the Bologna Process Declaration in 1999. Following this decision, Romania made {{efforts for}} the {{alignment}} of its higher education system to the objectives and the policies promoted by the Bologna Process. In this process different action lines have received different attention, as the understanding of the policy problems and the national priorities were not always in line with the EHEA <b>ministerial</b> <b>agreements.</b> The current article looks at the main commitments Romania has made within the Bologna Process by analysing the overall national implementation, the associated funding policies and institutional practices. The article focuses on three Bologna Process action lines: social dimension, quality assurance and internationalization of higher education, due to their complexity (beyond legal changes), impact at the grassroots level and their various understandings by the stakeholder community. The article ends with a short overview of the policy lessons that can be drawn regarding Bologna Process and its national translation for other countries which found themselves in policy transitions in the past two decades...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the dynamic model for the {{calculation}} of cost effective nutrient abatement for a marine sea with heterogeneous coupled marine basins which differ with respect to fast and slow responses to changes in external nutrient loads. A discrete dynamic model with heterogeneous sites – drainage and marine basins – is developed. The application to the Baltic Sea for achievement of the <b>ministerial</b> <b>agreement</b> among the riparian countries on water quality targets (Helsinki Commission Baltic Sea Action Plan) shows expected results; abatement is increasing over time and Poland faces the largest cost burdens. A specific finding is that, in spite of the complex and interlinked nutrient transports, policy design is facilitated by the stringent phosphorus load target on one specific marine basin, Baltic Proper, which is characterised by a relatively slow dynamic process and large interchange with other basins. The achievement of the phosphorus target in this basin then implies fulfilment of nutrient targets in the other basins. It is also shown that total costs under the dynamic cost effective solution can be considerably lower than the nutrient reduction program suggested by the international <b>ministerial</b> <b>agreement,</b> Helcom BSAP...|$|E
40|$|Large {{nitrogen}} loads to the Baltic Sea play {{an important}} role for currentdamages caused by eutrophication: large sea bottom areas without anybiological life, low stocks of cods, and toxic blue green algae. In spite of therelatively large supply of biological and physical data on the sea,difficulties remain with respect to linking costs of nitrogen reductions withthe dispersion of associated benefits among countries. The purpose of thisstudy is therefore to analyse and calculate efficient nitrogen reductionsand associated net benefits under international co-ordination of nitrogenreductions and single country actions for two different specifications ofmarginal benefits: uniform and differentiated. Further, comparisons aremade with the current <b>ministerial</b> <b>agreement</b> of 50 per cent nitrogenreduction to the Baltic Sea. The empirical results show that total netbenefits under internationally co-ordinated actions are considerablyhigher than when countries act on their own. Another result is thatdifferentiated benefits give higher total net benefits than uniform, and alsoimply larger differences in net benefits among countries. However, resultsindicate that uniform marginal benefits generate net benefits for allcountries from co-ordinated actions as compared to single country actions.

40|$|The transboundary River Nestos in the Balkan Peninsula is {{a surface}} water {{resource}} shared by Hellas and Bulgaria. The Public Power Corporation of Hellas (DEH) proceeded to the dams' construction of Thesaurus in 1997 and Platanovrissi in 2000, {{to satisfy the}} increased needs for power production and irrigation in the Regions of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in the Hellenic Territory. DEH following the <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Agreement</b> of the Hellenic Parliament "KYA 18492 / 19 - 09 - 1996 '' funded a series of Research Projects concerned on the monitoring of the water quantity and quality data of Nestos from the Hellenic-Bulgarian borders to its estuaries in the Thracian sea. "PERSEAS'' Research Group from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, carried out the research, design, construction, installation, operation and maintenance of the "R. E. MO. S. '' (Remote Environmental MOnitoring System) networks. Three REMOS networks have been installed {{in the areas of}} (a) the River Nestos deltaic channel, (b) Thesaurus dam-lake in the intramountainous valley and (c) Potamoi (Despat) and Pagoneri (Nestos) villages close to the borders between Hellas and Bulgaria. They record water level (H), water and air temperature (T), water conductivity (ECw), Redox potential (RP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on a 24 h basis, {{since the beginning of the}} year 2000. The research carried out in this paper, is focused on the REMOS station in the final course of Nestos in the deltaic area. The continuous monitoring and the data analysis yield useful results for the quality and quantity of the hydrologic regime of Nestos after the dams' construction, as well as for the trends detected of the quality parameters (ECw, RP and DO) and the water level, using the nonparametric Spearman's criterion. The best fitted model of time trend, for each variable, was chosen. The statistical sample of each one of the quality variables consisted of about 1000 values based on daily measures on a three years monitoring program (1 / 1 / 2000 - 31 / 12 / 2002). Further research and analysis for the other network stations of REMOS should provide useful results for the sustainable management of the transboundary River Nestos...|$|E
40|$|FTAA {{negotiations}} {{have reached}} a decisive stage, as the deadline to conclude negotiations {{is less than a}} year away. After nine years of debate, the moment is approaching to make decisions that could finally bring to a reality the agreement that emerged from the 1994 Summit of the Americas. The November 2003 ministerial meeting in Miami met the objective of providing the FTAA process with new momentum in the difficult wake of the Cancún failure. Ministers of the continent made the negotiating rules more flexible, and opened the possibility that different countries could assume different levels of obligations in the FTAA. This resulted in the removal of one of the major ¿straitjackets¿ of the hemispheric negotiations. However, the Miami instructions do not contemplate a critical path to implement the ministerial mandate and to ensure that the initiative can be concluded, if possible, in the agreed date. The great challenge of the moment is, precisely, to translate the Miami agreement into a concrete instruction for the nine FTAA negotiating tables. In order to contribute to such an important effort this paper intends to answer the following question: Is there a formula, some principle or group of principles which could facilitate the implementation of the Miami 2003 <b>Ministerial</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

Key elements of the Co-operation Agreement include regular discussion, learning and expertise exchange between the countries, and a Scottish Government (SG) financed International Development Fund, which supports discrete projects within Malawi. Under the auspices of the Co-operation <b>Agreement,</b> <b>Ministerial</b> discussion during the UN Climate Change Summit in Cancun in December 2010 highlighted the Government of Malawi’s target of increasing electricity access in Malawi from 8 % to 15 % of the population by 2015. It was agreed that the SG would consider how best it could contribute to this ambition through the Co-operation Agreement’s existing mechanisms. Against this background, the following scoping study was commissioned by the SG. The study commences with an overview of the broad energy and electricity sectors in Malawi, but its specific purpose is to understand how off-grid, community-level renewable energy technology can contribute towards meeting Malawi’s energy needs. To an extent, the scoping study also has its roots in one of the first projects to be supported through the SG’s International Development Fund. The University of Strathclyde-led Community Rural Electrification and Development (CRED) project aimed to improve the sustainability of rural solar panel deployments in Malawi by focussing on community engagement and empowerment, local responsibility and income generation. Learning captured through the project indicated that, aside from the obvious energy provision, community-level generation had the potential to bring considerable socio-economic benefits to rurally isolated Malawians. Given this grounding and experience, the SG invited the University of Strathclyde to lead this scoping study...|$|R
