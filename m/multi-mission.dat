40|$|This article determines {{sea level}} fields with {{nonlinear}} components {{along the northern}} coast of Australia using a state-of-the-art approach of the Multi-Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). The 20 years of data from <b>multi-missions</b> of satellite altimetry (e. g., Topex, Jason- 1, Jason- 2) and 14 tide gauges are combined to provide a consistent view of sea levels. The MARS is chosen because {{it is capable of}} dividing measured sea levels into distinct time intervals where different linear relationships can be identified, and of weighting individual tide gauge according to the importance of their contributions to predicted sea levels. In the study area, the mean R-squared (R 2) of 0. 62 and Root Mean Squared (RMS) error of 6. 73 cm are obtained from modelling sea levels by MARS. The comparison of the MARS with the multiple-regression shows an improved sea level prediction, as MARS can explain 62 % of sea level variance while multiple-regression only accounts for 44 % of variance. The predicted sea levels during six tropical cyclones are validated against sea level observations at three independent tide-gauge sites. The comparison results show a strong correlation (˜ 99 %) between modelled and observed sea levels, suggesting that the MARS can be used for efficiently monitoring sea level extremes...|$|R

40|$|Proper {{orthogonal}} decomposition (POD) is {{the mathematical}} {{basis of a}} method of constructing low-order mathematical models for the "gray-box" fault-detection algorithm that is a component of a diagnostic system known as beacon-based exception analysis for <b>multi-missions</b> (BEAM). POD has been successfully applied in reducing computational complexity by generating simple models {{that can be used}} for control and simulation for complex systems such as fluid flows. In the present application to BEAM, POD brings the same benefits to automated diagnosis. BEAM is a method of real-time or offline, automated diagnosis of a complex dynamic system. The gray-box approach makes it possible to utilize incomplete or approximate knowledge of the dynamics of the system that one seeks to diagnose. In the gray-box approach, a deterministic model of the system is used to filter a time series of system sensor data to remove the deterministic components of the time series from further examination. What is left after the filtering operation is a time series of residual quantities that represent the unknown (or at least unmodeled) aspects of the behavior of the system. Stochastic modeling techniques are then applied to the residual time series. The procedure for detecting abnormal behavior of the system then becomes one of looking for statistical differences between the residual time series and the predictions of the stochastic model...|$|R
40|$|The human {{planetary}} exploration goal {{asks for}} both a strong technology development {{and a great}} scientific knowledge enhancement {{that can be achieved}} only through a rational and well tuned sequence of different highly related missions, from demonstrators up to scientific probes, in the framework of a limited resources scenario. Therefore the programmatic division has to face the hard task of producing a long term planning deeply connected with the technical design of each unit belonging to a <b>multi-missions</b> scenario. The paper suggests a possible tool to solve the long term space missions planning problem by working on the single mission preliminary sizing, while taking into account the complex constraint net, both in the design and temporal domains. Thanks to the proposed multi-objective optimisation the engineers are given a pruned and ranked solution space, to work on to refine the programmatic. The Evolutionary Algorithms have been selected to deal with mixed domains and get the globally optimal solution set on the time and in design alternatives search space. Appropriate preliminary models are proposed to deal with the criteria vector elements here assumed to be the most relevant for the problem. The architecture has been tested on the NASA Apollo program scenario. The obtained results are consistent with the real program and possible discrepancies helped better tuning the tool. Simulations for ongoing exploration scenarios, such as the ESA Aurora, are offered to highlight the benefits of the tool in identifying a set of optimal, preliminary plans.

40|$|Researchers at JPL have {{completed}} a software prototype of BEAM (Beacon-based Exception Analysis for <b>Multi-missions)</b> and successfully tested its operation in flight onboard a NASA research aircraft. BEAM (see NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 9; and Vol. 27, No. 3) is an ISHM (Integrated Systems Health Management) technology that automatically analyzes sensor data and classifies system behavior as either nominal or anomalous, and further characterizes anomalies according to strength, duration, and affected signals. BEAM (see figure) {{can be used}} to monitor a wide variety of physical systems and sensor types in real time. In this series of tests, BEAM monitored the engines of a Dryden Flight Research Center F- 18 aircraft, and performed onboard, unattended analysis of 26 engine sensors from engine startup to shutdown. The BEAM algorithm can detect anomalies based solely on the sensor data, which includes but is not limited to sensor failure, performance degradation, incorrect operation such as unplanned engine shutdown or flameout in this example, and major system faults. BEAM was tested on an F- 18 simulator, static engine tests, and 25 individual flights totaling approximately 60 hours of flight time. During these tests, BEAM successfully identified planned anomalies (in-flight shutdowns of one engine) as well as minor unplanned anomalies (e. g., transient oil- and fuel-pressure drops), with no false alarms or suspected false-negative results for the period tested. BEAM also detected previously unknown behavior in the F- 18 compressor section during several flights. This result, confirmed by direct analysis of the raw data, serves as a significant test of BEAM's capability...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} the performances of satellite altimeter missions by comparing the altimeter sea surface heights with in situ dynamic heights derived from vertical temperature and salinity profiles measured by Argo floats. The two objectives of this approach are the detection of altimeter drift and the estimation of the impact of new altimeter standards that requires an independent reference. This external assessment method contributes to altimeter calibration–validation analyses that cover a wide range of activities. Among them, several examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of this approach, separating the analyses of the long-term evolution of the mean sea level and its variability, at global and regional scales and results obtained via relative and absolute comparisons. The latter requires the use of the ocean mass contribution to the sea level derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) measurements. Our analyses cover the estimation of the global mean sea level trend, the validation of <b>multi-missions</b> altimeter products as well as the assessment of orbit solutions. Even if this approach contributes to the altimeter quality assessment, the differences between two versions of altimeter standards are getting smaller and smaller and it is thus more difficult to detect their impact. It is therefore essential to characterize the errors of the method, which is illustrated with the results of sensitivity analyses to different parameters. This includes the format of the altimeter data, the method of collocation, the temporal reference period and the processing of the ocean mass solutions from GRACE. We also assess the impact of the temporal and spatial sampling of Argo floats, the choice of the reference depth of the in situ profiles and the importance of the deep steric contribution. These analyses provide an estimation of the robustness of the method and the characterization of associated errors. The results also allow us to draw some recommendations to the Argo community regarding the maintenance of the in situ network...|$|R
40|$|Observing system {{experiments}} (OSEs) {{are carried}} out over a 1 -year period to quantify the impact of Argo observations on the Mercator Ocean 0. 25 ° global ocean analysis and forecasting system. The reference simulation assimilates sea surface temperature (SST), SSALTO/DUACS (Segment Sol <b>multi-missions</b> dALTimetrie, d'orbitographie et de localisation précise/Data unification and Altimeter combination system) altimeter data and Argo and other in situ observations from the Coriolis data center. Two other simulations {{are carried out}} where all Argo {{and half of the}} Argo data are withheld. Assimilating Argo observations has a significant impact on analyzed and forecast temperature and salinity fields at different depths. Without Argo data assimilation, large errors occur in analyzed fields as estimated from the differences when compared with in situ observations. For example, in the 0 – 300 m layer RMS (root mean square) differences between analyzed fields and observations reach 0. 25 psu and 1. 25 °C in the western boundary currents and 0. 1 psu and 0. 75 °C in the open ocean. The impact of the Argo data in reducing observation–model forecast differences is also significant from the surface down to a depth of 2000 m. Differences between in situ observations and forecast fields are thus reduced by 20 % in the upper layers and by up to 40 % at a depth of 2000 m when Argo data are assimilated. At depth, the most impacted regions in the global ocean are the Mediterranean outflow, the Gulf Stream region and the Labrador Sea. A significant degradation can be observed when only half of the data are assimilated. Therefore, Argo observations matter to constrain the model solution, even for an eddy-permitting model configuration. The impact of the Argo floats' data assimilation on other model variables is briefly assessed: the improvement of the fit to Argo profiles do not lead globally to unphysical corrections on the sea surface temperature and sea surface height. The main conclusion is that the performance of the Mercator Ocean 0. 25 ° global data assimilation system is heavily dependent on the availability of Argo data...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} conceived {{method of}} automated {{diagnosis of a}} complex electromechanical system affords {{a complete set of}} capabilities for hybrid diagnosis in the case in which the state of the electromechanical system is characterized by both continuous and discrete values (as represented by analog and digital signals, respectively). The method is an integration of two complementary diagnostic systems: (1) beacon-based exception analysis for <b>multi-missions</b> (BEAM), which is primarily useful in the continuous domain and easily performs diagnoses in the presence of transients; and (2) Livingstone, which is primarily useful in the discrete domain and is typically restricted to quasi-steady conditions. BEAM has been described in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles: "Software for Autonomous Diagnosis of Complex Systems" (NPO- 20803), Vol. 26, No. 3 (March 2002), page 33; "Beacon-Based Exception Analysis for Multimissions" (NPO- 20827), Vol. 26, No. 9 (September 2002), page 32; "Wavelet-Based Real-Time Diagnosis of Complex Systems" (NPO- 20830), Vol. 27, No. 1 (January 2003), page 67; and "Integrated Formulation of Beacon-Based Exception Analysis for Multimissions" (NPO- 21126), Vol. 27, No. 3 (March 2003), page 74. Briefly, BEAM is a complete data-analysis method, implemented in software, for real-time or off-line detection and characterization of faults. The basic premise of BEAM is to characterize a system from all available observations and train the characterization with respect to normal phases of operation. The observations are primarily continuous in nature. BEAM isolates anomalies by analyzing the deviations from nominal for each phase of operation. Livingstone is a model-based reasoner that uses a model of a system, controller commands, and sensor observations to track the system s state, and detect and diagnose faults. Livingstone models a system within the discrete domain. Therefore, continuous sensor readings, as well as time, must be discretized. To reason about continuous systems, Livingstone uses monitors that discretize the sensor readings using trending and thresholding techniques. In development of the a hybrid method, BEAM results were sent to Livingstone to serve as an independent source of evidence that is in addition to the evidence gathered by Livingstone standard monitors. The figure depicts the flow of data in an early version of a hybrid system dedicated to diagnosing a simulated electromechanical system. In effect, BEAM served as a "smart" monitor for Livingstone. BEAM read the simulation data, processed the data to form observations, and stored the observations in a file. A monitor stub synchronized the events recorded by BEAM with the output of the Livingstone standard monitors according to time tags. This information was fed to a real-time interface, which buffered and fed the information to Livingstone, and requested diagnoses at the appropriate times. In a test, the hybrid system was found to correctly identify a failed component in an electromechanical system for which neither BEAM nor Livingstone alone yielded the correct diagnosis...|$|R
