2500|$|Mr. Armstrong-Toro {{was one of}} Ponce's most {{distinguished}} citizens as well. He {{was one of the}} first bankers in Puerto Rico, founder of the Banco de Ponce and the Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño. Mr. Armstrong-Toro developed an international banking network with offices in Puerto Rico, Cuba, the United States, and Denmark. As a result of his extensive financial relations with the Danish government, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> was conferred the high honor of the [...] "Danabru Order" [...] of Denmark and was named Danish Consul to Puerto Rico.|$|E
2500|$|Allegations in {{the book}} were reprinted in The Sunday Times (UK) by deputy sports editor Alan English in June 2004. Armstrong sued for libel, and the paper {{settled out of court}} after a High Court judge in a pre-trial ruling stated that the article [...] "meant {{accusation}} of guilt and not simply reasonable grounds to suspect." [...] The newspaper's lawyers issued the statement: [...] "The Sunday Times has confirmed to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance-enhancing drugs and sincerely apologized for any such impression." [...] The same authors (Pierre Ballester and David Walsh) subsequently published L.A. Official and Le Sale Tour (The Dirty Trick), further pressing their claims that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 {{he wrote}} the New York Times front-page article about man's first walk on the moon. His was the only byline on the front page, beneath the {{headline}} [...] "Men Walk On Moon" [...] and under the subheading [...] "A Powdery Surface is Closely Explored." [...] Upon the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Wilford's article was lauded by journalist Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics, who emphasized Wilford's skillful use of data. For example, Wilford wrote, [...] "Although <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> {{is known as a}} man of few words, his heartbeats told of his excitement upon leading man's first landing on the moon. At the time of the descent rocket ignition, his heartbeat rate registered 110 a minute—77 is normal for him—and it shot up to 156 at touchdown." [...] Dubner argues {{that this is one of}} the most elegant uses of data to have been ever used in journalism. Forty-three years after the moon landing, it was Wilford's byline on the Times' front-page obituary of Neil Armstrong - and a few years later, on the Times' December 2016 obituary of John Glenn.|$|E
50|$|It {{would seem}} {{that there had been}} at least {{problems}} in the marriage. Though authors who have studied the case have assumed that the Armstrong's marriage was a failure due to the domineering attitude of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> to her husband, the precise nature of the Armstrongs' relationship is far from clear. It was generally held that <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> was a singularly unpleasant woman who regularly abused and humiliated her husband in public, and it was not unnoticed that, though the local newspaper described <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> as a 'popular Hay lady,' few people attended her funeral. On the other hand, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> whenever separated from her husband due either to her stays in hospitals or to his service in the War, is reported to have expressed her desire for the family to be reunited at the earliest opportunity.|$|R

50|$|In May 1919, Kitty Armstrong's health {{first began}} to weaken, with certain {{symptoms}} which the local physician, Dr Thomas Hincks, diagnosed as a case of brachial neuritis. From this she appeared to recover, and {{did not need to}} consult Dr Hincks for over a year. But in August 1920, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong's</b> health, both physical and mental, deteriorated again. Armstrong kept in close contact with Dr Hincks, and showed great concern for his wife, consulting relatives and friends as well. Hincks found that <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> was showing signs of mental collapse and {{came to the conclusion that}} it was connected to her illness. At the end of August, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> was admitted to Barnwood, a private mental asylum near Gloucester. On admission she had pyrexia, vomiting, heart murmurs, and albumen in the urine. There was also partial paralysis in the hands and feet and loss of muscle tone. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> was also delusional.|$|R
60|$|The two {{following}} {{letters for}} Lord Ballindine were sent off, in the Grey Abbey post-bag, {{on the evening}} of the day on which <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong</b> had arrived there. They were from <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong</b> and Lord Cashel. That from the former was first opened.|$|E
60|$|This letter {{naturally}} increased Lord Ballindine's uneasiness, and {{he wrote}} a note to <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> informing {{him that he would}} not trouble him to go at all, unless he could start the next day. Indeed, that he should then go himself, if <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong</b> did not do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "D----n!" [...] exclaimed Barry, sitting {{bolt upright}} in his bed. [...] "Who says I object to see anybody? <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> {{what do you}} go and say that for?" [...] <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong</b> {{returned}} into the room. [...] "It's not true. I only want to have my bed-room to myself, while I get up." ...|$|E

60|$|After Captain Clayton had gone, Mr. Jones {{asked after}} Edith, {{and was told}} that she was away in Headford. She had walked into town to call on <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> with a view of getting a few {{articles}} which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> had promised to buy for her. Such was the story as given to Mr. Jones, and fully believed by him; but the reader may be permitted to think that the young lady was not anxious to meet the young gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My aunt, of course! How could I forget! <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> {{spoke of}} her being ill. Was it another stroke!' said Theodora, alarmed as her {{recollection}} returned, and Violet was obliged to tell the whole.|$|R
6000|$|It was all {{the same}} to <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> and the two {{therefore}} started for Tuam together. They had not, however, got above half way down the avenue, when they saw another gig coming towards them; and, after sundry speculations as to whom it might contain, <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong</b> pronounced the driver to be [...] "that dirty gallipot, Colligan." ...|$|E

6000|$|Fanny strove hard to {{keep her}} composure, and to make some fitting reply to <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> but she was unable. Her heart was too full; she was too happy.

But she could not bring herself to confess it to <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong.</b> At last she said: ...|$|E
50|$|Jean Armstrong, {{who was the}} {{principal}} when the doors opened in 1999 is still {{the principal}} of the Grammar School. She spent several years teaching fourth and fifth grade at NCCS but eventually returned to the primary position of principal. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> graduated from UMBC with a bachelor's degree in Elementary Education and Psychology. She also has a Master's Equivalency with a background in Applied Behavioral Science and Administration and Supervision. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> went on to spend 11 years teaching in Baltimore City Schools. During her time teaching in the city she earned her Advanced Professional Certificate from the Maryland State Department of Education.|$|R
50|$|Rebecca Jarrett met an old associate, a procuress called Nancy Broughton. Through her Jarrett {{learned of}} a 13-year-old named Eliza Armstrong, whose {{alcoholic}} mother Elizabeth was {{in need of}} money. She arranged for Jarrett to meet <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> who lived in the Lisson Grove area of West London, and although Rebecca told the mother the girl was to serve as a maid to an old gentleman, she believed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> understood that she was selling her daughter into prostitution. The mother agreed to sell her daughter for a total of £5 — equivalent to approximately £574 in 2014. On 3 June, the bargain was made.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} {{let them have}} a little black currant jelly, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> would be so thankful. She has so much to think of, and is so weak herself, poor thing, she hasn't time to make those things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait till I tell you. No; {{the people}} are mad because O'Connell and his myrmidons are to be locked up; and, mingled with their fury on this head are their insane rejoicings at the escape of this priest. They are, therefore,--or were, till Saturday last, howling for joy and for grief at the same time. Oh! such horrid howls, <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong.</b> I declare, <b>Mr</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> I have trembled for my {{children}} this week past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} you, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong,</b> {{about your}} daughter. What has Miss Mary {{to do with}} forgiving? How has she been injured?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> turned. [...] "What {{on earth}} brings you here, Mary? Run away, child. This is a dreadful business, {{and it will}} be {{haunting}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{was crying}} now, {{but they were}} not tears of unhappiness. They talked for some time longer, sitting hand in hand; and then, as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong's</b> step was heard coming up to the cottage, Ruth seized her hat and shawl.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong's</b> {{condition}} {{began to}} improve at Barnwood, {{and she was}} discharged home on 22 January 1921. Shortly after her return home her condition mysteriously deteriorated again and she died exactly a month after her return on 22 February 1921. Dr Hincks was puzzled by <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong's</b> symptoms, but nevertheless stated on the death certificate that she had died of gastritis, aggravated by heart disease and nephritis. Outwardly, Armstrong had shown nothing but forbearing concern for his wife, sitting at her bedside reading {{to her in the}} evenings, and leaving the office early whenever possible to be with her. If Armstrong did kill his wife, but for a later act of folly he might well have escaped detection.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of April 3, 2014, <b>Mrs</b> Christine <b>Armstrong,</b> a {{dedicated}} member of the Tathra Surf Life Saving Club was taken by a shark believed to be approx. 4m long. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Armstrong</b> was swimming between Tathra Wharf and the Tathra Beach {{with a group of}} friends and her husband Rob. The shark was never located. This attack {{is believed to be the}} first attack in around 100 years and is extremely odd as Tathra rarely sees Sharks close to the Bay.|$|R
60|$|His {{appearance}} {{was greeted with}} a hearty cheer, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> and three or four others ran in {{through the door of}} an inner room.|$|E
60|$|One of the {{hospital}} orderlies {{was standing by the}} bedside of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> as his daughter and the surgeon entered. The patient was talking loudly.|$|E

50|$|The tunnels {{were named}} in honor of Joseph G. Armstrong, County Director of Public Works.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you think}} that?" [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Armstrong</b> said, quickly. [...] "You {{think he knows}} a great deal better {{what ought to be}} done than I do?" ...|$|E

50|$|As of the mid-1950s, he was {{caring for}} his mother, {{who was living}} {{with him at the}} time.
