2500|$|The Koenigsegg CCX is a {{mid-engined}} {{sports car}} built by Koenigsegg Automotive AB. [...] The project {{began with the}} aim of making a global car, designed and engineered to comply with global safety and environment regulations, [...] particularly to enter the United States car market. To sell cars in the US many alterations were made to the design of the CCR; the previously used Ford <b>Modular</b> <b>engine</b> was replaced by a Koenigsegg engine designed to run on 91octane fuel, readily available in the United States, and to meet the Californian emission standards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981 Alfa Romeo {{developed}} {{in collaboration with}} the University of Genoa a semi-experimental Alfetta version, fitted with a modular variable displacement engine and an electronic engine control unit. Called Alfetta CEM (Controllo Elettronico del Motore, or Electronic Engine Management), it was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The [...] 2.0-litre <b>modular</b> <b>engine</b> featured fuel injection and ignition systems governed by an engine control unit, which could shut off two of four cylinders as needed in order to reduce fuel consumption. An initial batch of ten examples were assigned to taxi drivers in Milan, to verify operation and performance in real-world situations. According to Alfa Romeo during these tests cylinder deactivation was found to reduce fuel consumption by 12% in comparison to a CEM fuel-injected engine without variable displacement, and almost by 25% in comparison to the regular production carburetted 2.0-litre. After the first trial, in 1983 a small series of 1000 examples was put on sale, offered to selected clients; 991 examples were produced. Despite this second experimental phase, the project had no further developments.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a Figure-of-Merit (FoM) is {{developed}} to assess specific mission designs. The variables for a mission plan are so numerous and interdependent that a single parameter cannot accurately represent the overall design performance. The introduction of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) {{and the use of}} advanced <b>modular</b> <b>engines</b> further complicate the problem. For these reasons, the FoM approach has been proposed to provide a more comprehensive look at the overall picture. The analysis encompasses the important design parameters in addition to the less tangible aspects such as long-term effects, reliability and reparability of the hardware, and the risks that are inevitably associated with new technologies. FoM's have been examined in detail for historical missions and for a proposed Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. Results are presented for a conventional MSR mission along with missions incorporating ISRU and <b>modular</b> <b>engines</b> for comparison. It is concluded that this quantitative FoM approach may well become a key tool in the analysis and design of future space missions...|$|R

25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for pre-flight checks.

If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there is plenty of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|R
