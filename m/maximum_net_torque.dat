40|$|The {{evolution}} of the spin rate of comet 9 P/Tempel 1 through two perihelion passages (CYs 2000 and 2005) is determined from 1922 Earth-based observations taken {{over a period of}} 13 y as part of a World-Wide observing campaign and 2888 observations taken over a period of 50 d from the Deep Impact spacecraft. We determine the following sidereal spin rates (periods) : 209. 023 +/- 0. 025 degrees /day (41. 335 +/- 0. 005 h) prior to the 2000 perihelion passage, 210. 448 +/- 0. 016 degrees/day (41. 055 +/- 0. 003 h) for the interval between the 2000 and 2005 perihelion passages, 211. 856 +/- 0. 030 degrees/day (40. 783 +/- 0. 006 h) from Deep Impact photometry just prior to the 2005 perihelion passage, and 211. 625 +/- 0. 012 degrees /day (40. 827 +/- 0. 002 h) in the interval 2006 - 2010 following the 2005 perihelion passage. The period decreased by 16. 8 +/- 0. 3 min during the 2000 passage and by 13. 7 +/- 0. 2 min during the 2005 passage suggesting a secular decrease in the net torque. The change in spin rate is asymmetric with respect to perihelion with the <b>maximum</b> <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> being applied on approach to perihelion. The Deep Impact data alone show that the spin rate was increasing at a rate of 0. 024 +/- 0. 003 degree/d/d at JD 2453530. 60510 (i. e., 25. 134 d before impact) and provides independent confirmation of the change seen in the Earth-based observations. The rotational phase of the nucleus at times before and after each perihelion and at the Deep Impact encounter is estimated based on the Thomas et al. pole and longitude system. The possibility of a 180 degree error in the rotational phase is assessed and found to be significant. Analytical and physical modeling of the behavior of the spin rate through of each perihelion is presented and used as a basis to predict the rotational state of the nucleus {{at the time of the}} nominal (i. e., prior to February 2010) Stardust-NExT encounter on 2011 February 14 20 : 42. We find that a net torque in the range of 0. 3 - 2. 5 x 10 (exp 7) kg. square m 2 /square s acts on the nucleus during perihelion passage. The spin rate initially slows down on approach to perihelion and then passes through a minimum. It then accelerates rapidly as it passes through perihelion eventually reaching a maximum post-perihelion. It then decreases to a stable value as the nucleus moves away from the sun. We find that the pole direction is unlikely to precess by more than approximately 1 degree/perihelion passage. The trend of the period with time and the fact that the modeled peak torque that occurs before perihelion is in agreement with published accounts of trends in water production rate and suggests that widespread H 2 O out-gassing from the surface is largely responsible for the observed spin-up...|$|E

40|$|Two methods, both {{based on}} the concept of {{combustion}} <b>net</b> <b>torque,</b> for estimation of combustion properties using measurements of crankshaft torque data are investigated in this work. The first of the proposed methods estimates entire burned mass fraction traces from corresponding combustion <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> traces. This is done by solving a convex optimization problem that is based on a derived analytical relation between the two quantities. The other proposed estimation method estimates the well established combustion phasing measure referred to as 50 % burned mass fraction directly from combustion <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> using a nonlinear black-box mapping. The methods are assessed using both simulations and experimental data gathered from a 5 -cylinder light-duty diesel engine equipped with a crankshaft torque sensor and cylinder pressure sensors that are used for reference measurements. The results indicate that both methods work well but the method that estimates entire burned mass fraction traces is more sensitive to torque data quality. Based on the experimental crankshaft torque data, the direct combustion phasing estimation method delivers estimates with a bias of less than 1 CAD and a cycle-to-cycle standard deviation of less than 2. 7 CAD for all cylinders...|$|R

40|$|A new and {{computationally}} efficient method, {{called the}} combustion <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> method, for estimating combustion phasing in an {{internal combustion engine}} using crankshaft torque data is presented. The work is motivated by the need of such an estimation method for real-time implementation of a torque based closed-loop combustion phasing control system. The ideal properties of the proposed method, based on torque calculated from cylinder pressure, are studied using simulations and experimental data from both a spark ignited and a compression ignited engine. A relation to 50 % burned mass fraction, the most common measure of combustion phasing, is established and the robustness of the method is investigated. The {{results show that the}} ideal estimation accuracy of the proposed method is high, especially around the combustion phasing position where maximum engine efficiency is achieved. Also, the computational complexity of the combustion <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> method is significantly lower compared to other existing techniques for torque domain combustion phasing estimation...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{postural}} {{control in}} multiple planes {{is necessary to}} determine the movement strategies used to respond to unexpected perturbations. The present study quantified <b>net</b> joint <b>torques</b> of the lower limbs and trunk in the sagittal and frontal planes following multi-directional surface translations. Twenty-one healthy subjects stood with feet on separate force plates mounted on a moveable platform, translated unexpectedly in one of 12 directions. Peak <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> magnitudes and latencies following perturbation onset were determined as were the relative contributions of each joint to total torque production. Magnitude of <b>net</b> <b>torque</b> generated by each leg varied by perturbation direction, with the largest individual joint magnitude elicited in directions of limb loading. Relative contributions of individual joint torques to the total response were dependent upon perturbation direction. Results suggest that a redistribution of the relative contributions of hip/trunk versus ankle strategies occurs dependent on perturbation direction, with a significant contribution by the knee joint in response to forward perturbations. Direction-specific redistribution of proximal versus distal strategies appears to depend upon the biomechanical constraints imposed by a given perturbation direction. Thus, it appears that sagittal and frontal plane posture-righting responses may not be uniquely controlled, and may instead be governed similarly, with modulation of relative torque contributions among joints when necessary, given direction-specific anatomical constraints...|$|R
