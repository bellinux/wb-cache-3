5|$|Only two <b>more</b> <b>Windows</b> RT devices, the Microsoft Surface 2 and Nokia Lumia 2520 in late-2013, were {{released}} {{outside of the}} five original launch devices, and no Windows RT counterpart of the Surface Pro 3 was released due to a re-positioning of the Surface line into a high-end market, and a switch to Intel architecture for the Surface 3. These developments left Microsoft's future support of the platform in doubt. As of February 2015, {{with the end of}} production for both Surface 2 and Lumia 2520, Microsoft and its subsidiaries no longer manufacture any Windows RT devices.|$|E
5|$|Aisles {{were added}} to the nave in the 14th century, first on the north side and then on the south, {{doubling}} the seating capacity. <b>More</b> <b>windows</b> were also installed in the nave. A century later, a timber porch was built on the north side, the chancel arch was widened and a rood screen was installed, a standard feature of churches in the medieval era, as were wall decorations and paintings. Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere, whitewashed walls, screens and pillars by the 17th century, and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s. The vicar of Ifield, Reverend Robert Goddin, was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic-style worship, ceremony and church decoration, and he enforced the new style rigorously. The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{is now a}} ruin, and {{all that}} remains above ground is a large grey {{sandstone}} wall, {{which has been the}} only remnant of any building on the site since at least the early 18th century. It includes two large tracery windows, decorated by red sandstone, which stand out against the grey. Red sandstone also appears {{at both ends of the}} walls, suggesting at least two <b>more</b> <b>windows,</b> and meaning that the wall would have been at least twice the length of the surviving fragment when built. Beneath the large windows are two smaller ones, suggestive of an undercroft, and a flue runs between the sets of windows. The wall fragment is thought to be 14th century, likely dating from the reconstruction in 1354.|$|E

Many buildings used to house company employees were set afire and a community effort was required by residents of Santa Cruz to prevent fires from reaching powder magazines closer to the city. The explosion caused apprehension among Santa Cruz residents about the safety of operating the powder works so close to the city. Santa Cruz County closed the powder works school and required powder works employee housing facilities to be vacated.|$|E
25|$|Similarities {{between the}} English and New England barn are that {{buildings}} {{were used for}} multiple purposes: the cows were in tie-ups {{on one side of}} the main floor, typically a narrower space on the warmer side of the building, and hay storage and a stable were in the other side, typically the colder side. Both types of barns were sometimes built with big doors on both ends of the drive floor so a wagon team could drive through and generally called a drive through barn. Occasionally the back door was small and only used for ventilation or winnowing. There were likely loose poles called a scaffold on the beams above the drive floor and loft floors above the tie-ups. There may be a transom window above the barn doors and windows were used as needed in some of the walls, but <b>more</b> <b>windows</b> are likely to be found in the New England barn. The roofs of the three-bay barns frequently have no overhang on the eaves or sidewalls, but some New England barns have original, built in roof overhangs.|$|E

500|$|The present church {{dates from}} the time of King Henry VII (ruled 1485â€“1509), when a {{significant}} amount of building work took place in Wales. [...] Some <b>more</b> <b>windows</b> were added in the 17th or 18th century, and the church was restored in the mid to late 19th century. The writer Samuel Lewis recorded in 1849 that St Twrog's was attached to St Trygarn's Church, Llandrygarn, with the priest serving the two parishes residing in Llandrygarn. [...] The church tithes had been paid to Jesus College, Oxford (who had built a [...] "neat parsonage-house" [...] in Llandrygarn) since 1648, Lewis said, subject to a small deduction for distribution to the poor of the parish. The tithes were given to the college (which has had strong connections with Wales since its foundation in 1571) by a Dr Wynne, Chancellor of Llandaff Cathedral.|$|E
500|$|Philippe {{was able}} to get an {{emergency}} loan of $250,000 from a Lebanese company, but this did not go very far to completing the work on the project.

[...] Philippe's investors believed that the re-budgeting and additional loan would complete {{at least half of the}} resort and allow it to open for business, but Philippe continued to make expensive changes in the project such as adding <b>more</b> <b>windows</b> to all of the suites. [...] When it was evident that the project was once again in financial trouble, one of the investors in the property offered Philippe a loan for an additional $750,000, provided that the project would now result in a more modest resort. [...] Philippe was highly insulted and told the investor offering the additional funding, [...] "I have created a Cadillac. [...] You want to put into it a Chevrolet engine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anniston was {{the center}} of {{national}} controversy in 1961 when a mob bombed a bus filled with civilian Freedom Riders during the American Civil Rights Movement. As two Freedom buses were setting out to travel the south in protest of their Civil Rights following the Supreme Court case saying bus segregation was unconstitutional, one headed to Anniston, and one to Birmingham, Alabama before finishing in New Orleans. The Freedom Riders were riding an integrated bus to protest Alabama's Jim Crow segregation laws that denied African Americans their civil rights. One of the buses was attacked and firebombed by a mob outside Anniston on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 14, 1961. Prior to the bus being firebombed, attackers broke windows, and slashed tires, using metal pipes, clubs, chains and crowbars, before the police came to escort the bus away. The bus was forced to a stop just outside of Anniston, in front of Forsyth and Sons grocery, by more mob members. As <b>more</b> <b>windows</b> were broken, rocks and eventually a firebomb were thrown into the bus. As the bus burned, the mob held the doors shut, intent on burning the riders to death. An exploding fuel tank caused the mob to retreat, allowing the riders to escape the bus. The riders were viciously beaten as they tried to flee, where warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented the riders from being lynched on the spot,. as well as a young girl by the name of Janie Forsyth. The then 12-year-old girl set out against the mob with a bucket of water and cups to help the Riders, first tending to the one who had looked like her own nanny. Forsyth and Son grocery is located along Alabama Highway 202 about [...] west of downtown. The site today is home to a historic marker and was designated Freedom Riders National Monument by President Barack Obama in January 2017.|$|E
