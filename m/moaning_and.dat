5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, <b>moaning,</b> <b>and</b> a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E
25|$|Pain in contractions {{has been}} {{described}} as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps. Women are often encouraged to refrain from screaming, but <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> grunting may be encouraged to help lessen pain. Crowning may be experienced as an intense stretching and burning. Even women who show little reaction to labour pains, in comparison to other women, show a substantially severe reaction to crowning.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] is a dance-pop and electropop song. It {{is set in}} a {{moderate}} dance groove and composed in the key of G minor, with 113 beats per minute, with Spears vocal range spanning from G3 to C4. The melody incorporates [...] "low electronic lines" [...] whereas the beat has been described by Bill Lamb of About.com as [...] "disco-ish". Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared Spears's vocals to those of her single [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] (2001). Lamb described them as [...] "teasing [...] backed by <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> heavy breathing" [...] reminiscent of Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] (1975). Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt the song was reminiscent of Sabrina's [...] "Boys (Summertime Love)" [...] (1987).|$|E

[...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers. Jason made moaning sounds after that. It sounded like he was trying to mess with stuff or get up, because the hijacker pilot kept telling him to stop and to sit down." ...|$|E

500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> groaning about personal problems.

500|$|Of the {{multiple}} music critics who {{commented on the}} song, the majority praised [...] "Skins musical structure and Rihanna's vocal performance. Apart from writing about the song's composition, Daw called the ballad [...] "smoldering" [...] and compared the last minute of the song to Sades [...] "No Ordinary Love" [...] for the song's sensual content, but noted that Adu's song is not as lyrically graphic as [...] "Skin". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Rihanna's sensuality in the song is evoked though her use of sexually suggestive <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> heavy breathing, adding to the [...] "slow, torrid buildup". Colin Gentry of 4Music noted that Rihanna appears to be transitioning from singing songs about partying and dancing in clubs to singing about her sexual fantasies and desires, writing [...] "Rihanna swaggers through the album as {{a woman on the}} prowl, taking her conquests from the clubs to the bedroom. Demanding to know 'why are you standing over there with your clothes on?' on sultry track Skin, the Barbadian clearly means business." [...] Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media concurred with Stern with regard to [...] "Skin" [...] being the singer's most mature song to date, writing [...] "Skin' is her sexiest song yet, a haunted, near-dubstep stunner that wouldn't sound totally out of place on Massive Attack's Mezzanine." ...|$|E
500|$|As such, the FCC representatives {{start to}} censor any foul {{language}} and inappropriate behavior in Quahog, ruining their times of privacy; for instance, a black [...] "censor's bar" [...] is pulled over Peter's genitals by FCC employees {{as he leaves}} the shower, all expletives are overdubbed with an air horn, and audible farts are banned in public (replaced with a dubbing of Steven Wright punchlines). Everyone in Quahog is angered by this, except for Lois, who approves of the FCC's actions, believing that everyone in Quahog needs a lesson in decency. However, she realizes that the FCC's presence puts her and Peter's sex life to a stop after they prevent her and Peter from having any real sex, even if no one's watching (specifically banning thrusting, tongue-kissing, <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> any movement whatsoever). Peter angrily blames her, thus causing her to feel guilty for letting this happen. They lobby Congress to have the FCC's rulings reversed. At first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC, but they relent when Peter honorably retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts and any other body parts associating with it, such as the Capitol Building to a breast. The oppression of the FCC is finally gone, Lois congratulates Peter for beating the FCC on its tracks, and the family settles down to watch an uncensored episode of The Brady Bunch that features bathroom jokes.|$|E

500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the area}} of the Omarska mining complex that was used for the camp, the camp {{authorities}} generally confined the prisoners in three different buildings: the administration building, where interrogations and killings took place; the crammed hangar building; the [...] "white house", where the inmates were tortured; and on a cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the [...] "pista", an L-shaped strip of concrete land in between, also a scene of torture and mass killings. There was another small building, known as the [...] "red house", where prisoners were sometimes taken in order to be summarily executed. With the arrival of the first detainees, permanent guard posts and anti-personnel landmines were set up around the camp. The conditions in the camp were horrible. In the building known as the [...] "white house", the rooms were crowded with 45 people in a room no larger than [...] The faces of the detainees were distorted and bloodstained and the walls were covered with blood. From the beginning, the detainees were beaten with fists, rifle butts and wooden and metal sticks. The guards mostly hit the heart and kidneys whenever they decided to beat someone to death. In the [...] "garage", between 150 and 160 people were [...] "packed like sardines" [...] and the heat was unbearable. For the first few days, the detainees were not allowed out and were given only a jerry can of water and some bread. Men would suffocate during the night and their bodies would be taken out the following morning. The room behind the restaurant was known as [...] "Mujo’s Room". The dimensions of this room were about [...] and the average number of people detained there was 500, most of whom were Bosniaks. The women in the camp slept in the interrogations rooms, which they would have to clean each day as the rooms were covered in blood and pieces of skin and hair.

2500|$|The {{songs for}} the single were {{recorded}} at Alive Recording Studio in Setagaya, Tokyo and at Soi Studio. In the initial discussions with Mode Gakuen about the commercial, the company revealed to Sakanaction {{that they would be}} writing music for a [...] "sparkling" [...] commercial featuring choreographer Jonte' <b>Moaning,</b> <b>and</b> requested that they give them a song similar to [...] "Native Dancer" [...] (2009) or [...] "Identity" [...] (2010). The band chose a piece from Yamaguchi's pre-existing stock of songs, selecting a song that would best suit the commercial. As Mode Gakuen is a design school, they were asked to create a song that showed off design principles and creativity, as well as the commercial's theme of the importance of improving yourself. Yamaguchi felt that these needs worked well with Sakanaction's own goals for 2012.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{writers such}} as E.

During its time as a Penitentiary, both inmates and guards reported a wide range of purported ghostly activity in the prison. [...] It is reputedly haunted by the ghosts of Native American prisoners and officials who perished on the island during the American Civil War and at the military prison. Prisoners, many of whom were declared insane after serving time at Alcatraz, reported peculiar whispering sounds {{in the middle of the}} night, floating blue lights and figures, <b>moaning,</b> <b>and</b> the clanking of chains in cells which were known to be unoccupied.

The video depicts Castile slumped over, <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> moving slightly, with a bloodied left arm and side. In the video, Reynolds is speaking with Yanez and explaining what happened. Reynolds stated on the video that Yanez [...] "asked him for license and registration. He {{told him that it}} was in his wallet, but he had a pistol on him because he's licensed to carry." [...] Castile did have a license to carry a gun. Reynolds further narrated that the officer said, [...] "Don't move" [...] and as Castile was putting his hands back up, the officer shot him in the arm four or five times. Reynolds told the officer, [...] "You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir." [...] Reynolds also said [...] "Please don't tell me he's dead," [...] while Yanez exclaims: [...] "I told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his hand open!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Theodoret, {{when the}} emperor tried {{to enter a}} Milanese church, where Ambrose was about to {{celebrate}} a mass, the bishop stopped him and rebuked {{him for what he}} had done. And because the emperor “had been brought up according to divine words and understood well that some affairs are handled by priests, others by emperors”, he could do nothing but return [...] "weeping and sighing" [...] to the palace. Eight months had passed and Theodosius still sat in the palace, <b>moaning</b> <b>and</b> sobbing. His magister officiorum Rufinus, who [...] "used great freedom of speech due to the familiarity with the emperor", noticed this behaviour, approached and asked him why he was weeping. Having been told, he volunteered to see the bishop and ask him to reconsider. Theodosius hesitantly agreed and even chose to follow Rufinus from a distance. Ambrose was not restrained at all when negotiating with Rufinus, scolding him and even accusing him of complicity in the massacre: [...] "Rufinus, you are as impudent as a dog, because it was you who advised the emperor such a bloodshed." [...] When the emperor showed up, Ambrose at first remained stubborn and changed his mind only after Theodosius promised to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution.|$|E
