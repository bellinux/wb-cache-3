Furthermore, we demonstrate that the demagnetizing field leads to a subsequent broadening of the field distribution, as experienced by the muons implanted in the sample, with a characteristic shape including a low field tail and a sharp high-field cutoff. We present a detailed study of this field broadening {{as a function of}} the aspect ratio of the cylinder and find that it is significant and largest for aspect ratios typical for cylindrical samples grown in <b>mirror</b> <b>furnaces.</b> We identify two strategies to minimize this broadening: adding a degrader so that muons implant closer to the surface of the sample and using a circular mask to stop muons from implanting near the radial edge.

40|$|Fluctuations of the {{electrical}} resistivity due to inhomogeneous dopant distribution {{are still a}} serious problem for the industrial processing yield of doped silicon crystals. In the case of silicon floating-zone growth, the main sources of these inhomogeneities are time- dependent flows in the liquid phase during the growth process. Excluding radio frequency (RF) induced convection, buoyancy and thermocapillary (Marangoni) convection are the two natural reasons for fluid flow. Both originate from temperature/concentration gradients in the melt, buoyancy convection through thermal/concentrational volume expansion, and thermocapillary convection through the temperature/concentration dependence of the surface tension. To improve the properties of grown crystals, knowledge of the strength, the characteristic, and the relation of these two flow mechanisms is essential. By the use of microgravity, the effect {{and the strength of}} buoyancy (gravity dependent) and thermocapillary (gravity independent) convection can be separated and clarified. Applying magnetic fields, both convective modes can be influenced: fluid flow can either be damped (static magnetic fields) or overlaid by a regular flow regime (rotating magnetic fields). Two complementary approaches have been pursued: Silicon full zones (experiments on the German sounding rockets TEXUS 7, 12, 22, 29, and 36) with the maximum temperature at half of the zone height and silicon half zones (experiments on the Japanese sounding rockets TR-IA 4 and 6) with the maximum temperature {{at the top of the}} melt. With the full zone arrangement, the intensity and the frequency of the dopant striations could be determined and the critical Marangoni number could be identified. The half zone configuration is suited to classify the flow pattern and to measure the amplitude and the frequency of temperature fluctuations in the melt by inserting thermocouples or temperature sensors into the melt. All experiments have been carried out in monoellipsoid <b>mirror</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Typical zone geometries are approx. 8 to 14 mm in diameter and height. The crystals grown under microgravity are compared to crystals grown in static axial magnetic fields (B< 5 tesla) and in transversal rotating magnetic fields (B< 7. 5 mT / f= 50 Hz). Experimental results are completed by 3 D numerical simulations: the obtained temperature and concentration distribution in the melt confirm the damping effect of rotating magnetic fields and explain the change in the radial segregation under static magnetic fields...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the single crystal growth of functional oxides by the floating zone technique using a four <b>mirror</b> image <b>furnace.</b> This thesis attempts to extend our knowledge of the subject by firstly studying the optical floating zone method as a technique in terms of the experimental growth parameters and then by performing crystal growth and characterization on a number of functional oxides such as rutile (TiO_ 2), Co-doped rutile and rare earth orthoferrite crystals (RFeO_ 3, R=Er and Y). When growing high quality, large and homogeneous crystals using an image furnace, finding the optimum growth parameters (such as growth speed, rotation rate, gas pressure and type of atmosphere) is a crucial first step since it has been found that these parameters can all affect the eventual crystal quality and properties. Comprehensive characterization of an image furnace revealed that the growth behaviour, and consequently, the quality of the as-grown crystal, {{can be explained by the}} effects that varying these growth parameters have upon the temperature profiles within growing crystals. Characterization of as-grown crystals has been performed using a combination of different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, x-ray diffractometry, back reflection x-ray Laue, polarised optical microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry. The best quality TiO_ 2 crystals were prepared when neither the growing crystal nor the feed rod were rotated during crystal growth. When rotation was employed, this was found to introduce sub-grain boundaries in crystals when the linear growth rate was low, or bubble inclusions when the linear rate was high. The use of lower molten zone temperatures was found to give pale-yellow crystals, while crystals grown using higher molten zone temperatures tended to have the blue colour characteristic of oxygen deficient material. A study of Co-doped TiO_ 2 single crystals, prepared from the melt using the FZ technique, revealed that Co does not dissolve into the rutile matrix and that the type of atmosphere used during FZ affects the type of cobalt-based second phases formed. Magnetization measurements of Co-doped rutile bulk samples (both single crystals prepared using the FZ technique and polycrystalline powders prepared using a solid state reaction) also indicated that the magnetic properties depend upon the material preparation conditions. An oxygen deficient environment during the preparation of Co-doped TiO_ 2 powders and single crystals was crucial for the observation of room temperature ferromagnetism, since preparation in oxygen rich conditions led to the formation of paramagnetic material that included the second phase CoTiO_ 3. Finally, growth of ErFeO_ 3 and YFeO_ 3 single crystals by the FZ technique revealed that the best quality crystals were prepared when the growth rate was 6 mm/h or less, since the use of higher growth rates (12, 18 and 24 mm/h) was found to result in the formation of second phase inclusions within the crystals. The magnetic properties of these crystals, as represented by the hysteresis loops, showed that crystals of both materials grown at higher rates have significantly lower coercivities; this was attributed to the effect of the second phase in nucleating reverse magnetic domains and so aiding the demagnetization process.

40|$|In this thesis, the superconducting {{properties}} of some unconventional superconductors {{have been investigated}} using low temperature magnetic, thermal and transport measurements, small angle neutron scattering, and muon spin rotation/ relaxation techniques. The aim was to correlate the symmetry {{and structure of the}} superconducting gap with the unusual properties in these superconductors. These studies have required the preparation of high quality samples using different growth techniques. Good quality polycrystalline and single crystal samples of FeSe 1 -xTex and FeTe 1 -xSx were grown using a self- ux method. Polycrystalline samples of Lu 2 Fe 3 Si 5 and Re 3 W were made using the arc furnace. We have also grown single crystals of ZrB 12 using the optical oating zone method in a 4 <b>mirror</b> image <b>furnace,</b> and CaAlSi crystal using the Bridgman method. All the compounds have been characterized with a combination of X-ray, neutron diffraction, EDX, magnetization, resistivity or specific heat measurements. In order to investigate the pairing symmetry of the iron chalcogenide superconductors, low temperature muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR) measurements have been performed on FeTe 0 : 5 Se 0 : 5. The temperature dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth is found to be compatible with either a two gap s + s- wave or an anisotropic s-wave model. This result is consistent with our heat capacity data collected on the same sample. μSR results of FeTe 1 -xSx show an antiferromagnetic transition at low temperature and also suggest the presence of excess S in the samples. A similar magnetic transition has also been observed in the magnetization measurements. The symmetry of the superconducting gap of Lu 2 Fe 3 Si 5 with Tc = 6 : 1 K has been investigated using low-temperature transverse-field μSR and specific heat measurements. The temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth, λ(T) is consistent with a two gap s+s-wave model. Low-temperature specific heat measurements on the same sample also show evidence of two distinct superconducting gaps and hence support the muon results. To resolve whether CaAlSi is a single band or multiband superconductor, we have studied the ux line lattice in CaAlSi using small angle neutron scattering. A well defined hexagonal ux line lattice is seen just above Hc 1 in an applied field of only 54 Oe. A 30 ° reorientation of this vortex lattice has been observed in a very low field of 200 Oe. This reorientation transition appears to be of first-order and could be explained by non-local effects. The magnetic field dependence of the form factor is well described by a single penetration depth and a single coherence length. The penetration depth anisotropy has also been estimated with the field applied at different angles to the c-axis. The B-T phase diagram of superconducting ZrB 12 has been investigated by means of μSR spectroscopy using a mosaic of single crystal. The local field distribution for different applied fields and temperatures shows evidence of the Meissner, mixed, and intermediate states in ZrB 12. The intermediate state indicates that this material has some of the characteristics of a type-I superconductor, while the mixed state is typical of a type-II superconductor. Regions of coexistence have also been observed between the different states. We have not observed any distinct features of two-band or two-gap superconductivity in this material. Two different superconducting phases of Re 3 W have been found with different physical properties. One phase crystallizes in a non-centrosymmetric cubic (α-Mn) structure and has a superconducting transition temperature, Tc, of 7. 8 K. The other phase has a hexagonal centrosymmetric structure and is superconducting with a Tc of 9. 4 K. Switching between the two phases is possible by annealing the sample or remelting it. The zero-field μSR results indicate that time reversal symmetry is preserved for both structures of Re 3 W. For both phases of Re 3 W, the temperature dependence of the penetration depth can be explained using a singlegap s-wave BCS model. Low temperature specific heat data also provide evidence for an s-wave gap-symmetry for the two phases of Re 3 W. Both the μSR and heat capacity data show that the CS material has a higher Tc and a larger superconducting gap (0) at 0 K than the NCS compound. The experimental work detailed in this thesis provides new information on the superconducting {{properties of}} FeSe 0 : 5 Te 0 : 5, FeTe 1 -xSx, Lu 2 Fe 3 Si 5, CaAlSi, ZrB 12, and two different superconducting phases of Re 3 W and contributes to our overall understanding of the physics of the different exotic superconducting features in these systems...|$|R

The solidification shrinkage can cause different defects in the ingot casting {{as well as the}} shape casting. The volume change due to phase transformation during solidification is the other concept which has to be studied. In addition, the solidification shrinkage can be affected by the volume change of liquid metals due to the structure change of liquid. In this work, first, the solidification shrinkage was measured in copper-lead base alloys by a dilatometer which was developed to use for melting and solidification processes. The volume change was measured during primary solidification and monotectic reaction. The macrostructure evaluation of samples was used to explain the volume change results. A shrinkage model was used to explain the volume changes during solidification. In addition, the microsegregation of alloying elements was studied in the alloys.   In the second part, the solidification of brass alloys was investigated in different cooling rates. Microstructure evaluation showed that the peritectic transformation occurred as diffusionless (partitionless) as well as the diffusion-controlled transformation. In addition, the volume change was measured in the peritectic alloys. A theoretical analysis was developed to evaluate the volume change effect on the peritectic reaction.   Hot crack formation was investigated during the solidification of peritectic steels as a volume change concept during the transformation of ferrite to austenite. A series of in situ solidification experiments was performed using a MTS tensile testing machine combined with a <b>mirror</b> <b>furnace</b> to measure the sample temperature and the force change during solidification. It was observed that a rise in tensile force began with the start of solidification and suddenly dropped. The sudden drop of force, which occurred around the peritectic temperature of the alloy, was accompanied by a crack or a refilled crack in the microstructure. Furthermore, the peritectic reaction types were studied theoretically and experimentally to understand their effects on the force change during solidification. The analyses showed that the volume change due to the peritectic transformation is a reason for crack formation. In addition, when the peritectic reaction occurred as a diffusionless manner (partitionless), the crack formation is more probable.   In the last study, the effect of cooling rate and super heat temperature were studied on the precipitation of primary silicon in Al-Si hypereutectic alloys. The liquidus temperature was found to decrease with cooling rate. In addition, the fraction of primary silicon decreased with increasing the cooling rate and the super heat temperature. Furthermore, the morphology of the primary silicon changed as an effect of cooling rate and super heat temperature. It was concluded that the solidification characteristic and silicon morphology relate to the liquid structure. QC 2010072...|$|E
40|$|Different {{representatives of}} the group of quasi-one-dimensional spin-chain {{compounds}} Ba(1 -x) Sr(x) (Co(1 -y) M(y)) 2 V 2 O 8 with M= Mn, Cu, Ni, Mg and (Ba,Sr) Mn 2 V 2 O 8 were synthesized, characterized and their magnetic phase diagrams determined for H||c, H||a and H||[110]. The tetragonal structure of these compounds consists of screw chains of edge-sharing MO 6 octahedra, where depending on the transition metal M different spin values are realized. The chains are separated by nonmagnetic Ba or Sr and V ions. Large single crystals were grown via the floating-zone method in a <b>mirror</b> <b>furnace</b> employing the twice scanning method. The single crystal studies of the S= 5 / 2 Heisenberg spin chains BaMn 2 V 2 O 8 (T_N = 37 K) and SrMn 2 V 2 O 8 (T_N = 42 K) reveal a weak positive field dependence. BaMn 2 V 2 O 8 shows a spin-flop transition at H^(perpendicular c = 300 mT as is observed in the susceptibility and the magnetostriction. Deduced from this data a magnetic structure is suggested similar to the magnetic structure of SrMn 2 V 2 O 8 which reveals ferromagnetic planes (spins along (+-) a) that are ordered antiferromagnetically to each other along the chain direction c [100]. BaCo 2 V 2 O 8 is a quasi-one dimensional effective S= 1 / 2 Ising chain where the antiferromagnetic Ising chains along c have a frustrated inter-chain arrangement leading to the presence of two magnetic domains. Below T_N = 5. 4 K the system undergoes a structural distortion as confirmed by zero-field high-resolution thermal-expansion. Via magnetoelastic coupling the structural domains couple to the magnetic domains and can be manipulated by uniaxial pressure or magnetic fields along a. The expected distortion of the order of 10 ^(- 5) could hardly be detected in high-resolution single crystal X-ray diffraction. For H||c, the Néel ordered state breaks down at H_c= 3. 9 T where an incommensurate (IC) phase is entered in the low-T region [24, 110]. A first order transition is confirmed by a hysteresis in the low-T magnetostriction. Thermal expansion yields very broad anomalies in the low-T region of the high-field curves and the IC-to-paramagnetic phase boundary was traced up to 17 T. For H perpendicular c, an in-plane anisotropy was found with a weak field dependence of T_N for H||[110], but a complete suppression of T_N at H^(||a = 10 T. Kimura et al. developed a model where a magnetic field H||a is accompanied by a staggered transverse field component via a staggered g tensor [96]. The predicted breakdown of the magnetic order for H||a is evidenced in magnetostriction and the collapse of magnetic superstructure peaks in single-crystal neutron diffraction. The field-induced detwinning of the structural/magnetic domains is clearly observed in the different field hysterses of magnetic Bragg peaks being sensitive to different domains. Moreover, the magnetic field induces an increasing intensity for nuclear reflections due to a uniform ferromagnetic component parallel to to the external field. In addition, the presence of forbidden reflections and their field-dependent behavior are explained by the presence of the staggered moments giving a qualitative confirmation of the Kimura model. Different measures (thermal conductivity, heat capacity, neutron diffraction) show additional anomalies around 6 T whose origin remains unknown. The investigation of out-of-chain substitutions in the Ba(1 -x) Sr(x) Co 2 V 2 O 8 series and of in-chain substitutions in the BaCo 1. 9 M 0. 1 V 2 O 8 series (M= Mn, Ni, Cu, Mg) yields a preservation of the orthorhombic distortion (below T_N) and of both the Ising and in-plane anisotropy. Judging from these experimental results the magnetic structure is essentially preserved for all substitutions which was recently confirmed for SrCo 2 V 2 O 8 by neutron diffraction [100]. Only indirect hints for a transition from the ordered into an IC phase for H||c are given by hysteretic magnetostriction curves in the low-T regime. The Sr substitution yields a slight decline of the Ising anisotropy but an increase of the in-plane anisotropy as is reflected in the magnetic phase diagrams. These changes in the anisotropies can be understood by a systematic increase of the distortion of the CoO 6 octahedra with increasing Sr content. Due to the decreasing inter-chain distance with increasing Sr content a change of J^(perp) _(NN) and J^(perp) _(NNN) is suggested {{in a way that the}} resulting frustration increases, which in turn results in a weakened effective inter-chain interaction and a weakly decreasing T_N with increasing Sr content. The substitution of, e. g., Cu and Mg yields a drastic reduction of the ordering temperature. Due to the strong suppression of T_N by Mg in contrast to, e. g., Ni the NN intra-chain interaction is suggested to be the dominant coupling mechanism of the finite chain segments...|$|E
40|$|Single layered perovskites {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula La 2 −xSrxTO 4 (T = transition metal) exhibit {{a variety of}} intriguing ordering phenomena. The most outstanding is the occurrence of high temperature superconductivity in La 2 −xSrxCuO 4, which {{can be considered as}} the prototype system for the more complex cuprates. Some cuprates show incommensurate static charge order at low temperatures [38 – 40]. For others it is believed that charges are dynamically correlated [39, 147, 259]. Such eﬀects are diﬃcult to measure if the charges ﬂuctuate. In contrast to the cuprate La 2 −xSrxCuO 4 the isostructural nickelates and cobaltates remain insulating over a wide doping range [112, 134, 135, 138]. While incommensurate charge stripe order is long known for the nickelates, recently also evidence for charge stripes in cobaltates has been published [174]. Single crystal rods, with ≈ 10 cm length and ≈ 0. 8 cm diameter, have been grown by the traveling solvent ﬂoating zone technique using an optical four <b>mirror</b> <b>furnace.</b> We investigated strontium doped nickelates in the range 0. 15 ≤ x ≤ 0. 22. In addition, also co-doped nickelates have been investigated. A large number of samples with diﬀerent doping concentrations enabled us to systematically characterize the sample properties. Powder X-ray diﬀraction measurements were used to determine the lattice parameters. For the nickelates we could conﬁrm the doping dependence of the lattice constants reported in literature [202]. The main interest for the cobaltate system was in the strontium doping range 1 / 3 ≤ x ≤ 1 / 2. It was previously reported that the ab-lattice parameter exhibits an anomalous peak around a Sr doping x ≈ 1 / 3 [140]. We could not conﬁrm such an anomaly for our samples and, instead, we observe a strictly monotonic doping dependence of the lattice parameters which we attribute to the close to perfect stoichiometry of our samples. Samples with the 214 -layered perovskite structure can be synthesized over a wide range of oxygen oﬀ-stoichiometry. However, the oxygen content can have similarly strong inﬂuence on the sample properties as strontium doping. It is therefore essential for data interpretation to determine the oxygen oﬀ stoichiometry. EDX and WDX measurements were used to conﬁrm the oxygen content in our nickelates to be nearly stoichiometric. The oxygen content determination of the cobaltates is somewhat more diﬃcult. Thermogravimetry measurements in a ﬂow of Ar/H 2 conﬁrmed a nearly stoichiometric oxygen content δ in La 2 −xSrxCoO 4 +δ for all samples. We used neutron diﬀraction measurements to determine the magnetic order in our nickelate samples. In stripe ordered nickelates a small titanium co-doping of the order of 5 % is suﬁccient to supress the incommensurate magnetism and restore antiferromagnetic order. Within the series of zinc co-doped nickelates three samples exhibit an incommensurability epsilon ≈ 1 / 8, indicating the stabilization of an intermediate stripe pattern with an eightfold unit cell. Compared to the epsilon ≈ 1 / 3 regime the correlation length is greatly reduced. The magnon dispersion of two samples within the intermediate stripe phases with epsilon ≈ 1 / 8 and epsilon ≈ 1 / 4 has been measured with neutron spectroscopy. The observed dispersion neither resembles the one in the undoped nor the 1 / 3 strontium doped samples. Despite the amount of disorder in our co-doped nickelate materials there are no clear signs for the emergence of hourglass spectra which is most likely caused by a strong exchange interaction across the holes. We investigated the charge and magnetic order in the incommensurate regime of La 2 −xSrxCoO 4 with doping 0. 33 ≤ x ≤ 0. 5 by elastic neutron scattering and hard X-ray synchrotron measurements. In contrast to the established opinion that this phase is characterized by charge stripe order we were able to show that no charge stripes are present. Instead we found that checkerboard charge order, which is most stable at x = 1 / 2, persists to a much lower doping than previously thought. The absence of charge stripes is also in agreement with the dispersion of the top most Co-O bond stretching phonon mode. Charge order can induce an anomaly in this branch according to the modulation vector ~q. We observed a softening at ~q = (1 / 2 1 / 2 0), which is consistent with our expectations for a checkerboard charge ordered phase. Inelastic neutron measurements revealed an additional high energy part of the hourglass dispersion which has not been reported so far. The entire lowenergy spin excitations that belong to the classical hour-glass dispersion are mostly in-plane excitations, the newly discovered high-energy magnon mode arises from out-of-plane excitations. The resemblance between the low energy excitations below the neck of the hourglass with the excitations in La 1. 5 Sr 0. 5 CoO 4 and similarly between the high energy excitations with those observed in La 2 CoO 4 suggests that the observed dispersion is not a single dispersion, but instead consists of two dispersions with distinct origin. In this model the low-energy dispersion arises mainly from magnetic excitations of hole doped regions and the high-energy part would be connected to magnetic excitations within the undoped islands. The absence of charge stripe order in the insulating cobaltates in combination with an unmagnetic low spin state for Co+ 3 requires a diﬀerent explanation for the presence of incommensurate magnetic order. We propose a picture {{on the basis of the}} ideal checkerboard charge order of the half doped reference system. Decreasing the strontium concentration requires the replacement of Co+ 3 by Co+ 2, eﬀectively resulting in the competition between the antiferromagnetic order of the undoped and the antiferromagnetic order of the half doped compound. The induced frustration can be released by a twisting of magnetic moments away from their antiferromagnetic orientation, ultimately leading to the observed incommensurate magnetic order...|$|E
