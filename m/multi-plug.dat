25|$|Older Japanese sockets and <b>multi-plug</b> {{adaptors}} are unpolarized—the {{slots in}} the sockets {{are the same}} size—and will accept only unpolarized plugs. Japanese plugs generally fit into most North American sockets without modification, but polarized North American plugs may require adaptors or replacement non-polarized plugs to connect to older Japanese sockets. In Japan the voltage is 100 V, and the frequency is either 50Hz (East Japan) or 60Hz (West Japan) {{depending on whether the}} customer is located on the Osaka or Tokyo grid. Therefore, some North American devices which can be physically plugged into Japanese sockets may not function properly.|$|E

However most European extension reel cables now include an automatic current cut-out to avoid misuse of the cable. This requires manual resetting if excess current is drawn through the cable. (American <b>multi-plug</b> cords also include such a device, but single- or triple-outlet cords do not.) ...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate the restart behaviour of pipeline containing gelled waxy oil. The model {{takes into account the}} compressible, multi-phase and <b>multi-plug</b> flow characteristics of the gelled oil at start-up. The pipe is initially filled by the gelled oil in the form of plugs separated by pockets of gas. Displacement of the gelled oil is achieved by pumping in another fluid under constant applied pressure. The simulation results obtained show that the initial gas pressure and the location of the gas segment influence the flow of the downstream oil plug, but has little effect on the flow of the upstream oil flow and the clearance time. The length of the gas section has different effects on the oil flow rates and clearance time depending on the initial liquid hold up present in the pipe. The model is robust and insensitive to the specific constitutive model assumed for the gelled oil. It appears to produce a more realistic prediction of the restart flow than other previous models based on restrictive and simplified assumptions. Malcolm R. Davidson, Q. Dzuy Nguyen, and Hans Petter Rønningsen[URL]...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. The grade 12 Physical Sciences {{students}} of 2008 {{were the first}} group of South African students to write a National Senior Certificate (NSC) on the new outcomes-based education (OBE) curriculum – the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). Society scrutinised the performance of students in this high stake examination. The outcome was disappointing: 71, 3 % of the students achieved a mark of less than 40 %, and 45 % of the group achieved a mark of less than 30 %. Concern amongst the educational community, specifically the Department of Education (DOE), initiated a request for research into the possible causes of the poor performance by students in this examination. There are many factors that affect the performance of students, including the misconceptions held by students regarding subject content. This study aims to contribute knowledge about the common misconceptions held by science students regarding Physics. It also investigates the performance of students in explanation-type questions and what explanation-types reveal about student misconceptions. The research design for this study is a content analysis which was carried out qualitatively in two phases. In the primary phase, a sample of student examination scripts was analysed. During the secondary phase, interviews were conducted with grade 12 Physical Sciences students and teachers from one school. The findings of this study are that the following misconceptions are commonly held by students: • Heavier objects exert more force on lighter objects during a collision; • Total external resistance decreases when an external resistor, connected in parallel, is removed; • Energy is lost in certain situations; • A split-ring is found in an AC generator; • The voltage increases when appliances are added to a <b>multi-plug...</b>|$|E
