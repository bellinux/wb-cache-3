40|$|<b>Mist</b> <b>blower</b> {{is one of}} the {{mechanization}} tool {{of agriculture}} considered as a tool that can assist humans in fertilizer and pesticides spreading activities. Levels of motor speed in the used <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> were 1915, 4009, and 7227 rpm. Vibration measurements were conducted on the engine and handlebar control <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> with the three-dimensional axes namely X, Y, and Z. <b>Mist</b> <b>blower</b> noise measurements were performed on the engine, operator 2 Ì† 7 s right ear and left ear. Based on the analysis of vibration and noise from the <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> of type MK 150 -B was obtained the safe limit values from the use of these tools. The safe limit of the use of <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> in motor rotation speed of 1915, 4009, and 7227 rpm after being compared with the vibration and noise were 1 hour, 1 hour and 24 minutes respectively. The farther the distance from noise source, the lower the noise level too. Moreover objectivity study of operator was conducted. The first farmer was tired faster than the second farmer. In terms of age of farmer, the second farmer (60 years) older than the first farmers (40 years), but this should not affect significantly. Activity on the previous day greatly affects the level of fatigue when operating the <b>mist</b> <b>blower.</b> This was because the first farmers did more activities and had rest periods that less than second farmer...|$|E

40|$|Mosquitoes {{can be a}} {{nuisance}} and also transmit pathogens causing numerous diseases worldwide. Homeowners and others may hire private companies to alleviate mosquito-related issues. Here, two pyrethroids (Suspend[registered] Polyzone[registered] [deltamethrin] and Bifen Insecticide/Termiticide [bifenthrin]) used in mosquito control were evaluated on blocks of properties in two neighborhoods (Magnolia Ridge: 1 - 6 lot blocks, 2, 100 [...] 7, 500 m 2 /block and Cedar Ridge: 1 - 3 lot blocks, 1, 300 [...] 4, 200 m 2 /block) in eastern North Carolina for 23 weeks from May 18 [...] October 19, 2015. Properties were treated by Mosquito Authority operators using backpack <b>mist</b> <b>blowers</b> every 21 days. At 17 fixed sampling locations (13 treatment and four control lots), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CO 2 -baited traps were deployed overnight once/week {{for the duration of}} the experiment (377 trap nights). Oviposition traps (ovitraps) were deployed weekly at the same 17 locations and ovistrips remained in the field for seven days as a measure of Aedes albopictus abundance. Mosquitoes were identified to species, quantified, and tabulated by location and week. Differences were observed in mosquito abundance between neighborhoods, treatments, and weeks and differences varied between species. Adult and egg abundance were generally significantly (P [less than] 0. 05) higher in traps placed on control properties (no insecticide) compared to traps placed on treatment properties. In both neighborhoods, the abundance of Psorophora columbiae and Ae. vexans was significantly higher in control versus treatment traps. Bifenthrin and deltamethrin showed differences in efficacy (e. g. Ae. vexans, An. punctipennis, and Ps. ferox abundance was greater in traps placed on bifenthrin compared to deltamethrin and control properties), but this varied between neighborhoods and species...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to assess the}} outcomes on the spray patterns produced by the different feasible adjustments of two different air blast sprayers and one <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> sprayer, commonly employed for treatments to Apulian "tendone" vineyards. The spray profiles of these machines and the respective refinements affected by the alteration of the available adjusting devices were evaluated using a test bench, suitably set up for calibrating the sprayers used inside such vines. The air blast sprayers, compared with the <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> model, have a better chance to match the spray pattern and the canopy profile of the "tendone" vines. Furthermore, the left-right asymmetry of the spray profile is reduced only in the case of sprayers with two counter-rotating fans, under certain operating conditions. Conversely, the symmetry index worsens with the activation of the fan {{in the case of the}} air blast sprayer fitted with a single fan either with or without the air deflectors. The <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> sprayer develops lower drawbacks, in terms of left-right asymmetry of the spray profile, even if the high "stiffness" of the spray profile makes this sprayer not particularly suitable to the changing needs of the canopy of the "tendone" vineyards. The obtained results, even if related to the analyzed sprayers, can represent an original base of reference to set up guidelines for the adjustment of sprayers used for treatments inside "tendone" vineyards, very useful for the officially authorized Apulian workshops to make sprayers inspection and calibration...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{scanning}} Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) {{system to}} characterize drift during pesticide application is described. The LIDAR system is compared with an ad hoc test bench used to quantify the amount of spray liquid moving beyond the canopy. Two sprayers were used during the field test; a conventional <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> at two air flow rates (27, 507 and 34, 959 m 3 &# 183;h&# 8722; 1) equipped with two different nozzle types (conventional and air injection) and a multi row sprayer with individually oriented air outlets. A simple model based on a linear function was used to predict spray deposit using LIDAR measurements and to compare with the deposits measured over the test bench. Results showed differences in {{the effectiveness of the}} LIDAR sensor depending on the sprayed droplet size (nozzle type) and air intensity. For conventional <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> and low air flow rate; the sensor detects a greater number of drift drops obtaining a better correlation (r = 0. 91; p &lt; 0. 01) than for the case of coarse droplets or high air flow rate. In the case of the multi row sprayer; drift deposition in the test bench was very poor. In general; the use of the LIDAR sensor presents an interesting and easy technique to establish the potential drift of a specific spray situation as an adequate alternative for the evaluation of drift potential...|$|E

40|$|In Australia, dengue is not endemic, {{although}} the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti is established in far north Queensland (FNQ). Aedes albopictus has recently invaded the Torres Strait region, {{but is not}} established on mainland Australia. To maintain dengue-free, public health departments in FNQ closely monitor introduced dengue infections and confine outbreaks through rigorous vector control responses. To safeguard mainland Australia from Ae. albopictus establishment, pre-emptive strategies are required to reduce its breeding in difficult to access habitats. We compare the residual efficacy of VectoBac WDG, Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) formulation, as a residual treatment when misted across a typical FNQ bushland using a backpack mister (Stihl SR 420 <b>Mist</b> <b>Blower)</b> at two dose rates up to 16 m.

40|$|Researches are {{conducted}} in vineyard and apple orchard with {{two different types}} of mist blowers, axial (Hardi Zaturn) and radial (Hardi Arrow). The influence of major technical spraying factors (type of nozzle, working speed and spray volume) were observed on coverage of the treated area, average droplet diameter, number of droplets per cm 2 and drift. The working speed of sprayer was set at 6 and 8 km/h, and spray volume on 250, 325 and 400 l/ha for apple orchard and 250, 300 and 350 l/ha for vineyard. Researchers used Lechler blue (TR 8003), yellow (TR 8002) and green (TR 80015) nozzles. The research was set as three - factorial field experiment with 18 treatments in 4 repetitions, for different type of sprayer and permanent crops. We used 60 water sensitive papers for that treatment, which were processed with digital image analysis and ImageJ software. In addition to the main features of the research, research showed leaf area index and density, speed and flow of air current, working pressure, orientation of the nozzles and weather conditions, which were monitored during the study. Before the research, mist blowers are tested according to the European standard 13790. By decreasing the ISO number of nozzles and by increasing the working speed and spray volume, we found increase of area coverage, number of droplets per cm 2 and drift, and decrease of average droplet diameter. Also, by comparing the results of research exploitation by axial and radial <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> in the vineyards and apple orchards, better results are achieved with radial <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> (Hardi Arrow) in both cases. The best relationship of area coverage and liquid drift in vineyard were achieved with 64. 22 % area coverage and 17. 11 % of liquid drift (green nozzle, working speed of 6 km/h, spray volume of 350 l/ha, and working pressure of 10. 99 bar). In apple orchard the best relationship of area coverage and liquid drift were achieved with 59. 55 % area coverage and 21. 10 % of liquid drift (green nozzle, working speed of 8 km/h, spray volume of 325 l/ha, and working pressure of 16. 84 bar) ...|$|E
40|$|Since 2006, a {{large scale}} {{research}} {{on the effectiveness of}} entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) in the control of codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella, overwintering larvae has been performed on about 35 ha of pear orchards per year in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy. Steinernema carpocapsae and Steinernema feltiae activity was checked after spray applications of EPNs to the trunk and branches. In 2006, the treatment was applied either in spring or in autumn at different doses, before CM pupation; in 2007 the EPN treatment was applied only in autumn at 1. 5 x 109 I. J. ha â€“ 1. Every year it was distributed by means of a conventional <b>mist</b> <b>blower.</b> The larval mortality was assessed directly on sentinel larvae in card boards on the trunks and indirectly on the eggs laid by the females of the first CM generation in spring. Moreover, each year, a trial was performed applying only S. carpocapsae on sentinel larvae with the aim of testing this nematode at suitable temperatures but at different water volumes. The CM sentinel larvae were effectively parasitized after autumnal EPN application. Moreover, the egg assessment demonstrated a good decrease in CM population in spring 2007, when EPNs had been applied at the best weather conditions (t Â° 12 - 14 Â°C and rain) in the previous autumn...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMosquito Control in France {{represents}} about 45 000 ha (domestic and overseas area) and represents {{a public health}} concern operated by public authorities. Apart from aerial spraying, mosquito control is mainly achieved by agricultural sprayers (pickup â€“ ATV or manually mounted mist blowers). As spraying applications may lead to variable performance, a specif-ic research program was designed in order to simultaneously assess spray deposition and biological efficacy. This study {{was a part of}} the overarching project (Life + Integrated Mosqui-to Control Management - LIFE 08 /ENV/F/ 000488). Four mist blowers were tested (Martignani B 748 â€“ Tifone City 300 (ATR- TVI nozzles) â€“ Swingtec Mobilstar â€“ knapsack <b>mist</b> <b>blower</b> with AU 8000 rotary nozzle) as used for larvicide application. 22 tests were conducted including 3 repetitions for each equipment setup. BTi (Bacillius Thuringiensis Israelensis) was applied with an application volume of 8 to 12. 5 L/ha including 1 to 2. 5 L/ha of BTi Vectobac WGÂ® or Aquabac XTÂ® respectively. Each tank mix contained about 1 g/L of Brillant SulfloFlavine (BSF) dye tracer. Deposition values at different distances were calculated after tracer content measurement. 3 Petri dishes (f 8 cm) were used to collect ground deposits and placed around a jar including 25 mosquito larvae (Aedes Aegypty L.) for biological control. Alive lar-vae were counted immediately after application, 24 h and 48 h after application. Average deposition in 3 Petri dishes was compared with alive larvae at different distances and for each kind of equipment. 30 collecting plots placed on a 10 m x 10 m grid leading to 5 lines of 4 plots located at 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 m from the application path. A central line of collectors placed every 5 m was used from 55 to 90 m. Applications were realized downwind as advised by mosquito control operators at 8 km/h for vehicle mounted sprayers and 4 km/h for hand op-erated sprayer. Individual performance of each sprayer (i. e. efficient spray range) was com-pared to others and to manufacturer indications. A deeper analysis in terms of lethal dosage of Bti was also realized. For example, an application volume of 0. 5 L/ha (1 / 25 th of legal appli-cation volume) was found to generate acceptable mortality in some cases. Tentative of ex-planation regarding the global variability obtained after crossing physical deposits and biolog-ical efficacy was conducted. Among all parameters of influence, droplet size and atmospheric conditions were mainly identified. Indeed, best biological efficacy was obtained with lower application volume when small droplet size were produced (Tifone and rotary nozzle) ...|$|E
