40|$|International audienceA {{combination}} of <b>midodrine</b> and dihydroergotamine (DHE) is frequently used clinically in patients suffering from severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). Whereas <b>midodrine</b> {{acts as a}} selective, peripheral alpha 1 -receptor agonist, DHE displays complex pharmacology and can behave as an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist or antagonist. Surprisingly, the consequences of such a combination on blood pressure have never been investigated. The present study was performed in order to evaluate the pressor effects induced by the administration of both <b>midodrine</b> and DHE in old conscious dogs (n = 6) in experimental condition reproducing autonomic failure-related baroreflex dysfunction (atropine 0. 1 mg/kg). For this purpose, we first studied the relative potency and intrinsic activity of each agonist and noradrenaline (NA) for the alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor. The orders of potency obtained in our study were 0. 35, 11 and 400 microg/kg for NA, DHE and <b>midodrine,</b> and intrinsic activity: NA > <b>midodrine</b> > DHE. These results strongly suggest that DHE really acts in vivo as an alpha 1 -adrenoceptor partial agonist. Afterwards, the pressor effects of coadministration of <b>midodrine</b> (0. 4 mg/kg) and DHE (15 microg/kg) were investigated: in one setting, <b>midodrine</b> was first administered, followed by DHE; in another, DHE was first administered, followed by <b>midodrine.</b> Our results show that in conscious dogs, the {{combination of}} <b>midodrine</b> and DHE leads to near-complete abolition of the pressor effect induced by the first administered drug. This in vivo proof of such antagonistic effects on blood pressure could explain clinical observations of worsening of OH in humans administered <b>midodrine</b> plus DHE. Although in vivo results obtained in conscious healthy dogs need to be experimentally and clinically confirmed in humans suffering from OH, these results strongly suggest that a midodrine-DHE combined treatment should be avoided in clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension, which affects approximately 30 % of astronauts after short duration shuttle missions, is inadequate norepinephrine release during upright posture. We performed a two phased {{study to determine}} the effectiveness of an alpha 1 -adrenergic agonist, <b>midodrine,</b> as a countermeasure to post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension. The {{first phase of the}} study examined the landing day orthostatic responses of six veteran astronauts after oral <b>midodrine</b> (10 mg) administered on the ground within approximately two hours of wheel stop. One female crewmember exhibited orthostatic hypotension in a previous flight but not after <b>midodrine.</b> Five male crewmembers, who did not exhibit orthostatic hypotension during previous flights, also did not show signs of orthostatic hypotension after <b>midodrine.</b> Additionally, phase one showed that <b>midodrine</b> did not cause hypertension in these crewmembers.

Four of ten crewmembers have completed phase two of this study. Two crewmembers completed the landing day tilt tests, while two tests were ended early due to presyncopal symptoms. All subjects had decreased landing day stroke volumes and increased heart rates compared to preflight. <b>Midodrine</b> appears to have increased total peripheral resistance in one crewmember who was able to complete the landing day tilt test.

40|$|Initial {{treatment}} of vasovagal syncope (VVS) consists of advising adequate fluid and salt intake, regular exercise, and physical counterpressure manoeuvres. Despite this treatment, up to 30 % of patients continue to experience regular episodes of VVS. We investigated whether additional <b>Midodrine</b> treatment {{is effective in}} these patients. In our study, patients with at least three syncopal and/or severe pre-syncopal recurrences during non-pharmacological treatment were eligible to receive double-blind cross-over treatment starting either with <b>Midodrine</b> or placebo.

Twenty-three patients (17 % male, mean age 32) included in the cross-over trial received both <b>Midodrine</b> and placebo treatment. The proportion of patients who experienced syncopal and pre-syncopal recurrences did not differ significantly between <b>Midodrine</b> and placebo treatment (syncope: 48 vs. 65 %, P= 0. 22; pre-syncope: 74 vs. 78 %, P> 0. 99).

40|$|<b>Midodrine</b> {{prevents}} post-space flight {{orthostatic intolerance}} when testing is {{conducted in a}} controlled laboratory setting within 2 - 4 hours after Space Shuttle landing. It is unknown if <b>midodrine</b> is as effective during re-entry and immediately following landing. METHODS: Cardiovascular responses to 10 minutes of 80 head-up tilt in five male astronauts were compared before and immediately after Space Shuttle missions. Preflight tests were conducted in the Johnson Space Center Cardiovascular Laboratory without <b>midodrine.</b> Post-flight testing was performed in the Crew Transport Vehicle on the Space Shuttle runway within 60 minutes of landing; <b>midodrine</b> was self-administered before re-entry. Survival analysis was performed (Gehan-Breslow test) to compare presyncope rates pre- to post-flight. Cardiovascular responses (last minute standing minus supine) to tilt before and after space flight were compared using paired t-tests. RESULTS: <b>Midodrine</b> did not prevent post-flight orthostatic hypotension {{in two of the}} five astronauts, but the rate of presyncope across the group did not increase (p= 0. 17) from pre- to post-flight. Also, although the change in heart rate from supine to the last minute of standing was not affected by space flight, systolic blood pressure decreased more (p= 0. 05) and diastolic blood pressure tended to decrease (p= 0. 08) after space flight. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate interpretation of the current results requires that similar data be collected in control subjects (without <b>midodrine)</b> on the CTV. However, drug interaction concerns with commonly used anti-emetics and potentiation of prolonged QTc intervals observed in long duration astronauts make the routine use of <b>midodrine</b> for immediate post-flight orthostatic hypotension unlikely. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} erythrocytic hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in predicting the therapeutic efficacy of <b>midodrine</b> hydrochloride for children with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Study design Fifty-five children were included in this study, involving 28 children with POTS (POTS group) and 27 healthy children (control group). Children in the POTS group received <b>midodrine</b> hydrochloride treatment. Erythrocytic H 2 S production was measured; a receiver operating characteristic curve {{was used to assess}} if erythrocytic H 2 S could predict the therapeutic response to <b>midodrine</b> hydrochloride treatment. Results H 2 S production from erythrocytes was significantly higher in the POTS group than in the control group (P <. 01). H 2 S production was also significantly higher in responders to <b>midodrine</b> hydrochloride than in non-responders (P <. 05). The change in symptom score and baseline erythrocytic H 2 S production had a positive linear relationship (P <. 01). There was also a positive correlation with the change in heart rate (P <. 05).
