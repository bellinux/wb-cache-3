25|$|I {{confess to}} God Almighty, before the whole company of heaven, and to you, my {{brothers}} and sisters, that I have sinned in thought, word, and deed; in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, by my fault, by my fault, by <b>my</b> <b>most</b> grievous fault; wherefore I pray God Almighty to have mercy on me, forgive me all my sins, and bring me to everlasting life.

Therefore I beseech blessed Mary ever Virgin, blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, all the Saints, and you, brethren, to pray for me to the Lord our God.|$|E

25|$|Out in {{the real}} world, however, the {{response}} has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. <b>My</b> <b>most</b> troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been <b>my</b> <b>most</b> wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

500|$|Stipe had {{difficulty}} writing lyrics for the Up album. In {{the case of}} [...] "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful", it took the singer a year to write the song's verse because he needed {{to figure out what}} one could do to prompt the action described in the opening line. The solution finally occurred to him one morning, and he finished writing the words in 45 minutes. After a conversation with Patti Smith, Stipe was convinced that he needed to be fearless in his songwriting approach. In regards to [...] "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful", he had grown tired writing ironic love songs and consequently endeavored to create [...] "the most romantic song I'd ever written".|$|E
500|$|... "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} single from Up in early 1999. That February, R.E.M. performed [...] "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful" [...] for an episode of Party of Five, a television series which had included music by the band in the past; the show's producers determined the choice of song to be featured in the program. The single's promotional video was directed by Nigel Dick. The clip follows a cellist (portrayed by Rain Phoenix) experiencing a [...] "bad day" [...] {{on her way to}} an audition overseen by Buck, Mills, and Stipe. R.E.M. biographer David Buckley praised the narrative promo as one of the band's best. Though the song was a moderate hit, its success failed to stimulate sales of Up, which by 1999 had sold a relatively low three million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|... "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} as a [...] "gift" [...] from Stipe to his bandmates, to indulge their fondness of Pet Sounds. Commenting on the song's musical {{similarities}} {{to the work}} of the Beach Boys in his book Inside Classic Rock Tracks, Rikki Rooksby wrote that [...] "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful" [...] was [...] "a tribute to that sound, at once conveying something of R.E.M. and Brian Wilson. In other words, it's not so much like The Beach Boys that it's a pastiche, but sufficiently like them to be a musical homage." [...] He states that the song's use of an F chord with an A bass note in the verse follows the example of Brian Wilson's use of inversions on his band's Pet Sounds album, and that the cellos at the end heightens the section's resemblance to the Beach Boys' [...] "Good Vibrations".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to being its first tribute song, [...] "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful" [...] was also R.E.M.'s first straightforward love song. The lyrics reference leaving messages on a love interest's answering machine and what Rooksby terms [...] "knowing obsession". He states that the song is about [...] "the ennobling effect of love, yet is aware of its playful narcissism".|$|E
500|$|R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills {{stated that}} after he {{composed}} the piano part to [...] "At <b>My</b> <b>Most</b> Beautiful", he felt it sounded like music the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson would have written two decades prior. Once guitarist Peter Buck received the basic tracks of the song from Mills, he too found the music reminiscent of Wilson. Instead of avoiding the comparisons, the group instead opted to [...] " [...] toward it", in Mills' words.|$|E

500|$|I {{wanted the}} video {{to have the}} same rawness that both the melody and the lyrics of the song have because [...] "Dance for You" [...] is one of <b>my</b> <b>most</b> {{intimate}} songs. I wanted the video to have a classic feel; to be seductive but still keep the sense of mystery. When I write, when I perform, and when I make music videos, I don’t hold anything back. 'Dance for You' is about that same passion; to be free and unrestrained.|$|E

O'Reilly claims to have perfected the action of changing the spin from anticlockwise to clockwise without any discernible hand movement within a couple of days.
