50|$|SBMT BSU {{offers the}} first MBA program in Belarus. It was {{launched}} in 1998, and is aimed at training motivated individuals with work experience to improve their career possibilities. A prerequisite is no {{less than two years}} work experience after receiving a bachelor's degree. The MBA at SBMT BSU is noted for being a demanding and challenging program; with the majority of graduates saying: “If you have mastered this program you are a winner.” 30% of the students start this program based on the recommendations of previous graduates.In order to be admitted, applicants must submit an essay providing their reasons for studying in the program. Applicants must also pass serious exams, including a written test aimed at checking mathematical skills, and an exam in English (TOEFL) if applying for an English program, and a <b>motivational</b> <b>interview.</b> The <b>motivational</b> <b>interview</b> is given the most value when applying for the program.Since 2010, based on the existing English-language MBA program of the School of Business and Management of Technology BSU the first Belarusian English-language MBA program was created that would qualify for the international accreditation CEEMAN and AMBA.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{very often}} used in similar contexts, motivational therapy, motivational {{interviewing}} and motivational enhancement theory/therapy have their differences. Motivational interviewing (MI) is similar to motivational therapy {{in the sense that}} it attempts not to create change within an individual but give foundation and support to the change the individual finds within him or her self. As a treatment for individuals with all types of substance abuse disorders, <b>motivational</b> <b>interview</b> therapists focus on trying to erase any type of ambivalence the individual may have towards their abuse. Similar to MET, motivational interviewing finds 'change talk' very important and the clinician interacts with the patient through open-ended questions, affirmations, reflections and end-of-session summaries. There are three key elements that build the foundation of motivational interviewing; collaboration, evocation and autonomy. Evocation is expressed through the clinician's responsibility to [...] "draw out" [...] the opinions and commitment to change of the client, rather than suggesting or imposing ideas. The client and the therapist, through collaboration, work together to build a trusting relationship, as opposed to the therapist taking the expert or higher role between the two. While Motivational Therapy is a method to treat substance abuse, Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) is also a very common way to treat alcoholism or alcohol abuse. MET is very focused on the individual or patient taking responsibility for their abuse and speaking about the actions needed to evoke change in their life. Through this therapy, patients learn alternative routes to deal with such a huge change in their lifestyle. Similar to MT, therapists attempt throughout MET to evoke a feeling of optimism within patients, but unlike motivational therapy, therapists are very clear on their advice and suggestions for change. Without taking the back seat and just listening to their patients' thoughts, therapists of MET are more vocal in their feedback towards patient improvement. Like MT, there are five stages which set the stage for successful MET (in order, from beginning to end): Pre-contemplation, contemplation, determination, action, maintenance. If not permanently successful, there becomes a sixth stage to work through - relapse.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> is a {{collaborative}} conversational style intended to strengthen motivation to change. It {{has been shown}} to be effective in addressing many different lifestyle problems as well as in chronic disease management, and many disease prevention guidelines promote use of <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing.</b> The aim of the present study was twofold: to assess to what extent the primary care nurses in the study perform <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> according to the <b>Motivational</b> <b>Interviewing</b> Treatment Integrity Code and to investigate how the participating primary care nurses rated their own performance in <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing.</b> Method: The study was based on twelve primary care nurses' audio-recorded <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> sessions with patients (total 32 sessions). After each session, the nurses completed a questionnaire regarding their experience of their own performance in <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing.</b> The audio-recorded sessions were analyzed using <b>Motivational</b> <b>Interviewing</b> Integrity Code 3. 1. 1. Results: None of the nurses achieved beginning proficiency in all parts of any <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> sessions and two nurses did not achieve beginning proficiency in any parts or sessions. Making more complex than simple reflections was the specific verbal behavior/summary score that most nurses achieved. Beginning proficiency/competency in "percent open questions" was the summary score that fewest achieved. Conclusion: Primary care nurses did not achieve beginning proficiency/competency in all aspects of <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> in their recorded sessions with patients, where lifestyle change was discussed. This indicates a need for improvement and thus additional training, feedback and supervision in clinical practice with <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing.</b> Funding: University of Gavle in Sweden, STROKE-Riksforbundet (The Swedish Stroke Association) in Sweden, Erik, Karin och Gosta Selanders Foundation in Sweden </p...|$|R

40|$|Background - <b>Motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> {{has been}} {{recommended}} {{as an effective}} counselling intervention for weight management with overweight and obese individuals. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research {{for the use of}} <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> in weight management groups and research in the area often lacks sufficient 'treatment fidelity', failing to accurately report the consistency, style, content and competence of those delivering the intervention. The current study examined the efficacy of the Small Changes weight management programme comparing <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> in groups to treatment as usual. Methods - Those in the <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> group intervention received 12 sessions of 2 hours, which comprised 9 group and 3 one to one sessions over 12 months. The <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> group were treated in a <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> consistent manner throughout; for example, change talk was identified, evoked and strengthened via specific micro-skills such as open questions, affirmations and reflections. In the treatment as usual group, subjects also received 9 group and 3 one to one sessions over a 12 month period. The treatment as usual group were required to self-select a 'Small Change' at each meeting with the facilitator. All subjects were measured at five time points: baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, outcome measures included: weight, body mass index, body-fat percentage, waist to hip ratio, number of minutes of daily physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption and feelings of well-being. A treatment fidelity framework was applied to the <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> groups' intervention to ensure a consistent, reliable and reproducible approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reducing the {{prevalence}} of unhealthy lifestyle behaviour could positively influence health. Motivational interviewing (MI) is used to promote change in unhealthy lifestyle behaviour as part of primary or secondary prevention. Whether MI is actually applied as taught is unknown. Practice nurses' application of motivational interviewing in real-life primary care consultations was examined. Furthermore, we explored if (and to what extent) practice nurses adjust their motivational interviewing skills to primary versus secondary prevention. METHODS: Thirteen Dutch practice nurses, from four general practices, trained in motivational interviewing participated, 117 adult patients visiting the practice nurse participated, 117 practice nurse-patient consultations between June and December 2010 were videotaped. <b>Motivational</b> <b>interview</b> skills were rated by two observers using the Behaviour Change Counselling Index (BECCI). Data were analyzed using multilevel regression. RESULTS: Practice nurses use motivational interviewing techniques to some extent. Substantial variation was found between motivational interviewing items. No {{significant differences in the}} use of motivational interviewing between primary and secondary prevention was found. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interviewing skills are not easily applicable in routine practice. Health care providers who want to acquire <b>motivational</b> <b>interview</b> skills should follow booster sessions after the first training. The training could be strengthened by video-feedback and feedback based on participating observation. A possible explanation for the lack of differences between the two types of prevention consultations may be the gain to help patients in primary consultations by preventing complications equals the necessity to help the disease from aggravating in secondary prevention...|$|E

Therefore, it is unclear if the clinical method of <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> requires modification for the CR population, in which {{it could be argued}} that people are motivated and engaged. The purposes of this report are to describe processes in incorporating <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> in the CR setting and to discuss insights gained regarding the use of this intervention. METHODS: As part of a randomized controlled trial currently recruiting in the CR setting, CR patients allocated to the intervention group participate in two <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> sessions with a motivational interviewing-trained nurse. To ascertain treatment fidelity, this process review comprised three sources: (1) the extant literature on motivational interviewing; (2) reflections of the project team; and (3) data derived fro...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> is a {{promising}} method to increase treatment motivation {{for people with}} mild intellectual disability and challenging behaviour. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to identify how professionals could adapt <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> techniques for use with clients. Method We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews and focus groups with 26 clients, parents, and professionals. A general inductive approach led to the identification of multiple core themes. Results The authors recommend several modifications to accommodate <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> for use with clients: adapt to language level, adjust to cognitive abilities, and control for social desirability of responding. In addition, certain characteristics of professionals were also found to be critical for effective motivational interviewing: trustworthiness, engagement, acceptance, empathy, and honesty. Conclusions Concrete recommendations for the adaptation of the <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> techniques for use with people with mild intellectual disability and challenging behaviour are identified. Certain characteristics of professionals are also critical for maximising the treatment motivation of clients.

40|$|Condom use {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} preventive mechanisms available to combat sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancies, yet over 70 % of adolescents and young adults lack education on the proper use of condoms. Lack of education and confidence in using condoms contributes to a decrease in condom usage, resulting in increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancies. The purpose of Project Motivate was to determine if <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> significantly improves self-efficacy related to condom use among patients presenting for screening of sexually transmitted diseases. The project sought to determine if <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> is an effective intervention in promoting condom use self-efficacy. Project Motivate implemented awareness utilizing <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> (MI) as an intervention to promote condom use self-efficacy. The findings of Project Motivate suggested the potential benefits of integrating <b>motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> into clinical practice. <b>Motivational</b> <b>interviewing</b> highlights the promise of a useful, inexpensive clinical tool for health promotion and disease prevention...|$|R
