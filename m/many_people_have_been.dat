5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{important}} in the push to develop {{the game in the}} Cook Islands and raise the profile of the national netball team on the global stage. They include Anna Noovao, who was the captain of the 1992 New Zealand side, Margharet Matenga, who was the first Cook Islands player to play for New Zealand's national team, and Mamia, who was the secretary of the Cook Islands Netball Association for six years.

Elizabeth Tou was coach of the national team from 2005 to 2007. She represented the country as a player at Pacific Games, Commonwealth Games and the World Championships.|$|E

500|$|The {{scandal has}} {{affected}} numerous people and organizations associated with Goldschmidt. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accused of knowing of the crime, but failing to act accordingly. Debby Kennedy, {{who worked for}} Goldschmidt while he was governor, recalled, [...] "I just can't {{tell you how many}} rumors there were about him then." [...] Multnomah County Sheriff Bernie Giusto, who admitted knowing about the abuse, announced his early retirement in February 2008.|$|E

"The Franciscan Spanish {{fathers are}} {{explaining}} that the King of the Ambassador [...] will soon become the supreme ruler of his country, and that, not only will they become Christians and follow {{the will of the}} church of Rome, but they will also in turn convert the rest of the population. This is why they are requesting the dispatch of a high eclesiastic together with the missionaries. Because of this, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doubting the true purpose of the embassy, and are wondering if they are not looking for some other benefit."

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is the sort of person who would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming.

50|$|Recent Financial Services Authority {{guidelines}} to UK lenders regarding interest-only mortgages has tightened the criteria on new lending on an interest-only basis. The problem for <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the fact that}} no repayment vehicle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> implemented, or the vehicle itself (e.g. endowment/ISA policy) performed poorly and therefore insufficient funds were available to repay balance {{at the end of the}} term.|$|R

2500|$|Too <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spied upon by {{too many}} Government {{agencies}} {{and too much}} information has been illegally collected. The Government has often undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens {{on the basis of}} their political beliefs, even when those beliefs posed no threat of violence or illegal acts on behalf of a hostile foreign power. The Government, operating primarily through secret and biased informants, but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps, microphone [...] "bugs", surreptitious mail opening, and break-ins, has swept in vast amounts of information about the personal lives, views, and associations of American citizens. Investigations of groups deemed potentially dangerous—and even of groups suspected of associating with potentially dangerous organizations—have continued for decades, despite the fact that those groups did not engage in unlawful activity.|$|E

According to James Burnett, who headed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation team, [...] "I can't think of a recent accident where this <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> up and out of their seats and didn't make it out." [...] The captain {{was one of the few}} people who died of blunt force trauma, a blow to the head when the bulkhead collapsed as the aircraft collided with the firehouse.

2500|$|Tolkien always {{strongly}} {{held that}} The Lord of the Rings was not allegorical, particularly {{in reference to}} political events of his time such as World War II or the Cold War. At {{the same time he}} conceded [...] "applicability" [...] as being within the [...] "freedom" [...] of the reader, and indeed <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> inclined to view the One Ring as a symbol or metaphor. The notion of a power too great for humans to safely possess is an evocative one, and already in the 1930s there were technologies available to suggest the idea. By the time the work was published, though not when most of it was written, the existence of nuclear power and nuclear weapons were common knowledge, and the Ring was often taken as symbolic of them. The effect of the Ring and its physical and spiritual after-effects on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction; actor Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the film trilogy cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance.|$|E
2500|$|With the Mexican economy {{struggling}} due to {{the complications}} of trade with the United States, the job market has also taken a tremendous hit. This is what may be considered the main motivation behind Mexican immigration to the U.S. [...] Due to the failing economy in their home country, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> forced {{to leave their homes}} and look for work in the United States simply to support their families. [...] Since the United States is a major contributor to the economic problems and lack of jobs in Mexico, undocumented workers should not be viewed in such a negative light by American citizens. These workers have been forced out of their jobs {{due to the}} United States and its negative influence on the Mexican economy. [...] These immigrants really have no other choice but to come to America in search of jobs and a better life for their families. In a sense, these workers are only doing what is necessary based on the situation they have been put in by the United States.|$|E
50|$|On 16 April, renewed {{fighting}} {{was reported in}} Idlib city. This fighting came after the Syrian army in Idlib reportedly killed 26 civilians. Two days later, despite a ceasefire organized by the UN, the Syrian army shelled parts of the city, due to a continuing presence of opposition fighters in those areas. Activists in Idlib claimed that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed in the fighting, although the claims could not be independently verified.|$|R
