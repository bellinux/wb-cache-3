5000|$|Add cup {{of coconut}} milk and 2 {{cup of water}} in a <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> heat then add the palm sugar and ¼ {{teaspoon}} of salt, stir until dissolved.

Stir until sugar and salt are dissolved and remove from heat. Add the rice in cooked coconut sauce, stir the mixture and cover for 30 minutes.|$|R
60|$|Two kitchen chairs, and a round table, and an {{attenuated}} old poker and tongs were, however, gathered {{round the}} fire-place, as was a <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> a feeble sputtering fire. There {{was a bit}} of cheese and bread, and a tin candlestick on the table, and a little black porter in a pint-pot.|$|R

60|$|Nicholas shook hands, {{kissed his}} old pupils all round, intrusted a large parcel of toys to the {{guardianship}} of Morleena, {{bowed to the}} doctor and the married ladies, and inquired after Mrs Kenwigs in a tone of interest, which went to the very {{heart and soul of the}} nurse, who had come in to warm some mysterious compound, in a little <b>saucepan</b> <b>over</b> the fire.|$|R
50|$|A bread-like dish {{similar to}} the calentita. Sharing its Italian origins, it is a {{descendant}} of the Genoese dish with the same name. Unlike calentita the ingredients are first simmered in a <b>saucepan</b> for <b>over</b> an hour, stirring constantly, to form a paste which is then left to set. When the polenta-like dough is set, it is cut into small strips and fried in olive oil.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of a Megaera as {{you know}} that creature, sir, and impetuous! If {{everything}} is not handy, if that poor girl is not like clockwork with the sauces, and herbs, and things, if a <b>saucepan</b> boils <b>over,</b> or a ham falls into the fire, if the girl treads on the tail {{of one of the}} cats--and the woman keeps a dozen--then she flies at her with anything that comes handy.' ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Charley, I {{wonder what}} could have {{made me think of}} him in {{connection}} with heroes; his lovableness, I suppose--certainly not his heroic qualities. I can recall his boyish face now (it was always a boyish face), the tears streaming down it as he sat in the schoolyard beside a bucket, in which he was drowning three white mice and a tame rat. I sat down opposite and cried too, while helping him to hold a <b>saucepan</b> lid <b>over</b> the poor little creatures, and thus there sprang up a friendship between us, which grew.|$|R
60|$|The men's {{weapons were}} {{fastened}} round {{one of the}} poles {{to keep them from}} the damp night air. Ostik had at once set to work on landing, leaving the Houssas to pitch the tent. A fire was soon blazing and a kettle and <b>saucepans</b> suspended <b>over</b> it. Rice was served out to the men, with the addition of some salt meat, of which sufficient had been purchased from the captain of the brig to last throughout the journey in the canoe. The men were all in high spirits at this addition to their fare, which was more than had been bargained for, and their songs rose merrily round the fire in the night air.|$|R
50|$|Juan {{has lost}} Tanto so El Nombre helps him and Mama to find him, the bear {{from the first}} episode tries to boil a <b>saucepan</b> of water <b>over</b> a fire but its bottom is missing, a magician turns her volunteer's watch and keys into an alarm clock and one big key, and two burglars named Bob and Bert break into a sweet shop and eat all the sweets but grow too fat to escape through the window so they get caught by a {{policeman}} named PC Nabb; from this point onwards, El Nombre also returned to one sketch per episode (except for in Episodes 21 and 26).|$|R
60|$|Oh {{that you}} had been at Clarence Terrace on Nina's birthday! Good God, how we missed you, talked of you, drank your health, and {{wondered}} what you were doing! Perhaps you are Falkland enough (I swear I suspect you of it) to feel rather sore--just a little bit, you know, the merest trifle in the world--on hearing that Mrs. Macready looked brilliant, blooming, young, and handsome, and that she danced a country dance with the writer hereof (Acres to your Falkland) in a thorough spirit of becoming good humour and enjoyment. Now you don't like to be told that? Nor do you quite like to hear that Forster and I conjured bravely; that a plum-pudding was produced from an empty <b>saucepan,</b> held <b>over</b> a blazing fire kindled in Stanfield's hat without damage to the lining; that a box of bran was changed into a live guinea-pig, which ran between my godchild's feet, and {{was the cause of}} such a shrill uproar and clapping of hands that you might have heard it (and I daresay did) in America; that three half-crowns being taken from Major Burns and put into a tumbler-glass before his eyes, did then and there give jingling answers to the questions asked of them by me, and knew where you were and what you were doing, to the unspeakable admiration of the whole assembly. Neither do you quite like to be told {{that we are going to}} do it again next Saturday, with the addition of demoniacal dresses from the masquerade shop; nor that Mrs. Macready, for her gallant bearing always, and her best sort of best affection, is the best creature I know. Never mind; no man shall gag me, and those are my opinions.|$|R
6000|$|At certain intervals, the {{original}} wildness {{broke out in}} the natures of Brutus and Cassius. The modest comforts of home, the savory charms of made dishes, the decorous joy of digestions accomplished on hearth-rugs, lost all their attractions, and the dogs ungratefully left the house to seek dissipation and adventure in the outer world. On these occasions the established after-dinner formula of question and answer between old Mazey and his master varied a little in one particular. [...] "God bless the Queen, Mazey," [...] and [...] "How's the wind, Mazey?" [...] were followed by a new inquiry: [...] "Where are the dogs, Mazey?" [...] "Out on the loose, your honor, and be damned to 'em," [...] was the veteran's unvarying answer. The admiral always sighed and shook his head gravely at the news, as if Brutus and Cassius had been sons of his own, who treated him with a want of proper filial respect. In two or three days' time the dogs always returned, lean, dirty, and heartily ashamed of themselves. For the whole of the next day they were invariably tied up in disgrace. On the day after they were scrubbed clean, and were formally re-admitted to the dining-room. There, Civilization, acting through the subtle <b>medium</b> of the <b>Saucepan,</b> recovered its hold on them; and the admiral's two prodigal sons, when they saw the covers removed, watered at the mouth as copiously as ever.|$|R
