5|$|The Røros Line was {{connected}} to the station at Brattøra at 24 June 1884, allowing Marienborg to be us as a common <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot</b> for both lines. The Meråker Line's locomotives were then renumbered, starting at 51, to keep them distinguished from the Røros Line's. From the same year, the Meråker Line was assigned two Class 8 locomotives. From 1896, Class 15 locomotives were used, and two years later supplemented by the Class 17.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the station lies Arriva TrainCare's Barton Hill train <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot</b> that {{services}} Class 220/221 Voyagers for CrossCountry Class 66 locomotives for DB Schenker and during summer months steam locomotives operating the Torbay Express. To the south-east of the station lies St Philip's Marsh depot that services the Great Western Railway fleet. This is accessible from both ends of Temple Meads station.|$|E
5|$|While {{the power}} station was being built, the District {{electrified}} the Ealing to Harrow line {{that was not}} yet open. It was equipped with automatic signalling using track circuits and pneumatic semaphore signals, and trials were run with two seven car trains. In August 1903, an order was placed for 420 cars and a new <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot</b> was built west of Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town).|$|E

50|$|Road <b>maintenance</b> <b>depots</b> carry {{gear for}} a number of tasks, {{including}} road works, snow removal, planting of road verge and central reservations and storm drain <b>maintenance.</b> Most <b>depots</b> will have limited accommodation facilities for staff who are on-call, particularly during heavy winter storms, when travel between the worker's home and the depot may be restricted. Road <b>maintenance</b> <b>depots</b> also include garages and repair shops for the fleets of vehicles stored within, and large depots keep supplies of fuel and road salt for drivers.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track connection, tracks ST-1 and ST-2, {{is planned}} between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot.</b> The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 2010, Green Line (Line 5) is {{the fifth}} line of the Delhi Metro network and the first line on {{standard}} gauge, as opposed to previous broad gauge lines. It runs between Inderlok (station on the Red Line) and Mundka with a branch line connecting the line's Ashok Park Main station with Kirti Nagar station on the Blue Line. The completely elevated line, built {{as part of the}} Phase-II of Delhi Metro runs mostly along the busy NH 10 route in West Delhi. The line consists of 17 stations including an interchange station covering a total length of 18.46km. This line also has the country's first standard-gauge <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot</b> at Mundka.|$|E
5|$|The final island {{platform}} is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15: 15 {{is used by}} most trains from Paddington that continue westwards to Weston-super-Mare or beyond. Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from Paddington, some local services and occasionally by CrossCountry. There is another siding beyond platform 15 {{that used to be}} the In/Out Road for Bath Road Traction <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Depot.</b> This depot has been demolished. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up Through line and the Middle Siding, the latter is often used to stable Mark 1 carriages between Torbay Express duties in the summer months. The Down Through line runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.|$|E

5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar {{is on the left}} and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot</b> {{can be seen in the}} distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E
5|$|On 6November 1981, the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, {{presented}} the Queen's Colour to No.1 AD. By September {{the following year}} the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as electroplating, fibre optics, and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, Macchi MB-326 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet jets. From 1986, restructuring and outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services. In February 1990, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Logistics Command, formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components. By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and private contractors, and it was disbanded on 2December 1994. No.1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating <b>maintenance</b> <b>depot</b> of any air force.|$|E
