3000|$|Figure  1 (B) {{illustrates}} three link types for {{the case}} of a two layer network. Firstly, we define a <b>multiplex</b> <b>link</b> between two nodes i and j as a link that exists between them at least in two layers [...]...|$|E
30|$|Crucially, the {{abovementioned}} {{two types}} of links often occur together (depicted using the <b>multiplex</b> <b>link</b> in Fig.  1 c), as both ownership and board interlocks are instruments by which one firm can influence or exert power over the other. Indeed, also in our data, these {{two types of}} links often coincide, at numbers that are thousands of times higher than one would expect (see the “Corporate network data” section), calling for a multiplex network approach.|$|E
30|$|With {{respect to}} our {{multilayer}} configurations, {{we can see}} that user pairs in Figure  2 (C), where the global connectivity between the two services is considered, have a similar arrangement in terms of curves as the single-layer configurations. The main differences, however, come from the greater distinction between non-present links (na) and single-layer links (fo and to) than in the single network configurations where exogenous links and non-existent links had similar distribution. In particular, {{we can see that}} in Figure  2 (C) 50 % of user pairs which are not connected have an Adamic/Adar index of 10 − 4 or greater, whereas 50 % of single-layer links (fo and to) have 10 − 3 or higher and finally <b>multiplex</b> <b>link</b> pairs (tf) have an index of 10 − 3.5 or greater. On the other hand, in the core configuration in Figure  2 (D) we can see a division between <b>multiplex</b> <b>link</b> types and all other link types, where 25 % of all pairs of all multiplex ties (tf) have an index of approximately 101 or greater while all other link types have a lower threshold of 100 or higher. While this is somewhat expected, it shows that the core configuration is a good proxy for multiplex ties. In agreement with previous studies of tie strength [20], we observe that multiplex links share greater structural similarity than other link types across network configurations and this will be s useful property in our link prediction problem.|$|E
30|$|Finally, we can {{see that}} using {{multilayer}} and geo-social features which employ both spatial and social interactions from the two heterogeneous platforms can outperform both single layer sets in predicting <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> (highest AUC = 0.88 for Chicago). It is intuitive that when using information from both layers the prediction of <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> becomes easier and it is often the case that such multilayer network data is not available. However, we have also shown that we can achieve relatively good results using only social or only geographic information.|$|R
30|$|Our {{first goal}} is to gain insight into the geo-social {{structural}} and interaction properties of <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> in the multilayer social network and how they differ from other link types. We study {{the three types of}} links as described in our multilayer model above: <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> across both Twitter and Foursquare, which we denote as tf for simplicity; single-layer links on Foursquare only (denoted as fo); single-layer links on Twitter only (denoted as to), and compare these to unconnected pairs of users (denoted as na). We use the insight gained from the discriminative power of each feature to interpret the results of our link prediction tasks defined in the following section.|$|R
50|$|Multiplexing {{multiple}} telecommunications connections {{over the}} same physical conductor has been possible for a long time, but nonetheless each channel on the <b>multiplexed</b> <b>link</b> was either dedicated to one call at a time, or it was idle between calls.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} Foursquare spatial {{interaction}} in Figure  4 (C) and (D), multiplex ties (tf) {{have the highest}} probability of multiple colocations with a median value of 10 − 3.8. Despite being weighted by the popularity of a venue, values in the top quartile of unconnected pairs (na) are relatively high with respect to other link types. However, in terms of median values {{there is still a}} distinction between the different levels of multiplexity which each link type represents. On the other hand, while distance (Figure  4 (D)) does not vary much in terms of median values for the different link types, based on the top quartiles of the distributions across link types, it appears that Foursquare only pairs (fo) are more likely to frequent locations close to each other, closely followed by <b>multiplex</b> <b>link</b> pairs (tf) where distances for both are below 20  km. Twitter only (to) and unconnected pairs frequent locations similarly further away. This indicates that both Foursquare spatial features are better at distinguishing multiplex links and native Foursquare links than other link types based on the distributions observed.|$|E
30|$|In our {{particular}} case, a second challenge {{is the fact}} that the board interlock network is a product of the projection of the bipartite network linking firms and directors to a firm-by-firm network which links firms based on shared directors. As such, a relatively large number of cliques exists in the empirical network, effectively resulting from directors with three or more positions. Not explicitly modelling this phenomenon would simply result in all discovered motifs being clique-like. So to ensure that this particular aspect is preserved, the undirected interlock network is modeled at the bipartite level. For this, we again employ the stub-matching model (Bender and Canfield 1978). We encode the node type (firm or director) by enforcing that directors only have a particular outdegree value, and firms only a particular indegree value. The subsequent conversion to an undirected network is trivial, after which a regular projection to the one-mode firm-by-firm network can be made. It should be noted that in our case, the same bipartite projection step should be done for multiplex links, because part of a <b>multiplex</b> <b>link</b> is an interlock edge. Finally, the different networks for each of the 2 |J|− 1 link type combinations (three in our case) are combined into one multiplex network.|$|E
30|$|We have {{observed}} in our preceding analysis on link types that those pairs connected only on Foursquare do not exhibit strong interaction on Twitter by exchanging a {{low number of}} mentions and having low neighbourhood overlap, however, those pairs of users connected on both platforms, exhibit high interaction across. We can therefore expect that we have identified {{a large number of}} stronger multiplex ties in this task. In our second prediction task, we test this assumption by observing if we are able to achieve higher predictive power across cities when testing on {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>multiplex</b> <b>link.</b> Formally, given a feature vector x_ij, we would like to predict a target label y_ij∈{- 1,+ 1 }, where a link exists on both layers (+ 1) or not (− 1). In Figure  5 (C) and (D) we can observe that we are able to achieve greater predictive power using Twitter features in predicting multiplex links than Foursquare links in Figure  5 (A) and in using Foursquare features in Figure  5 (B), with the highest AUC scores of 0.82 and 0.84 for each set respectively. We also note that the Foursquare spatial features perform slightly better than the social interaction features for Twitter, which places importance on the discriminative power of spatial interactions as also observed in the first part of our analysis. This confirms our assumption that multiplex links are easier to identify than single layer links by using the same algorithmic set-up and shows that the strength of multiplex ties exhibited in the first part of our analysis can be used to predict links across networks.|$|E

50|$|Multipath TCP is {{particularly}} {{useful in the}} context of wireless networks - using both Wi-Fi and a mobile network is a typical use case. In addition to the gains in throughput from inverse <b>multiplexing,</b> <b>links</b> may be added or dropped as the user moves in or out of coverage without disrupting the end-to-end TCP connection. The problem of link handover is thus solved by abstraction in the transport layer, without any special mechanisms at the network or link level. Handover functionality can then be implemented at the endpoints without requiring special functionality in the subnetworks - in accordance to the Internet's end-to-end principle.|$|R
30|$|In Figure  4 (F) the {{distinction}} between different link types in the distributions of values is more striking than {{for any of the}} single-layer features. We can see that each median value is significantly different - <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> (tf) are the highest with a median of 101.5, followed by to links (100), fo links (10 − 1.5) and finally non-present links (10 − 4). This satisfies two desirable properties for link prediction - distinct thresholds between link types, and a discriminative threshold between the non-existent links (na) and all other link types, on which to base binary decisions of the presence/absence of a link.|$|R

40|$|Online {{social systems}} are {{multiplex}} in nature as multiple links may {{exist between the}} same two users across different social networks. In this work, we introduce a framework for studying links and interactions between users beyond the individual social network. Exploring the cross-section of two popular online platforms - Twitter and location-based social network Foursquare - we represent the two together as a composite multilayer online social network. Through this paradigm we study the interactions of pairs of users differentiating between those with links on one or both networks. We find that users with <b>multiplex</b> <b>links,</b> who are connected on both networks, interact more and have greater neighbourhood overlap on both platforms, in comparison with pairs who are connected on {{just one of the}} social networks. In particular, the most frequented locations of users are considerably closer, and similarity is considerably greater among <b>multiplex</b> <b>links.</b> We present a number of structural and interaction features, such as the multilayer Adamic/Adar coefficient, which are based on the extension of the concept of the node neighbourhood beyond the single network. Our evaluation, which aims to shed light on the implications of multiplexity for the link generation process, shows that multilayer features, constructed from properties across social networks, perform better than their single network counterparts in predicting links across networks. We propose that combining information from multiple networks in a multilayer configuration can provide new insights into user interactions on online social networks, and can significantly improve link prediction overall with valuable applications to social bootstrapping and friend recommendations...|$|R

30|$|In Figure  4 (E) and (F) we {{can compare}} the geo-social {{features}} we defined above to the single-layer social and geographic features observed. Firstly, we observe {{the distribution of}} the sim_GNij measure integrating similarity and distance as factors of attraction between pairs of users. We can distinguish between link types mainly based on the maximum value in the top quartile of the distributions in Figure  4 (E), where we observe that the maximum values for <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> are higher than any other link type (over 7.5), whereas the maximum value for unconnected pairs is approximately 4 while the median is 0. This shows that only values with low similarity and high distance fall below 0, whereas most pairs of users have less negligible similarity where values around 1 indicate a balance between distance and similarity.|$|R
30|$|Media multiplexity is {{fascinating}} {{from the social}} networks perspective as it can reveal the strength and nature of a social tie given the full communication profile of people across all media they use [4].

Nevertheless, we have observed some evidence of media multiplexity manifested in the greater intensity and structural overlap of <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> and have gained insight into how we can utilise these properties for link prediction. Certainly, considering more OSNs and further relating media multiplexity to its offline manifestation {{is one of our}} future goals, and we believe that with the further integration of social media services and availability of data this will be possible in the near future.|$|R

The study {{is presented in the}} context of creating an all-analogue real-time multigigabit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing electro-optical transceiver for short range and high-capacity data center networks. Passive microwave filters are used to perform the pulse shaping of the bit streams, allowing an orthogonal transmission without the necessity of digital signal processing (DSP). Accordingly, a cyclic prefix that would cause a reduction in the net data rate is not required. An experiment consisting of three orthogonally spaced 2. 7 Gbaud quadrature phase shift keyed subchannels demonstrates that the spectral efficiency of traditional DSP-less subcarrier <b>multiplexed</b> <b>links</b> can be potentially doubled.

On the other hand, mentions are just as common between users who are not connected on any network (na) as between those who are connected on both(tf), which may be as a result of mentioning celebrities and other commercial accounts. This, however, is not the case for hashtags (Figure  4 (B)), where we find that almost all of unconnected users share 10 hashtags or less with the exception of outliers. While mentions are more discriminative between <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> (tf) and single-layer connectivity (to and fo), hashtags are better at distinguishing between links and non-links (na) in terms of median values.|$|R

In Figure  2 (A) {{we can see that}} 25 % of Twitter user pairs (to) have an overlap of 100.3 or greater, while 25 % of multiplex tie pairs (tf) have 101 or higher. Those pairs that are not connected (na) and those which are only connected on Foursquare (fo) have a similarly lower Adamic/Adar threshold of 100. The results over different fractions of user pairs remain consistent where multiplex tie pairs (tf) always have a higher Adamic/Adar index threshold than Twitter only (to), Foursquare only (fo) and no link (na) pairs, based on the CCDF curves. These results are analogous for the Foursquare network, where we have an Adamic/Adar index of approximately 101 for 25 % of multiplex pairs, closely followed by Foursquare only (fo) pairs and then Twitter only (to) and na user pairs with a value of 100. From the two single layer configurations, we can see that <b>multiplex</b> <b>links</b> always exhibit the highest structural similarity, followed by links native to the platform and then exogenous and finally unconnected user pairs.|$|R

We analyze the OAM mode purity and the bit-error-rate performance of a classical two-mode OAM <b>multiplexed</b> <b>link</b> for the case of division and multiplication of the OAM state order. The experimental mode purity for halving and doubling OAM state order can reach around 87 % and 40 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The Internet traffic {{consists}} of an increasing amount of soft real-time flows, which can tolerate very small delay variation and losses. Allowing probabilistic Quality of Service (QoS) violation for these flows can greatly help to improve resource utilization. However, this improvement depends on the statistical properties of competing independent flows and the resources (capacity and buffer) of the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>link.</b> The notion of effective bandwidth summarizes the statistical properties and the QoS requirements of the flow. Similarly, the time varying resource availability to the arrival process at the link can be summarized using the notion of effective capacity. This paper expresses the QoS measures at the link in terms of effective capacity using the large deviations theory. Further, it applies the general formulation of effective bandwidth and effective capacity {{within the framework of}} the statistical network calculus for an efficient per-hop analysis of the feed-forward network with finite number of independent sources. This new approach enables efficient utilization of statistical multiplexing of independent flows both at the ingress of the network and along the path of the flow.

30|$|A final {{observation}} {{with respect}} to the motifs of size 3 is made with regards to node pairs (which could also be seen as subgraphs of size 2, for which we logically did not perform explicit enumeration). Indeed, any insight from such subgraph patterns would simply be about links and the frequency of <b>multiplex</b> <b>links,</b> not resulting in significant motifs as we fixed the coincidence of link types in the null model. However, in some of the motifs we do observe a reciprocated ownership link between a pair of nodes as part of larger ownership motifs of size 3. We acknowledge that this observation could also be made from comparing the global metric of link reciprocity (percentage of symmetric links) between the random graphs and the empirical network. Yet, it is an interesting finding as it demonstrates the existence of so-called crossholdings. A crossholding indicates a mutual investment of two firms, so a firm invests in a firm that is also its shareholder. Such structures are typically related to an institutional preference for more direct forms of economic coordination (Soskice and Hall 2001), a common phenomenon in Germany (Adams 1999).|$|R
