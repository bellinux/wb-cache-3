5000|$|A Volume {{table is}} a chart {{to aid in the}} {{estimation}} of standing timber volume. These tables are based on volume equations and use correlations between certain aspects of a tree to estimate the volume to a degree of certainty. The diameter at breast height (DBH) and the <b>merchantable</b> <b>height</b> are used to determine the total volume. Difficulties occur when estimating the form class of the tree in question. The Mesavage and Girard form classes used to classify the trees to decide which volume table should be used. These volume tables are also based on different log rules such a Scribner, Doyle, and International ¼” scale. In order to be effective, the proper form class must be selected as well as accurate DBH and height measurements.|$|E

One potential use for the Eschweilera genus is in forest management, where just a few trees are removed per hectare. In order to improve the forest management in the Amazon, this study assessed two critical issues: volume equations fitted for a single genus {{and the development of}} a non-destructive method using climbing techniques. The equipment used to measure the sample trees included: climbing rope, ascenders, descenders, and carabiners. To carry out the objectives of this study, 64 trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm were selected and measured in ZF- 2 Tropical Forestry Station near the city of Manaus, Brazil. Four single input models with DBH and four dual input models with DBH and <b>merchantable</b> <b>height</b> (H) were tested. The Husch model (V = a × DBHb) presented the best performance (R 2 = 0. 97). This model does not require the <b>merchantable</b> <b>height,</b> which is an important advantage, because of the difficulty in measuring this variable in tropical forests. When the <b>merchantable</b> <b>height</b> data are collected using accurate methods, the Schumacher and Hall model (V = a × DBHb × Hc) is the most appropriated.

Outputs from five carbon (C) pools were considered: <b>merchantable</b> stemwood (stump <b>height</b> of 30 cm, minimum DBH of 9 cm and a minimum top diameter of 7 cm), deadwood, soil C, total ecosystem C and cumulative total ecosystem C emissions. Yield curves strongly affected the predicted size of all five pools. Longer rotation lengths led to larger pools with the relative differences between rotation lengths varying with stand types. Pools associated with poplar were usually the largest while those of jack pine on shallow sites were generally the smallest. When compared to the starting point of the simulations, cumulative total ecosystem C and C emissions increased with the 100 - and 250 -year harvest rotations (HARV 100 and HARV 250, respectively) and declined with the 50 -year harvest rotation (HARV 50). Fire disturbances resulted in stable pools of cumulative ecosystem C and declines in C emissions. CBM-CFS 3 provided realistic pool values but the authors suggest further development of the model depiction of ecosystem processes, especially with respect to the treatment of respiration.

The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a set of models that will allow the {{determination}} of volume for Tectona grandis trees and stands grown in plantation form in Tanzania. As a secondary objective, models describing tree and dominant stand height were developed. Total volume and volume ratio models were fitted that respectively predict total tree volume and merchantable volume. In order to allow the calculation of volume for different product classes and dimensions, taper models were fitted. All the data were collected by non-destructive sampling methods using a Barr and Stroud optical dendrometer. This proved to be an accurate and inexpensive method of collecting data for developing volume and taper models. Sampling stratification was based on age and site quality and as wide a range as possible was covered to ensure adequate representation of all growing sites and ages present in Tanzanian teak plantations. A total of 2617 individual observations were made from 222 trees at three teak plantations. Several models were selected from the literature to describe teak volume and shape. Results indicated that the Schumacher and Hall (1933) volume equation best describes total volume over and underbark to a fixed upper limit of 7. 5 cm. Merchantable volume to upper stem diameter and height limits were best described by respectively the Burkhart (1977) volume ratio model and the Cao and Burkhart (1980) modification thereof. Many of the fitted taper models were unable to adequately describe stem shape over the whole stem, mainly due to the large range in tree sizes and ages used in model fitting. The variable form taper model by Perez, Burkhart and Stiff (1990) provided the best results according to various criteria and is recommended for predicting teak underbark diameters to various heights and, if only a single model is required, the <b>merchantable</b> volume. Top <b>height</b> growth of teak stands was adequately described by the generalized Schumacher (1939) model with the value of the exponent k estimated from the sample data. From this a series of anamorphic site index curves were developed.

The points were 0.15, 0.7, 1.4 (breast height) and 3  m above the ground and thereafter every 3  m {{up to the point}} where the remaining distance to the tip was less than 3  m. Diameter measurements were taken on felled trees. Total aboveground outside bark volume was calculated for each tree by applying Smalian’s formula to each of the bolt sections between stump height and the last diameter measurement point up in the stem, then applying volume of a cylinder formula to the stump (because groundline diameters were not measured) and volume of a cone formula to the tip portion and, lastly, summing up the bolt volumes. Merchantable volume to 14 -cm outside bark top diameter (pulpwood top diameter limit) and to 22 -cm outside bark top diameter (sawtimber top diameter limit) were calculated for trees that had an above-stump <b>merchantable</b> <b>height</b> of at least 3.8  m by applying Smalian’s formula to each of the bolt sections between stump height and the top diameter limit and then summing up the bolt volumes.

Although there are many studies on the total tree volume estimation from allometric models, these allometric models cannot predict tree- and stand-level merchantable volume at any <b>merchantable</b> <b>height,</b> and the stand-level merchantable volume model was not seen yet in Chinese fir plantations. This study aimed to develop (1) a compatible taper function for tree-level merchantable volume estimation, and (2) a stand-level merchantable volume model for Chinese fir plantations.

However, the industry requires improved knowledge of the physical and mechanical properties of these species and how this information can be applied to end use attributes in value added forest products. Black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) is abundant throughout the region, yet has been identified as an underutilized species with limited available literature on properties or potential variations. Nine mature black ash trees from the Thunder Bay Seed Zone were destructively sampled and wood properties in differing radial and longitudinal positions were measured and recorded. Longitudinal positions reflect 0, 25, 50 and 75 percent of total <b>merchantable</b> <b>height.</b> Radial positions reflect the juvenile wood core, transition zone and mature wood of each stem. Measured wood properties include MOE, MOR, compression parallel to the grain, Janka ball side hardness, relative density, ring width, latewood percentage and average ring density. Results indicate stable and predictable wood properties in the radial direction with only percentage of latewood varying significantly radially. Longitudinal position reflected increased variance with MOE, compression parallel to the grain, side hardness and ring width displaying significant results. The greatest level of variability was observed between sites in each of the selected properties. Results consistently displayed two subsets of sites; reflecting the second and third sites, or three distinct sites.

The study area was located near Chapleau, Ontario in a fire-originated jack pine stand. The stand was treated at age 45 with 336 kg urea-N/ha and a low thinning of 20 percent basal area in a 2 X 2 factorial design with four replicates. At stand age 55, 80 trees were felled for stem analysis, representing 5 tree diameter classes within each stand treatment. Volume increment, height increment, measures of form, and local volume equations were determined from the stem analysis data. The local volume equations were applied to diameter frequency distributions at stand ages 45, 50, and 55 to calculate stand volumes at these ages. A growth model was developed to characterize the annual volume growth of individual trees. The model related the annual volume growth of an individual tree to its volume, and the stand volume. Aggregation of the annual volume increments of individual trees allowed annual stand volume increments to be estimated. Individual trees responded to fertilization with greater 10 -year volume increment and <b>merchantable</b> <b>height</b> increment. On a stand basis, fertilization resulted in about 20 m[superscript 3] ha[superscript 2] of additional gross volume growth during the ten-year response period, This volume growth response was greatest {{in the third and}} fourth years after fertilization. Fertilization appeared to have both a direct effect and an indirect effect. Tlie direct effect was growth response to the improved nitrogen status, and this effect ceased 10 years after treatment.

Sudan has a wide variation of climatic zones, thus; great variations are expected in the anatomical and physical properties between and within species grown in each zone. This variation needs to be fully explored in order to suggest best uses for the species. The present study was carried out to assess the suitability of Acacia seyal var. seyal Del and Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Delile wood for pulp and paper making (PPM) and flooring industry, {{as well as to}} investigate the effect of rainfall zones on selected wood properties. For this purpose, a total of thirty trees per species were collected from four states in Sudan, namely: Blue Nile, North Kordofan, South Kordofan and White Nile. The study areas located in two precipitation zones. Zone one with 273 mm mean annual rainfall, and zone two with 701 mm mean annual rainfall. Wood samples in form of disc were obtained from two heights within each tree, which are 10 % and 90 % from the tree <b>merchantable</b> <b>height.</b> Anatomical, physical and mechanical investigations were conducted in order to test the wood properties of the study species. The studied anatomical properties were: fibre and vessel diameter, lumen diameter and wall thickness. In addition to fibre length and three fibre derived values, namely: flexibility coefficient, Runkel ratio and slenderness ratio. The trend of fiber length from pith to bark was determined. The anatomical composition was described. Wood density was investigated as a main physical property. Basic density as well as air dry density were measured in the current study. Additionally, the density was measured using X-ray densitometry method in order to assess its suitability as a valid tool for the study species density determination. The trend of wood basic density from pith to bark was also determined. Brinell hardness strength was measured in the transverse and radial sections. According to the study results, the fibre length of both species considered as medium (900 - 1600 μm). However, Acacia seyal has longer fiber. Acacia seyal wood density considered heavy (≥ 720 kg/m³) while that of Balanites aegyptiaca is medium (500 - < 720 kg/m³). Depending upon the mean values of hardness strength in transverse as well as radial sections, the wood of both species can be classified as very hard (up to 146 N/mm 2 hardness strength). Fibre length and wood density for both species followed the increase trend from the pith to the bark. The X-ray densitometry technique is considered as a valid tool for wood density determination for both species. For each species, some wood properties (in mature wood) were significantly affected by the water stress in the drier zone. For instance, Acacia seyal fibre length was negatively affected, while vessel wall thickness, basic density as well as hardness strength of the radial section were positively affected. In case of Balanites aegyptiaca the following properties were affected: vessel dimensions (negatively) and basic density (positively). However, the water stress did not affect Acacia seyal fibre and vessel diameter and lumen diameter, fiber wall thickness, flexibility coefficient, Runkel ratio and hardness strength in transverse section. Balanites aegyptiaca fibre characteristics and hardness strength did not show any response to water stress as well. In general, the overall wood properties of the study species considered compatible for PPM and flooring industry. However, trees growing in the more humid zone are preferable for both industries, due to their lower wood density and longer fibres in case of Acacia seyal and lower density in case of Balanites aegyptiaca...|$|E
