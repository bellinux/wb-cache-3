Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, {{which have a}} proboscis but no stylet, and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase <b>may</b> <b>make</b> up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E

5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature <b>may</b> <b>make</b> laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime <b>may</b> <b>make</b> the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females <b>may</b> <b>make</b> a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E

5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, <b>may</b> <b>make</b> them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females <b>may</b> <b>make</b> purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This <b>may</b> <b>make</b> the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E

5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon <b>may</b> <b>make</b> as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament <b>may</b> <b>make</b> some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court <b>may</b> <b>make</b> a declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also {{may not make}} an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E

5|$|In some archaea, the {{lipid bilayer}} is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse the tails of two phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion <b>may</b> <b>make</b> their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} <b>may</b> <b>make</b> vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or in small groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies <b>may</b> <b>make</b> their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E

5|$|Medicinal plants demand {{intensive}} management. Different species each require {{their own}} distinct conditions of cultivation. The World Health Organization recommends {{the use of}} rotation to minimise problems with pests and plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or <b>may</b> <b>make</b> use of conservation agriculture practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with no-till farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E
5|$|Most {{populations are}} sedentary, apart from some post-breeding {{dispersal}} of young birds, {{and there is}} a reluctance to cross even short stretches of open water. Northern and eastern breeders are dependent on the cones of the Siberian stone pine, and if the crop fails many birds of the S.e.asiatica subspecies may move west into northern Sweden and Finland in autumn, sometimes staying to breed. Siberian S.e.arctica <b>may</b> <b>make</b> more limited movements south and east in winter, and S.e.amurensis, from southeast Russia, is regular in winter in Korea.|$|E
