40|$|In 1997, a community-wide {{outbreak}} of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) infection occurred in France. The investigation included case searching and a case-control study. A case {{was defined as}} a resident of the Jura district with fever or diarrhoea between 12 May and 8 July 1997, from whom S. typhimurium was isolated in stool or blood. One hundred and thirteen cases were identified. Thirty-three (83 %) of 40 cases but only 23 (55 %) of 42 community controls, matched for age and area of residence, reported eating <b>Morbier</b> <b>cheese</b> (Odds ratio: 6. 5; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 4 - 28. 8). <b>Morbier</b> <b>cheese</b> samples taken from the refrigerators of two case-patients and one symptom-free neighbour cultured positive for S. typhimurium of the same phage type as the human isolates. The analysis of distribution channels incriminated one batch from a single processing plant. These findings show that an unpasteurized soft cheese is an effective vehicle of S. typhimurium transmission...|$|E
50|$|Humboldt Fog is a mold-ripened {{cheese with}} a central line of edible white ash much like <b>Morbier.</b> The <b>cheese</b> ripens {{starting}} with the bloomy mold exterior, resulting in a core of fresh goat cheese surrounded by a runny shell. As the cheese matures, more of the originally crumbly core is converted to a soft-ripened texture. The bloomy mold and ash rind are edible but fairly tasteless. The cheese is creamy, light, and mildly acidic with a stronger flavor near the rind.|$|R
