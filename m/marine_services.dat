25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} steampowered {{vessels in the}} world's merchant <b>marine</b> <b>services</b> {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor (and, by extension, crimping) greatly diminished. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|E
25|$|Jerold Kaplan of Walt Disney Imagineering {{designed}} and engineered the Earth Globe and supporting barge. The detailed engineering for the barge and its propulsion and control systems {{were provided by}} Glowacki Engineering of Orange Park, FL. The Earth Globe Barge was built by Sun State <b>Marine</b> <b>Services</b> in Green Cove Springs, FL and was delivered in four major components which were assembled on site. The LED video display {{is run by a}} Pentium II server running Microsoft Windows 95/8 using a Serial ATA drive. There are two servers constantly running the same programs at the same time for fail-safe support. If one goes down, they can instantly switch to the other server which presumably will still be running. The video control software, written by Derek Brown for Hitech Electronic Displays of Clearwater, Florida, communicates with on-board PLCs using two interfaces. The serial interface is used to receive the 4 character command codes separated by spaces to signify the end of each command. The NIDAQ (National Instrument Data Acquisition) card is used to provide status back to the PLCs. There are 8 optically isolated status channels. One channel is used to provide a heartbeat signal to tell the PLC that the software is on and functioning. The file formats are uncompressed AVIs passed through a masking filter to put the pixels in the spots for the countries.|$|E

2500|$|Pier 66 is the {{official}} designation for the Port of Seattle's Bell Street Pier and Bell Harbor complex, which replaced historic Piers 64, 65, and 66 in the mid-1990s. Facilities at the Bell Street facility include a marina, a cruise ship terminal, a conference center, the Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center, restaurants, and <b>marine</b> <b>services.</b> A pedestrian elevator and overpass at Bell Street connects it to the upland World Trade Center (another Port of Seattle property), {{as well as to}} a parking lot and to Belltown in general. The area once was a shantytown. Cleared around 1903 in conjunction with the regrading of Denny Hill, it became home to the Pacific Coast Company's Orient Dock, which ran parallel to the shoreline rather than at the usual northeast-southwest angle. The southern portion of that dock was sometimes referred to as Pier D. By the 1920s, the Orient Dock was replaced by two [...] "finger piers" [...] running at the usual angles. These Lenora Street Piers (Piers 64 and 65) were used by the [...] "Princess Ships" [...] of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Leslie Salt Co. The Port of Seattle's original Bell Street Pier, the previous Pier 66, was built here in 1914 on dirt from the Denny Regrade. Despite the Thomson/Cotterill plan, the Orient Dock and both the old and new Bell Street Pier were built parallel to the shore. There was a bridge {{on the site of the}} present-day pedestrian overpass.|$|E
