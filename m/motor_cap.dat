60|$|Dick, {{who had an}} {{objection}} to walking when {{it was possible to}} drive, set out with Mrs. Crowley in a trap. Alec waited for Lucy. She went round to the stable to fetch a dog to accompany them, and, as she came towards him, he looked at her. Alec was a man to whom most of his fellows were abstractions. He saw them and talked to them, noting their peculiarities, but they were seldom living persons to him. They were shadows, as it were, that had to be reckoned with, but they never became part of himself. And it came upon him now with a certain shock of surprise to notice Lucy. He felt suddenly a new interest in her. He seemed to see her for the first time, and her rare beauty strangely moved him. In her serge dress and her gauntlets, with a <b>motor</b> <b>cap</b> and a flowing veil, a stick in her hand, she seemed on a sudden to express the country through which for {{the last two or three}} days he had wandered. He felt an unexpected pleasure in her slim erectness and in her buoyant step. There was something very charming in her blue eyes.|$|E

40|$|In most {{analytical}} investigations, {{there is}} a need to process complex field samples for the unique detection of analytes, especially when detecting low concentration organic molecules that may identify extraterrestrial life. Wet chemistry based instruments are the techniques of choice for most laboratory- based analysis of organic molecules due to several factors including less fragmentation of fragile biomarkers, and ability to concentrate target species resulting in much lower limits of detection. Development of an automated wet chemistry preparation system that can operate autonomously on Earth and is also designed to operate under Martian ambient conditions will demonstrate the technical feasibility of including wet chemistry on future missions. An Automated Sample Processing System (ASPS) has recently been developed that receives fines, extracts organics through solvent extraction, processes the extract by removing non-organic soluble species, and delivers sample to multiple instruments for analysis (including for non-organic soluble species). The key to this system is a sample cell that can autonomously function under field conditions. As a result, a self-sealing sample cell was developed that can autonomously hermetically seal fines and powder into a container, regardless of orientation of the apparatus. The cap is designed with a beveled edge, which allows the cap to be self-righted as the <b>capping</b> <b>motor</b> engages.

40|$|Insulinoma-associated 1 a (insm 1 a) is a zinc-finger {{transcription}} factor playing {{a series of}} functions in cell formation and differentiation of vertebrate central and peripheral nervous systems and neuroendocrine system. However, its roles {{on the development of}} motor neuron have still remained uncovered. Here, we provided evidences that insm 1 a was a vital regulator of motor neuron development, and provided a mechanistic understanding of how it contributes to this process. Firstly, we showed the localization of insm 1 a in spinal cord, and primary motor neurons (PMNs) of zebrafish embryos by in situ hybridization, and imaging analysis of transgenic reporter line Tg(insm 1 a: mCherry) ntu 805. Then we demonstrated that the deficiency of insm 1 a in zebrafish larvae lead to the defects of PMNs development, including the reduction of caudal primary <b>motor</b> neurons (<b>CaP),</b> and middle primary motor neurons (MiP), the excessive branching of motor axons, and the disorganized distance between adjacent CaPs. Additionally, knockout of insm 1 impaired motor neuron differentiation in the spinal cord. Locomotion analysis showed that swimming activity was significantly reduced in the insm 1 a-null zebrafish. Furthermore, we showed that the insm 1 a loss of function significantly decreased the transcript levels of both olig 2 and nkx 6. 1. Microinjection of olig 2 and nkx 6. 1 mRNA rescued the motor neuron defects in insm 1 a deficient embryos. Taken together, these data indicated that insm 1 a regulated the motor neuron development, at least in part, through modulation of the expressions of olig 2 and nkx 6. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} zebrafish orthologues of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the ligand-binding component of its receptor GFRα 1. We examined the mRNA expression pattern of these {{genes in the}} developing spinal cord primary motor neurons (PMN), kidney, and enteric nervous systems (ENS) and {{have identified}} areas of correlated expression of the ligand and the receptor that suggest functional significance. Many aspects of zebrafish GDNF expression appear conserved with those reported in mouse, rat, and avian systems. In the zebrafish PMN, GFRα 1 is only expressed in the <b>CaP</b> <b>motor</b> neuron while GDNF is expressed in the ventral somitic muscle that it innervates. To test the functional significance of this correlated expression pattern, we ectopically overexpressed GDNF in somitic muscle {{during the period of}} motor axon outgrowth and found specific perturbations in the pattern of CaP axon growth. We also depleted GDNF protein in zebrafish embryos using morpholino antisense oligos and found that GDNF protein is critical {{for the development of the}} zebrafish ENS but appears dispensable for the development of the kidney and PMN...|$|R
40|$|AbstractZebrafish primary motor axons extend along stereotyped {{pathways}} innervating distinct {{regions of}} the developing myotome. During development, these axons make stereotyped projections to ventral and dorsal myotome regions. Caudal primary motoneurons, CaPs, pioneer axon outgrowth along ventral myotomes; whereas, middle primary motoneurons, MiPs, extend axons along dorsal myotomes. Although the development and axon outgrowth of these motoneurons has been characterized, cues that determine whether axons will grow dorsally or ventrally have not been identified. The topped mutant was previously isolated in a genetic screen designed to uncover mutations that disrupt primary <b>motor</b> axon guidance. <b>CaP</b> axons in topped mutants fail to enter the ventral myotome at the proper time, stalling at the nascent horizontal myoseptum, which demarcates dorsal from ventral axial muscle. Later developing secondary motor nerves are also delayed in entering the ventral myotome whereas all other axons examined, including dorsally projecting MiP motor axons, are unaffected in topped mutants. Genetic mosaic analysis indicates that Topped function is non-cell autonomous for motoneurons, and when wild-type cells are transplanted into topped mutant embryos, ventromedial fast muscle are the only cell type able to rescue the CaP axon defect. These data suggest that Topped functions in the ventromedial fast muscle and is essential for motor axon outgrowth into the ventral myotome...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{behaviors}} are generated by well-coordinated activation of neural circuits. In zebrafish, embryos start to show spontaneous muscle contractions at 17 to 19 h postfertilization. To visualize how motor circuits in {{the spinal cord}} are activated during this behavior, we developed GCaMP-HS (GCaMP-hyper sensitive), an improved version of the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP, and created transgenic zebrafish carrying the GCaMP-HS gene downstream of the Gal 4 -recognition sequence, UAS (upstream activation sequence). Then we performed a gene-trap screen and identified the SAIGFF 213 A transgenic fish that expressed Gal 4 FF, {{a modified version of}} Gal 4, in a subset of spinal neurons including the caudal primary (<b>CaP)</b> <b>motor</b> neurons. We conducted calcium imaging using the SAIGFF 213 A; UAS:GCaMP-HS double transgenic embryos during the spontaneous contractions. We demonstrated periodic and synchronized activation of a set of ipsilateral motor neurons located on the right and left trunk in accordance with actual muscle movements. The synchronized activation of contralateral motor neurons occurred alternately with a regular interval. Furthermore, a detailed analysis revealed rostral-to-caudal propagation of activation of the ipsilateral motor neuron, which is similar to but much slower than the rostrocaudal delay observed during swimming in later stages. Our study thus demonstrated coordinated activities of the motor neurons during the first behavior in a vertebrate. We propose the GCaMP technology combined with the Gal 4 FF-UAS system is a powerful tool to study functional neural circuits in zebrafish...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} appropriate muscle control, individual motor axons are guided to the appropriate target region and branch, enabling synapse formation at muscles. In this thesis I analyze the function of two zebrafish genes, plexin A 3 and turnout, in guiding axons to the correct region of the myotome and establishing the appropriate branch morphology. turnout mutants were identified in an forward genetic screen based on axon branching defects. I have mapped the turnout mutation to a 200 Kb interval of chromosome 24 and will present ongoing efforts to identify the gene mutated at the turnout locus. Closer investigation of the turnout mutant revealed that turnout function is required to control the guidance and branching of all classes of primary motor neurons, and is required non-cell autonomously for this function. ^ Motor axon branching is initially absent in wild-type CaP axons during the ventral migration out of the spinal cord and through the myotome. Later in development branching occurs, first by bifurcation and followed by collateral branching along the distal axon shaft. Time-lapse microscopy of plexin A 3 and turnout <b>CaP</b> <b>motor</b> axons in live zebrafish demonstrates that while these genes are dispensable for controlling {{the total number of}} axon branches and the timing and location of CaP axon bifurcation, they are necessary to control collateral axon branch formation both temporally and spatially, demonstrating a specific role in controlling collateral branch morphogenesis. ^ Analyzing protrusions dynamics along the axon shaft during early motor axon guidance revealed that while both turnout and plexin A 3 are dispensable for determining the location of protrusions, they are necessary for determining their formation rate and stability. Mutant axons extend fewer short-term protrusions, but are more likely to stabilize protrusions into permanent branches, indicating a dual role for plexin A 3 and turnout in encouraging the formation of short-term protrusions while suppressing branch stabilization. These findings suggest a general mechanism by which an extrinsic signal, turnout, and an intrinsic signal, plexin A 3, specifically shape motor axon branch morphology by controlling collateral axon branch location and timing by destabilizing axon protrusions during axon outgrowth. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} neuromuscular {{system is}} an elegant model to study neural development. To reveal a specific programme for zebrafish motor axon pathfinding I established {{a method to}} selectively block motor axon pathfinding by interfering with LIM domain transcription factor signaling. LIM homeodomain proteins (LIM-HDs) are an important class of transcriptional regulators and involved in neural development as well as neuron fate decision in vertebrates. DD domain dimerization of CLIM (cofactor of LIM-HDs) can activate LIM-HDs and downstream gene transcription while over-expression of dominant-negative CLIM (DN-CLIM), which lacks the DD domain, blocks LIM-HD activity. Motor neurons fluoresce in HB 9 :GFP transgenic zebrafish as the promoter of the motor neuron specific gene Hb 9 drives expression of GFP. Motor axons in DN-CLIM injected HB 9 :GFP zebrafish are unable to exit the spinal cord, instead they grow inside the spinal cord. Thus axon pathfinding, but not general growth appears to be impaired in these neurons. This provides an excellent research model to find genes involved in motor axon pathfinding downstream of LIM-HDs. Gene array expression profiling was carried out on GFP+ motor neurons by fluorescence-activated flow sorting (FACS) with and without prior injection of DN-CLIM mRNA to elucidate the potential genes relevant to motor axon pathfinding. Genes that were most strongly down-regulated in DN-CLIM injected embryos were considered {{to belong to a}} motor axon specific guidance programme. Calca, tac- 1 and chodl genes, retrieved from the gene array data, showed specific expression pattern in motor neuron and obvious down-regulation after DN-CLIM injection by in situ hybridization. This validated the array results. Chodl contains a C-type lectin domain representing a potential cell surface receptor for guidance factors. Gene knock-down experiments with two independent morpholinos led to stalling of <b>CaP</b> <b>motor</b> axons at the horizontal myoseptum, a pivotal choice point for axon pathfinding. This suggests that this novel gene specifically affects motor axon pathfinding in zebrafish. Single stranded DNA binding protein 1 (SSDP 1) functions as an activator of SSDP 1 /CLIM/LIM-HD complex which involved in the transcriptional control of embryonic development. To verify how SSDP 1 function in neural development in zebrafish, I have cloned Zebrafish SSDP 1 a and SSDP 1 b, which are most closely related to mouse and human SSDP 1. SSDP 1 a is widely expressed during zebrafish development while SSDP 1 b is specifically expressed in sensory trigeminal and Rohon-Beard neurons. Over-expression of the N-terminal portion of SSDP 1 (N-SSDP 1) increases endogenous CLIM protein levels in vivo and impairs the formation of eyes and midbrain-hindbrain boundary. In addition, SSDP 1 b knock down impairs trigeminal and Rohon-Beard sensory axon growth. N-SSDP 1 can partially rescue the inhibition of axon growth induced by DN-CLIM. These results reveal specific functions of SSDP 1 in neural patterning and sensory axon growth which are in part due to the stabilization of LIM-HD/CLIM complexes. In summary, co-factors of LIM-HDs play important roles in neural development, cell fate specification as well as axon pathfinding...|$|R
