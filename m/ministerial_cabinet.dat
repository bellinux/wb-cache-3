5|$|Madagascar is a semi-presidential {{representative}} democratic multi-party republic, {{wherein the}} popularly elected {{president is the}} head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet,</b> the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the next}} decade, Amanullah Khan instituted {{a number of}} social and {{constitutional}} reforms which had first been advocated by the Niedermayer-Hentig expedition. The reforms were instituted under a <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet.</b> An initial step was made towards female emancipation when women {{of the royal family}} removed their veils; educational institutions were opened to women. The education system was reformed with a secular emphasis and with teachers arriving from outside Afghanistan. A German school that opened in Kabul at one point offered the von Hentig Fellowship, devoted to postgraduate study in Germany. Medical services were reformed and a number of hospitals were built. Amanullah Khan also embarked on an industrialisation drive and nation-building projects, which received substantial German collaboration. By 1929, Germans were the largest group of Europeans in Afghanistan. German corporations like Telefunken and Siemens were amongst the most prominent firms involved in Afghanistan, and the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa became the first European airline to initiate service to Afghanistan.|$|E

40|$|While in many Western-European {{countries}} the ascend of special advisers {{is a relatively}} recent phenomenon, Belgium since long engages <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> as structural interfaces between politics and administration. Relatively large by international standards, <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> consist of political advisers who as “an extension of their minister” {{put pressure on the}} civil servants in order to ensure political responsiveness. Ministerial advisers have crucial policy-making roles, while the career civil servants {{at the top of the}} administration were long considered to be marginalized in the policy-making process. At the turn of the millennium, the reduction and revision of <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> in favour of strengthening the administration’s role in policy formulation gained a place on the agenda. In several of the Belgian administrations, the policy analytical capacity has been strengthened, and the relations between the administration and <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> improved in the direction of greater complementary of roles. This chapter makes draws on comparative literature on politico-administrative relations, and of survey material on the policy analytical roles of ministerial advisers and civil servants to analyse how bureaucratic policy expertise is balanced with political control. The analysis points at the enduring functionality of <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinets</b> in a polity characterized by fragile coalition government and partitocracy. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|But the President has his ministers as our Queen has hers. In {{one sense}} he has such ministers. He has high State {{servants}} who under him take {{the control of}} the various departments, and exercise among them a certain degree of patronage and executive power. But they are the President's ministers, and not the ministers of the people. Till lately there has been no chief minister among them, nor am I prepared {{to say that there is}} any such chief at present. According to the existing theory of the government these gentlemen have simply been the confidential servants of the commonwealth under the President, and have been attached each to his own department without concerted political alliance among themselves, without any acknowledged chief below the President, and without any combined responsibility even to the President. If one minister was in fault-- let us say the Postmaster-General--he alone was in fault, and it did not fall to the lot of any other minister either to defend him, or to declare that his conduct was indefensible. Each owed his duty and his defense to the President alone and each might be removed alone, without explanation given by the President to the others. I imagine that the late practice of the President's cabinet has in some degree departed from this theory; but if so, the departure has sprung from individual ambition rather than from any pre-concerted plan. Some one place in the cabinet has seemed to give to some one man an opportunity of making himself pre-eminent, and of this opportunity advantage has been taken. I am not now intending to allude to any individual, but am endeavoring to indicate the way in which a <b>ministerial</b> <b>cabinet,</b> after the fashion of our British cabinet, is struggling to get itself righted. No doubt the position of Foreign Secretary has for some time past been considered as the most influential under the President. This has been so much the case that many have not hesitated to call the Secretary of State the chief minister. At the present moment, May, l862, the gentleman who is at the head of the War Department has, I think, in his own hands greater power than any of his colleagues.|$|E
