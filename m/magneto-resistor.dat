50|$|A <b>magneto-resistor</b> (MR) is a two {{terminal}} device which {{changes its}} resistance parabolically with applied magnetic field. This {{variation of the}} resistance of MR due to the magnetic field {{is known as the}} Magnetoresistive Effect. It is possible to build structures in which the electrical resistance varies as a function of applied magnetic field. These structures can be used as magnetic sensors. Normally these resistors are assembled in a bridge configuration to compensate for thermal drift. Popular magneto resistance-based sensors are: Anisotropic Magneto Resistance (AMR), Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR), Giant Magneto Impendence (GMI) and Tunnel Magneto Resistance (TMR). All these MR-based sensors have higher sensitivity compared to Halleffect sensors. Despite of this, these sensors (GMR, CMR, and TMR) are still more expensive than Hall-effect devices, have serious drawbacks related with nonlinear behavior, distinct thermal drift, and a very strong external field can permanently alter the sensor behavior (GMR). GMI and TMR sensors are even more sensitive than GMR based sensors, but still in the test phase and no commercial version are available today.|$|E

This {{is the case}} of defects with ramifications where the eddy currents cannot penetrate some concavity areas. The illumination of the material under test with a coherent excitation field presents some advantages, such as the possibility of applying the excitation into different directions, thus obtaining different patterns that may be correlated to increase the definition of the acquired signals. The generation of the coherent excitation is obtained by using a planar coil that produces a uniform excitation field inside a given area. It is not easy to correlate the magnetic field patterns, obtained by using single component giant <b>magneto-resistor</b> (GMR) sensors, with the real geometry of the defects. The interpretation of the measured data is much easier if the data are inversed to obtain the geometry of the eddy current lines inside the conductor. The inversion process was performed using the discrete Fourier transform of the field data and of the elementary dipole current kernel. The inversion was followed by Tikhonov regularization and automated determination of the regularization parameter. Results obtained for a defect with three linear segments in a star configuration are depicte...|$|E
40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{automation}} in industrial manufacturing and {{in many areas of}} the daily life requires as well as the continuous rising need for information of the society an technical measurement monitoring of various process and environmental parameters. Sensors convert the instantaneous value of a physical measured variable on basis of physical or chemical effects into an equivalent electrical signal. They build the interface between a technical system and its environment. Magnetic field sensors, like the sensor elements Hall-Element and <b>magneto-resistor</b> which are based on galvanomagnetic ef-fects, react to a magnetic interaction with the item under test or cause such an interac-tion. The starting point of the present study is built by the treatment of the components of galvanomagnetic sensor systems as shape elements out of defined material, which are used as information carrier by modification of the constructional parameters. The variation of number, arrangement and/or geometrical shape results in one- or multidi-mensionally structured system components, which allow the generation of defined sen-sor system topologies with custom-designed information content. Within the framework of this work different new sensor systems were developed, which open a broader appli-cation scope to the galvanomagnetic sensor technology by structured components and which permit the application of these sensors within purviews of the measuring tech-nique, which are dominated so far by sensors on basis of other, usually optical effects. If the allocation of a sensor signal to the structure of a system component is reproducible and biunique, then the principle of the structure variation also admits a purposeful cod-ing of defined discrete information. For this a beginning for the development of magnetic structure codes for the identification technology forms the conclusion of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} the eddy current method {{is used to}} {{characterize}} defects in conductive non-ferromagnetic plates. A special {{attention is paid to}} the presentation of results in the form of images. An inverse problem with Tikhonov regularization is solved to obtain the two-dimensional distribution of currents inside the material under test. With this purpose a uniform field probe is used to guarantee a spatially invariant excitation field for probe scanning translations. The probe contains a magnetic field detector based on high sensitivity giant <b>magneto-resistors</b> which reads the magnetic field component parallel to the excitation and induction currents...|$|R
