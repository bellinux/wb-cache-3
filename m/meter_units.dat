The <b>metering</b> <b>units</b> included a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the standard cell corn plate, a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the flat plate, and a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus row unit with the finger pick‐up metering system. Planter seed spacing uniformity was measured using three parameters: ISO Miss index, ISO Multiples index, and Coefficient of Precision (CP 3). Six replications for nine field slope treatments were conducted for each <b>metering</b> <b>unit.</b> The field slope treatments included: front‐up (front of planter unit), front‐down, right‐up (right side of planter unit), and left‐up (left side of the planter unit) each at field slope levels of 10 % and 20 %, and level. Slope and travel pattern had significant effects on the seed spacing uniformity {{for each of the}} three <b>metering</b> <b>units</b> tested. The finger pick‐up was the least affected by slope as only the treatment of front‐up at 20 % slope had significantly worse seed spacing uniformity than the level treatment. For the cell plate <b>metering</b> <b>unit,</b> seed spacing uniformity was best with the planter on a level surface, or with the uphill‐downhill travel pattern on a 10 % slope, and on a 20 % slope the uphill‐downhill travel pattern had better seed spacing uniformity than the on‐the‐contour travel pattern. The finger pick‐up <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> had equally good seed spacing uniformity on a level surface and with either travel pattern on the 10 % slope. On a 20 % slope, the finger pick‐up <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> had better seed spacing uniformity with the on‐the‐contour travel pattern than with the uphill‐downhill travel pattern. The flat plate <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> had its best seed spacing uniformity with the front up on a 10 % slope, followed by equivalent seed spacing uniformity between right up on a 10 % slope and on a level surface.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Boston UniversityBarriers to care {{have been}} {{identified}} as a major factor in cancer health disparities. Previous research at Boston Medical Center (BMC) found that women referred from community health centers (CHCs) following abnormal breast cancer screening took longer to achieve diagnostic resolution than women referred from a BMC-based practice, consistent with research showing longer delays and worse outcomes for disadvantaged urban populations. It is not known whether this difference relates to the additional distance to BMC. To evaluate the effect of proximity from subjects' residence to the site of clinical care on time to diagnostic resolution in this urban setting we conducted a secondary analysis using data collected as part of the Boston Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP). The database included all women who had a breast or cervical cancer screening abnormality at six Federally-qualified CHCs from January 2007 to June 2009. Using geocoded home address data captured at the time of registration, we calculated straight-line distances to the location of the diagnostic evaluation, which was the CHC for subjects with a cervical abnormality or BMC for subjects with a breast abnormality, and plotted the time to diagnostic resolution versus distance to site of care. We used proportional hazards regression models to examine the effect of distance to site of care on time to resolution, adjusting for CHC, subject age, race/ethnicity, language, and insurance. Results. We geocoded addresses for 1512 of 1544 subjects (98 %). Among the diverse group of subjects with a breast screening abnormality (36 % Black, 33 % Hispanic; 44 % non-English speaking), {{there was no significant difference}} in adjusted hazard ratios based on distance to care in 1, 000 <b>meter</b> <b>units</b> (adjusted Hazard Ratio 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 01).

Conclusions. Increased distance between residence and clinic alone is not a barrier to diagnostic resolution for this vulnerable urban population receiving care at a CHC who had an abnormal cancer screening exam...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Road cycling is well {{established}} and has always {{been described as a}} highly endurance sport. To be able to compete in such a demanding sport the physiology of the athletes needs to be greatly developed. This review will focus on high intensity interval training {{and its impact on the}} physiological characteristics of competitive road cyclists. The main difference between different levels of competitive road cyclists seems to be the capacity to maintain a high sub maximal power output over a long period of time in order to succeed. High intensity interval training, from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, leads to improved VO 2 peak, aerobic peak power and time trial performance. The intensities used during these intervals are all based on the cyclists aerobic power output. Despite these findings, very few researches have studied the impact of interval training among professional road cyclists. Future research should therefore make us of mobile power <b>meter</b> <b>units</b> as a part to implement professional road cyclists in studies concerning interval training. In that way the cyclists will be able to train under their regularly routine in their ordinary training environment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel dosing concept for drug delivery {{based on a}} peristaltic piezo-electrically actuated micro membrane pump. The design of the silicon micropump itself is straight-forward, using two piezoelectrically actuated membrane valves as inlet and outlet, and a pump chamber with a piezoelectrically actuated pump membrane in-between. To achieve a precise dosing, this micropump is used to fill a <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> placed at its outlet. In the final design this <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> will be made from a piezoelectrically actuated inlet valve, a storage chamber with an elastic cover membrane and a piezoelectrically actuated outlet valve, which are connected in series. During a dosing cycle the <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> is used to adjust the drug volume to be dispensed before delivery and to control the actually dispensed volume. To simulate the new drug delivery concept, a lumped parameter model has been developed to find the decisive design parameters. With the knowledge taken from the model a drug delivery system is designed that includes a silicon micro pump and, in a first step, a silicon chip with the storage chamber and two commercial microvalves as a <b>metering</b> <b>unit.</b> The lumped parameter model is capable to simulate the maximum flow, the frequency response created by the micropump, and also the delivered volume of the drug delivery system...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the fuel}} {{injection}} pressure in diesel engines {{is one of}} the main parameters which determine the emissions and the fuel efficiency, a precise control algorithm for the common-rail pressure is a required priority for improving the engine performances. This paper proposes a coordinated common-rail pressure control strategy for passenger car diesel engines using a <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> and a pressure control valve. The <b>metering</b> <b>unit,</b> which is located at the high-pressure pump, adjusts the inlet fuel flow for the common rail using a first-order polynomial equation that describes the relation between the inlet fuel flow and the outlet fuel flow for the common rail. The injected fuel flow is used as the input for the control algorithm to determine the driving current of the <b>metering</b> <b>unit.</b> The designed control strategy for the <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> effectively reduces the rail pressure wave generated by the high-pressure pump. Furthermore, since the inlet fuel flow is adjusted according to the injected fuel flow, the proposed control algorithm shows a robust performance to the injection disturbance. The pressure control valve located on the common rail adjusts the outlet fuel flow of the common rail. The control algorithm for the pressure control valve is designed using quantitative feedback theory to assure robustness even when the variation in the plant characteristics (such as the static gain and the time constant) is caused by the <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> operation. Engine experiments proved that the proposed control strategy can reduce the variation in the steady-state rail pressure to less than 10 bar; in addition, the proposed rail pressure controller has a good degree of consistency under various engine operating conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to try to}} make the {{mathematics}} content of textile handicraft visible. This is done through an attempt at integrated studies in the two subjects with 6 th grade students. The main question is: In what way may integrated studies in mathematics and textile handicraft lead to making the mathematics content of textile handicraft visible to the students? This question has been divided into three sub-questions: 1. What knowledge do students have on the order of the millimeter, centimeter, decimeter and <b>meter</b> <b>units</b> of length?, 2. In what situations do students mention knowledge of measuring as being of use?, and 3. To what extent do students see a connection between mathematics and textile handicraft before and after an attempt at integrated studies in mathematics and textile handicraft? The methods of use in this thesis are questionnaires and interviews. The theoretical frame is constituted by the sociocultural theory. This theory focuses on the idea that thinking is closely connected to our activities, which makes it a suitable basis for the thesis. The results of the study show that overall the students’ knowledge of the order of the units of length in question is good. The students mention knowledge of measuring as being of use mostly in situations related to consumption, building and painting, and mathematics. No student mentions a connection between mathematics and textile handicraft in the questionnaires. However, the interviewees mentioned measuring as being of use in textile handicraft. The study gives no definite answer to the question of whether integrated studies can make the mathematics of textile handicraft visible. The fact that students in interview after integrated studies are able to discover a connection between the two subjects may indicate that the mathematics content of textile handicraft has been made visible...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of glucocorticoids {{has been shown}} to induce atrophy and weakness in whole skeletal muscle. These effects frequently appear to be more pronounced in pale muscle than in red muscle. The present study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} steroid treatment on the contractile, electrical, and fatigue properties of single <b>meter</b> <b>units</b> in pale and red cat hindlimb muscles. Single motor units in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus muscles were isolated using techniques developed by McPhedran, et al., (1965). The properties of a large number of motor units were examined in normal animals and were compared to those of single units from the muscles of steroid-treated (3 - 4 mg. of triamcinolone acetonide per kg. per day for 10 - 16 days) animals. Motor units examined in both control and experimental animals were classified by type according to criteria developed by Burke, et al., (1973, 1974). The results show that steroids produce alterations in the strength- and speed-related properties of motor units which are more pronounced in fast-twitch than in slow-twitch units. The mean maximum tetanic tension (Pmax) for types FF (fast-twitch, readily fatiguable) and FR (fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant) units in MG were reduced by 63 % and 71 % respectively; The Pmax for type S units in MG was reduced by 25 % as a result of steroid treatment but was unchanged for type S units in soleus. The mean maximum rate of rise of tetanic tension (dP/dt) for the three classes of motor units in MG was reduced in a pattern similar to that for tetanic tension. The dP/dt for types FF, FR, and S units in MG were reduced by 79 %, 54 %, and 25 % respectively. The dP/dt for soleus units was increased by 73 % as compared to control soleus units. Steroid treatment lengthened the mean twitch contraction time (CF) of FF units and shortened the CT for type S units in both MG and soleus. The integrated EMG signals elicited from FF and FR units were unchanged following steroid treatment but were significantly increased for type S units in both pale and red muscles. Steroid administration did not markedly alter the susceptibility to fatigue of the three classes of units in MG or in soleus units. There were however fewer MG units with intermediate fatigue indeces in steroid-treated animals. These finding suggest that those units most frequently activated in muscular contractions are the least susceptible to steroid-induced changes in their contractile properties and vice versa. Since the overall frequency of activation of motor uﬁits is determined by cell size, these results imply that the Size Principle (Hennemann, et al., 1965) can be extended to not only explain the recruitment order of motor units in muscular contractions but also to account for the patterns of motor unit involvement in steroid-induced myopathy...|$|E
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Texas Department of Transportation, Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT-ENV), the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) {{conducted}} archeological significance testing at 41 ZV 202, a prehistoric site located in northwestern Zavala County, in March of 2003. The work, conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3071 issued to Dr. Steven A. Tomka, was done in anticipation of the potential widening by TxDOT of FM 481. While materials dating to the Archaic were also present, the testing demonstrated the presence of significant Late Prehistoric (Austin Interval) deposits with good integrity within a portion of the TxDOT right-of-way (ROW). As TxDOT construction could not avoid these deposits, and as both the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and TxDOT concurred with CAR’s recommendations that the deposits were eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under criterion d of 36 CFR 60. 4, data recovery investigations were initiated. CAR began that work in July and August of 2003. The testing permit was amended to include the data recovery efforts. Dr. Russell Greaves served as project archeologist for both the testing and data recovery effort at 41 ZV 202. The testing and data recovery work consisted of the excavation of a 53 -m-long Gradall trench, exposing and profiling a 75 -m-long road cut, and the hand excavation of 52 1 x 1 <b>meter</b> <b>units</b> that removed approximately 34. 6 m 3 of soil. Testing identified two large, dark stained areas designated Features 4 and 5, an associated hearth (Feature 7), and a small cluster of FCR (Feature 6). Just over 1, 000 chipped stone items were recovered, including several Scallorn points, one reworked dart point, several bifaces, and two flake tools. Eleven AMS radiocarbon dates were submitted from deposits, with eight clustering around 1000 BP. Data recovery efforts defined FCR features 8 through 13. In addition, 24 arrow points, several dart points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial tools, a small number of cores, roughly 6, 000 pieces of debitage, and a variety of burned sandstone, were recovered. We also collected small quantities of bone and mussel shell along with about 14, 350 gastropod shells, and a variety of soil samples. Finally, all calcium carbonate nodules were retained from the screens. Following the completion of data recovery efforts, the CAR was directed by TxDOT to develop a research design for the analysis of the material from 41 ZV 202. TxDOT and THC accepted that research design in November of 2004, at which time the CAR began analysis and report production. Unfortunately, by 2005 project archeologist Russell Greaves had left the CAR. At that point, CAR assistant director Dr. Raymond Mauldin took over the project. The analysis of the 41 ZV 202 Late Prehistoric data outlined in this report is conducted {{in the context of a}} large-scale, theoretically driven model of adaptation for hunters and gatherers loosely based on aspects of Optimal Foraging Theory. In addition to 41 ZV 202, the approach relies on comparative data sets from Late Archaic and other Late Prehistoric sites from South and South-Central Texas to investigate shifts in subsistence, technology, and mobility across this broad region. At this time, discard decisions have not been made. However, all artifacts and associated samples collected and retained during this project, along with all project-associated documentation, are to be permanently curated at the CAR according to Texas Historical Commission guidelines...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Konum bilgisi, günlük hayatta ve endüstriyel sistemlerde sıkça gerek duyulan, kıymetli bir bilgidir. Dünya üzerindeki konumu belirleyebilmek için yıldız haritaları ve deniz fenerleri yüzyıllar boyu kullanılmış, daha sonra yerini uydulardan faydalanarak geliştirilen GPS sistemine bırakmıştır. Günümüzde GPS teknolojisi tüm taşıtlara hatta kişisel elektronik cihazlara kadar ulaşmıştır. Bu cihazlar açık alanlarda birkaç metre hassasiyetle konumunu belirleyebilse de kapalı alanlarda kişisel ya da endüstiyel cihazların konum bilgisine ihtiyaç duyulduğunda GPS teknolojisi yeterli hassasiyete ulaşamamaktadır. Kapalı alan konumlama özellikle kişisel cihazların kullanımının artması ve otonom hareket edebilen endüstriyel araçların çoğalmasıyla son yıllarda önemli araştırma konularından biri olmuştur. Geliştirilen farklı teknolojilerin birbirlerine üstünlükleri olduğu göz önünde bulundurulduğunda, farklı ihtiyaçlara yönelik en iyi çözümlere farklı teknolojilerle ulaşmak mümkündür. Bu nedenle farklı teknolojiler incelenmiş ve soruna yönelik en uygun çözüm önerilmiştir. GPS, RFID/NFC, WiFi ve BLE ile çeşitli çözümler sunulmaktadır. Farklı ihtiyaçlar için farklı çözümlere yönelmek gerekebilir, bu nedenle 4 teknoloji de kapsama alanı, maliyet, hassasiyet, erişilebilirlik ve güvenlik kriterlerine göre incelenmiştir. İncelemeler sonrasında Bluetooth Low Energy altyapısı ve RSSI ile konum tahmini tekniği kullanıma uygun bulunmuştur ve RSSI değerindeki {{standart}} sapma dikkate alınarak algoritma geliştirilmiştir. Bu tercihler ile 2 tip gezici donanım, 1 sabit donanım geliştirilmiştir. Bu donanımlar için ihtiyaca yönelik 1 yönlü, 1 yönsüz anten tasarımı yapılmıştır. Yönsüz anten için PIFA, yönlü anten için LOOP topolojileri tercih edilmiştir. Donanım yazılımları için yeni bir BLE profili oluşturulmuş, konum bilgisi haricinde cihazın çevresel koşulları ve yerel veri tabanındaki bilgiler kullanılarak gelişmiş bir sistem oluşturulmuştur. Ofis ortamında gerçeklenen sistem için sabit düğüm konumları belirlenmiş, yönlü ya da yönsüz anten tercihi yapılmıştır. Sabit düğümlerden toplanan veriler bilgisayar arayüzü ile işlenerek; hareketli düğüm konumları ve durumları periyodik kontrol edilip bölge değişimleri ve tahmini konumları incelenmiştir. Geliştirilen sistem güç tüketimi, hassasiyet, erişilebilirlik, güvenlik ve maliyet kriterlerine göre farklı sistemlerle karşılaştırılmıştır. Güç tüketimi, güvenlik, erişilebilirlik ve maliyet yönüyle güçlü; bölge tayini ve sınır algılama yapabilecek hassasiyette bir sistem geliştirilmiştir. Location data is {{a valuable}} information which is often required both in daily life and industrial systems. Celestial maps and lighthouses had been used for centuries to estimate a specific location, subsequently were replaced with GPS, which is a location estimator developed via utilizing satellites. Nowadays GPS Technologies are embedded in almost all devices, even to the personal devices. These devices are capable of estimating location with the accuracy of a few meters error margin in the open fields. However, indoor area accuracy is not reliable enough when you need location estimation of the personal or industrial devices. Indoor location estimation {{has been one of}} the significant subjects of the researches with the contribution of the rise in the use of personal devices and autonomous self-driving industrial vehicles. Taking into consideration the superiority of the developed systems from each other, it is possible to generate the best need-based results via various technologies. Thus several technologies have been observed and the most convenient case-oriented result is submitted. Several solutions are provided by GPS, RFID/NFC, WiFi and Bluetooth LE. It may offer different solutions for varied needs. Thus, these 4 technologies have been evaluated according to coverage, cost, sensitivity, accessibility and security criteria. After analyzing, Bluetooth Low Energy infrastructure and location estimation technique via RSSI were found suitable for use, and an algorithm have been developed considering standard deviation of the RSSI value. By these preferences, 2 types of mobile hardware and 1 type of fixed hardware have been developed. 1 directional and 1 omni-directional need-oriented antenna have been designed. PIFA topology for omni-directional antenna, and LOOP technology for directional antenna were preferred. In this study, Cambrigde Silicon Radio CSR 1010 is used for all BLE hardware blocks. It has a wide input voltage range from 1. 8 V up to 3. 6 V, and 900 nA sleep mode current 16 mA maximum communication current. With these features, it is suitable for use with a battery. It also has 12 digital inputs and outputs, 10 -bit ADC, 4 PWM module, UART, I 2 C and SPI, 64 KB of ROM and 64 KB RAM with a built-in processor. It has also has good RF features: 7 dbm output power and - 92. 5 dbm reception sensitivity, 50 Ω RF antenna connection with built-in balun.   Mobile node design has a 33 mm* 50 mm* 20. 3 mm container, a CR 2032 battery could fit into the container. Mobile E-ink node has low power BLE and E-ink technology together. With this combination, light-weight and very low power design could be performed for personal ID tag. Fixed node has an BLE and Ethernet interface, and also optional 3 G interface. It gathers data from mobile nodes via BLE and sends data to central software via Ethernet. Communication with mobile nodes and central software are managed by micro controller unit STM 32 F 101 RCT 6. This device is not suitable for battery powered usage because of the large signalling traffic. Therefore, fixed nodes also contains AC/DC converter. According to usage purpose and locations of the device, directional or omni-directional antenna could be used for BLE communication. Omni-directional antenna has a center frequency of 2. 45 GHz, providing the required 7 % band width and 10 dB return loss. Directional loop antenna has 2. 45 GHz center frequency with 7 % band width, 13 dB return loss, 5. 8 dB gain and 120 ˚ orientation angle. For this study, a unique BLE profile has been developed. Including location information, a system has been created by using environmental informations and local databases of the devices.   In similar studies in this area, ideal condition in an ideal environment have been chosen for distance measurement in <b>meter</b> <b>units.</b> For closer results to ideal environment,  maximum RSSI values of the gathered information is used. In this study, instead of maximum of RSSI values, the mean value and standard deviation is taken into account in the implemented system.   RSSI value is affected by environment and moving object. Thus, distance measurement via RSSI value is not a robust solution. In this study, RSSI values are filtered with an algorithm that uses mean value and standard deviation of gathered RSSI values. Instead of calculating distance between fixed node and mobile node, location information of mobile node is determined with zones in the region. In addition to the location information, an advance system have been developed via using environmental conditions and information in the local database of nodes. Fixed node locations have been determined for the system which was performed in the office environment and either directional or omni-directional antennas have been preferred. The data generated from fixed nodes had been processed with computer interface; by controlling mobile node locations and conditions periodically, zone variance and estimated locations had been analyzed. The developed system was compared to the other systems according to power consumption, coverage, cost, sensitivity, accessibility and security a. Consequently, a strong system in the aspects of power consumption, security, accessibility and cost which is capable of sensitively performing zone assignment and border detection has been developed. The system performed in an office environment, the positions of fixed nodes determined. Two directional antennas and three omni-directional antennas are used for five fixed nodes. Collected periodical data from mobile nodes are processed by fixed nodes and location changes, entries to restricted areas and environmetal changes are  reported to the central software by fixed nodes. The system is suitable for improvement and could be used for various purposes in various fields.   BLE technology was developed to meet the needs of low-power and do not require high data transfer applications. Has expanded rapidly since 2010. Low-power and low-data rate applications are increasing rapidly with personal devices, machine to machine communication (M 2 M), Internet of  Things (IoT) applications with new ideas to reach all electronic devices. Location-based services are also needed for in-door applications. Navigation for indoor locations with a large area, caring in the field of life of patients, following the daily activities of athletes, inventory safety for high cost devices in hospitals and lobatories, monitoring the status of autonomous devices in the production line, examining the product of the process steps, knowing last position cases and boxes in logistics network, estimating working hours of stuff,  preventing the entry of visitors to the forbidden zones,studing of consumer behavior in stores and shopping centers could be applications with BLE for location-base services.

40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} seed <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> {{was designed}} and mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as seed metering shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and seed metering shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of seed metering shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated seed <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the grain drill and equipped grain drill with common seed <b>metering</b> <b>unit</b> (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of grain drill (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the grain drill for DSW. Using the FSMU reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) by approximately 50 %. Consequently, applying the FSMU on the common grain drill led to a desirable seeding rate at different forward speeds of the grain drill and stubble existence...|$|R
