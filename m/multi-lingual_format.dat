The station {{took on a}} mostly Spanish identity in the 1950s, then became primarily oriented towards the African American community of New York City in the mid-1960s. WWRL played R&B music from 1964 to 1982 before changing to gospel music and religious programming from 1982 to 1997.|$|E
5000|$|By 1983, KFOX {{had evolved}} into a multi-ethnic, <b>multi-lingual</b> <b>format</b> such as Radio Rangarang (Persian), Radio Omid (Persian) and Radio Naeeri (Armenian).

This {{continued}} until 1999, when the Church of the Foursquare Gospel, which, {{as a condition of}} selling 96.3 KXOL-FM moved the KFSG call letters and format to 93.5, which was acquired by 96.3's new owners, Spanish Broadcasting System, specifically for the purpose of relocating KFSG.

It is through technological applications of this nature that the indigenous parameters and set-up of oral literature are changed. Oral literature by its nature is traditionally transmitted verbally. The technological changes that the world undergoes compel oral literature to adapt to the new changes, namely digitalization, for preserving and archiving our cultural artefacts {{so that they can be}} passed on to future generations. We argue that the digital revolution offers an excellent chance for scholars, oral performers and librarians to avail the oral text online to regions beyond our borders. We suggest that the technology now allows us to provide the oral text in multi-media, <b>multi-lingual</b> and interactive <b>format</b> for local and foreign consumption. It is time for the oral literature researcher to join the digital world...|$|R
