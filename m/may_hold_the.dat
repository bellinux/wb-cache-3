25|$|Believing the Second Foundation {{still exists}} (despite the common {{belief that it}} has been extinguished), young {{politician}} Golan Trevize is sent into exile to uncover the group by the current Mayor of the Foundation, Harla Branno, accompanied by a scholar named Janov Pelorat. The reason for their belief is that, despite the unforeseeable impact of the Mule, the Seldon Plan still appears to be proceeding in accordance with the statements of Seldon's hologram, suggesting that the Second Foundation still exists and is secretly intervening to bring the plan back on course. After a few conversations with Pelorat, Trevize comes to believe that a mythical planet called Earth <b>may</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> secret to the location. No such planet exists in any database, yet several myths and legends all refer to it, and it is Trevize's belief that the planet is deliberately being kept hidden. Unknown to Trevize and Pelorat, Branno is tracking their ship so that, in the event they find the Second Foundation, the first Foundation can take military or other action.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{surgical}} trainees enter training {{after five}} years of medical school and two years of the Foundation Programme. During the two to three-year core training programme, doctors will sit the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS examination, surgeons <b>may</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> title 'Mister' or 'Miss/Ms' rather than doctor. This is a tradition dating back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom. Trainees will then go onto Higher Surgical Training (HST), lasting a further five to six years. During this time they may choose to subspecialise. Before the end of HST, the examination of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will become a consultant surgeon and will be eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register and may work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant general surgeon. The implementation of the European Working Time Directive limited UK surgical residents to a 48-hour working week. The introduction of a sub-consultant grade to enable those who have recently received a UK Certificate of Completion of Training may be necessary.|$|E

25|$|When P. exigua catch prey, {{they return}} to the nest with a solid, usually glossy mass, held in their mouthparts. If the size of prey is {{relatively}} large, the wasp <b>may</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> crop with its anterior legs. Wasps were reported to share this food with other adults and offer the protein in a macerated form to larvae. The water gathered by workers is placed directly onto {{the walls of the}} nest cells, usually without any contact with other wasps. Wood pulp and fibers are collected primarily for nest building. Wasps return to the nest with a solid mass taken in the mouthparts; they are usually smaller and darker than the prey crop. P. exigua has the habit of building white or light brown nests, so the item taken to the nest for colony growth was white and larger than the prey. This item is chewed, mixed with saliva and incorporated in the cell walls. Resin is gathered in order to build layers within the nest. Workers carrying resin to the nest travel to substrate sheets and proceed to lay their foraged material on top of the structure. This new layer remains there until the sheets stuck together and formed a stronger partition.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{metabolism}} also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} {{in the direction of}} mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication <b>may</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E
