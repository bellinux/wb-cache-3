5|$|In {{the case}} of human subjects, this {{involved}} injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or {{to have a life}} expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> radium. Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E
5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E

5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on {{injuries}} {{related to}} commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{is responsible for}} the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.|$|E

25|$|Crime in Manassas {{has been}} rated by Neighborhood Scout to be <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> 63% of all American neighborhoods and 37% safer than all American neighborhoods. That shows that Manassas has a {{moderately}} higher crime rate than average.|$|E
25|$|A wolf’s {{behavior}} is typically more socially shy and timid toward humans {{than that of}} a dog. Due to the variability inherent to their hybridization, whether a wolf–dog cross should be considered <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> a dog depends on behavior specific to the individual alone rather than to wolfdogs as a group.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> brown bears, which live in more open spaces {{and are thus}} {{less likely to be}} surprised by approaching humans. They are also likely to attack when protecting food.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on actual}} {{exposure}} time, {{according to a}} 1970 North American study, diving was 96 times <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> driving an automobile. and according to a 2000 Japanese study, 36 to 62 times riskier than driving. A difference between the risks of driving and diving is that the diver is less at risk from fellow divers than the driver is from other drivers.|$|E
25|$|In October 2004, {{researchers}} discovered H5N1 is far <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> {{was previously}} believed. Waterfowl were {{revealed to be}} directly spreading this highly pathogenic strain to chickens, crows, pigeons, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals, as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was a {{replication}} of the research of Reason et al. (1990). Its aim was to confirm the distinction between driving errors and violations in a Western Australian driving population. Sixty-one male drivers and 74 female drivers completed a questionnaire containing items on driver demographics, driving penalties incurred, driving convictions and accident history and driver behavioural aberrations drawn from the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). In agreement with Reason et al. factor analysis revealed three factors; {{in the present study}} these were general errors, dangerous errors, and dangerous violations. Young drivers committed <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> errors and <b>dangerous</b> violations <b>than</b> older drivers. Females reported <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> errors <b>than</b> males. Males reported <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> violations <b>than</b> females. Drivers who reported a high level of road exposure and those who reported having been convicted for speeding reported <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> violations. Differences in the results of the two studies can largely by accounted for by differences in the representation of age and gender in the two populations studied...|$|R

25|$|Fentanyl analogues may be {{hundreds}} of times more potent than street heroin, and tend to produce significantly more respiratory depression, making it much <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> heroin to users. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, often leading to overdoses. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Estonia has {{the highest rate of}} 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.|$|E
25|$|The film {{follows the}} adventures of the four Turtles: Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, and their Master Splinter. Resuming from {{the events of the}} last film, the villain, Shredder, returns to take back command of the Foot Clan, and work towards getting revenge on the Turtles. When he learns the secret behind the Turtles' mutation, he becomes <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> ever. The film sheds some light on the origins of Splinter and the Turtles, as well as {{introduces}} two new villains: Tokka and Rahzar.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} infrequency of SWAT call-outs means these expensively {{trained and}} equipped officers cannot {{be left to}} sit around, waiting for an emergency. In many departments the officers are normally deployed to regular duties, but are available for SWAT calls via pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers. Even in the larger police agencies, such as the LAPD or the NYPD, SWAT personnel will normally be seen in crime suppression roles—specialized and <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> regular patrol, perhaps, but the officers would not be carrying their distinctive armor and weapons.|$|E

Charles Martel invaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced back again to Frankish territory under his control. Alessandro Santosuosso strongly argues that the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> the first. The second expedition's failure {{put an end to}} any serious Muslim expedition across the Pyrenees, although raids continued. Plans for further large-scale attempts were hindered by internal turmoil in the Umayyad lands which often made enemies out of their own kind.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Evelyn Fisher {{wrote of}} how {{women living in}} a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles {{intended}} for Roman Catholic ceremonies to dilate the cervix {{in an effort to}} self-induce abortion. Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, sticks, knives, and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States. Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of sitting over a pot of steam into the early 20th century. Abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> childbirth until about 1930.|$|E
25|$|The third {{game was}} played on 11 November 2014. Anand's {{superior}} opening preparation was the decisive factor in this game. In a sharp, topical variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined involving an early Queen's side attack by White, he improved on an earlier game between Levon Aronian and Michael Adams. He soon had a clear advantage, his c-pawn on the 7th rank being far <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> Carlsen's passed a-pawn. Carlsen, down to 6 minutes, blundered with 28...Ba5?, although his position was very bad anyway. Anand leveled the match at 1½–1½. This was Anand's first and thus far (as of 2016) only victory over Carlsen in a world championship game.|$|E
