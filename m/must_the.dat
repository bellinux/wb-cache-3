5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton {{is defined as the}} force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly, so too <b>must</b> <b>the</b> newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|This {{reinforcement}} of the aristocracy {{must be seen}} {{in conjunction with the}} war in France, as <b>must</b> <b>the</b> emerging sense of national identity. Just as the war with Scotland had done, the fear of a French invasion helped strengthen a sense of national unity, and nationalise the aristocracy that had been largely Anglo-Norman since the Norman conquest. Since the time of Edward I, popular myth suggested that the French planned to extinguish the English language, and as his grandfather had done, Edward III made the most of this scare. As a result, the English language experienced a strong revival; in 1362, a Statute of Pleading ordered the English language to be used in law courts, and the year after, Parliament was for the first time opened in English. At the same time, the vernacular saw a revival as a literary language, through the works of William Langland, John Gower and especially The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yet the extent of this Anglicisation must not be exaggerated. The statute of 1362 was in fact written in the French language and had little immediate effect, and parliament was opened in that language as late as 1377. The Order of the Garter, though a distinctly English institution, included also foreign members such as John IV, Duke of Brittany and Sir Robert of Namur. Edward III – himself bilingual – viewed himself as legitimate king of both England and France, and could not show preferential treatment for one part of his domains over another.|$|E

Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} the grapes at the winery is to separate {{the components of the}} wort that are needed from the unwanted parts. The process followed at this stage will largely determine the future quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken then trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows the grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from black grapes as the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured <b>must).</b> <b>The</b> practice of shaking or stalking has the advantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine a herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not macerated and the transparent yellow colour is retained.|$|E

500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics.

500|$|World Tour {{features}} a wireless six-piece drum kit, with a bass drum pedal and five velocity-sensitive drum pads, which Activision has stated provide the [...] "most realistic drum experience ever {{in a video}} game". Generally, the pads represent the snare drum (red), the tom-tom drum (blue), the floor tom (green), the hi-hat cymbal (yellow), and the crash cymbal (orange), however, {{they can be used}} for other percussion instruments depending on the song. The bass drum is represented by a purple, horizontal line on the highway, which players <b>must</b> <b>the</b> drum pedal to hit. The drum kit was designed with help from John Devacka, the developer of [...] MTV Drumscape, and developed key patents used for most modern music games that are now owned by Activision. [...] Special note gems on the drum track, representing accent notes, are [...] "armored", requiring the player to strike the corresponding drum head harder in order to break the armor and score more points. [...] During song creation, the velocity sensitivity feature of the drum pad allows players to alter the sounds made by the drums. The drum set also has a MIDI input port in the back, allowing users to connect a compatible MIDI drum kit to play in the game. The Wii version of the drum controller includes a slot for the Wii Remote to fit into, enabling it to become wireless, much like the guitar controller introduced for the Wii version of Guitar Hero III.|$|E

500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only <b>must</b> <b>the</b> spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
