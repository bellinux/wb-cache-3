500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Muncie {{worked with}} the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. In 1997, he {{established}} the Chuck Muncie Youth Foundation in Antioch, California. The nonprofit organization mentored at-risk youth and provided free medical services, childhood immunizations, tattoo removal for gang members, and camps for chronically ill children. Muncie also led a program that mentored athletes at his alma mater in Berkeley. In his later years, he also ran a recruiting service evaluating high school football players. [...] "Everything I did and everything I went through in my life has allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> things I'm doing now," [...] Muncie said.|$|E
2500|$|Camelot 3000 had lengthy delays {{between its}} final issues. Bolland {{recalled}} {{that he and}} DC [...] "talked {{quite a bit about}} {{how long it would take}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> series," [...] and because the series was inked by other artists, he started off [...] "churning the pages out with great enthusiasm." [...] As the series continued, however, Bolland became increasingly meticulous, [...] "trying to make the pages look better and better". The added details he introduced into his artwork caused significant delays in the final issues of the limited series, causing issues #8–11 to be released on a quarterly rather than monthly status, and the final issue to be cover dated nine months later than the penultimate issue.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} it's {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do!</b> <b>The</b> telegram won't come for hours yet. I want something {{to go on with}} in the mean time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not; there's nothin' for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> till <b>the</b> folks {{begin to}} come in to see how well I can row a boat. What <b>did</b> <b>the</b> old duffer do?" ...|$|R

6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Now he'll {{have to go}} down to {{the parlor}} and send up his name, and that just gives <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> {{necessary}} prinking. You stay here and receive him, Nettie." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is it so indeed? Well, {{the more}} reason that I should make haste to follow her. Begone and leave <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> deed alone," [...] and he stepped towards the sword.|$|E
