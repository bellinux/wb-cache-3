My goal when I started working on Leona's new album was to '' chase or be influenced by any of her previous hits—or any songs 've ever done with anyone else—including 'Bleeding Love'. True artists do not look back to previous successes; they look forward to creating new moments and songs the world can connect with in a different way. And that is what Leona has done with 'Happy'. I hope [...] like it as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> and I hope the lyrics hit [...] as hard as they hit me".|$|E
2500|$|Trish Bendix of AfterEllen.com, on {{the other}} hand, {{challenged}} the outrage, stating that while LGBT visibility matters, fictional characters of color (including transgender characters of color) do not get {{a tenth of the}} attention that white television characters do. She hoped to see viewers care more about these characters going forward. The A.V. Clubs Kyle Fowle felt that while [...] "it's certainly frustrating to see one of TV's prominent lesbian characters written off so hastily," [...] the show made Lexa's death mean something. In his opinion, episode [...] "Thirteen" [...] is [...] "a remarkable episode, one that deepens the mythology of The 100 while also delivering on a number of character threads that have been left dangling for much of this season so far." [...] Damian Holbrook of TV Insider argued that, despite assertions to the contrary, television writers and producers never hastily kill off a character. [...] "They are humans who come to love their casts and their characters as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> but they are also ultimately telling a story." ...|$|E

2500|$|When I was young, {{literary}} critics often rejoiced that {{the hypocrisy of}} the Victorians had been discredited, or expressed confidence that the operation would soon be complete. So far from that, it has returned in a peculiarly stifling form to take possession of critics of Eng. Lit.; Mr Pecksniff has become {{the patron saint of}} many of my colleagues. As so often, the deformity is the result of severe pressure between forces in themselves good. The study of English authors of the past is now centred in the universities, and yet there must be no censorship - no work of admitted literary merit may be hidden from the learners. Somehow we must save poor Teacher's face, and protect him from the indignant or jeering students, local authorities or parents. It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> even, and wanted his book to shame everybody out of being so nasty ever again. This is often called fearless or unflinching criticism, and one of its ill effects is to make the young people regard all literature as a terrific nag or scold. Independently of this, a strong drive has been going on to recover the children for orthodox or traditional religious beliefs; ... and when you understand all that, you may just be able to understand how they manage to present James Joyce as a man devoted to the God who was satisfied by the crucifixion. The concordat was reached over his dead body.|$|E
