40|$|The {{environmental}} consequences and {{the probability of}} <b>conceivable</b> <b>accidents</b> occurring during the high level waste preparation (HLWP) phase of the Commercial Nuclear Waste Vitrification Project (CNWVP) were analyzed. The maximum {{environmental consequences}} of postulated accidents were calculated to result in low radiation doses: a 50 -year dose commitment of 0. 3 rem to the whole body for a maximum individual, and of 20 man-rem to the whole body for the surrounding population. This may be compared to Department of Energy (DOE) values, in Manual Chapter Appendix 0524, of 0. 5 -rem whole-body annual dose commitment to individuals at points of maximum probable exposure in uncontrolled areas. The calculated whole-body relative dose risk to individuals from accidents is low (1. 6 x 10 {sup - 6 } rem/yr) as compared to that received from natural background radiation (approximately 1. 5 x 10 {sup - 1 } rem/yr) and as compared to levels specified in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements for routine releases from nuclear power reactors (5. 0 x 10 {sup - 3 } rem/yr).

Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that flight preparation followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes, and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm. At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable. The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the steel balls on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion.

40|$|In {{scenarios}} {{of a future}} energy provision, liquid hydrogen has, as an environmentally benign energy carrier, advantages compared to other alternatives (for instance the pollution-free oxidation to water). However, in consideration of hazards associated with hydrogen when mixed with air, the assessment of conceivable risks and its jeopardizing potential after an inadvertant release has to be performed. The tools for such a risk analysis are calculation models to simulate <b>conceivable</b> <b>accidents</b> {{with the release of}} cryogenic liquids as realistic as possible. The spreading and vaporization of cryogenic liquids, as a part of it, has been investigated in this work. Experiments have been conducted to study the vaporization of liquid nitrogen (LN_ 2) over insulated bodies of macadam and concrete (dry/moist). For moist concrete, the time until a complete vaporization of the LN_ 2 is significantly smaller than for dry concrete. Also, the radial pool spreading and vaporization of liquid nitrogen over water and of liquid hydrogen over water and aluminium has been experimentally examined. After spreading of the cryogenic liquid over a water surface, ice formation has been observed. To simulate vaporization over insulated bodies as well as pool spreading over water and solid grounds, the computer model LAuV (LachenAusbreitung und Verdampfung) has been developed. The results of postcalculations are in good agreement with the measurement data of the above mentioned own experiments as well as of literature data. Postcalculations have been made for liquid natural gas, liquid nitrogen, and liquid hydrogen.

40|$|The safety {{analysis}} of medium-sized High-Temperature Reactors (HTR) {{has to make}} a statement an the technical basis for the risk during a hypothetical core heat-up accident. The failure of the core heat removal system determines the risk of the HTR. During this accident the liner cooling system is the only active heat sink. Thera are <b>conceivable</b> <b>accidents</b> during which the core cooling system and the liner cooling system are not avaiiable for a considerable time. This paper investigates experimentally and theoreticaily the possibility of refeeding the liner coofing system and the heat transfer processes of a two-phase flow during a refeeding of the liner cooling system above the saturation temperature. The experiments have shown that even at an initial temperature of 700 Â°C it is stillpossible to refeed the liner cooling system without difficufty. Depending an the initial temperature and flow, a steam blockage of the wofing tubes may temporarily occur but this does not interrupt the wofing process. At initial temperatures far above the saturation temperature it is advisable to carry out reflooding with a flow below that of normal operation in order to avoid excessive pressure in the hot tubes and to keep the thermal stress low. The SIKADE- 2 simulation gave good agreement with the experimental data. Theapplication of the reflooding process to the liner cooling system in the THTR- 300 during a core heat-up accident enables one to state that reflooding of the liner cooling system in the cylindrical wall would take about 10 or 20 minutes if refeeding is assumed to start at an initial temperature of 300 Â°C or 450 Â°C...|$|R
40|$|As the {{biosynthesis}} of cylindrospermopsin (CYN) {{is assumed}} to depend on nitrogen availability, this study investigated the impact of nitrogen availability on intra- and extracellular CYN and deoxy-CYN (D-CYN) contents in three Aphanizomenon strains from temperate waters. Nitrogen deficient (âN) cultures showed a prolonged growth phase and intracellular toxin accumulation {{by a factor of}} 2 â 6. In contrast, cultures with additional nitrate supply (+N) did not accumulate CYN within the cells. Instead, the <b>maximum</b> <b>conceivable</b> CYN release estimated for dead cells (identified by SYTOXÂ® Green staining) was much lower than the concentrations of dissolved CYN actually observed, suggesting these cultures actively release CYN from intact cells. Furthermore, we found remarkably altered proportions of CYN to D-CYN: as batch cultures grew, the proportion of D-CYN increased by up to 40 % in +N medium, whereas D-CYN remained constant or decreased slightly in âN medium. Since +N cultures showed similar toxin patterns as âP cultures with increased extracellular CYNs and higher proportion of D-CYN we conclude that nitrogen limitation may affect the way the cells economize resources, especially the yield from phosphorus pools, and that this has an impact on CYN production and release. For water management, these result imply that nutrient availability not only determines the abundance of potentially CYN-producing cyanobacteria, but also the amount of extracellular CYNs (challenging drinking-water treatment) as well as the ratio of D-CYN to CYN (affecting toxicity) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper that the D-He- 3 fusion fuel cycle is not only {{credible}} from a physics standpoint, but that its breakeven and ignition characteristics could be developed on roughly the same time schedule as the DT cycle. It was also shown that the extremely low fraction of power in neutrons, the lack of significant radioactivity in the reactants, {{and the potential for}} very high conversion efficiencies, can result in definite advantages for the D-He- 3 cycle with respect to DT fusion and fission reactors in the twenty-first century. More specifically, the D-He- 3 cycle can accomplish the following: (1) eliminate the need for deep geologic waste burial facilities and the wastes can qualify for Class A, near-surface land burial; (2) allow 'inherently safe' reactors to be built that, under the worst <b>conceivable</b> <b>accident,</b> cannot cause a civilian fatality or result in a significant (greater than 100 mrem) exposure to a member of the public; (3) reduce the radiation damage levels to a point where no scheduled replacement of reactor structural components is required, i. e., full reactor lifetimes (approximately 30 FPY) can be credibly claimed; (4) increase the reliability and availability of fusion reactors compared to DT systems because of the greatly reduced radioactivity, the low neutron damage, and the elimination of T breeding; and (5) greatly reduce the capital costs of fusion power plants (compared to DT systems) by as much as 50 percent and present the potential for a significant reduction on the COE.

40|$|The {{recession}} {{of the early}} 1990 âs marked {{the starting point for}} a transformation of the Swedish transportation industry. Cost oriented production techniques by the industryâs customer increased demand on swiftness, reliability and flexibility in transportation services. This development has continued ever since which in turn has continuously increased the rates of harmful discharges of emissions. The research is performed on the Swedish plastic industry and examines the relationship between environmental sustainability, lead time and cost when selecting road carrier for transportations. The main purpose is to examine to what extent environmental concerns are taken into account when deciding over distribution and furthermore, whether there exist potential and ambitions for improvements. Out of theories concerning transportation modal choice, four points of interest constitutes the basis for the empirical gathering; prioritization of selection determinants, environmental requirements in procurement of transportation services, use of rail freight and acceptable cost levels for implementing environmental sustainability. The study shows that the market of the Swedish plastic industry is driven by price competition and constant pressure from international trade. Naturally, cost is considered to be the foremost selection determinant in terms of transportation modal choice, followed by reliability and lead time. Furthermore, the study shows that environment is of low priority in respect to the other selection determinants. Although the current market condition diminishes the possibilities for changes, there exists a general ambition to become more environmental within the distribution activities. A majority of the respondent firms could potentially accept levels of increased transportation costs which balance with the costs of guaranteeing environmental sustainability in road transportations. In reference to increased environmental ambitions, three conclusions can be drawn. The relationship between environmental sustainability, lead time and cost allow for environmental improvements if lead time can be extended to the <b>maximum</b> <b>conceivable</b> limit of the market. Furthermore, the price competition of the market makes own initiatives impossible in terms of raising price for transportations; environmental sustainability in road transportation must therefore be preceded by demand for such. Finally, it can be concluded that environmental improvements cannot be achieved single handedly; costs must be evenly distributed among the suppliers, customers and haulers...|$|R

Since the {{automotive industry}}, {{as well as}} many others, is in need of improvements in this area, this project is focused on developing a new process that joins dissimilar materials with <b>maximum</b> strength <b>conceivable</b> by in part minimizing any brittle intermetallic region that may be formed. If successful, this research would produce a strong, lightweight, and efficient joint. Potentially, the Friction Stir Forming process can meet these criteria and overcome all of the current challenges that other processes are facing in a cheaper way without additional mass from rivets, bolts, or other fasteners. Fillers, chips, and substantial energy for heating can also be avoided. The concept of this process is to heat the top sheet by friction generated by a rotating tool, which simultaneously applies a downward force causing the top sheet to deform into a prefabricated hole in the bottom sheet. A mechanical interlocking joint can be formed with relatively simple machinery and techniques. The first part of this research was focused on exploring the concept feasibility and finding optimized processing parameters such as: spindle and plunge speed, torque, geometrical dimensions of the tools, etc. In the next part of the research, the knowledge gathered from {{the first part of the}} research was carried forward and the focus was applied to adjusting the FSF process for industrial conditions.

This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing the process that joins lightweight dissimilar materials with the <b>maximum</b> strength <b>conceivable</b> and with a minimum brittle intermetallic-formed region. It is difficult to weld these materials together because {{the properties of the}} dissimilar materials are usually prominently different. Friction Stir Forming process can achieve this objective, and it can overcome the current challenges that other processes are facing in a cheaper way without using rivets, bolts, fluids, substantial energy for heating, or additional mass additions. This process can achieve the objective by stir heating one sheet and forming it into a pre-punched or pre-drilled hole in the second sheet. The result is forming a mechanical interlocking joint with minimal mechanical force by using relatively simple machinery and simple techniques. The first part of this research was focused on exploring the feasibility of concept and finding the optimal values of the important parameters such as spindle and plunge speed, torque, geometrical dimensions of the tools, etc. This experimental step gathered necessary data in order to set up a foundation for the following finite element analysis (FEA) work.

40|$|Abstract. Clinical and {{experimental}} {{studies suggest that}} acute or chronic renal injury could occur after certain types of radiation accidents. Such renal injury could be life-threatening in its own right, could exacerbate other radiation injuries and could complicate the treatment of non-radiation injuries. The clinical experience with therapeutic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) indicates that acute renal failure is <b>conceivable</b> in radiation <b>accident</b> victims who receive BMT, and there are experimental data that suggest that radiation-induced bone marrow aplasia could exacerbate acute renal failure caused by other agents. Both the experimental data and the clinical experience with therapeutic BMT also suggest that chronic renal failure could occur after radiation accidents if the bilateral renal dose exceeded 4 â 5 Gy and if bone marrow toxicity was avoided by partial body shielding or therapeutic interventions. In addition, clinical experience using radiolabelled biologicals in cancer therapy shows that internal deposition of certain types of radioactive material can cause chronic renal failure. There is clinical evidence that the progression of established chronic radiation-induced renal injury can be attenuated by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists. There is also pre-clinical evidence {{that the risk of}} radiation-induced chronic renal failure can be reduced through prophylactic use of ACE inhibitors or AII receptor antagonists, and a randomised clinical trial of this approach is in progress...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of novae may be divided roughly into two separate stages: quiescence and outburst. However, at closer inspection, both stages cannot be separated. It should be attempted to explain features in both stages {{with a similar}} model. Various simple models to explain the observed light and spectral observations during post optical <b>maximum</b> activity are <b>conceivable.</b> In instantaneous ejection models, all or nearly all material is ejected in a time that is short compared with the duration of post optical maximum activity. Instantaneous ejection type 1 models are those where the ejected material is in a fairly thin shell, the thickness of which remains small. In the instantaneous ejection type 2 model ('Hubble Flow'), a thick envelope is ejected instantaneously. This envelope remains thick as different parts have different velocities. Continued ejection models {{emphasize the importance of}} winds from the nova after optical maximum. Ejection is supposed to occur from one of the components of the central binary, and one can imagine a general swelling of one of the components, so that something resembling a normal, almost stationary, stellar photosphere is observed after optical maximum.

30|$|The Noto Hanto {{earthquake}} struck one of {{the lowest}} earthquake probability regions on the national seismic hazard map of Japan. To contribute to future updates of the hazard map, we examined the predictability of the 2007 earthquake on the basis of geological data that were available before it occurred. Sonic prospecting profiles of active faulting and the absence of an onshore fault could have limited the potential rupture length to 12 â 15 km, similar to the 2007 source. Empirical relationships between magnitude and fault length would have given us Mj = 6.6 â 6.8 and Mw = 6.3 â 6.4. The emergence of one marine terrace, which inclines to the south and reaches an altitude of approximately 50 m, can be dated to 120 â 130 ka and yields an uplift rate of approximately 0.4 mm/year. Mw-displacement empirical relationships and examples of recent blind fault events that have occurred at various locations around the world suggest that the <b>conceivable</b> <b>maximum</b> coseismic uplift of such shocks is 40 â 70 cm. Together with the uplift rate, we would have obtained an average recurrence interval of 1000 â 2000 years and, consequently, a 1.5 â 3.0 % time-independent (Poisson) probability for 30 years. In addition, the significant inclination of the marine terracesâ 3.2 per mille (0.32 %)âis better explained by the accumulation of frequent southward tilting as large as that of the 2007 type event with approximately 1600 -year intervals, without any significant contributions from other seismic sources. We therefore conclude that the Noto Hanto earthquake source would have been better evaluated and identified if we had taken into account not only major active faults but also the active tectonics of moderate-size faults and their associated scale and rate.|$|R
