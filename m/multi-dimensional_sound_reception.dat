40|$|Whales receive {{underwater}} sounds {{through a}} fundamentally different mechanism than their close terrestrial relatives. Instead of hearing through the ear canal, cetaceans hear through specialized fatty tissues {{leading to an}} evolutionarily novel feature: an acoustic funnel located anterior to the tympanic aperture. We traced the ontogenetic development of this feature in 56 fetal specimens from 10 different families of toothed (odontocete) and baleen (mysticete) whales, using X-ray computed tomography. We also charted ear ossification patterns through ontogeny to understand the impact of heterochronic developmental processes. We determined that the acoustic funnel arises from a prominent V-shaped structure established early in ontogeny, formed by the malleus and the goniale. In odontocetes, this V-formation develops into a cone-shaped funnel facing anteriorly, directly into intramandibular acoustic fats, which is likely functionally linked to the anterior orientation of <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> in echolocation. In contrast, the acoustic funnel in balaenopterids rotates laterally, later in fetal development, consistent with a lateral <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> pathway. Balaenids and several fossil mysticetes retain a somewhat anteriorly oriented acoustic funnel in the mature condition, indicating that a lateral <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> pathway in balaenopterids may be a recent evolutionary innovation linked to specialized feeding modes, such as lunge-feeding...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{concerns about}} the effects of anthropogenic noise on baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti), we lack basic information about their auditory physiology for comprehensive risk assessments. Hearing ranges and sensitivities could be measured if customized equipment and methods were developed based on how baleen whales receive <b>sound.</b> However, <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> pathways in baleen whales are currently unknown. This thesis presents an integrative approach to understanding hearing in baleen whales through dissections, biomedical imaging, biochemical analyses, and modeling sound propagation through a whale head using the Finite Element Method (FEM). We focused on the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) because {{it is one of the}} smallest and most abundant mysticete species, reducing logistical difficulties for dissections and experiments. We discovered a large, well-formed fat body extending from the blubber region to the ears and contacting the ossicles. Although odontocetes, or toothed whales, are thought to use specialized "acoustic fats" for <b>sound</b> <b>reception,</b> no such tissues had been described for mysticetes to date. Our study indicates that the basic morphology and biochemical composition of the minke whale "ear fats" are very different from those of odontocete acoustic fats. However, the odontocete and mysticete fatty tissues share some characteristics, such as being conserved even during starvation, containing fewer dietary signals compared to blubber, and having well-defined attachments to the tympano-periotic complex, which houses the middle and inner ears. FE models of the whale head indicated that the ear fats caused a slight increase in the total pressure magnitude by the ears, and this focusing effect could be attributed to the low density and low sound speed of the ear fats in the models. Fatty tissues are known to have lower densities and sound speeds than other types of soft tissues, which may explain why they are an important component of the auditory system of odontocetes, and perhaps mysticete cetaceans as well. In an aquatic habitat where the pinna and air-filled ear canal are no longer effective at collecting and focusing so'und towards the ears, we propose that both odontocete and mysticete cetaceans have incorporated fatty tissues into their auditory systems for underwater <b>sound</b> <b>reception.</b> by Maya Yamato.

This thesis investigates sound production and <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> in several species of cicadas from Portugal as an approach to the tasks faced by the participants in an acoustic communication system. The problem for a sender is to produce detectable and specific sound signals, whereas the receiver must detect the signals, locate the sound source, and recognise the message. The diversity and specificity of the sound signals in the time-amplitude pattern and in the frequency domain were illustrated in several cicada species: Cicada barbara lusitanica, C. orni, tettigetta argentata/atra, Tett. estrellae, Tett. josei, Tettigetta sp, Tibicina quadrisignata and Tympanistalna gastrica. The morphology of the timbal and other structures related to sound production and <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> was also studied. The time pattern of the timbal muscle contraction and the sound pulses produced in each timbal cycle were described for some of those species during the generation of the calling song and the alarm signal, as well as the bilateral coordination of the timbals. Important differences among species were found concerning all these aspects. Moreover, this study also demonstrated that the contractions of the timbal muscles cannot be responsible for the amplitude and frequency modulations exhibited by the songs. Several mechanisms by which sound modulation is achieved were studied: 1) The tensor muscle is used to modify the timbal mechanics in several species under the same physical principle - a more convex, and thus stiffer, timbal generates louder sounds when buckled. However, in different cicadas the contraction of the tensor muscle can cause either a large increase (Tett. argentata/atra, Tett. josei) or an extensive decrease in the amplitude of the sound pulsesAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 6, 2011) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 56 - 62) Odontocete mandibles serve multiple functions, including feeding and hearing. One hypothesis is that sound enters the hearing apparatus via the pan bone of the posterior mandibles (Norris, 1968). Another viewpoint, based on computer models, suggests that sound enters primarily through the gular apparatus and the opening created by the absent medial wall of the posterior mandibles. The posterior region of each mandibular ramus has a large, hollow cavity called the mandibular foramen that contains a bulging mandibular fat body (MFB), which terminates on the bony tympanoperiotic complex. The acoustic properties of these fat bodies suggest that they refract sound. This unambiguous link between form and function has catalyzed this current study of mandibular shape. Previous studies have described odontocete mandibles using linear morphometrics and focused on multiple populations within single genera. Geometric Morphometrics (GM) is used to avoid some limitations of linear morphometric studies, using relative 3 -D landmark positions instead of lengths. This technique measures shape only, excluding any scaling, rotational, and positional effects. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to use GM to quantify mandibular shape across all major lineages of Odontoceti. Eighty-five mandibles, comprised of 40 species, representing all major lineages were included in the shape analysis. Twelve landmarks found on each mandible represent regions of the symphysis and mandibular foramen. The majority of shape variation was found in Jaw Flare and Symphysis Elongation (85. 5 %). Shape differences in the mandibular foramen also accounts for a portion the total variation (10. 9 %). The mandibles are an integral component of the <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> apparatus in toothed whales and the geometry of the mandibular foramen likely plays a role in hearing. The second objective {{of this study is to}} assess correlates of hearing and mandibular foramen geometry derived from the GM shape analysis, as well as from linear morphometrics. Echolocation peak frequency (EPF) was used as a measure of <b>sound</b> <b>reception.</b> Odontocete anatomy may emphasize frequencies they need to hear and suppress others in a returning echo during echolocation. Frequencies can be characterized by corresponding wavelengths. Surface area between the four landmarks that represent the mandibular foramen was calculated to assess the relationship between EPF and dimensions of a receiving structure (i. e. mandibular foramen and corresponding MFB). A significant relationship between size of the foramen and EPF was found, suggesting that size of the foramen may limit lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) from propagating through the mandibular fat body. The final objective of this study is to examine the amount of phylogenetic signal in the observed morphological variation as well as examine the patterns of mandibular shape evolution. The phylogenetic signal is significant in Jaw Flare and Symphysis Elongation and mandibular foramen shapes. Mandibular foramen shapes, however, may be shaped by other selective pressures. It appears that the shape of the foramen has an optimum shape in the entire toothed whale lineage, perhaps an optimum for <b>sound</b> <b>reception.</b> Phylogenetic relationships may account for mandibular shape on different levels and selective pressures may drive shape variation in less inclusive clades. Convergences among clades is also apparent within Jaw Flare and Symphysis Elongation shapes, indicating a selective force drove two lineages to similar jaw shapes...|$|R

Geometric array construction that facilitates sound source localization is taken into consideration.

2500|$|The {{hair cells}} in the organ of Corti are tuned to certain sound {{frequencies}} by way of their location in the cochlea, due {{to the degree of}} stiffness in the basilar membrane.

[...] Since its stiffness is high there, it allows only high-frequency vibrations to move the basilar membrane, and thus the hair cells. [...] The farther a wave travels towards the cochlea's apex (the helicotrema), the less stiff the basilar membrane is; thus lower frequencies travel down the tube, and the less-stiff membrane is moved most easily by them where the reduced stiffness allows: [...] that is, as the basilar membrane gets less and less stiff, waves slow down and it responds better to lower frequencies.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of the ear is sound recepction, particularly the detection of amplitude and frequency of the sound waves by Corti's organ. The latter is a sensory structure located in the cochlear duct (middle scale), consisting of hair cells lying above the basilar membrane. The cochlear duct is surrounded by two cavities containing perilymph: the scala vestibularis and the scala tympani. The <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> mechanism involves several other components of the ear such as malleus, incus and stapes, in the tympanic cavity, and the oval and round windows. The movement of the stapes on the oval window, that is adjacent to the scala vestibularis, generates pressure waves in the perilymph along the vestibular canal. The round window, that separates the scala tympani from the tympanic cavity, moves to compensate for oval window movements. The malfunction of the inner ear, due to specific diseases, could be corrected by use of the drugs such as gentamicin that reaches the cochlea through the round window.

40|$|In {{the ear of}} {{the desert}} locust {{frequency}} analysis arises from the mechanical properties of the tympanal membrane. Incident sound is spatially decomposed into discrete frequency components through a tympanal travelling wave that funnels mechanical energy to specific tympanal locations, where distinct groups of mechanoreceptor neurones project. Initial analysis of the travelling waves employs conventional, steady state FFT, allowing {{a detailed analysis of}} the spatial composition of different frequencies onto the membrane. To further understand the exact mechanics of the tympanal travelling wave, its motion was also measured in the time domain to characterise its response to single impulse and single frequency stimuli, with a resolution of 390 ns. This allows the measurement of instantaneous wave velocity and the direct observation of wave compression across the tympanum. The locust tympanal membrane locust exploits tonotopic frequency analysis, in a similar sense to that of the travelling waves of von Békésy on the mammalian basilar membrane. However, von Békésy's wave is born from interactions between the anisotropic basilar membrane and surrounding incompressible fluids, whereas the locust's wave rides on an anisotropic membrane suspended in air.

There is a clear sexual dimorphism in the tympanal mechanics. The large male tympanum is unexpectedly insensitive to the dominant frequency of its own calling song, possibly a reflection of its dual purpose as a sound emitter and receiver. The small female tympanum appears to be mechanically sensitive to the dominant frequency of the male calling song and to high-frequency sound, a capacity never suspected before in these insects. This sexual dimorphism probably results from a set of selective pressures acting in divergent directions, which {{are linked to the}} different role of the sexes in <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> and production.
