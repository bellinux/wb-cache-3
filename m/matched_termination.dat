We analyze a device geometry of a straight one-dimensional microsize silicon rod, where a longitudinal acoustic wave is generated and detected using capacitive transducers. Linear, isotropic, and nondispersive acoustic-wave propagation is assumed. Based on the calculation of the electromechanical impedance, an electrical equivalent model is derived for the acoustic transmission line.

Two different configurations of the single-layer six-port networks, one conventional and the other nonconventional, are designed, fabricated, and measured. The six-port network based on the conventional configuration is formed by one Wilkinson divider and three couplers, with one unused port terminated with a coaxial <b>match</b> <b>termination.</b> The nonconventional six-port network, proposed here, is constructed using a similar configuration except one of the couplers {{is replaced by a}} quadrature power divider eliminating the need for <b>match</b> <b>termination.</b> To obtain fully planar device with wideband operation, the six-port networks use double-stage Wilkinson dividers, disk type couplers, and a wireless via 90 ° phase shifter.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{techniques for}} global high-speed signaling over long (~ 10 mm) lossy chip-serial transmission lines. With {{the increase in}} clock frequencies to multi-GHz rates, it has become impossible to move data across a die in a single clock cycle using conventional parallel bus-based communication. There are also reliability problems due to timing errors, skew, and jitter in fully synchronous systems. Noise, coupling, and inductive effects become significant for both intermediate length and global routing. A new on-chip lossy transmission line technique is developed and new driver and receiver circuitry for on-chip serial links are described. High-speed long-range serial signaling is best done over transmission lines. However, because of the relatively high sheet resistance of metal interconnect layers, on-chip transmission lines tend to be lossy. <b>Matched</b> <b>termination</b> with resistors and the proper selection of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line structure can effectively suppress ISI. Fast digital CMOS technology allows pulsed mode data drivers to operate at multi-GHz rates. A phase-tuned receiver samples and de-serializes the received signal. Since the sampling instant is tuned to match the received signal eye, there is no requirement to match the clock and signal routing or clock and signal delays. A complete self-testing on-chip transceiver communicating over a 5. 8 mm on-chip transmission line is implemented in 0. 13 um CMOS and tested. The measured BER at 9 Gbps is less than 10 ^- 10. Interleaving is usually necessary in high serial data rate serializer and de-serializer circuits. Multi-stage LC oscillators {{can be used to}} generate low phase noise multi-phases clocks required for interleaving. Conventional coupling between oscillators introduces out of phase currents, and this out of phase current causes a lower effective quality factor for each oscillator stage. However, capacitive coupling, a new technique, introduces in phase coupling between stages. Increased coupling with a ring of capacitors decreases phase spacing error dramatically and, in addition, the phase noise of multi-stages is also decreased thanks to in-phase coupling...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{measuring}} the dielectric {{properties of materials}} - <b>matched</b> <b>termination</b> and coaxial line resonance- have been developed and used to study the properties of two groups of nitrogen ceramics, namely, silicon nitrides and oxynitride glasses. In these methods advantage is taken of the wide frequency range, from 500 MHz up to about 9 GHz, covered by a single apparatus - the General Radio slotted coaxial line. Previous measurements in this Department have indicated the difficulties in {{the determination of the}} loss tangent of low to medium loss samples (tan Ỏ ~ 10 (^- 3) - 10 (^- 2)). The two methods developed reduced these difficulties. The applicability of these methods was assessed using known materials including the high loss liquids water and chlorobenzene, medium loss solutions of chlorobenzene in cyclohexane and the low loss solids polymethyl methacrylate and polytetrafluoroethylene. The silicon nitride ceramics were in various degrees of nitridation given by the weight gain which ranged from 38 % for partially-nitrided to a maximum of 63. 2 % for the fully-nitrided samples. The dielectric constant at 1 GHz increased from 4. 51 for fully-nitrided to about 9. 9 for the 38 % weight gain samples. The fully-nitrided material has a loss factor of 7. 6 x 10 (^- 3); this increased to 1. 85 x l 0 (^- 1) as the weight gain decreased to 38 %. These values have been extrapolated to 'zero weight gain' and compared with pure silicon for which the dielectric constant is 11. 7 and the loss factor approximately 0. 2. The oxynitrides have dielectric constants between 6. 5 and 7. 5 depending on the cation present and the percentage of nitrogen substituted for oxygen in the glasses. Є' increased in the cation order Mg, Y, Ca and increased with increasing nitrogen substitution in each cation series. The loss factor, however, depends not only on these cation types but also on the other constituents of the glasses. The dielectric constant of both the silicon nitride ceramics and oxynitride glasses fitted the Jonscher universal law of dielectric response (Є' - Є) w(^n- 1), where the exponent n - 1 for all the samples. Similarly, the loss factor for these materials showed a frequency dependence Є" w(^n- 1), again with n approximately 1.

40|$|In {{this article}} I develop a dynamic {{assignment}} model where matches {{are subjected to}} persistent idiosyncratic shocks. The model nests two independent models commonly used in the matching literature that have highlighted {{different aspects of the}} data. On one hand, there is ex ante heterogeneity as in traditional assignment models, so the equilibrium distribution of the match surplus between partners depends on the distributions of both types of agent characteristics in the economy (Roy (1951), Tinbergen (1951) and Koopmans and Beckmann (1957)). On the other hand, the model incorporates the fact that match outcomes are subjected to match–specific shocks, which may eventually lead to <b>match</b> <b>termination</b> (Jovanovic (1979)).

40|$|The best {{backplane}} designs {{allow the}} components {{to operate at}} peak efficiency. Minimizing compromises and enhancing all design parameters enable backplanes {{to do more with}} less. To increase efficiency, for example, the I/O technology chosen should allow the backplane to run at maximum frequency. This is achieved by minimizing impedance discontinuities and noise and by carefully <b>matching</b> <b>termination</b> design. The alternative to optimizing I/O technology is selection of higher drive and speed technology and operation at slower than optimum speeds. The first method – choice of the correct I/O technology – reduces overall cost and delivers better signal integrity than the second “brute force ” method. An optimized backplane will use less power, generate little noise, have better signal integrity, and be less costly. For this reason, it is key for the designer to understand how the components interact with each other when laying out a backplane.

40|$|Society’s {{dependence}} on electronic and electrical systems has increased rapidly {{over the past}} few decades, and people are relying more and more on these gadgets in their daily life because of the efficiency in operation which these systems can offer. This has revolutionized many areas of electrical and electronics engineering including power sector, telecommunication sector, transportation and many other allied areas. With progress in time, the sophistication in the systems also increased. Also as the systems size reduced from micro level to nano level, the compactness of the systems increased. This paved the way for development in the digital electronics leading to new and efficient IC 0 s that came into existence. Power sector also faced a resurge in its technology. Most of the analog meters are now replaced by digital meters. The increased sophistication and compactness in the digital system technology made it susceptible to electromagnetic interference especially from High Power Electromagnetic Sources. Communication, data processing, sensors, and similar electronic devices are vital parts of the modern technological environment. Damage or failures in these devices could lead to technical or financial disasters as well as injuries or the loss of life. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) can be explained as any malicious generation of electromagnetic energy introducing noise or signals into electric and electronic systems, thus disrupting, confusing or damaging these systems. The disturbance may interrupt, obstruct, or otherwise degrade or limit the effective performance of the circuit. These effects can range from a simple degradation of data to a total loss of data. The source may be any object, artificial or natural, that carries rapidly changing electrical currents, such as an electrical circuit. The sources of electromagnetic interference can be either unintentional or intentional. The sources producing electromagnetic interference can be of different power levels, different frequency of operation and of different field strength. One such classification of these sources are the High Power Electromagnetic Sources (HPEM) High Power Electromagnetic environment refers to sources producing very high peak electromagnetic fields at very high power levels. These power levels coupled with the extremely high magnitude of the fields are sufficient to cause disastrous effects on the electrical and electronic systems. There {{has been a lot of}} developments in the field of the source technology of HPEM sources so that they are now one of the strongest sources of electromagnetic interference. High Power Electromagnetic environment refers to the sources producing very high peak electromagnetic fields at very high power levels. These power levels coupled with the extremely high magnitude of the fields are sufficient to cause disastrous effects on the electrical and electronic systems. HPEM environments are categorized based on the source characteristics such as the peak electric field, often called threat level, frequency coverage or bandwidth, average power density and energy content. The sources of electromagnetic interference can be either unintentional or intentional. Some examples of unintentional sources are the increased use of electromagnetic spectrum which generates disturbance to various systems operating in that frequency band, poor design of systems without taking care of other systems present nearby as well as lightning. Intentional sources are High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) or Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (NEMP) due to nuclear detonations, Ultra Wide Band (UWB) field from Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRA), Nar-row band fields like those coming from High Power Microwaves (HPM), High Intensity Radio Frequency (HIRF) sources. Of these the lightning is natural and all other sources are man-made. The significant progress in the Intentional High-Power Electromagnetic (HPEM) sources and antenna technologies and the easy access to simple HPEM systems for anyone entail the need to determine the susceptibility of electronic equipment as well as coupling of these fields with systems such as cables (buried as well as aerial), airborne vehicle etc. to these types of threats. Buried cables are widely used in the communication and power sectors due to their efficient functioning in urban cities and towns. These cables are more prone to electromagnetic interferences from HPEM sources. The buried communication cables or even the buried data cables are connected to sensitive equipments and hence even a slight rise in the voltage or the current at the terminals of the equipments can become a serious problem for the smooth operation of the system. In the first part of the thesis the effect of the electromagnetic field due to these sources on the cables laid underground has been studied. The second part of this thesis deals with the study of the interaction of the EM field from the above mentioned HPEM sources with an airborne vehicle. Airborne vehicle and its payload are extremely expensive so that any destruction to these as a result of the voltages and currents induced on the vehicle on account of the incoming HPEM fields can be quite undesirable. The incoming electromagnetic fields will illuminate the vehicle along its axis which results in the induction of currents and voltages. These currents and voltages will get coupled to the internal control circuits that are extremely sensitive. If the induced voltage/ current magnitude happen to be above the damage threshold level of these circuits then it will result in either a malfunction of the circuit or a permanent damage of it, with both of them being detrimental to the success of the mission. This will even result in the abortion of the mission or possible degradation of the vehicle performance. Hence it is worthwhile to see what will be the influence of an incoming HPEM electromagnetic field on the airborne vehicle with and without the presence of an exhaust plume. In this work, the HPEM sources considered are NEMP, IRA and HPM. The electromagnetic fields produced by the EMP can induce large voltage and current transients in electrical and electronic circuits which can lead to a possible malfunction or permanent damage of the systems. The electric field at the earth 0 s surface can be modelled as a double exponential pulse as per the IEC standard 61000 - 2 - 9. The NEMP field incident on the earth’s surface is considered as that coming from a source at a distance far away from the earth’s surface; hence a plane wave approximation has been used. Impulse radiating antennas are the ones that are used as the major source of ultra wide band radiation. These are highly powerful antennas that use a pulsed power source as the input and this power source is conditioned to get an extremely sharp rise time pulse. These antennas are very high power antennas that are capable of producing a significant electromagnetic field. Impulse radiating antenna is a paraboloidal reflector and hence is an aperture antenna. Initially the radiated field due to this aperture needs to be found out at any observation point from the antenna. In this thesis, the aperture distribution method is used to accurately determine the field due to the aperture. In this method the field reflected from the surface of the reflector is first found on an imaginary plane through the focal point of the reflector that is normal to the axis of the reflector, by using the principles of geometrical optics, which then is extended to the observation point. The IRA considered for the present work is the one of the most powerful IRA as per the published literature available in the open domain. This has an input voltage of 1. 025 MV. The far field electric field measured at the boresight (at r = 85 m) being equal to 62 kV/m, and the uncorrected pulse rise time (10 %- 90 %) is 180 ps for this IRA. HPM sources are usually electromagnetic radiators having a reflector with a horn antenna kept at their focal point for excitation. HPM sources generally operate in single mode or at tens or hundreds of Hz repetition rates. Many HPM radiators are developed in the world each with their own peculiar geometry and power levels. In the present thesis, a single waveguide (WR- 975) fed HPM antenna assembly has been studied. The chosen waveguide has a cut-o_ frequency of 1 GHz and a power level of 10 GW. The wavelength associated with the waveguide is 0. 3 m. The field pattern shows a definite peak in its response when the frequency is 1 GHz, the cut-off frequency of the waveguide. The electric field coming out of the HPEM sources travel through the medium that is either air alone or a combination of air and soil respectively depending upon whether the circuit on which the coupling is analysed is an airborne vehicle or an underground cable. The media plays a major role in the coupling, as the field magnitude is influenced by the characteristic properties of the media. As height increases the magnitude of the electric field decreases for all types of sources and also the time before which the field waveform starts is increased. The electric field in the soil is decided by the soil properties such as its conductivity and permittivity. The soil is modelled in frequency domain and the high frequency behaviour of soils is considered with its conductivity and permittivity taken as functions of frequency, as the incident field has high frequency components. A soil medium can be electromagnetically viewed as a four component dielectric mixture consisting of soil particles, air voids, bound water, and free water. When electric field is incident on the soil, it gets polarized. This is as a result of a wide variety of processes, including polarization of electrons in the orbits around atoms, distortion of molecules, reorientation of water molecules, accumulation of charge at interfaces, and electrochemical reactions. Whatever is the HPEM source, an increase in the soil conductivity results in an increased attenuation of the field. Also there is a significant loss of high frequency components in the GHz range in the field due to the selective absorption by the soil. This effect causes the percentage attenuation to be maximum for HPM and minimum for NEMP and IRA lying in between these two extremities. Increase in permittivity of the soil causes attenuation of the electric field for all HPEM sources. This is due to the relaxation mechanisms in the soil due to atomic- or molecular-scale resonances. The coupling of the electromagnetic fields due to HPEM sources is considered in the first phase. Two cables are considered (i) buried shielded and (ii) buried shielded twisted pair cables. The results are arrived at using the Enhanced Transmission Line model. The induced current is more for a shielded cable than a twisted pair cable of the same configuration. The induced current magnitude depends upon the type of the HPEM source, the depth of burial of the cable and the point on the cable where the current/ voltage is computed. Current is maximum at the centre of the cable for a <b>matched</b> <b>termination</b> and the voltage is the minimum at this point. The ratio of the induced current in the inner conductor with respect to the shield current of a shielded cable is the least for an HPM, and maximum for NEMP. This is due to the fact that higher frequencies are absorbed more by the shield of the cable. This affects HPM induced current the maximum and NEMP the least because of the presence of the lower frequency components in NEMP. Induced current in the twisted pair cable depends upon the number of pairs of the cable and the pitching of the cable. The electromagnetic field from the HPEM sources propagates with less attenuation in air due to the lower resistance this medium offers for electromagnetic wave propagation. Hence any system in air, be it electrical or electronic, will be under the strong illumination by these electromagnetic fields. As the second part of this thesis, the influence of the electromagnetic fields from all the three HPEM sources on an airborne vehicle in flight is analysed. For this part of study, the Electromagnetic (EM) fields radiated by all the three sources at different heights from the earth 0 s surface have been computed. The coupling study has been done for the case of a vehicle with plume as well as without plume. For the second case, the electromagnetic modelling of the plume has been done taking into consideration its conductivity, which in turn depends on the different ionic species present in the plume. The species of the exhaust plume depends upon the chemical reactions taking place in the combustion chamber of the nozzle of the vehicle. The presence of the alkali metals as impurity in the airborne vehicle propellant will generate considerable ion particles such as Na+, Cl in addition to e- in the plume mixture during combustion which makes the plume electrically conducting. But it does not influence the pressure, temperature and velocity of the plume. After the nozzle throat, the exhaust plume regains the supersonic speed, so the flow of the exhaust plume is assumed as compressible flow in the second region. The electrons have high collision frequency, high number density, high plasma frequency and lower molecular mass and hence the highly mobile electrons dominate the heavy ion particle in the computation of the electrical conductivity of the plume. The plume conductivity decreases marginally from the axis till a distance equal to the nozzle radius but the peak value increases sharply towards the exit plane edge of the nozzle radius. The induced current is computed using Method of Moments. The induced current depends upon the type of interference source, its characteristics, whether the plume is present or not and the type of the plume. The HPM induces maximum current in the vehicle because of the fact that the plume has a tendency to become more conductive at these frequencies. The induced currents due to the EM fields from IRA and NEMP comes after the HPM. The presence of the plume enhances the magnitude of the induced current. If the plume is homogeneous then the current induced in it is more...|$|E

This new structure type has been renamed RDDS 1, and the first of this series, RDDS 1, is presently under design and fabrication. The carefully sculpted cell profile (fabricated on computer controlled lathes at KEK incorporating diamond point machining) provides a 20 % increase in shunt impedance which, when combined with other parameters, allows for a dramatic reduction in the RF power required for the NLC (Next Linear Collider). The detuning profile, damping manifold taper, and the cell to manifold coupling contant profile have all been carefully optimised so as to permit decoupling the cells at the ends of the structure from the manifolds while still adequately minimising the transverse wake.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{performed}} self-consistent, three-dimensional (3 -D), time-domain calculations for a bounded-wave electro-magnetic pulse simulator. The simulator {{consists of a}} constant-impedance transverse electromagnetic structure driven by a charged capacitor, discharging through a fast closing switch. These simulations yield the detailed 3 -D electromagnetic field structure {{in the vicinity of}} the simulator. The prepulse seen in these simulations can be explained quan-titatively in terms of capacitive coupling across the switch and the known charging waveform across the capacitor. Placement of a test object within the simulator significantly modifies the electric fields within the test volume, in terms of field strength as well as the frequency spectrum. This means that, for a given simulator, larger objects would be subjected to somewhat lower frequencies. The E-field waveform experienced by a small test object is reasonably close to that for free-space illumination, but the mismatch increases with object size. The use of a resistive sheet as a <b>matching</b> <b>termination</b> signifi-cantly reduces radiation leakage as compared to two parallel re-sistive rods. For a given termination, larger test objects marginally reduce leakage. A physical interpretation of these conclusions is also included.

40|$|To control reflections, the {{impedance}} {{of integrated}} circuit output pad drivers must be matched to {{the impedance of}} the transmission lines to which the pads are connected. HP’s HSTL (high-speed transceiver logic) controlled impedance I/O pads use an on-chip impedance matching network that compensates for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Transmission line reflections {{are one of the}} major factors limiting high-speed I/O performance. These reflections can be controlled by matching the driver output impedance to that of the transmission line. Traditional solutions require the use of off-chip components to implement <b>matching</b> <b>termination</b> networks. This adversely impacts board density, reliability, and cost. Integration of the termination network on-chip removes these negative attributes while providing additional advantages. In this paper, we review a solution for an on-chip impedance matching network. Our HSTL (high-speed transceiver logic) family of controlled impedance I/O pads includes single-ended and differential drivers and receivers, along with com-pensation circuitry for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Mea-sured HSTL signal integrity in a large, complex board environment is presented. Parallel versus Series Termination When I/O signal integrity and speed are of utmost importance, many pad designers turn to parallel termination networks. Parallel termination eliminates transmission line reflections. However, parallel termination exacts a costly toll on power dissipation because a dc component is added to power consumption. An alternative termination approach is source series termination. In a point-to-point environment, series termination provides an output driver with a means to absorb incident waves, effectively damping any reflections in the transmission line. Matching a driver’s output impedance to that of the board impedance increases signal integrity and speed while keeping power dissipation to a minimum...|$|R

A beam is deflected {{by both the}} electric and magnetic fields of a TEM wave created by a pulse propagating along the strips in the direction opposite to the beam. Computations of the beam coupling impedances for such structures are difficult because of their length. In the paper, the beam coupling impedances of transmission-line kickers are calculated by combining analytical and numerical methods: the wake potentials computed in short models are extended analytically to obtain the wakes for the long kickers, and then the corresponding beam impedances are derived. At very low frequencies the results are compared with simple analytical expressions for the coupling impedances of striplines in beam position monitors. 1 TRANSMISSION-LINE KICKERS In the planned Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF) [1], the 20 -ns beam bunches will be extracted from the 50 -GeV main proton synchrotron and then will be transported to a target by an elaborated transport system. The beam transport system splits the beam bunches into equal parts in its splitting sections so that up to 12 synchronous beam pulses can be delivered to the target for the multi-axis proton radiography.

40|$|As society becomes {{increasingly}} plagued with crime, poverty, violence, skyrocketing divorce rates and increasing rates of {{drug and alcohol}} abuse, the need to attend carefully to our youth is evident. At the forefront of youth preventative care {{over the past several}} decades has been the mentoring movement. The Big Brothers/Big Sisters (BB/BS) organization stands as a model of effective mentoring, representing the most long-standing, widespread and structured of these efforts. Research has demonstrated that BB/BS has a positive impact on youths involved in the program, including decreased drug and alcohol use, a reduction in violent behaviour, improved school attendance and expectations of school success, and improved relationships with parents. However, these positive effects are contingent upon the formation of longstanding and meaningful relationships with youths. Unfortunately, national mentoring agencies such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters report that approximately 55 % of matches terminate early and, moreover, that these premature terminations can lead to further declines in functioning for at-risk youth. The current archival study represents the first attempt to predict match duration on the basis of information available at match onset. File information obtained from multiple sources were examined for 196 Big and Little Sister matches within a Big Sisters affiliate of the national BB/BS agency. Results suggests that while the limited predictive accuracy of models does not warrant screening out potential volunteers, it is possible to enhance match formation as well as identify matches in need of extra supervision and support. In particular, attending to practical requests made by Big and Little Sisters (e. g., desire for a Big Sister with access to a vehicle; desire for a Little Sister within a particular age range) and matching dyads in terms of energy levels may prove simple and beneficial tools in matching. Factors which increased the risk of premature <b>match</b> <b>termination</b> included elements of the Little Sister’s family background (i. e., family history of illness or violence, recent move), lack of stability in Big Sister’s housing and employment, and lower Big Sister educational achievement...|$|R
40|$|We {{proceed with}} the study of {{termination}} properties in the double pushout approach to algebraic rewriting, and show a concrete termination criterion for rewriting systems with inhibitors. Inhibitors prevent elements in an algebra to participate in rule <b>matches,</b> so that <b>termination</b> depends only on whether new possibilities for matches are created. The notion of inhibitor can be extended to considering different levels of inhibition, by which the ability of an element {{to participate in a}} match is progressively reduced. We illustrate the approach by considering some application contexts in model transformation...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a modular property of equational proofs, called modularity of normalization, {{for the union}} of term rewrite systems with shared symbols. The idea is, that every normalization with R = R 1 + R 2 may be obtained by first normalizing with R 1 followed by an R 2 normalization. We develop criteria for this that cover non-convergent TRS R, where, as the main restriction, R 1 is required to be left-linear and convergent. As interesting applications we consider solving equations modulo a theory given by a TRS. Here we present a modular narrowing strategy that can be combined with nearly all common narrowing strategies. Furthermore, we also prove some modularity results for decidability of unification and <b>matching</b> (via <b>termination</b> of narrowing). 1 Introduction We study a modular property of equational normalization proofs, called modularity of normalization, for term rewrite systems with shared symbols.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} the design, fabrication, and measurement of backward-wave-cancelled distributed traveling-wave photodetectors. One {{of the fundamental}} issues in traveling-wave photodetectors is the generation of back-ward-waves, which reduces bandwidth or, {{in the case of}} <b>matched</b> input <b>termination,</b> reduces their radio-frequency (RF) efficiencies by up to 6 dB. We report a traveling-wave photodetector with multisection coplanar strip transmission lines. The reflections at the discontinuities of the transmission line cancel the backward propagating waves exactly. The bandwidth reduction due to back-ward-waves is eliminated without sacrificing the RF efficiency. We have demonstrated a broadband backward-wave-cancelled traveling-wave photodetector with three discrete photodiodes. The photodetector is realized in InGaAs/InGaAsP/InP material systems and operates at 1. 55 m. A 3 -dB bandwidth of 38 GHz and a linear RF output of 1 dBm at 40 GHz have been achieved. The experimental results agree very well with the theoretical calculations.

50|$|Electrically, IEEE 488 used a {{hardware}} interface {{that could be}} implemented with some discrete logic or with a microcontroller. The hardware interface enabled devices made by different manufacturers to communicate with a single host. Since each device generated the asynchronous handshaking signals required by the bus protocol, slow and fast devices could be mixed on one bus. The data transfer is relatively slow, so transmission line issues such as impedance <b>matching</b> and line <b>termination</b> are ignored. There was no requirement for galvanic isolation between the bus and devices, which created the possibility of ground loops causing extra noise and loss of data.|$|R

We characterize an efficient segregating equilibrium, in which players only cooperate with others bearing the same symbol.

50|$|Termination can be passive or active. Passive {{termination}} {{means that}} each signal line is terminated by two resistors, 220 Ω to TERMPOWER and 330 Ω to ground. Active termination {{means that there}} is a small voltage regulator which provides a +2.85 V supply. Each signal line is then terminated by a 110 Ω resistor to the +2.85 V supply. Active termination provides a better impedance <b>match</b> than passive <b>termination</b> because most flat ribbon cables have a characteristic impedance of approximately 110 Ω. Forced perfect termination (FPT) is similar to active termination, but with added diode clamp circuits which absorb any residual voltage overshoot or undershoot. There is a special case in SCSI systems that have mixed 8-bit and 16-bit devices where high-byte termination may be required.|$|R

40|$|The {{strip line}} {{electrodes}} of the kickers {{used in the}} transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback systems see significant power deposition by beam and HOM-induced currents. This leads to elevated temperatures of the aluminum electrodes and will ultimately become a limit for the beam current in the Low Energy Ring.

In order to extend the beamcurrent range of these kickers, new electrodes have been fabricated from molybdenum which are able to run at significantly higher temperature, thus greatly increasing {{the efficiency of the}} radiative cooling of the electrodes. Blackening of the electrodes is achieved by oxidation in air at 530 Æ C (1000 Æ F) using a recipe first applied in aviation research for supersonic aircraft.
