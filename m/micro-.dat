5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in <b>micro-</b> and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of <b>micro-</b> and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
5|$|The rose petal's <b>micro-</b> and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E
5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between <b>micro-</b> and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, Giddens {{concludes that}} all social change {{stems from a}} mixture of <b>micro-</b> and macro-level forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrophobic}} {{nature of}} plastic surfaces stimulates rapid formation of biofilms, which support {{a wide range}} of metabolic activities, and drive succession of other <b>micro-</b> and macro-organisms.|$|E
25|$|The LLNL {{engineering}} activities include <b>micro-</b> and nanotechnology, lasers and optics, biotechnology, precision engineering, nondestructive characterization, modeling and simulation, systems and decision science, and sensors, imaging and communications.|$|E
25|$|Paleobotanists {{distinguish}} between <b>micro-</b> and megafossils. Microfossils are primarily spores, either single or in groups. Megafossils are preserved {{parts of plants}} large enough to show structure, such as stem cross-sections or branching patterns.|$|E

25|$|This {{category}} includes {{everything that}} does not fit {{into any of the}} other categories, for example (but not limited to): tunings designated only for a particular piece; non-western intervals and modes; <b>micro-</b> or macro-tones; and “hybrid tunings” combining features of major alternate tuning categories – most commonly an open tuning with the lowest string dropped.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the {{atmosphere}} {{can be divided into}} distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into <b>micro-,</b> meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.|$|E
25|$|In 1902 Webern began {{attending}} {{classes at}} Vienna University. There he studied musicology with Guido Adler, writing his thesis on the Choralis Constantinus of Heinrich Isaac. This interest in early music would greatly influence his compositional technique in later years, especially {{in terms of}} his use of palindromic form on both the <b>micro-</b> and macro-scale and the economical use of musical materials.|$|E
25|$|New {{models are}} {{beginning}} to show how kinetic friction can be greater than static friction. Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction. Surface roughness and contact area affect kinetic friction for <b>micro-</b> and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{encapsulation}} is {{a technology}} {{that has the potential}} to provide a system for the recyclable removal of lead and other ions from polluted sources. Nano-, <b>micro-</b> and milli- capsules, with sizes in the ranges 10nm-1μm,1μm-1mm and >1mm, respectively, are particles that have an active reagent (core) surrounded by a carrier (shell).There are three types of capsule under investigation: alginate-based capsules, carbon nanotubes, polymer swelling capsules. These capsules provide a possible means for the remediation of contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|The neoclassical view ignores much of {{what the}} natural {{sciences}} have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and ecosystem services directly to human communities: <b>micro-</b> and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.|$|E
25|$|Physical cues {{are formed}} by {{creating}} an ordered surface structure {{at the level of}} the microstructure and/or nanostructure. Physical cues on the nanoscale have been shown to modulate cell adhesion, migration, orientation, contact inhibition, gene expression, and cytoskeletal formation. This allows for the direction of cell processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and spreading. There are numerous methods for the manufacture of <b>micro-</b> and nanoscale topographies, which can be divided into those that create ordered topographies and those that create unordered topographies.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{structuration}} {{is a social}} theory of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is based {{in the analysis of}} both structure and agents (see structure and agency), without giving primacy to either. Further, in structuration theory, neither <b>micro-</b> nor macro-focused analysis alone are sufficient. The theory was proposed by sociologist Anthony Giddens, most significantly in The Constitution of Society, which examines phenomenology, hermeneutics, and social practices at the inseparable intersection of structures and agents. Its proponents have adopted and expanded this balanced position. Though the theory has received much criticism, it remains a pillar of contemporary sociological theory.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have {{highlighted}} the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (>100nm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricate macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks. These scaffolds possess macro-, <b>micro-,</b> and nano- structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications. These 3D all-carbon scaffolds/architectures {{may be used for}} the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage, supercapacitors, field emission transistors, high-performance catalysis, photovoltaics, and biomedical devices and implants.|$|E
25|$|The Haas School of Business, in {{conjunction}} with the main UC Berkeley campus, offers an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree intended to provide the knowledge and technical skills necessary for success in the modern business world. Students take core courses in Business Communication, <b>Micro-</b> and Macroeconomics, Managerial and Financial Accounting, Finance, Spreadsheet Decision-Making, Organizational Behavior, Marketing, and Ethics, as well as elective courses in these and other areas. Students often explore their field of interest in electives and can take more advanced courses such as Corporate Valuation, Financial Engineering, and Competitive Strategy. Undergraduates enter Haas {{at the beginning of their}} junior year, and graduate within two years.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposition}} of silica by diatoms may also {{prove to be}} of utility to nanotechnology. Diatom cells repeatedly and reliably manufacture valves of various shapes and sizes, potentially allowing diatoms to manufacture <b>micro-</b> or nano-scale structures which may be of use {{in a range of}} devices, including: optical systems; semiconductor nanolithography; and even vehicles for drug delivery. With an appropriate artificial selection procedure, diatoms that produce valves of particular shapes and sizes might be evolved for cultivation in chemostat cultures to mass-produce nanoscale components. It has also been proposed that diatoms {{could be used as a}} component of solar cells by substituting photosensitive titanium dioxide for the silicon dioxide that diatoms normally use to create their cell walls. Diatom biofuel producing solar panels have also been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Microstructure and nanostructure, {{along with}} {{superstructure}} are three main levels of scaffold structure that deserve consideration when creating scaffold topography. While the superstructure {{refers to the}} overall shape of the scaffold, the microstructure refers to the cellular level structure of the surface and the nanostructure refers to the subcellular level structure of the surface. All three levels of structure are capable of eliciting cell responses; however, there is significant interest in the response of cells to nanoscale topography motivated {{by the presence of}} numerous nanoscale structures within the extracellular matrix. There are a growing number of methods for the manufacture of <b>micro-</b> and nanostructures (many originating from the semiconductor industry) allowing for the creation of various topographies with controlled size, shape, and chemistry.|$|E
25|$|While Morocco {{is already}} a model of water {{management}} in the MENA region, upgrades to its water system under the National Wastewater Management Programme should further improve wastewater treatment and maximise efficient water usage. Authorities are promoting better water rationalisation in agriculture, which uses 80% of water resources, by replacing existing irrigation systems with <b>micro-</b> irrigation and drip networks. A net energy importer, Morocco launched the National Renewable Energy and Efficiency Plan in February 2008 to develop alternative energy to meet 15% of its domestic needs and increase the use of energy-saving methods. It is expected to create more than 40,000 jobs and stimulate over €4.5 billion in investment by 2020. The National Plan for the Development of Solar Thermal Energy, formulated in 2001, aims to install 440,000 solar-powered water heaters by 2012, of which 235,000 are completed.|$|E
25|$|Optical fibers {{can be used}} as {{sensors to}} measure strain, temperature, {{pressure}} and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber. These can be implemented by various <b>micro-</b> and nanofabrication technologies, such that they do not exceed the microscopic boundary of the fiber tip, allowing such applications as insertion into blood vessels via hypodermic needle.|$|E
25|$|For {{patterns}} containing 0.5mg/ml laminin, {{a higher}} proportion of neurites grew on the microdispensed lines than between the lines. On 10mg/ml and 1mg/ml BSA protein patterns and fatty-acid free BSA protein patterns a significant number of neurites avoided the protein lines and grew between the lines. Thus, the fatty-acid-containing BSA lines were just as non-permissive for neurite growth as lines containing BSA with fatty acids. Because microdispensing does not require direct contact with the substrate surfaces, this technique can utilitze surfaces with delicate <b>micro-</b> or nanotopology that could be destroyed by contact. It is possible to vary the amount of protein deposited by dispensing more or less droplets. An advantage of microdispensing is that patterns can be created quickly in 5–10 minutes. Because the piezoelectric microdispenser does not require heating, heat-sensitive proteins and fluids as well as living cells can be dispensed.|$|E
25|$|Since 1985, the Britannica has {{had four}} parts: the Micropædia, the Macropædia, the Propædia, and a two-volume index. The Britannicas {{articles}} {{are found in}} the <b>Micro-</b> and Macropædia, which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 Macropædia has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 Micropædia has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors. The Micropædia articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the Macropædia. The Macropædia articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere. The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states. The 2013 edition of Britannica contained approximately forty thousand articles.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests {{they will have}} an important role in nanotechnology engineering. The highest tensile strength of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube has been tested to be 63GPa. Carbon nanotubes were found in Damascus steel from the 17th century, possibly helping to account for the legendary strength of the swords made of it. Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (>1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricated macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks.

25|$|The {{history of}} calpain {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} “calcium-activated neutral protease” (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the lysosome and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the cathepsin family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain’s role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name “calpain”, to recognize it as a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, papain. Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed μ("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. calpain I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names reflect {{the fact that they are}} activated by <b>micro-</b> and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E
25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, <b>micro-</b> and macro-level of tissues.|$|E

500|$|Digital {{camouflage}} {{provides a}} disruptive effect {{through the use}} of pixellated patterns at a range of scales, meaning that the camouflage helps to defeat observation at a range of distances. Such patterns were first developed during the Second World War, when Johann Georg Otto Schick designed a number of patterns for the Waffen-SS, combining <b>micro-</b> and macro-patterns in one scheme. The German Army developed the idea further in the 1970s into Flecktarn, which combines smaller shapes with dithering; this softens the edges of the large scale pattern, making the underlying objects harder to discern. Pixellated shapes pre-date computer aided design by many years, already being used in Soviet Union experiments with camouflage patterns, such as [...] "TTsMKK" [...] developed in 1944 or 1945.|$|E
