5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human <b>malignancies.</b> CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in a study by Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{etiology}} of anemia is multifactorial in diabetes and covers inflammation, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, medications and hormonal changes, {{in addition to}} the kidney diseases or may be <b>malignancy.</b> In this study, it was aimed to study the profile of the <b>malignancy</b> in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and anemia. Materials and Methods: The files of the follow-up patients with type 2 diabetes were retrospectively reviewed and 103 patients with type 2 DM and anemia were included in the study. The demographic, hematological and biochemical analysis of the data was performed in the diabetic patients with anemia. The frequency of <b>malignancy</b> in diabetic patients with anemia, the {{etiology of}} <b>malignancy,</b> the relationship between the presence of <b>malignancy</b> and anemia type and depth, biochemical parameters in the determination of <b>malignancy,</b> the effects of endoscopic and imaging methods, the presence of anemia in patients without <b>malignancy</b> and the effect of in-depth glomerular filtration rate were investigated. Results: The iron deficiency anemia (69. 9 %) was the most common. <b>Malignancy</b> was found in 11 of the 103 patients (10. 7 %). 2 patients (1. 9 %) had stomach cancer, 4 patients (6. 3 %) had colon cancer in endoscopic procedures. In computerized tomography images, 5 patients were found to be malignant {{in addition to the}} stomach and colon cancer. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significantly higher in the group with <b>malignancy.</b> No correlation was found between <b>malignancy</b> and anemia type and depth. Conclusion: Screening for <b>malignancy</b> should be considered in diabetic patients with anemia, especially in patients with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, regardless of the type and depth of the anemia. In addition, tomography should be recommended for <b>malignancy</b> screening in diabetic patients with anemia that have a normal gastrointestinal examination...|$|R

All ND fine needle aspirations (FNAs) that were performed under ultrasound guidance by an interventional radiologist with rapid on-site evaluation {{were included in the}} study. Slides were reevaluated to identify the cause of inadequacy as "qualitative" or "quantitative. " The <b>malignancy</b> rate of the ND category was assessed. Nodule/patient characteristics were compared between benign and malignant cases within the study cohort. The study cohort consisted of 192 ND aspirations. Overall there were 156 (81. 3 %) women and 36 (18. 7 %) men {{with a mean age of}} 50. 6 years (range 24 - 82 years). The <b>malignancy</b> rate was 4. 7 %. None of the nodules (size, consistency, and number) or patient characteristics (gender and age) were found to be predictive of <b>malignancy.</b> The <b>malignancy</b> rate of the ND category was high when compared to BSRTC predictions, but at the low end of the reported <b>malignancy</b> rates in the literature. Our results revealed that cyto-histopathologic correlation and method of <b>malignancy</b> rate estimation could have an effect on a wide range of reported <b>malignancy</b> rates.

40|$|Background The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) has {{standardized}} {{the reporting}} of thyroid cytology specimens. The objective {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the nationwide usage of TBSRTC and assess the <b>malignancy</b> rates in each category of TBSRTC in Korea. Methods Questionnaire surveys were used for data collection on the fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules at 74 institutes in 2012. The incidences and follow-up <b>malignancy</b> rates of each category diagnosed from January to December, 2011, in each institute were also collected and analyzed. Results Sixty out of 74 institutes answering the surveys reported the results of thyroid FNA in accordance with TBSRTC. The average <b>malignancy</b> rates for resected cases in 15 institutes were as follows: nondiagnostic, 45. 6 %; benign, 16. 5 %; atypical of undetermined significance, 68. 8 %; suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN), 30. 2 %; suspicious for <b>malignancy,</b> 97. 5 %; <b>malignancy,</b> 99. 7 %. Conclusions More than 80 % of Korean institutes were using TBSRTC as of 2012. All <b>malignancy</b> rates other than the SFN and <b>malignancy</b> categories were higher than those reported by other countries. Therefore, the guidelines for treating patients with thyroid nodules in Korea should be revisited based on the <b>malignancy</b> rates reported in this study...|$|R
