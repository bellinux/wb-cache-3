2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the largest party of missionaries ever sent to China—as well as their intent to be dressed in native clothing—gave the foreign {{settlement}} in Shanghai <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and some criticism began for the young China Inland Mission. [...] The party donned Chinese clothing, notwithstanding—even the women missionaries—which was deemed semi-scandalous at the time. When other missionaries sought to preserve their British ways, Taylor {{was convinced that the}} Gospel would only take root on Chinese soil if missionaries were willing to affirm the culture of the people they were seeking to reach. He argued, from the example of the Apostle Paul, [...] "Let us in everything not sinful become like the Chinese, that by all means we may save some." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks, awfully, Bob," [...] said Mike. And {{after that}} {{there seemed to}} be nothing <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> So Mike edged out of the room, and tore across to Wain's.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Catholic Herald newspaper published in December 2008, he {{was reported to have}} said that it does not make <b>much</b> sense <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> salvation <b>to</b> young people [...] "unless you speak in their own language." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because the Almighty {{sent the}} rain {{at the very}} moment," [...] said Harry, {{striking}} the top rail {{of one of the}} pens with his fist. [...] "I'm not <b>much</b> given <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Providence, but this looks like it, does it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{a general}} rule {{we do not want}} <b>much</b> {{encouragement}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> ourselves; yet this little book {{is the result of a}} friendly suggestion, and even of a little friendly pressure. I defended myself with some spirit; but, with characteristic tenacity, the friendly voice insisted, [...] "You know, you really must." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We talked," [...] said Mabel, with a frank glance. [...] "There was <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> and all {{was rather}} wonderful. Perhaps this looks extravagant, but I don't think it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> {{as far as}} I am concerned, sir," [...] Ronald said. [...] "It was the Fingoes' doing altogether, and they could have managed as well, indeed better, without me." ...|$|E
60|$|Chisholm had not {{stipulated that}} nobody should be told and Flora's friends had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> Mabel Hilliard was disturbed, and when Marston {{came to her}} mother's house one evening {{took him to the}} garden.|$|E
60|$|It is very <b>much</b> more {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a thing than to do it. In {{the sphere of}} actual life that is, of course, obvious. Anybody can make history, only a great man can write it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure, Guert, I am as little {{disposed}} to brag of my share in this affair, as you or any one can possibly be; {{but it is}} <b>much</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> getting away from this confused crowd than really to do the thing. I doubt {{if any of these}} boats will take us in; for an Englishman, flogged, is not apt to be very good-natured; and all our friends seem to be killed or wounded." ...|$|R
50|$|Annie: Annie {{is another}} {{childhood}} friend of LaVaughn's in the book. She did not {{grow up with}} LaVaughn like Myrtle did, but she did go to school with them, {{and after a while}} became their best friend. Annie's background isn't really described in True Believer. Annie also joined a church and after a while became very attached to it. LaVaughn did not attend church with them at all, therefore their friendship of dwindled. Myrtle and Annie did not have as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> LaVaughn <b>about,</b> because LaVaughn had different views. LaVaughn questions God a lot throughout the book, while Annie and Myrtle goes go with what is dealt to them through the church.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I will dance this one," [...] said Mrs. Peagrim surprisingly. [...] "I'm {{sure you}} two must have ever so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> Why don't you take Sir Derek {{and give him}} a cup of coffee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not like}} the {{prospect}} of affairs," [...] said Mr. Sidney Wilton to Endymion as they were posting up to London from Montfort Castle; a long journey, but softened in those days by many luxuries, and they had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Sylvia," [...] said I, [...] "we {{have had}} so much to do and so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> and so much to think about and plan, that I have had no chance to finish the story of Tomaso and Lucilla." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fiona Wallice is a {{therapist}} who has conceived {{of a new}} [...] "modality" [...] of therapy: the titular [...] "web therapy". In her estimation, the traditional [...] "50-minute hour" [...] version of therapy gives people too <b>much</b> leeway <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> irrelevant things. By dramatically shortening session time, she hopes to get results more quickly. Her sessions take place via webcam over the internet using Skype.

6000|$|He hummed {{about the}} room, running over the {{advertising}} pages of magazines, discussing Plato fraternities, and waiting till {{it should be}} time to go home. Their conversation kept returning to the fraternities. There wasn't <b>much</b> else <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> Before to-night they had done complete justice to all other topics--Joralemon, Bennie Rusk, Joe Jordan's engagement, Adelaide Benner, and symphony concerts.

60|$|And Grace Bentham, as {{she washed}} tin dishes in her {{hillside}} cabin, often glanced down into Eldorado Creek, and dreamed,--not of dumps nor dust, however. They met frequently, as {{the trail to}} the one claim crossed the other, and there is <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> in the Northland spring; but never once, {{by the light of}} an eye nor the slip of a tongue, did they speak their hearts.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish there}} had been no one else here this evening,' Dorothy Hawtrey said to Captain Hampton before dinner, 'there is so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> First, I want to hear all you have been doing in India, and next, we must have a long chat over old times; in fact, we want a cozy talk together. Of course you will be tremendously engaged just at present, but you must spare me a long morning as soon as you {{possibly}} can.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} all summer, Mrs. Maturin. There was so <b>much</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> with you, but I {{wanted to be}} sure of myself first.

2500|$|Sebottendorf was {{an agent}} of the German {{military}} intelligence in neutral Istanbul during the period 19421945, while apparently also working as a double agent for the British military. His German handler, Herbert Rittlinger, later described him as a [...] "useless" [...] agent (eine Null), but kept him on largely, it seems, because of an affection for [...] "this strange, by then penniless man, whose history he did not know, who pretended enthusiasm for the Nazi cause and admiration for the SS but who in reality seemed little interested in either, <b>much</b> preferring <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Tibetans".|$|R
60|$|But the fishes {{were the}} most {{interesting}} of all. Some were big and lazy, floating slowly along or lying at rest with just their fins waving. Many with big round eyes looked full at the girl as she watched them and Dorothy wondered if they could hear her through the glass if she spoke to them. In Oz, where all the animals and birds can talk, many fishes are able to talk also, but usually they are more stupid than birds and animals because they think slowly and haven't <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{place they}} had just been in called up so many recollections, and Kate had so many anecdotes of Madeline, and Nicholas so many anecdotes of Frank, and each was so {{interested}} in what the other said, and both were so happy and confiding, and had so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> {{that it was not}} until they had plunged for a full half-hour into that labyrinth of streets which lies between Seven Dials and Soho, without emerging into any large thoroughfare, that Nicholas began to think it just possible they might have lost their way.|$|E
60|$|Captain Trimblett {{rose with}} an alacrity that mystified Miss Willett more than ever, and, having gained the garden, found {{so many things}} to show Miss Hartley, and so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> that supper was on the table before he had finished. Fearful of being left alone with Miss Willett, he stuck to his young {{protector}} so closely that in going in at the door he trod on her heel. Miss Hartley entered the room limping, and, having gained her seat, sat eying him with an expression in which pain and reproachful mirth struggled for the mastery.|$|E
40|$|In his book, aptly titled Speech, Music, Sound, Theo van Leeuwen {{proposes to}} {{integrate}} these three modes of sonic information: “They have been <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{in different ways}} and with different terminologies: linguistics <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> speech; musicology <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> music; not <b>much</b> at all <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> ‘sound effects’ ” (Leewen 1999, p. 1).

60|$|Mr. Bale was delighted, on his return, to find Bob. It {{was just}} the hour for closing, and he insisted upon Mr. Medlin {{stopping}} to take supper with him. Bob had written, whenever there was an opportunity of sending letters; {{but many of these}} had never come to hand, and there was <b>much</b> <b>to</b> tell, and <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Katharina Scheven {{was one of}} {{the young}} and liberal women who heard Gertrude Guillaume-Schack speak in London and took up the cause of abolishing {{regulated}} prostitution in Germany.Others included Anna Pappritz (1861-1939), Anita Augspurg (1857-1943) and Minna Cauer (1841-1922).Disapproval of public discussion of vice was an obstacle to Abolitionists. In 1895 the board of the BDF tried to prevent public discussion of a petition on prostitution it had presented to the national parliament because it addresses [...] "very awkward matters".In 1904 Katharina Scheven said it [...] "is still regarded in many educated circles as unbecoming to know about these things, <b>much</b> less <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them.|$|R
60|$|She {{kept the}} man waiting twenty, {{possibly}} because she believed {{it would be}} a salutary discipline, and was not displeased to notice that he stamped impatiently up and down. Then she went down with him to the lake, and it was dusk when they returned with several fine trout, in the state of content with each other which occasionally characterizes comrades in a successful angling expedition. They had also so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that Miss Deringham completely forgot the message, and her pleasure was only dissipated when she met her father alone for a minute. His pose expressed dejection and indecision as he came towards her along the verandah.|$|E
60|$|Dear Rain! if I've been {{cold and}} shy, Take no offence! I'll tell you why. A dear old Friend e'en now is here, And with him came my sister dear; After long absence now first met, Long months by pain and grief beset-- With three dear friends! in truth, we groan Impatiently to be alone. We three, you mark! {{and not one}} more! The strong wish makes my spirit sore. We have so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> So many sad things to let out; So many tears in our eye-corners, Sitting like little Jacky Horners-- In short, {{as soon as it}} is day, Do go, dear Rain! do go away.|$|E
60|$|The cadets had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that day--the sudden {{liberation of}} Pepper, and the losses Bart Conners and Dan Baxter had suffered. At noon Captain Putnam came back, {{and he had}} the captain of Company B and Dan Baxter in his office for the best part of an hour. But nothing came of the conference, {{excepting}} that the owner of the Hall said he would pay all losses and gave Baxter his eleven dollars on the spot. Then he had a long conference with the new man of all work, who was really a detective in disguise. But that individual was as much in the dark as anybody. He had seen nobody prowling around during the night.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{left the}} {{hospital}} from {{which he had been}} so ruthlessly driven, and settled himself down in his own modest manner in the High Street of Barchester, he had not expected that others would make more fuss about it than he was inclined to do himself; extent of his hope was, that the movement might have been made in time to prevent any further paragraphs in [...] "The Jupiter." [...] His affairs, however, were not allowed to subside thus quietly, and people were quite as <b>much</b> inclined <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the disinterested sacrifice he had made, as they had before been to upbraid him for his cupidity.|$|R
6000|$|An {{invitation}} to dine with the Dallams', {{in their own}} house, arrived {{a day or two}} after the tea which Honora had attended there. Although Lily had always been cordial, Honora thought this note couched in terms of unusual warmth. She was implored to come early, because Lily had so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her <b>about</b> which couldn't be written on account of a splitting headache. In moderate obedience to this summons Honora arrived, on the evening in question, before the ornamental ironwork of Mrs. Dallam's front door at a few minutes after seven o'clock. Honora paused in the spring twilight to contemplate the house, which stood out incongruously from its sombre, brownstone brothers and sisters with noisy basement kitchens. The Third Avenue Elevated, [...] "so handy for Sid," [...] roared across the gap scarcely a block away; and just as the door was opened the tightest of little blue broughams, pulled by a huge chestnut horse and driven by the tiniest of grooms in top boots, drew up at the curb. And out of it burst a resplendent lady--Mrs. Dallam.|$|R
6000|$|The carpet {{was damp}} and muddy, {{the house was}} chill, and the damp wind filled them all with ague; but they had so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> see and <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> that time passed rapidly.
