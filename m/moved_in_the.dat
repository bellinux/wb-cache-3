5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction to {{the rotation of the}} rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|A {{new wave}} of Armenian {{immigrants}} <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1940s, including Soviet Armenian prisoners of war {{who were able to}} make their way westward after being freed from Nazi camps. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US. From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians migrated to the US, many with the help of George Mardikian's American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA).|$|E

5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club <b>moved</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> club rented the ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at peppercorn rent for its continued use. This arrangement has been extended several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.|$|E

5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E

Their first album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), has sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide, {{and is one of the}} best-selling debut albums of all time in the U.S. with 18 million units sold. Its full-length follow-ups, the twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991), were also widely successful; they respectively debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} {{aimed to explore}} <b>the</b> rhetorical <b>moves</b> <b>in</b> abstracts of English and Persian Mining Engineering research articles.

While in Littleton, Bowman attended Deer Creek Middle School. As a Colorado Avalanche fan, he has listed Joe Sakic as a player he looked up to. In 2003, he and his family moved once more to Vancouver, British Columbia to better his opportunities in hockey. He attended Vancouver Christian School while playing at the bantam level for the North Vancouver Winter Hawks.|$|E
5|$|Development work on {{the castle}} continued. There was {{extensive}} restoration of the medieval masonry in 1921, with architect John Grant rebuilding the South Gate and the barbican tower, and reconstructing the medieval West Gate and town wall alongside the castle, with the Swiss Bridge being moved in 1927 {{to make room for}} the new West Gate development. Further archaeological investigations were carried out into the Roman walls in 1922 and 1923, leading to Grant redesigning the northern Roman gatehouse. The second half of the castle stables were finally completed. The Animal Wall was <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s to the west side of the castle to enclose a pre-Raphaelite themed garden. The grand staircase in the main range was torn out in the 1930s. During World War II, extensive air-raid shelters were tunnelled out within the medieval walls, with eight different sections, able to hold up to 1,800 people in total, and the castle was also used to tether barrage balloons above the city.|$|E
5|$|Grand River Avenue {{originated}} as an Indian trail before Michigan statehood. It {{later was}} used as a wagon road across the state. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1919 as M-16 and later the United States Numbered Highway System as US16. Construction of a freeway {{along the length of the}} corridor was proposed in the 1940s, and included as part of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s. This construction was started in 1956 and initially completed across the state to Detroit in 1962. The proposed route for the Jeffries Freeway in Detroit was <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s; it was built in the 1970s. I-96 was completed on November 21, 1977, in the Detroit area, closing the last gap along the route. Since then, additional interchanges and lanes have been added in places to accommodate traffic needs.|$|E

Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.|$|E
5|$|On social issues, Gillibrand is {{generally}} liberal, supporting abortion rights, legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2017, {{she came out}} in favor of single-payer healthcare, and cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which would gradually expand the existing Medicare program to cover all Americans. She is a strong advocate for government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information. She is also a strong supporter of female equality and involvement, having begun the website offthesidelines.org in 2011. Although a supporter of gun rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of gun control.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him.

The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died there in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The altarpiece was {{commissioned}} in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, {{and his wife}} Guigone de Salins, who is buried {{in front of the}} altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in the hospice today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Abby were {{possibly}} from a tropical wave that <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity of the}} Lesser Antilles in early July 1960. Ships and a few weather stations on July 9 reported {{the existence of a}} tropical cyclone. On July 9, it had operationally been classified as a tropical storm upon formation, though a later analysis revealed that it was only a tropical depression. The depression passed near Barbados early on July 10 before rapidly intensifying into a hurricane. Hurricane Abby accelerated toward the west and made landfall in St. Lucia as a minimal category 1 hurricane. Abby emerged into the Caribbean Sea a few hours later. As it headed generally westward, it also gradually strengthened. By July 11, Hurricane Abby had attained peak intensity as an 80mph (129km/h) category 1 hurricane.|$|E
