5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, endometrial cancers newly {{occurred}} in 320,000women and caused 76,000deaths. This {{makes it the}} third {{most common cause of}} death in cancers which only affect women, behind ovarian and cervical cancer. It is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.|$|E

5|$|Parasola auricoma is a {{saprobic}} species, and so obtains nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter into simpler molecules. The fruit bodies grow either singly or in groups, often in large numbers, at road sides in deciduous forests, or on grassy areas. The mushrooms are short-lived, usually lasting {{only for a}} few hours before collapsing. Common in Europe and North America (including Hawaii), it has also been recorded from Japan. In Europe, fruit bodies appear most commonly in spring and summer months, while in North America, fruiting is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late summer and autumn, after rains.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep farming is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern provinces of the country, where such tracts of land exist. China does have a native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{most likely}} {{made their way}} to the West via the Silk Route and {{maritime}} trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of mandibular tori ranges from 5% - 40%. It is less common than bony growths occurring on the palate, known as torus palatinus. Mandibular tori are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> Asian and Inuit populations, and slightly <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> males. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, the prevalence is 7% - 10% of the population.|$|R

5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe {{as a whole}} than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, {{comparable to that of}} platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} became <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th century BC {{and gave}} rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the 1st century AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BC in the island of Thasos. It probably took place {{during a period of}} war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act {{on the part of the}} master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating {{a large amount of}} anaerobic organisms.|$|E

5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, which is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It {{is actually a}} combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or {{hole in the wall}} of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|After 600, {{information}} on the Britons of Alt Clut becomes <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sources. In 642, led by Eugein son of Beli, they defeated the men of Dál Riata and killed Domnall Brecc, grandson of Áedán, at Strathcarron. The kingdom suffered a number of attacks from the Picts under Óengus, and later the Picts' Northumbrian allies between 744 and 756. They lost the region of Kyle in the south-west of modern Scotland to Northumbria, and the last attack may have forced the king Dumnagual III to submit to his neighbours. After this, little is heard of Alt Clut or its kings until Alt Clut was burnt and probably destroyed in 780, although by whom and what in what circumstances is not known, Historians have traditionally identified Alt Clut with the later Kingdom of Strathclyde, but J. E. Fraser points to the fact there is no contemporary evidence that the heartland of Alt Clut was in Clydesdale and the Kingdom of Strathclyde may have arisen after Alt Clut's decline.|$|E
