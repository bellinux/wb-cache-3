40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a dynamic {{multicast}} routing algorithm based on probability for multimedia communications in an {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) network environment. For multimedia communications, we not only aim to arrange a transmission path with the minimal cost from a source node to each destination node, but also consider the dynamic multicast situation with node joining/leaving. To meet the above requirements, we develop a new method based on the relative probability of each node being truncated from the <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> tree, such that we can arrange a better path for a new joining node {{in such a way}} as to reduce the impact of leaving requests caused by other nodes in the <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> tree. The main contribution of this paper is a new and efficient dynamic multicast routing algorithm for multimedia communications which keeps the whole <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> tree near optimal in terms of cost inefficiency and guarantees that the transmission delay will be less than the preset bounded end-to-end delay. Simulation results show that under various sizes of networks and requests, the cost inefficiency of the <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> tree constructed by our approach is less than those of the trees constructed by the greedy algorithm and the weighted greedy algorithm, respectively...|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} the network {{with a set}} of nodes, e.g., routers supporting an explicit route. A subset of these nodes is assumed to be ingress-egress nodes among which multicast connections can be established. For a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> in a backbone, the source is one of the ingress nodes, and the destinations are a group of the egress nodes. On the other hand, for a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> in an access network, the source is one of the ingress node, and the destinations are a group of all the nodes. Both connections are considered to analyze the effect of proposed dynamic multicast routing algorithms on the connections and find the optimal algorithm to the corresponding connection.|$|E
40|$|In WDM {{networks}} {{with limited}} drop-offs, {{the route of}} a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> consists {{of a set of}} light-trees. Each of the light-tree is rooted at the source node and contains no more than a limited number, say k, destination nodes due to the power loss of dropping optical signals off at destination nodes. We call such a light-tree k-drop light-tree. In this paper we study the multicast routing problem of constructing a set of k-drop lighttrees that have the minimal network cost. The network cost of a set of light-trees is defined as the summation of the link cost of all the light-trees. We first prove that this problem is polynomialtime solvable for k = 2 and NP-hard for k 3. Wethen propose a 4 -approximation algorithm for the problem for k 3. A wavelength assignment algorithm is also proposed to assign wavelengths to the light-trees of a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection.</b> In the end we give simulation results showing that k-drop multi-tree routing can significantly save not only the network cost but also wavelengths used. Moreover, when k 5 its performance is very close to the case where k is infinite (i. e., the case of using a single tree for a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Multicast</b> <b>connection</b> is an {{effective}} solution for transferring broadband multimedia services because of its link sharing capability. Since the <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> form {{is quite different from}} the unicast one, the optimal network topology will need to be changed if many multicast services are provided. We have been investigating the network topology most suitable for such an environment. It is concluded that the optimal network is structured as a two-layered topology that has Mesh as the upper layer and Delta-Star rather than Star as the lower layer. This paper focuses on the lower layer of the hierarchically structured network and evaluates the topological extension algorithms from Star to DeltaStar.

30|$|Network coding (NC) {{is a novel}} {{information}} processing technique applied in network nodes in which, instead of simple forwarding of received data packets, the data packets are combined and resulting network coded packets are transmitted instead. The idea was first introduced for the single-source multicast problem, where it was shown that, unlike routing, it achieves {{the capacity of the}} <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> [3]. For the single-source multicast problems represented by directed acyclic graphs with unit-capacity error-free edges, the class of linear network codes achieves the <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> capacity [4]. Furthermore, random linear codes over sufficiently large finite fields open the way for simple and fully distributed network code design [5]. The random linear coding (RLC) approach is adapted for practical implementation in lossy packet networks [6, 7], and suggested in a number of wireless networking applications [8, 9].|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maximizing the lifetime of a given <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> in a wireless network of energyconstrained (e. g. battery-operated) nodes, by choosing ideal transmission power levels for the nodes relaying the connection. We distinguish between two basic operating modes: In a static assignment, the power levels of the nodes are set {{at the beginning and}} remain unchanged until the nodes are depleted of energy. In a dynamic assignment, the powers can be adjusted during operation. We show that lifetime-maximizing static power assignments can be found in polynomial time, whereas for dynamic assignments, a quantized-time version of the problem is NP-hard. We then study the approximability of the quantized dynamic case and conclude that no polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) exists for the problem unless P = NP. Finally, by considering two approximation heuristics for the dynamic case, we show experimentally that the lifetime of a dynamically maintained <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> can be made several times longer than what can be achieved by the best possible static assignment...|$|E
40|$|The {{distributed}} algorithm for a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> set-up, {{based on}} the 'cheapest insertion' heuristic, is reviewed. The multicast routing problem is translated into a Steiner tree problem in point-to-point networks where nodes have only a limited knowledge about the network. A solution is proposed in which the time complexity {{and the amount of}} information exchanged between network nodes are proportional to the number of members of the multicast group. The Steiner tree is constructed by means of a distributed table-passing algorithm. The analysis of the algorithm presented, backed up by simulation results, confirms its superiority over the algorithm based on 'waving technique'. Scope and purpose Multicasting is a mechanism used in communication networks that allows distribution of information from a single source to multiple destinations. The problem of finding a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> for a static group of communicating entities in connection-oriented point-to-point network can be formulated in graph theory as a minimum Steiner tree problem. Due to NP-completeness of the Steiner tree problem multicast, routing algorithms are based on heuristics.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies teletraffic engineering {{of dynamic}} <b>multicast</b> <b>connections.</b> The traditional models in teletraffic engineering do not handle <b>multicast</b> <b>connections</b> properly, since in a dynamic multicast tree, users may join {{and leave the}} connection freely, and thus the multicast tree evolves in time. A model called multicast loss system {{is used to calculate}} blocking probabilities in a single link and in tree-type networks. In a single link case, the problem is a generalised Engset problem, and a method for calculating call blocking probabilities for users is presented. Application of the reduced load approximation for <b>multicast</b> <b>connections</b> is studied. Blocking probabilities in a cellular system are studied by means of simulation. The analysis is mainly concentrated on tree type networks, where convolution-truncation algorithms and simulation methods for solving the blocking probabilities exactly are derived. Both single layer and hierarchically coded streams are treated. The presented algorithms reduce significantly the computational complexity of the problem, compared to direct calculation from the system state space. An approximative method is given for background traffic. The simulation method presented is an application of the Inverse Convolution Monte-Carlo method, and it gives a considerable variance reduction, and thus allows simulation with smaller sample sizes than with traditional simulation methods. Signalling load for dynamic <b>multicast</b> <b>connections</b> in a node depends on the shape of the tree as well as the location of the node in the tree.

40|$|AbstractMulticast {{applications}} such as video conferencing, weather forecasting and on-line multi player gaming are major areas of Internet traffic growth. The disparity between bandwidth offered by a wavelength and the bandwidth requirement of a <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> can be purposefully solved by grooming low bandwidth connection requests into a high bandwidth wavelength channel in an optical network. In this paper, we discuss multicast traffic grooming problem using light-tree approach with static <b>multicast</b> <b>connection</b> requests. As higher layer electronic ports such as transmitters and receivers are dominant cost factors in a WDM mesh networks, {{it is critical to}} reduce their number when grooming multicast traffic into high bandwidth trees. This paper propose a heuristic algorithm called Saturated-Light-Tree based Multicast Traffic Grooming (SLTMTG) that solves grooming, routing and wavelength assignment problems. SLTMTG algorithm is based on grooming of multicast traffic to constrained light-trees in which traffic is groomed for better resource utilizations. This approach is used to minimize the grooming cost as well as wavelength requirement. Here, proposed approach tries to satisfy all connection requests. The performance of proposed algorithm has compared with existing Multicast Traffic Grooming (MTG) algorithm. The results are compared on several standard networks to measure cost and wavelength utilization...|$|E
