2500|$|An {{aquarium}} can {{be placed}} on an aquarium stand. Because {{of the weight of}} the aquarium, a stand must be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack. These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room decor. Simple <b>metal</b> <b>tank</b> stands are also available. Most aquaria should be placed on polystyrene to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself that may cause cracks. [...] However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} Meinhof's death, the prison staff cleaned and painted her cell {{despite the fact}} that it had been repainted in September 1975 (8 months before). Shouldn't the cell be sealed? Why had police seized all of the Meinhof's {{personal}} items and refused to give them to her relatives or lawyers? Other prisoners reported that handwritten documents, which Meinhof used to keep with her inside a black dossier, had also disappeared. Her fellow prisoners insisted that her cell remained intact until Meinhof's lawyers arrived, but [...] "by the time the first lawyer arrived the <b>metal</b> <b>tank</b> had already been extracted hastily" [...] (Ensslin). They were prohibited to come closer to the corridor in order to have visual contact with the cell. The authorities also prohibited Wienke Zittlaf, Anja Röhl, Klaus Croissant, and Michael Oberwinder to view Meinhof's body and the inside of the cell. According to the official explanation they were also looking for incriminating documents that could be used against Klaus Croissant.|$|E
2500|$|Wivern {{was part}} of the escort of Convoy FS 56 on its voyage from Rosyth to the Thames Estuary on 14 March 1945 when the [...] attacked, torpedoing and sinking the Danish cargo ship Magne off St. Abbs, Scotland, near the Firth of Forth. As Wivern rescued Magnes survivors, the South African Navy frigate , a new ship that had left the River Tyne only four hours earlier bound for Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and then for antisubmarine warfare {{training}} at Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, arrived on the scene to assist. Natal detected a submerged submarine with her ASDIC equipment, which was more modern and advanced than that on Wivern. Natal attacked, firing two Squid (weapon)|Squid anti-submarine mortar salvos of six depth bombs each. After the second attack, Natal lost ASDIC contact with U-714 and oil and a <b>metal</b> <b>tank</b> rose to the surface at [...] Natal then proceeded to Scapa Flow.|$|E

50|$|The Ogilvie Watertower {{was one of}} {{the first}} water towers in Minnesota to be {{constructed}} of reinforced concrete. It was cast in place by the Circular Concrete Company of Minneapolis in 1918. Its design was a noticeable contrast to the <b>metal</b> <b>tank</b> towers found in many other communities around the state, such as the Cuyuna Iron Range Municipally-Owned Elevated Metal Water Tanks. Although other concrete water towers were built, they tended to leak at the base of the internal tank, so most have been demolished and replaced.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and metal structure of all-metal gas tanks made of medium-carbon steel after different periods of service have been studied. It {{has been observed}} that {{the duration of the}} service does not significantly influence on the strength of the <b>metal</b> <b>tanks,</b> but it leads to some reduction of plasticity and toughness decrease. It has been observed that toughness degradation appears after 25 - 30 years of tanks exploitation. At testing of the Menazhe and Sharp specimen it was also found out that temperature dependence of <b>metal</b> <b>tanks</b> toughness varies with the service life. It has been noted that the metal microstructure does not change under continuous operation. Therefore the decrease in properties after long-term use of the cylinders was caused by the metal substructure. Exploration of the mechanism and kinetics of the substructure changes requires special studies. On the strength of these data the need to improve the existing methods of periodic inspection (as a function of service time) of all-metal steel cylinders, as well as setting limits of the life-span of these vessels has been show...|$|R
