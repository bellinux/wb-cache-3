According to a national report on chestnut plantation, Luotian produced 65,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>chestnuts</b> {{in the year of}} 2013 and it was considered as the biggest producer <b>of</b> <b>chestnuts</b> in China. The annual production <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> in Luotian is worth about 500 million RMB.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} Castanea sativa (sweet chestnut) {{cultivation}} since medieval times {{has been well}} described {{on the basis of}} the very rich documentation available. Far fewer attempts have been made to give a historical synthesis of the events that led to the cultivation <b>of</b> sweet <b>chestnut</b> in much earlier times. In this article we attempt to reconstruct this part of the European history <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> cultivation and its early diffusion by use of different sources of information, such as pollen studies, archaeology, history and literature. Using this multidisciplinary approach, we have tried to identify the roles of the Greek and Roman civilizations in the dissemination <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> cultivation on a European scale. In particular, we show that use <b>of</b> the <b>chestnut</b> for food was not the primary driving force behind the introduction of the tree into Europe by the Romans. Apart from the Insubrian Region in the north of the Italian peninsula, no other centre <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> cultivation existed in Europe during the Roman period. The Romans may have introduced the idea of systematically cultivating and using chestnut. In certain cases they introduced the species itself; however no evidence of systematic planting <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> exists. The greatest interest in the management <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> for fruit production most probably developed after the Roman period and can be associated with the socio-economic structures of medieval times. It was then that self-sufficient cultures based on the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> as a source of subsistence were formed...|$|R

The high fermentability <b>of</b> <b>chestnuts</b> helps to maintain the beer's head and gives Pietra beer its golden colour.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of bread, was {{prepared}} with wheat and chestnut flours, without the addition of any conservatives. Several experiences were also done {{to find the most}} appropriate proportion <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> flour. The particle size of different fractions <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> flour did not influence the flour water absorption, and they presented similar protein content. The farinographic experiences showed that the water absorption of wheat flour with 10 % <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> was similar to the wheat flours. The extensographic analysis revealed that 45 minutes is the optimum fermentation time, with higher resistance to extension. The addition <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> flour increased the dough stability. The optimized product was characterized considering the rheological, physical-chemical and sensorial properties. The breads presented low moisture but a considerable water activity. Bread density decreased and their dimensions increase. The breads were quite white, and during storage the color parameters changes differently. The chestnut flour clearly increased the number of alveolus, but the total area was similar to the wheat breads. The elasticity of breads did not vary significantly, but increase after the third day of storage. The addition <b>of</b> <b>chestnut</b> flour influenced significantly the appearance of bread, and this bread was sweeter and presented a higher score in the global appreciation...|$|R
