40|$|Anti-DNP-globulin from hyperimmunized rabbits was {{conjugated}} to ferritin {{by means}} of the bifunctional reagent, <b>metaxylene</b> diisocyanate. About 37 per cent of the antibody linked to ferritin was still able to combine specifically with the antigen, whereas no precipitating activity could be demonstrated. Data obtained in equilibrium dialysis experiments indicate an unchanged valency and affinity of those immunoferritin conjugates which remained active...|$|E
40|$|Paraxylene {{is used as}} a raw {{material}} for the production of the synthetic fibers. The production of paraxylene can be obtained by isomerization of xylene using zeolites as catalyst. At equilibrium, the mixture of xylene contains 24 % para, 24 % ortho and 52 % of <b>metaxylene.</b> The objective of this experiment is to access the effectiveness of several zeolite catalysts for the isomerization of xylene. The study was carried out using micro reactor packed with zeolite (0. 5 g). In this work, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst in the isomerization of xylene depend on the type of zeolite used. HZSM- 5 catalyst gives higher activity and selectivity over other type of zeolite...|$|E
