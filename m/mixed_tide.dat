Understanding the factors that control the division of water and sediment discharge over channels in the delta is relevant in the contexts of geology, ecology and river engineering.

River-tide interaction exerts an influence on the discharge regimes and on the division of water and sediment at the bifurcations in the delta. Bifurcations control the dispersal of sediments that eventually govern the shape and evolution of the delta. In this thesis, spatial and temporal aspects of delta evolution are shown to be reflected in scaling relations between the geometric properties of delta channels and the discharge conveyed by the channels, which is known as downstream hydraulic geometry (HG). Downstream HG relations as established in this research, feature a transition from the landward part to the seaward part of the delta characterized by a clear break in scaling behavior.

The Tarbert Formation has been interpreted to be deposited in a <b>mixed</b> <b>tide</b> and wave energy setting, and has subsequently been divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Tarbert. The Lower and Upper Tarbert are dominantly wave-dominated, while the Middle Tarbert is tide-dominated.

Three lower order sequences have been inferred in the Martin Linge–Oseberg west flank correlation. Each sequence comprises a regressive and a transgressive segment. In the Valemon-Kvitebjørn area 6 higher order sequences are present. Due to the significant expansion of the Tarbert Formation {{in the southern part of}} the Rungne sub-basin, fault activity is identified as a major controlling mechanism for thickness variations and facies partitioning.

The sequence boundary is a type- 1 surface produced during the lowstand of the Last Glacial period ca. 18 000 14 C yr BP. No fluvial lowstand deposits {{were found in the}} area. Due to rapid transgression the valley fills consist of transgressive and highstand sediments. The maximum landward advance of the estuarine barriers occurred ca. 6500 – 6000 14 C yr BP during the maximum of the Flandrian transgression, but {{there is no evidence of}} sea level rising appreciably above the present. A large part of the estuaries was filled during H 1 (ca. 6500 – 4400 14 C yr BP) but ravinement by shifting tidal inlets destroyed most of the coeval barriers.

Between H 2 and H 3 prevailing winds changed from W to WSW, increasing spit growth to the east and south-east. Progradation of bay-head deltas and flood-plains during H 3 (ca. 2300 – 800 14 C yr BP) and H 4 (500 yr ago to the present) further reduced the accommodation space in the largely-filled valleys, and sediment by-passed the estuaries and accumulated in the estuarine barriers as fast-growing spits.

40|$|International audienceCoastal {{barriers}} {{have been}} intensively studied since they constitute natural protections against wave attack and marine submersion. In {{a context of}} climate change and sea-level rise acceleration, understanding their future development is critically. Here we present the main results of a research project that aimed in reconstructing and comparing the evolution of two sandy barriers (sandspits). The originality {{of the study was}} to examine sandspits located along macrotidal coasts since most barriers are considered in their context of wave-built sedimentary bodies. In order to examine when and how these sandspits developed, a stratigraphic reconstruction based on ground penetrating radar (GPR) investigations were performed, completed with vibrocore acquisitions for sediment facies analyses, GPR ground-truthing, and chronology. Historical land and sea charts were used to refine the time frame of evolution. To be able to infer the role of tides vs. wave climate in sandspit evolution, two sandspits subject to significant difference in tidal ranges were studied. The Saint-Germain spit (NW France, English Channel coast, tidal range up to 14 m); The Arcay spit (SW France, Atlantic Ocean coast, tidal range up to 7 m). Both sites are influenced by relatively similar low to moderate wave dynamics (Hs~ 0. 5 m). The comparison of historical charts demonstrates that the formation of the two spits occurred between 1650 and 1700 AD, within the period of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our study suggests that LIA climate conditions (enhanced storm and wind activities) were favourable for spit formation. Despite the convergence in time of formation, the depositional history of the two spits differs significantly. It appears that the Arcay spit experienced a regular elongation that is still ongoing today. On the contrary, the evolution of Saint-Germain spit was periodic and very fast. Already about 1750 AD it reached its current extension and morphology, suggesting that in half a century or maybe less, the entire spit formed. The GPR and core data reflect these contrasted evolutions of the spits. Data from Arçay demonstrate that the spit complex is mainly made of three wave-dominated units (spit platform, beach, washover) and evidence a dominant shore-parallel mode of construction. 14 C ages for Arcay spit are consistent with an onset of construction during the 1600 s. Data from the Saint-Germain spit display two main units that are respectively tide-dominated (estuary, embayment) and <b>mixed</b> <b>tide,</b> wave and wind-influenced (sand spit body). 14 C and OSL ages constrain the onset of sandspit formation to around 1000 years ago, and the most recent sand construction, around 400 years ago. The Saint-Germain spit complex results both from a vertical and progradational / longshore accretion. Differences in sediment supply are assumed to explain these two contrasted construction modes (quick progradational vs progressive longshore mode). This difference can be partly related to tidal ranges. Sand fluxes, both wave and wind-induced, are much higher on hypertidal sites, with large intertidal foreshore/flats, than those on macrotidal beaches. This difference was probably enhanced during the severe wind conditions of the LIA...|$|E

A stability ratio, which represents the balance between <b>mixing</b> (<b>tide</b> and wind) and buoyancy (heat and freshwater) processes, is defined. When buoyancy dominates over mixing, stratification is possible. Use of model- and satellite-derived data allows maps of the spatial and temporal development of stratification to be constructed.

Consideration of the forcing components and corresponding stability ratio provides insight into the wide range of bloom dynamics observed in the Gulf of Alaska. Interannual variability in heat and freshwater forcing corresponds to the phase of the North Pacific Index (NPI). A low NPI reflects an intense Aleutian low-pressure system and is associated with warmer, wetter winters, leading to the earlier onset of stratification and subsequently an earlier and more intense spring bloom.

The mean circulation consisted of seaward flow in the near surface and landward flow below 7 m, with a core of maximum velocity at mid-depth. Volume transport was 22, 000 m 3 /s.

40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) <b>mixed</b> <b>tide.</b> Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.

40|$|The Mandovi and Zuari are two {{tropical}} estuaries {{along the}} west coast of India, characterized by <b>mixed</b> <b>tides</b> with semi-diurnal dominance and heavy fresh water influx during the southwest monsoon (June to September). Previous observations of tides in these estuaries show that the tidal effects in the upstream regions are subject to decay due to freshwater influx during the southwest monsoon. The longitudinal distribution of salinity in these estuaries undergoes large variations between the southwest monsoon and the dry season (February to May). The main objectives of the present study were to simulate the tidal circulation, the longitudinal distribution of salinity and the freshwater influence on tides and the salinity distribution. Another objective was to study the intra-seasonal variations of salinity during the breaks in the southwest monsoon. A hybrid network numerical model was used for the present study to simulate the tidal circulation and the salinity distribution in these estuaries. The model reproduced observed tides accurately during the dry and wet seasons. The model could reproduce the longitudinal distribution of salinity well during the dry season and the simulation of salinity distribution was reasonably well during the wet season. The simulated tidally-averaged salinities over the M 2 tidal period for varying river discharges show that even a small freshwater influx can affect the longitudinal distribution of salinity to a great extent in this type of estuaries...|$|R
40|$|Models of {{rotating}} single stars {{can successfully}} {{account for a}} wide variety of observed stellar phenomena, such as the surface enhancements of N and He. However, recent observations have questioned the idea that rotational mixing is the main process responsible for the surface enhancements, emphasizing the need for a strong and conclusive test. We investigate the consequences of rotational mixing for massive main-sequence stars in short-period binaries. In these systems the tides spin up the stars to rapid rotation. We use a state-of-the-art stellar evolution code including the effect of rotational <b>mixing,</b> <b>tides,</b> and magnetic fields. We discuss the surface abundances expected in massive close binaries (M 1 ~ 20 solar masses) and we propose using such systems to test the concept of rotational mixing. As these short-period binaries often show eclipses, their parameters can be determined with high accuracy, allowing for a direct comparison with binary evolution models. In more massive close systems (M 1 ~ 50 solar masses, Porb<~ 2 days) we find that helium is efficiently mixed throughout the envelope. The star remains blue and compact during the main-sequence phase. It stays within its Roche lobe while it gradually becomes a helium star. It is the less massive star, in which the effects of rotational mixing are less pronounced, which fills its Roche lobe first. We propose that this evolution path provides an alternative channel for the formation of tight Wolf-Rayet binaries with a main-sequence companion and might explain massive black hole binaries such as the intriguing system M 33 X- 7.

50|$|Yaquina Bay {{experiences}} <b>mixed</b> semidiurnal <b>tides,</b> {{ranging from}} 1.9-2.5 m (6.2-8.2 ft) daily. The {{influx of water}} from the ocean changes the salinity of the estuary, creating a salt intrusion that has been estimated to reach as far as 21.8 km (13.5 mi) upriver. Daily tidal changes affect estuary mixing and stratification. Flood tides coming from the ocean bring coastal nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus into the estuary. During mixing events, the Yaquina Bay estuary experiences changes in gradients for salinity, concentration of chemical species, and suspended sediment, which in turn influences biological productivity. The Yaquina Bay estuary has high primary productivity throughout the year due to high dissolved oxygen concentrations and cool water temperature from tidal flushing.|$|R
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variability of intertidal rocky shore bivalves and gastropods in Sichang Island, {{east coast of}} Thailand were studied over 12 months (March 2008 to February 2009). The study area experiences <b>mixed</b> <b>tides</b> with the largest tidal range of 3. 6 m above MTL during spring tides. Shores {{are exposed to the}} prevailing northeast monsoon in the winter (November to February), resulting in stronger wave action during this season than in summer(March to May) and rainy season (June to October). Transects were positioned at five different heights from mid shore to high shore (2. 5 to 3. 5 m above MTL) dominated by rock oysters in the mid shore. At each height, abundance of bivalves and gastropods were recorded within fifteen replicate quadrats (25 x 25 cm) on a monthly basis. A total of 2 bivalves and 10 species of gastropods were identified. In the high shore, the littorinid Echinolittorina malaccana dominated. Dense beds of the bivalve Isognomon nucleus were abundant in crevices at 2. 5 and 2. 75 m above MTL, whilst a large number of snails (Planaxis sulcatus) were found near the midshore. Below this, the rock oyster Saccostrea cucculata was dominant, with a variety of mobile gastropods (Cellana grata, C. toreuma, Patelloidea saccharina and Siphonaria japonica). The general sequence of zonation patterns were clear over time, but the vertical extent of some mobile species varied in accordance with the monsoon effect and increasing tidal range in winter, especially on the more exposed of the two sites. The high shore littorinids, E. malaccana moved up shore and were more abundant near the supralittoral line in winter suggesting that the seasonal monsoon effect and tidal range were important factors determining the distribution of some species of mobile gastropods, allowing them to exploit higher tidal levels...|$|R
