5|$|Animals {{living on}} the volcano include the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> and spectacled bear, {{both of which are}} {{designated}} as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.|$|E
5|$|Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a {{significant}} biological community with fauna {{such as the}} <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir,</b> giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture. Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected {{as part of the}} Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and the danger of falling ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
50|$|Newborn <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> weigh about 5.4 to 6.2 kg {{and have}} a brown coat with yellowish-white spots and stripes. Like adults, baby <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> have thick, woolly fur to help keep them warm. Weaning begins at around three months of age. The {{immature}} coloration fades after about a year, but the mother continues {{to care for her}} young for around 18 months. <b>Mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> reach sexual maturity at age three and have lived up to 27 years in captivity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> {{are also}} {{important}} seed dispersers within their environments, and {{have been identified as}} a keystone species of the high Andes. A relatively high proportion of plant seeds eaten by <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> successfully germinate in their dung, probably due to a relatively inefficient digestive system and a tendency to defecate near water. Although a wide range of seeds are dispersed in this manner, those of the endangered wax palm seem to rely almost exclusively on <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> for dispersal, and this plant, along with the highland lupine, declines dramatically whenever the animal is extirpated from an area.|$|R
50|$|Predators of <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> include cougars, spectacled bears, and, less commonly, jaguars.|$|R
25|$|Tapirs {{are largely}} nocturnal and crepuscular, {{although}} the smaller <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> of the Andes is generally more active {{during the day}} than its congeners. They have monocular vision.|$|E
25|$|Adult tapirs {{are large}} enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin {{on the backs of}} their necks helps to protect them from threats such as jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers. The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, {{considering}} their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; both the Brazilian tapir and the Malayan tapir are classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's tapir and the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> are endangered.|$|E
25|$|The Malayan tapir, {{the species}} most {{isolated}} geographically {{from the rest}} of the genus, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American tapirs. A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird's tapir and the Brazilian tapir, and 15 between Baird's and the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir)</b> have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird's and Brazilian tapirs have identical X chromosomes, while mountain tapirs are separated by a heterochromatic addition/deletion.|$|E

50|$|When {{around other}} members of their species, <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> {{communicate}} through high-pitched whistles, and the males occasionally fight over estrous females by trying to bite each other’s rear legs. But for the most part, <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> are shy and lead solitary lives, spending their waking hours foraging for food on their own along well-worn tapir paths. Despite their bulk, they travel easily through dense foliage, up the steep slopes of their hilly habitats, and in water, where they often wallow and swim.|$|R
50|$|Rare <b>Mountain</b> (Wooly) <b>tapirs</b> are {{featured}} in a new exhibit opened in late 2015. The zoo's tapirs were housed away from the public in 2012 due {{to the construction of}} Encounter Africa. Only two zoos in the United States have <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> - Los Angeles Zoo and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. There are only seven tapirs between the two zoos, and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo has the only proven breeding female.|$|R
25|$|Size varies between types, {{but most}} tapirs are about 2m (6.6ft) long, stand about 1m (3ft) high at the shoulder, and weigh between 150 and 300kg (330 and 700lb). Their coats are short and range in color from reddish brown, to grey, to nearly black, with the notable {{exceptions}} of the Malayan tapir, {{which has a}} white, saddle-shaped marking on its back, and the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir,</b> which has longer, woolly fur. All tapirs have oval, white-tipped ears, rounded, protruding rumps with stubby tails, and splayed, hooved toes, with four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet, which help them to walk on muddy and soft ground. Baby tapirs of all types have striped-and-spotted coats for camouflage. Females have {{a single pair of}} mammary glands, and males have long penises relative to their body size.|$|E
500|$|Cutervo National Park [...] (...) , {{established}} in 1961, {{is the oldest}} protected area in Peru. It {{is located in the}} northern Peruvian Andes, in the region of Cajamarca. The park was extended to [...] and protects areas of Andean montane forests and paramo for headwater conservation. Moreover, those areas are the habitat of animal species like the spectacled bear, the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir,</b> and the oilbird; and plant species like the Andean wax palms.|$|E
500|$|The park {{is home to}} mammal species facing risk of {{extinction}} such as the neotropical otter, the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir,</b> the spectacled bear, the mountain paca, the giant anteater, and a species of [...] wild cat (Leopardus colocolo). Bird species like the oilbird, the golden-headed quetzal, and the Andean cock-of-the-rock are also live within the park. A species of catfish (Astroblepus rosei) {{can be seen in}} the underground streams of the caves inside the park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> are {{generally}} crepuscular, {{although they are}} more active during the day than other species of tapirs. They sleep from roughly midnight to dawn, with an additional resting period during the hottest {{time of the day}} for a few hours after noon, and prefer to bed down in areas with heavy vegetation cover. <b>Mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> forage for tender plants to eat. When trying to access high plants, they will sometimes rear up on their hind legs to reach and then grab with their prehensile snouts. Though their eyesight is lacking, they get by on their keen senses of smell and taste, as well as the sensitive bristles on their proboscises.|$|R
25|$|Lack {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} in tapir populations {{has become a}} major source of concern for conservationists. Habitat loss has isolated already small populations of wild tapirs, putting each group in greater danger of dying out completely. Even in zoos, genetic diversity is limited; all captive <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs,</b> for example, are descended from only two founder individuals.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> {{have been}} hunted for their meat and hides, while the toes, proboscises, and {{intestines}} {{are used in}} local folk medicines and as aphrodisiacs. Since they will eat crops when available, they are also sometimes killed by farmers protecting their produce. Today, deforestation for agriculture and mining, and poaching are the main threats to the species.|$|R
2500|$|A tapir ( [...] , [...] , or [...] ) is a large, herbivorous mammal, {{similar in}} shape to a pig, with a short, prehensile nose trunk. Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of South America, Central America, and Southeastern Asia. The five extant species of tapirs are the Brazilian tapir, the Malayan tapir, the Baird's tapir, the kabomani tapir, and the <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir.</b> The four species {{that have been}} {{evaluated}} (the Brazilian, Malayan, Baird's and <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir)</b> are all classified as endangered or vulnerable. Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, which include horses, donkeys, zebras and rhinoceroses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> has no {{recognised}} subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Large {{vertebrates}} are the cougar (Puma concolor), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), {{spectacled bear}} (Tremarctos ornatus), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus pinchaque), little red brocket (Mazama rufina), pacarana (Dinomys branickii), mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii) and Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus).The brown woolly monkey, <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> and spectacled bear are of special concern.Endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), red-crested tree-rat (Santamartamys rufodorsalis), Handley's slender opossum (Marmosops handleyi), white-footed tamarin (Saguinus leucopus) and <b>mountain</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus pinchaque).Endangered reptiles include Daniel's large scale lizard (Ptychoglossus danieli) and Colombian lightbulb lizard (Riama columbiana).|$|E
50|$|Lack {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} in tapir populations {{has become a}} major source of concern for conservationists.

Even in zoos, genetic diversity is limited; all captive <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs,</b> for example, are descended from only two founder individuals.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> have a 30-day estrous cycle, and {{typically}} breed {{only once every}} other year. During courtship, the male chases the female and uses soft bites, grunts, and squeals to get her attention, while the female responds with frequent squealing. After a gestation period of 392 or 393 days, the female gives birth to a single young; multiple births are very rare.|$|R
50|$|There {{may be only}} 2,500 {{individuals}} left in {{the wild}} today, making {{it all the more}} difficult for scientists to study them. Also, very few individuals are found in zoos. Only a handful of breeding pairs of this species exists in captivity in the world — at the Los Angeles Zoo, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, and, as of 2006, the San Francisco Zoo. In Canada, a mating pair is kept in Langley, BC, at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre. The nine individuals in captivity are descendants of just two founder animals. This represents a distinct lack of genetic diversity and may not bode well for their continued existence in captivity. The three zoos that house this species are working to ensure that the remaining wild populations of <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> are protected. Two <b>mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> were sent from San Francisco Zoo to Cali Zoo, making them be the only captive tapirs in their natural home range; also, one male is kept in Pitalito, Huila, and it is possible to move it to the Cali Zoo to make a breeding pair.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tapir</b> <b>Mountain</b> Nature Reserve - {{a forest}} reserve of 6750 acre, in the Maya Mountains with rugged (karst) relief and {{relatively}} undisturbed subtropical moist forest.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>tapirs</b> {{are black}} or very dark brown, with {{occasional}} pale hairs flecked in amongst the darker fur. The fur becomes noticeably paler on the underside, around the anal region, {{and on the}} cheeks. A distinct white band runs around the lips, although it may vary in extent, and there are usually also white bands along the upper surface of the ears. In adults, the rump has paired patches of bare skin, which may help to indicate sexual maturity. The eyes are initially blue, but change to a pale brown as the animal ages. Unlike all other species of tapir, the fur is long and woolly, especially on the underside and flanks, reaching 3.5 cm or more in some individuals. Adults are usually around 1.8 m in length and 0.75 to 1 m in height at the shoulder. They typically weigh between 136 and 250 kg, and while the sexes are of similar size, females tend to be around 25 to 100 kg heavier than the males.|$|R

The main cave system is about 3 mi long and {{consists}} of a long river passage for approximately 2 mi, which ends at an upstream sump. A series of upper prehistoric passages continues another mile past the sump through massive breakdown boulders and giant rooms. The cave can be exited through a tight squeeze ending in a giant sink hole collapse in the jungle. The cave's upper passage is located about 1/3 of the way in from the lower entrance. Here 14 skeletal remains have been found, and numerous examples of ancient Maya pottery remain.|$|R
