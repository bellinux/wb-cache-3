2500|$|The soul, for Ptolemy, [...] {{includes}} the faculty for conscious reasoning, which is rational and {{attributed to the}} condition of Mercury, and the subconscious and unconscious elements of the mind (the [...] "sensory and irrational part"), which is sensitive and attributed to {{the condition of the}} Moon. These two chapters <b>make</b> <b>analysis</b> of instinctual impulses and moral inclinations, being concerned with psychological motives and behavioural expression rather than the physical temperament described in chapter 11. Diseases of the soul are defined as [...] "affections which are utterly disproportionate and as it were pathological" [...] including insanity, inability to exercise moderation or restraint, instability of the emotions, depraved sexuality, morbid perversions, and violent afflictions of the intellectual and passive parts of the mind. The astrological explanations are mainly related to the exaggerated influence of destructive planets which are also in difficult configurations with Mercury and the Sun or Moon, or the planet associated with the psychological impulse (for example, Venus in matters of sexuality). Campion has pointed out that these planetary associations with psychological qualities are not original to Ptolemy, being present in the Corpus Hermeticum which was in circulation in Alexandria at the time Ptolemy compiled his text.|$|E
