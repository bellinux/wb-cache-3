50|$|From 1948 to 1950, Hurst {{worked with}} Ritchie {{to develop a}} fast neutron survey meter and fast neutron {{dosimetry}}. The fast neutron dosimetry work continued throughout the 1950s with the added interest in tissue dose. In 1952, the team of Hurst, D.J. Knowles and C. Yochem worked to develop a thermal neutron survey instrument. Hurst and F.M. Glass developed a method of pulse integration by utilizing the binary scaling unit. Hurst explored fast neutron dosimetry and tissue-equivalent phantoms. His team that included J.A. Harter, P.N. Hensley and W.A. Mills studied neutron flux and tissue dose with fission threshold detectors.Around 1955, Hurst teamed with A.C. Upton, F.P. Conte and W.A. Mills {{to look at the}} relative biological effectiveness (RBE) that involved <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> fields for acute lethality in various animal models.Additional studies with A.C. Upton, K.W. Christenberry, G.S. Melville, and J. Furth utilized <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> fields to produce lens opacity in various animal models. In 1956 and again in 1980, Hurst utilized threshold detectors to measure neutron spectra in order to determine tissue dose.In 1961, Hurst led a group that performed measurements of the absorbed dose of neutrons, and of <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> field of neutrons and gamma rays.

40|$|Measurements of neutron and gamma dose {{rates in}} <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> fields, and gamma dose rates from {{calibrated}} gamma sources, were performed using a {{liquid scintillation counter}} NE 213 with a pulse shape discrimination technique based on the charge comparison method. A computer program was used to analyse the experimental data. The radiation field was obtained from a 241 Am- 9 Be source. There was general agreement between measured and calculated neutron and gamma dose rates in the <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> field, but some disagreement in the measurements of gamma dose rates for gamma sources, due to the dark current of the photomultiplier {{and the effect of}} the perturbation of the radiation field by the detector. An optical fibre bundle was used to couple an NE 213 scintillator to a photomultiplier, in an attempt to minimise these effects. This produced an improvement in the results for gamma sources. However, the optically coupled detector system could not be used for neutron and gamma dose rate measurements in <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> fields.

40|$|The U. S. Navy DT- 60 {{dosimeter}} {{was evaluated}} under field type conditions {{as to its}} reproducibility and accuracy of gamma x-ray, thermal and fast neutron and <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> responses. Gamma and x-ray responses from 25 to 600 rads at energies in oxcess of 200 kev {{were found to be}} accurate within 20 % in 92 % of 160 dosimeters examined. Because the DT- 60 was found to have no detectable fast neutron response, effort was directed toward exaggerating the thermal neutron response to approximate the total neutron dose from a nuclear detonation and also toward eliminating any neutron response in a mixed neutron- gamma field. This was accomplished by various combinations of lithium, paraffin and cadmium shielding. Data indicate that the DT- 60 dosimeter can be modified to approximate more closely doses from specific types of mixed radiations; however, this generally detracts from its value in approximating other types of <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> doses.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> {{field in}} the Earth’s {{atmosphere}} {{is caused by the}} interaction of cosmic and trapped radiation with the atmosphere. A plethora of secondary particles is created which, together with the primary radiation, creates this complex natural <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> field. Apart from charged particles (predominantly protons, electrons, muons, pions, and alpha particles)), it also contains neutral particles, i. e., neutrons and gamma rays, which are generally difficult to measure. The Flight Radiation Environment Detector (FRED) was designed to measure quantitatively the contributions of the charged and neutral components. It consists of four segmented silicon solid-state detectors which form a particle telescope and also form an efficient anti-coincidence to separate the neutral radiation. Thus FRED is also designed to measure the respective dose rate from charged and neutral particles.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of large-amplitude internal waves (LAIWs) propagating in the Strait of Gibraltar {{is carried out}} using a fully nonlinear nonhydrostatic numerical model. The focus of the modeling efforts was on three-dimensional peculiarities of LAIW evolution, namely, cross-strait variability, interaction with lateral boundaries (including wave breaking and water <b>mixing),</b> <b>radiation</b> of secondary waves from orographic features, and interaction of secondary scattered internal waves. The along-channel propagation of packets of LAIWs reveals remarkable three-dimensional behavior. Due to the Coriolis force and multiple reflections from the lateral boundaries, the largest leading LAIW loses its energy much faster than that in the packet tail, which captures the scattered energy from the leading wave as it propagates and grows in amplitude. As {{a result of the}} energy transfer, the initially rank-ordered wave packet loses its regular structure to evolve into a non-rank-ordered wave train.

40|$|For {{measurements}} of the equivalent dose of the <b>mixed</b> <b>radiation</b> fields in aircraft usually many different measuring devices are necessary for consideration of the different components of the radiation field. This work discusses {{the possibility of using}} thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs) for determination of absorbed dose and average LET of this complex radiation field in aircraft. The HTR-method, developed for determination of the equivalent dose in spacecraft, enables the measurement of the average LET in addition to the absorbed dose. Furthermore, a rem-counter based on TLDs and a modified pair-method (TLD- 600, TLD- 700) was used for determination of the absorbed dose due to the neutron component. Using small TLD-crystals it is possible to obtain the depth-distribution of absorbed dose and average LET by exposing TLDs in Bonner spheres with different diameters.

This mixture of radiation with particles at different energy levels has different effects on biological systems.

While NASA Space Radiation Laboratory is working on advanced switches {{to make it possible}} to have a <b>mixed</b> field <b>radiation</b> with particles of different energies, the radiation source will be limited. Development of an easily available experimental model for studying effects of <b>mixed</b> field <b>radiation</b> could greatly speed up our progress in our understanding the molecular mechanisms of damage and responses from exposure to space radiation, and facilitate the discovery of protection and countermeasures against space radiation, which is critical for the mission to Mars. Bleomycin, a radiomimetic agent, has been widely used to study radiation induced DNA damage and cellular responses. Previously, bleomycin was often compared to low low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) gamma radiation without defined characteristics. Our recent work demonstrated that bleomycin could induce complex clustered DNA damage in human fibroblasts that is similar to DNA damage induced by high LET radiation. These type of DNA damage is difficult to repair and can be visualized by gamma-H 2 Ax staining weeks after the initial insult. The survival ratio between early and late plating of human fibroblasts after bleomycin treatment is between low LET and high LET radiation. Our results suggest that bleomycin induces DNA damage and other cellular stresses resembling those resulted from <b>mixed</b> field <b>radiation</b> with both low and high LET particles. We hypothesize that bleomycin could be used to mimic space radiation in biological systems.

An enhancement in conversion efficiency over similar systems reported previously is obtained {{by using a}} Michelson interferometer to separate the sidebands from the carrier and by placing the Schottky diode in an open structure corner cube mount. With 4 mW of laser power at 693 and 762 GHz the sideband power {{was measured to be}} 3. 0 μW. This is at least an order of magnitude better than the previously reported results. At higher frequencies, 22 mW of 1627 ‐GHz laser power produced about 2. 5 μW of sideband output, while 3 mW of 1839 ‐GHz laser power generated about 100 nW of sideband radiation. The lower efficiency at the higher frequencies is due primarily to the mismatch between the laser radiation and the fixed‐length diode antenna. To demonstrate the tunability of the generated far‐infrared radiation, the laser sidebands were swept through absorption lines of HDO and H_ 2 CO near 600 and 800 GHz.

40|$|SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy) is {{extensively}} used in microelectronics {{in order}} to measure the depth profiles of dopants in silicon wafers. During the SIMS analysis, the sputtering ion beam induces several mass transport processes (collisional <b>mixing,</b> <b>radiation</b> [...] enhanced diffusion of the dopant atoms) which depend on ion beam characteristics (ion mass, energy, incident angle) and on atomic transport properties of the sample. The atomic transport leads to broader and shifted depth profiles in the measurements compared to the original ones. For a delta distribution of the analyzed impurity in depth, the signal of the SIMS apparatus leads to the response function; this function represents the distortion introduced by the measuring technique. In a first approximation, this response function is assumed to be independent of the initial profile depth. The resulting experimentally measured depth profile can be described as a convolution of the original undistorted profile and the SIMS response function. The SIMS distortion function associated with collisional mixing during SIMS analysis is calculated in the present work using a dynamic version of the TRIM program. As the depth dependence of the response function is important for SIMS analysis of shallow ion implanted profiles of arsenic, this effect was taken into account to improve the precision of the SIMS profile modeling...|$|R
