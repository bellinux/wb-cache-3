This paper presents an original integrated electro-mechanical model aimed at testing the possibility and the interest of tooth fault detection based on electric measurements on the motor stator. The motor is simulated using Kron's transformation while the mechanical transmission is accounted for by a lumped parameter model. Tooth defects are assimilated to distributions of initial separations between the <b>mating</b> <b>flanks</b> whose positions and shapes are controlled. A unique non-linear parametrically excited differential system is obtained, which provides direct access to both the electrical and mechanical variables. A number of results are presented, which illustrate the possibility of tooth fault detection by stator current measurements with regard to the position and dimensions of the defect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. If {{the contact}} {{pressure}} between <b>mating</b> <b>flanks</b> of a gear set is increased, the {{lubricant film thickness}} in between is reduced to a level where the asperities of the flanks start to touch. This case where the surface roughness is of similar value as the EHD film thickness is called “mixed friction”. Due to the metallic contact of the asperities {{and the movement of}} the flanks with respect to each other, the flanks are damaged. The damaged flanks appear dull or greyish, hence the name “grey-staining” (or “Graufleckigkeit ” in German), see e. g. [4] or [1]. Micropitting are small cracks {{on the surface of the}} gears (as opposed to pitting, where the cracks form below the surface), which grow into the material. The size of the damages is about 10 - 20 µm depth, 25 - 100 µm length and 10 - 20 µm width. Micropitting is mainly observed with case carburized gears but may also be found in nitrided, induction hardened or through hardened gears. Micropitting mainly occurs in areas of negative specific sliding. Negative specific sliding is to be found along the path of contact between point A and C on the driving gear and between point C and E on the driven gear...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} gear transmissions, such as NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) or {{durability}} analyses, require an accurate {{description of the}} contact forces, acting on meshing gear teeth. In order to properly model the contact force between two bodies, an accurate prediction of the contact locations and corresponding penetrations is required, before contact loads can be calculated. This paper proposes a numerically efficient and accurate contact model to calculate the contact locations and penetrations between <b>mating</b> gear <b>flanks</b> by making use of the ease-off concept. The proposed approach exploits the fact that <b>mating</b> gear <b>flanks</b> {{are designed to be}} close-to-conjugate and can account for possible micro-modifications and relative motion between the meshing gear flanks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an extension to the ease-off based contact modeling which enables accounting for misalignments without the need to recalculate the ease-off topography for each new misaligned configuration. In a preprocessing step to the actual contact detection algorithm, the surface of roll angles and ease-off topography for a given gear pair under a given kinematic configuration are calculated, starting from a cloud-of-point representation of the different gears. The use of a cloud-of-point representation, combined with the knowledge of the surface normal vectors, allows for the analysis of different types of gears, without the need of a detailed knowledge of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the created algorithm can account for different gear geometries, ranging from cylindrical gears to bevel and hypoid gears. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Vibration and Acoustics [© ASME] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] differential hypoid gears play an important role on the Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) signature of the drive train system. Additionally, the generated friction between their <b>mating</b> teeth <b>flanks</b> under varying load-speed conditions is a source of power loss in a drive train, whilst absorbing some of the vibration energy. The paper deals with the coupling between system dynamics and analytical tribology in a multi-physics, multi-scale analysis. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication of elliptical point contact of partially conforming hypoid gear teeth pairs with non- Newtonian thermal shear of a thin lubricant film is considered, including boundary friction as the result of asperity interactions on the contiguous surfaces. Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) has been used to obtain the input data required for such an analysis. The dynamic behaviour and frictional losses of a differential hypoid gear pair under realistic operating conditions are therefore determined. The detailed analysis shows a strong link between NVH refinement and transmission efficiency, a finding not hitherto reported in literature...|$|R

50|$|Like {{all members}} of the genera Phyllobates, Dendrobates, and Ranitomeya, family groups of golden poison dart frogs {{assemble}} into large breeding gatherings once or twice per year. While peaceful towards others of their species at other times, the male frogs can be formidably aggressive while competing for a breeding space. Females will remain fairly calm throughout this ordeal. Courtship for the golden poison frog {{is similar to that of}} the green and black poison dart frog. Its call consists of a rapid series of high-pitched squeaks. Golden poison frogs are notable for demonstrating tactile courtship during reproduction, each partner stroking its <b>mate's</b> head, back, <b>flanks,</b> and cloacal areas prior to egg deposition.

40|$|Mucor circinelloides is a zygomycete fungus and an {{emerging}} opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially transplant recipients {{and in some}} cases otherwise healthy individuals. We have discovered a novel example of size dimorphism linked to virulence. M. circinelloides is a heterothallic fungus: (+) sex allele encodes SexP and (-) sex allele SexM, both of which are HMG domain protein sex determinants. M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus (Mcl) (-) mating type isolates produce larger asexual sporangiospores that are more virulent in the wax moth host compared to (+) isolates that produce smaller less virulent sporangiospores. The larger sporangiospores germinate inside and lyse macrophages, whereas the smaller sporangiospores do not. sexMDelta mutants are sterile and still produce larger virulent sporangiospores, suggesting that either the sex locus is not involved in virulence/spore size or the sexP allele plays an inhibitory role. Phylogenetic analysis supports that at least three extant subspecies populate the M. circinelloides complex in nature: Mcl, M. circinelloides f. griseocyanus, and M. circinelloides f. circinelloides (Mcc). Mcc was found to be more prevalent among clinical Mucor isolates, and more virulent than Mcl in a diabetic murine model in contrast to the wax moth host. The M. circinelloides sex locus encodes an HMG domain protein (SexP for plus and SexM for minus <b>mating</b> types) <b>flanked</b> by genes encoding triose phosphate transporter (TPT) and RNA helicase homologs. The borders of the sex locus between the three subspecies differ: the Mcg sex locus includes the promoters of both the TPT and the RNA helicase genes, whereas the Mcl and Mcc sex locus includes only the TPT gene promoter. Mating between subspecies was restricted compared to mating within subspecies. These findings demonstrate that spore size dimorphism is linked to virulence of M. circinelloides species and that plasticity of the sex locus and adaptations in pathogenicity have occurred during speciation of the M. circinelloides complex.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Torsional vibrations in differentials of Rear Wheel Drive vehicles are of major importance for the automotive industry. Hypoid transmissions, forming the motion transfer mechanism from the driveshaft to the wheels, suffer from severe vibration issues. The latter are attributed to improper mesh between the <b>mating</b> gear <b>flanks</b> due to misalignments, variation of contact load and shifting of the effective mesh position. For certain operating conditions, the gear pair exhibits high amplitude motions accompanied with separation of the mating surfaces. Ultimately, single or even double-sided vibro-impact phenomena evolve, which have been related to noise generation. This thesis attempts {{to address these issues}} by effectively analysing the dynamic behaviour of a hypoid gear pair under torsional motion. The case study considered is focused on a commercial light truck. The major difference of the employed mathematical model to prior formulations is the usage of an alternative expression for the dynamic transmission error so that the variation of contact radii and transmission error can be accounted for. This approach combined to a correlation of the resistive torque in terms of the angular velocity of the differential enables the achievement of steady state, stable periodic solutions. The dynamic complexity of systems with gears necessitates the identification of the various response regimes. A solution continuation method (software AUTO) is employed to determine the stable/unstable branches over the operating range of the differential. The ensuing parametric studies convey the importance of the main system parameters on the dynamic behaviour of the transmission yielding crucial design guidelines. A tribo-dynamic investigation aims at expanding the dynamic model from pure dry conditions to a more integrated elastohydrodynamic (EHL) approach. Analytical and extrapolated solutions are applied for the derivation of the film thickness magnitude based on the kinematic and loading characteristics of the dynamic model. The temperature rise is governed mainly by conduction due to the thin lubricant films. The generated friction is also computed {{as a function of the}} viscous shear and asperity interactions. The effective lubricant viscosity is greatly affected by the pressure increase due to the resonant behaviour of the contact load. The final part of this work is involved with a feasibility study concerning the application of Nonlinear Energy Sinks (NES) as vibration absorbers, exploiting their ability for broadband frequency interaction. Response regimes associated with effective energy absorption are identified and encouraging results are obtained, showing the potential of the method...|$|R
40|$|The medial {{nucleus of}} the {{amygdala}} (Me) processes both chemosensory and hormonal input. In the male Syrian hamster the integrity of this nucleus is essential for normal reproductive behavior. To determine if gonadal steroids modulate neuronal structure in this nucleus, the morphology of Golgi-stained neurons in the anterior and posterior regions of Me were compared in castrated and reproductively intact adult hamsters. In castrated males, neurons in the posterior, but not the anterior, region of Me undergo structural changes, as indicated by {{a decrease in the}} mean highest dendritic branch level and mean somal area compared to intact males. To further elucidate the importance of testosterone and its metabolites in maintenance of neuronal structure in the adult, seven groups of male Syrian hamsters were studied. Animals were castrated and received a blank silastic capsule or a capsule filled with either testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or estradiol. or two capsules containing both metabolites, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol. Two groups of reproductively intact animals were included: brains from one group were processed simultaneously with the castrated and hormone-treated groups (control intact group), and the other group was processed {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. Animals were tested for <b>mating</b> behavior and <b>flank</b> glands were measured to test whether the capsules were effective in releasing the hormones into circulation. After a 12 -week survival period, the brains were processed with Golgi stain and well-impregnated neurons from the posterior Me were quantitatively analyzed for somal area, highest dendritic branch, total dendritic length, and density of spines. All the measures analyzed revealed a consistent pattern of response to the different gonadal steroids. Castration resulted in a decrease in the mean somal area, the mean highest dendritic branch, and the percentage of neurons with tertiary branch segments. Dihydrotestosterone treatment also resulted in a significant decrease in somal area, mean highest dendritic branch, and percentage of neurons with tertiary dendritic branches. In addition, the total dendritic length and spine density on terminal dendrites were reduced in these brains. The remaining hormone treatment groups were not significantly different from the control group. These results suggest that in orchidectomized male Syrian hamsters, testosterone or its aromatized form, estradiol, but not dihydrotestosterone, is sufficient to maintain the normal morphology of the neurons in the posterior part of the medial {{nucleus of the}} amygdala...|$|R
