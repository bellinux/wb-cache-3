5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater,</b> living on the remote island of Skokholm. These small seabirds make {{one of the longest}} migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This {{behaviour}} led {{to the question of how}} they navigated.|$|E
5|$|Wales’ {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater,</b> puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60% of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel. Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater,</b> could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
50|$|Other {{breeding}} species include ravens, common buzzards, peregrines, northern wheatears, gulls, auks, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> razorbills and guillemots.|$|R

5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids {{undertake}} long annual migrations in the non-breeding season. Southern {{species of}} shearwater {{such as the}} sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown {{that they are able}} to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200mi).|$|E
5|$|While Hesperornis is {{not thought}} to have left descendants, the {{earliest}} modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes. In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> and sooty shearwater) might {{date back to the}} Oligocene. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.|$|E
40|$|Northern fulmars and <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> are pelagic seabirds of the Order Procellariiformes, a {{group that}} is characterised by extreme life-history traits. Many of these traits have been {{associated}} with the unpredictability of marine food sources. However, fulmars and <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> feed their chicks at relatively frequent intervals compared with other procellariiforms, and the life-history implications of this strategy are poorly understood. In this thesis I examined food provisioning and chick growth strategies in fulmars and <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> and discussed these strategies in the context of life history - environment interactions. 1 tested the efficacy of a periodic weighing method for assessing food provisioning, and found that this gave a very similar estimate of the frequency and size of feeds compared to periodic weighing combined with data on parental attendance, determined by radio tracking. However, periodic weighing was much less effective at distinguishing meals from one or two parents. In <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> chick growth was highly correlated with food provisioning rate, and both variables showed significant annual variation. Both individual and environmental effects contributed to this variation, and in particular, peak mass showed highly significant repeatability coefficients. Fulmars showed significant variation in breeding success, diet and chick growth between two years, but chicks were apparently heavier in a very poor year. This was caused by differential mortality of chicks in poor condition. In <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> male parents visited the nest more frequently and made a greater contribution to food provisioning than females, a strategy that has seldom been reported in sexually monomorphic seabirds. I used a cross-fostering experiment to examine the parent-chick interactions responsible for the mass recession period prior to fledging in <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters.</b> Both parents and chicks had an active role in controlling food intake, and the results indicated that mass recession was not caused by parental desertion as previously thought...|$|R

50|$|The {{island is}} known for its seabirds, {{including}} <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> and Atlantic puffins, and for its plants, including red fescue, sea beet and common tree-mallow.|$|R
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater.</b> On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
25|$|Choughs live in {{holes in}} the cliffs, and the coast at Gwbert {{is also home to}} gannet, razorbill, guillemot, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater,</b> black-headed gull and fulmar. On the land other {{frequently}} spotted birds are birds of prey such as red kite, buzzard, peregrine falcon, kestrels and sparrowhawks. Skylarks are also a regular sight.|$|E
25|$|The shorter {{focal length}} of shearwater eyes {{give them a}} smaller, but brighter, image than {{is the case for}} pigeons, so the latter has sharper daytime vision. Although the <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> has adaptations for night vision, the effect is small, and it is likely that these birds also use smell and hearing to locate their nests.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} known for its bird life, {{including}} corncrakes, Arctic terns, gannets, corn buntings and <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters.</b> The RSPB has a nature reserve at Balranald.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater,</b> {{like many}} other seabirds, visits its {{breeding}} colonies at night to reduce the chances of attack by aerial predators. Two aspects of its optical structure suggest that the eye of this species is adapted to vision at night. In the shearwater's eyes the lens {{does most of the}} bending of light necessary to produce a focused image on the retina. The cornea, the outer covering of the eye, is relative flat and so of low refractive power. In a diurnal bird like the pigeon, the reverse is true; the cornea is highly curved and is the principal refractive component. The ratio of refraction by the lens to that by the cornea is 1.6 for the shearwater and 0.4 for the pigeon; the figure for the shearwater is consistent with that for a range of nocturnal birds and mammals.|$|E
25|$|Tubenosed seabirds, {{which come}} ashore only to breed and {{spend most of}} their life {{wandering}} close {{to the surface of the}} oceans, have a long narrow area of visual sensitivity on the retina This region, the area giganto cellularis, has been found in the <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater,</b> Kerguelen petrel, great shearwater, broad-billed prion and common diving-petrel. It is characterised by the presence of ganglion cells which are regularly arrayed and larger than those found in the rest of the retina, and morphologically appear similar to the cells of the retina in cats. The location and cellular morphology of this novel area suggests a function in the detection of items in a small binocular ﬁeld projecting below and around the bill. It is not concerned primarily with high spatial resolution, but may assist in the detection of prey near the sea surface as a bird flies low over it.|$|E
500|$|The most pelagic species, {{mainly in}} the 'tubenose' order Procellariiformes, are great wanderers, and the {{albatrosses}} of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the [...] "roaring forties" [...] outside the breeding season. The tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean, but congregate when food becomes available. Many are also among the longest-distance migrants; sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus nesting on the Falkland Islands migrate [...] between the breeding colony and the North Atlantic Ocean off Norway. Some Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus do this same journey in reverse. As they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> is calculated to have flown 8 million km (5 million miles) during its over-50 year lifespan.|$|E
50|$|Puffin Island holds {{important}} {{populations of}} several seabird species, including Atlantic puffins, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> and European storm-petrels, and was acquired as a nature reserve by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (now BirdWatch Ireland) {{in the early}} 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The coastal {{sections}} {{may provide}} sightings of seabirds such as kittiwakes, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> puffins, guillemots and sea gulls together with grey seals, and at points inland the rare Manx Loaghtan sheep on areas protected by Manx National Heritage.|$|R
50|$|Calf of Man {{is home to}} a {{breeding}} population of <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> a seabird which derives its name from its presence in Manx waters. The Calf of Man also has a large colony of seals which live and breed on the rocky coastline.|$|R
500|$|The {{ability of}} birds {{to return to}} precise {{locations}} across vast distances {{has been known for}} some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s, a <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> released in Boston in the United States returned to its colony in Skomer, in Wales within 13 days, a distance of [...] Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} name Fratercula {{comes from the}} Medieval Latin fratercula, friar, {{a reference to the}} black and white plumage which resembles monastic robes. The specific name arctica refers to the northerly distribution of the bird, being derived from the Greek ἄρκτος ("arktos"), the bear, referring to the northerly constellation, the Great Bear. The vernacular name puffin – puffed in the sense of swollen – was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus puffinus), which in 1652 was known as the [...] "Manks puffin". It is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English pophyn or poffin) used for the cured carcasses. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name at a much later stage, possibly because of its similar nesting habits, and it was formally applied to Fratercula arctica by Pennant in 1768. While the species is also known as the common puffin, [...] "Atlantic Puffin" [...] is the English name recommended by the International Ornithological Congress.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "three now {{cosmopolitan}} commensal rodent pest species" [...] (the brown rat, {{the black}} rat {{and the house}} mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum. This approach has been successful {{on the island of}} Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.|$|E
50|$|The island {{supports}} one of {{the largest}} and most important seabird colonies in Ireland, with over 50,000 common guillemots, 5,000 kittiwakes, 3,500 razorbills, 2,500 pairs of herring gulls, as well as smaller numbers of puffins, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> fulmars, greylag geese and other species.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} lack of {{mobility}} on land, <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> are vulnerable to attack by large gulls, such as the great black-backed gull, and great skua. Birds of prey such as the peregrine falcon and golden eagle are also recorded as killing adult birds.|$|R
50|$|The north, north-east, and {{south-east}} {{coasts of}} the island {{have been identified as}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of their significance as seabird breeding sites, especially for <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (2500 pairs), European storm petrels (500 pairs) and black guillemots (300 pairs).|$|R
2500|$|The station badge {{showed a}} <b>Manx</b> <b>Shearwater</b> bird {{on one of}} the many islands that lie off the eastern Pembrokeshire coastline.

2500|$|The English name [...] "puffin" [...] – puffed in {{the sense}} of swollen – was {{originally}} applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwater</b> (Puffinus puffinus), formerly known as the [...] "Manks puffin".

2500|$|The {{tufted puffin}} was first {{described}} in 1769 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas.

25|$|In September 2005, it was {{reported}} that the population of brown rats on the island had grown to 10,000 and was causing such problems to both the human population and the birdlife, particularly the rare <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> that a complete cull would take place. Because the mice on the island are believed to be a rare and distinct subspecies of woodmouse, a breeding population of mice was removed beforehand by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) so that the cull could use rodenticide. By the end of 2006 it was believed that Canna was rat-free and during that summer there was also an encouraging {{increase in the number of}} breeding puffins and razorbills; <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> were nesting for the first time since 1997.|$|R
500|$|Experiments with <b>Manx</b> <b>shearwaters</b> {{showed that}} when {{released}} [...] "under a clear sky" [...] {{far from their}} nests, the seabirds first oriented themselves and then flew off in the correct direction.
