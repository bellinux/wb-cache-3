5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> continental landmass, {{the island of}} Hawaii {{is one of the}} most geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.|$|E
5|$|In April 1784, the Rowans {{and five}} other {{families}} set out for a tract of land on the Long Falls of the Green River that Rowan had purchased before leaving Pennsylvania. The party arrived on May 11, 1784, and constructed a fort which they dubbed Fort Vienna. The fort, then located approximately 100 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> white settlement, is the present-day town of Calhoun. The settlers at Fort Vienna frequently clashed with the Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort Vienna for six years.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} 150years, other expeditions, explorers, and {{scientists}} would piece together what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the Back River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> outpost of Western civilization.|$|E
25|$|South from Branstree {{a further}} ridge connects to Tarn Crag, passing between {{the head of}} Mosedale and the {{headwaters}} of Longsleddale. This depression at 1,650ft is broad and boggy. Mosedale is the upper hanging valley of Swindale, running westwards from the apparent dalehead. Nestled against the lower slopes of Branstree near the head of Mosedale is Mosedale Cottage. This shepherd's bothy, two <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> road, is only inhabited occasionally. Its whitewashed walls provide an important navigational reference in deteriorating weather. Behind the cottage are {{the remains of a}} large quarry.|$|E
25|$|The {{services}} remained without major modification until 2001 {{when the}} Newbury complex {{was closed and}} the Meridian West studio operation {{was moved to the}} Southampton headquarters; Newsgathering remained the same as previously. When the company moved to Whiteley in 2004, presentation of all three editions of Meridian Tonight moved with the company, resulting in the closure of the New Hythe studio base, although newsgathering in the south-east was unaffected as journalists and reporters moved back to the Maidstone Studios. Despite this move not being uncommon in the broadcasting industry, some considered the move controversial, particularly as the Meridian South East programme would be presented 60 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> part of the South East region and 160 miles from its furthest point.|$|E
50|$|Flecknoe {{is quite}} an {{isolated}} village, being one <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> main road (<b>the</b> A425 Southam - Daventry road) and is connected only by narrow lanes. Flecknoe {{has a small}} church, dedicated to St. Mark, which was built with railway money in 1891 as compensation for disruption to the nearby ancient village of Wolfhampcote.|$|R
50|$|Alpine, Washington, was {{a town in}} <b>the</b> Cascade Mountains, <b>near</b> Skykomish, Washington. Founded in {{the late}} 19th century and {{originally}} named Nippon, Washington, it was first built to house Japanese railway workers. Another nearby railway town, Corea, housed Korean workers.

25|$|Pillar {{may also}} be climbed from Ennerdale. From the YHA youth hostel at Black Sail {{at the head of}} the valley, it is a fairly short walk (around 1.5km and 300m of ascent) to the summit of Black Sail Pass, from where the same routes can be {{followed}} as described above. As Black Sail hostel is five or six <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> public road, this approach is somewhat impractical to day-trippers (especially since the Ennerdale valley is itself remote from the main tourist centres of the Lake District), though attractive to those staying at the hostel. Alternatively, there are various paths up the mountain from lower down the valley which offer the possibility of closer acquaintance with the crags of the north face.|$|E
25|$|Lynch's {{first term}} as Taoiseach also {{witnessed}} various reforms {{in areas such}} as welfare and education. In 1967, a redundancy payments scheme was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic flat-rate maternity benefit. In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school “for those living more than three <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> school.” In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of pensionable age, while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.|$|E
25|$|Much of the municipality's {{economy is}} now {{tied to the}} influx of {{tourists}} and foreigners who come to live, mostly retirees. A Wikipedia sister site Wikivoyage has an entry for San Miguel de Allende. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about 8.4 million USD at the town's attractions, but those who live here contribute far more to the economy. Most of this is concentrated {{in the town of}} San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside. This began in the mid 20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it no longer is. This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. Despite not having a casino or an airport and being 400 <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Time and Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler as one of its preferred places to live and visit.|$|E

The public charging network is envisaged to comprise 500 on-street charging points and 2.000 installations in publicly accessible car parks.
