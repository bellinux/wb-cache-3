The citation read: The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Admiral Vice Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt (NSN: 0-5819), United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commander, Western Naval Task Force, in action against enemy German forces during the invasion of Salerno, in September 1943. In command of more than 600 Allied Men-O'-War, ships and large landing craft responsible for the safe sea borne movements of the Allied FIFTH Army to the Gulf of Salerno, Admiral Hewitt brought them skillfully through <b>mined</b> <b>approach</b> courses and developed a sea frontier length of approximately fifty miles despite limited maneuvering space. As the second wave of our landing boats reached the shore, strong German armored elements, deployed along selected beaches, launched heavy counterattacks. They raked the sands where our troops were trying to dig in, tanks rolled out of the valley and charged; hostile artillery continually shelled ships in the anchorage; enemy air forces attacked with high and low-level bombings, dive-bombing and strafing, and with radio-controlled and rocket-glider bombs. The entire operation was in jeopardy. Aware of the narrow margin of success, Admiral Hewitt went ashore. He made a personal reconnaissance of the situation and learned of the peril in flat coastal plains where Allied formations were enveloped in two small detached areas pounded by artillery fire from rugged high ground inland, and requested immediate air and sea reinforcements. With his Flagship marked for destruction by the German Command and pursued as a vital target, he shifted his Flag to a less important unit. His long-range Naval guns blasted enemy formations without respite. German penetration was sealed off and rendered an immobile target for heavy strikes by Allied bombers, thus insuring the success of the Salerno Campaign. By his courage, initiative and inspiring leadership under fire, Admiral Hewitt upheld the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

40|$|In {{this survey}} paper, we discuss {{biomedical}} ontologies and major text mining techniques applied to biomedicine and healthcare. Biomedical ontologies such as UMLS {{are currently being}} adopted in text <b>mining</b> <b>approaches</b> because they provide domain knowledge for text <b>mining</b> <b>approaches.</b> In addition, biomedical ontologies enable us to resolve many linguistic problems when text <b>mining</b> <b>approaches</b> handle biomedical literature. As the first example of text mining, document clustering is surveyed. Because a document set is normally multiple-topic, text <b>mining</b> <b>approaches</b> use document clustering as a preprocessing step to group similar documents. Additionally, document clustering is able to inform the biomedical literature searches required {{for the practice of}} evidence-based medicine. We introduce Swanson’s UnDiscovered Public Knowledge (UDPK) model to generate biomedical hypotheses from biomedical literature such as MEDLINE by discovering novel connections among logically-related biomedical concepts. Another important area of text mining is document classification. Document classification is a valuable tool for biomedical tasks that involve large amounts of text.

40|$|Recently, some {{researchers}} have developed incremental and online <b>mining</b> <b>approaches</b> to maintain association rules without having to re-process the entire database whenever the database is updated or user specified thresholds are changed. However, they usually can not flexibly obtain association rules or patterns from portions of data, consider problems with different aspects, or provide online decision support for users. We earlier developed an online <b>mining</b> <b>approach</b> for generation of association rules under multidimensional consideration. The multidimensional online <b>mining</b> <b>approach</b> may, however, get loose upper-bound support of candidate itemsets and thus cause excessive I/O and computation costs. In this paper, we attempt to apply {{the concept of a}} negative border to enlarge the mining information in the multidimensional pattern relation to help get tighter upper-bound, and thus reduce the number of candidate itemsets to consider. Based on the extended multidimensional pattern relation, a corresponding online <b>mining</b> <b>approach</b> called Negative-Border Online Mining (NOM) is proposed to efficiently and effectively utilize the information of negative itemset in the negative border. Experiments for heterogeneous datasets are also performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

New threats and interrelated solutions to avoid these threats are budding jointly with the secured system evolution.

The optimization of IDS becomes an attractive domain due to the security audit data as well as complex and active properties of intrusion behaviors. The main purpose of IDS is to protect the resources from threats.

Intrusion detection systems have been integrated with data <b>mining</b> <b>approaches</b> to identify intrusions.
