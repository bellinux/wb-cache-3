To maintain a noise floor of 110 dB below the carrier power, i.e., CNR, a <b>minimum</b> carrier <b>power</b> is required.

40|$|Given {{a quantum}} gate $U$ {{acting on a}} bipartite quantum system, its maximum (average, <b>minimum)</b> {{entangling}} <b>power</b> is the maximum (average, minimum) entanglement generation with respect to certain entanglement measure when the inputs are restricted to be product states. In this paper, we mainly focus on the 'weakest' one, i. e., the <b>minimum</b> entangling <b>power,</b> among all these entangling powers. We show that, by choosing von Neumann entropy of reduced density operator or Schmidt rank as entanglement measure, even the 'weakest' entangling power is generically very close to its maximal possible entanglement generation. In other words, maximum, average and <b>minimum</b> entangling <b>powers</b> are generically close. We then study <b>minimum</b> entangling <b>power</b> with respect to other Lipschitiz-continuous entanglement measures and generalize our results to multipartite quantum systems. As a straightforward application, a random quantum gate will almost surely be an intrinsically fault-tolerant entangling device that will always transform every low-entangled state to near-maximally entangled state.

25|$|In some cases, {{especially}} in the high plateau, cooperatives and community organizations access the distribution companies’ network and sell electricity to small rural communities. Sometimes, those are organized enterprises that provide the service to middle-size towns, but in most cases, they are small organizations that serve family communities. This situation faces a legal vacuum since the consumers benefiting from these scheme, who do not consume the <b>minimum</b> <b>power</b> established legally established, cannot be considered as regulated ones. In addition, these consumers are localized outside the distribution companies’ concession areas, so they cannot receive the companies’ service. In practice, the distribution companies are reselling electricity to the mentioned organizations outside the legal framework. Accurate information {{on the number of}} organizations that operate in rural areas does not exist. However, there are approximately three in La Paz, twenty in Oruro and three in Potosi.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Bossi {{heard of}} an {{airplane}} which had successfully flown while powered only by a 1-horsepower (0.75kW) engine. This prompted Bossi to calculate the <b>minimum</b> <b>power</b> that a manned aircraft would need to fly. The calculation yielded a value of approximately 0.94-horsepower (0.70kW), which convinced Bossi that Human-powered flight might be possible. During a trip to Philadelphia, Bossi tested {{the speed at which}} a glider would take off under tow. The experiment consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider. A spring scale was attached to the tow line to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist. This same experiment procedure was later repeated as part of the development of the Gossamer Condor and the Gossamer Albatross. The results confirmed that a speed at which the necessary lift could be obtained was indeed attainable.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} change to the {{previous}} Finnish ice class rules {{was the way the}} structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, midship, aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area {{as a function of the}} ship's displacement and engine output. The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a <b>minimum</b> <b>power</b> requirement was given so that the ice-strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic.|$|E

2500|$|Work {{hardening}} {{happens to}} all cases, even low-pressure handgun cases. The sudden {{increase in pressure}} upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing its crystalline structure and making it more brittle. The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, crimping, and firing, and will split during loading or firing. While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded or recycled as a wildcat cartridge of shorter overall length, allowing the split section to be removed. [...] The simplest way to decrease the effects of work hardening is to decrease the pressure in the case. Loading to the <b>minimum</b> <b>power</b> level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life.

2500|$|Lap {{times were}} {{slower than the}} {{previous}} year's session because of indistinct track surface changes and new tyres provided by Michelin. In {{the first group of}} five runners, which saw no driver venture out of their garages and onto the track for the first three minutes because they were unwilling to be first to lay rubber on the circuit, Buemi set the fastest overall time of all four groups with a lap of one minute and 2.171 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist and di Grassi. Abt and Bird were the first group's slowest two drivers. López went fastest in the track's first sector to become the quickest competitor in the second group, followed by Mitch Evans and Prost. Conway and Piquet rounded the second group's five participants. In the third group, local favourite Vergne went second fastest overall, with Turvey setting the second-quickest time, 0.110 seconds behind Vergne. Gutiérrez, Jérôme d'Ambrosio and Stéphane Sarrazin rounded out the third group's slowest three drivers. Sarrazin pulled {{over to the side of}} the track when his powertrain switched off on his <b>minimum</b> <b>power</b> lap, before restarting his car, enabling him to continue, although the problem meant he started from 20th (and last) on the grid. Despite going the fastest of any competitor in the fourth group, Heidfeld narrowly missed out on progressing into super pole, while second-fastest driver Frijns was also unable to advance further by less than a tenth of a second. Dillmann was third-quickest, and António Félix da Costa and Adam Carroll competed the fourth group's running order. After group qualifying ended, the times set by Buemi, Vergne, Turvey, López and Gutiérrez (in his third start) were fast enough to progress them into super pole.|$|E
