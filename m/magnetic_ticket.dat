50|$|Tisséo {{operates}} two metro lines, two tramway line, and hundred bus and shuttle services (bus, mobibus, TAD), with an unified <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticketing</b> and RFID card system.|$|R
50|$|Contactless {{smart cards}} fully {{replaced}} their <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> predecessors on 1 December 2002, making Singapore {{one of the}} first cities to implement contactless smart card payment on all main modes of public transportation, similar to Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|The company {{charges a}} flat fare {{that can be}} paid either by <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> sold in the {{stations}} or with a rechargeable smartcard, and grants access {{to any of the}} rail lines on the Greater São Paulo.|$|E
50|$|At first, {{the pass}} is a hand-written ticket, {{but it was}} changed to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> when KTX opened, so that the tickets can be used at {{automatic}} ticket gates. There were only three-, five-, seven- and ten-day passes initially, and a further one-day pass was added in February 2011.|$|E
50|$|Tickets {{are valid}} for 90 minutes. To {{purchase}} on a bus, money is {{dropped into a}} farebox, which accepts only coins. The farebox counts the money and depending on the time and amount paid, and the driver presses a button on a control panel printing out a <b>magnetic</b> transfer <b>ticket</b> for one, two, or three zones. Although <b>magnetic</b> transfer <b>tickets</b> are valid throughout the system including SkyTrain and SeaBus, fare gates on SkyTrain and SeaBus stations are incapable of reading <b>magnetic</b> transfer <b>tickets</b> and the gate will not open even if the passenger has a valid <b>magnetic</b> transfer <b>ticket.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{using the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticketing</b> system for 27 years from 1984 to 2011, Kolkata Metro {{introduced}} Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tokens by Centre for Railway Information Systems(CRIS) from 2011. The old magnetic strip reader gates {{were replaced by}} new RFID readers.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2010 the MTR {{began to}} replace the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> used for single, group, and {{multiple}} journey tickets with new [...] "smart tickets" [...] that contain a memory chip. The new system was in full operation by 5 June 2010.|$|R
50|$|Fares are {{collected}} in buses (which {{are equipped with}} turnstiles) at the stops and termini turnstiles, before passengers' admission. Infrequent customers may buy a <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> to ride the system (an Edmondson ticket). Daily commuters often employ the BOM card (Cartão BOM) - an abbreviation for Bilhete Ônibus Metropolitano, Metropolitan Bus Ticket, compiling a word meaning good in Portuguese - a smartcard allowing access to the buses and the state rail transportation as well. Special integration fares were offered for customers using São Paulo Metro or CPTM commuter rail systems, through the acquisition of a combined ticket costing R$5.80.|$|E
50|$|In July 2006, PATCO {{announced}} that it would start the transition from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> fare system to an electronic smart card system. Magnetic tickets are still sold, for the occasional riders, however they are now in a paper form. The new computer vending machines allow more advanced purchasing options for Freedom Cards (the term used for the smart cards). Payment can now be in the form of coins, bills, credit cards, or debit cards; however, credit and debit cards can only be used to load fare onto a Freedom Card or purchase a new card. PATCO has a system that allows balances to be reloaded on the Internet.|$|E
50|$|From its {{beginning}} in 1969, PATCO used a <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> {{as the sole}} means of collecting fares. The plastic tickets may still be bought for single rides through vending machines in the stations. These machines once required coins, so bill changers were placed in stations. Each vending machine was capable of selling two types of tickets, which the rider chose by pushing a button after inserting the correct fare. Several machines were needed in each station, since different types of one-way and two-way tickets needed to be sold. After the ticket was purchased, it was inserted through a turnstile gate. To exit the station, it was inserted again, and if it had rides remaining, returned to the rider. A ticket with no rides was re- encoded by the system and returned {{to use in the}} vending machine. Tickets could also be purchased in ten-trip passes, but these were obtained through mail or in office.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years, single trip <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> were {{purchased}} at Ticket Vending Machines with coins only. Notes could be broken up into small change at a separate change machine. Those holding magnetic multi trip farecards could only reload their cards with additional credit at manual service counters or a separate Add Value Machine.|$|R
2500|$|The {{funicular}} {{is considered}} {{to be part of the}} Paris Métro network, and so has similar pricing. The two stations each have turnstiles which can read <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> and Navigo passes. They thus allow access via all RATP payment methods, including the single-journey Ticket [...] "t", [...] combination transport/museum pass and other RATP weekly and monthly passes.|$|R
5|$|Starting September 2015, the old <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> were {{decommissioned}} {{and replaced}} by contactless-based smart card technology. Passengers can enter the system paid areas with either a single journey or stored value Beep Card. The Beep Card {{can be used on}} all LRT and MRT lines. Tickets can be sold from ticket booths manned by station agents or on ticket machine/s.|$|R
50|$|The T1 modern tramway {{was built}} following, {{for the most}} part, the {{previous}} tramway which was closed in 1962. The line from Kabataş to Topkapı was previously served by tram Routes 12, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34 (see Trams in Istanbul). The Galata Bridge was also served by trams previously, although this bridge {{and other parts of}} the former tram route was totally unreserved track, while the present route is mostly on reserved track right of way. On the reserved portions of the line, rails are often raised like metro/suburban train to run fast, and stops on these parts have platforms, illuminated covering, etc. All stops on the T1 line have ticket counters and <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticket</b> gates (just like the Istanbul Metro). In the busiest sections, tracks are also elevated, and the reserved/elevated track areas have separate light systesm for improved visibility and safely. In the unreserved portions of the T1 line, recent tracks were paved with tiles for a gentler look. In some cases, tracks are laid on both side of the road, while sometimes on either the left or the right side of the road, and still other times in middle of road if running on a narrow street. On the Galata Bridge, tracks are in middle of the bridge on a fully dedicated right of way. At some stops, there is a staircase link from the road via a bridge to the tram stop, to promote safe crossing of the road for those taking the tram.|$|E
50|$|New fareboxes were {{installed}} in June 2011. The fareboxes collect fares, issue new <b>magnetic</b> striped <b>tickets</b> (e.g., day passes, change cards) and process previously issued <b>magnetic</b> striped <b>tickets</b> (e.g., day passes, youth summer passes, change cards). When a patron {{does not have}} exact change, a change card is issued with a cash value that can be redeemed at a future farebox transaction {{for up to a}} year.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} <b>ticketing</b> {{system of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> has been scrapped and tokens {{are being used}} in its placed since July 2011. The system requires touch-free gates that function through radio-frequency identification rather than the old magnetic-strip reader. The Centre for Railway Information Systems, which has implemented the Rs 415 million project, gave the contract to a Spanish firm last year after a global bidding process.|$|R
50|$|For {{passengers}} {{who do not}} have a Chip and PIN or Chip and Signature payment card, these are processed by a swipe slot in the AVANTIX casing which reads the magnetic stripe of the card and requires the buyer to sign a card receipt. This magnetic read head {{can also be used to}} swipe suitable <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> and will tell the user if the ticket has been through a ticket barrier.|$|R
500|$|The LRT-1 serves 500,000 {{passengers}} daily {{while the}} LRT-2 serves 200,000 passengers. Its [...] of mostly elevated route form two lines which serve [...] in total. [...] LRT Line1 (LRT-1), {{also called the}} Green Line (formerly known as Yellow Line), opened in 1984 and travels a north–south route. [...] LRT Line2 (LRT-2), the Blue Line (formerly known as Purple Line), was completed in 2004 and runs east–west. [...] The original LRT-1 was built as a no-frills means of public transport and lacks some features and comforts, but the new LRT-2 has been built with additional standards and criteria in mind like barrier-free access. Security guards at each station conduct inspections and provide assistance. A reusable plastic <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticketing</b> system has replaced the previous token-based system in 2001, and the Flash Pass introduced as a step towards a more integrated transportation system. In 2015, the plastic <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> were replaced with the Beep, a contactless smart card, was introduced to provide a common ticketing to 3 rail lines and some bus lines.|$|R
50|$|In April 2003, ERG {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Stockholm’s public transport authority, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL) to implement a smart card based fare collection system. The contract involved the upgrade of the current rail and metro <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticketing</b> system to contactless smart cards, together with the extension of the system to the bus network, sales outlets, and new ticket vending machines. The contract included the issuing of over one million cards. The system went into public trial from September 2008 and became widely available to the public in 2009.|$|R
2500|$|Fare {{payment is}} via a barrier system {{accepting}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> and RFID like contacless cards. A rechargeable {{contactless smart card}} called [...] "OPUS" [...] unveiled on April 21, 2008 provides seamless integration with other transit networks of neighboring cities by being capable of holding multiple transport tickets: tickets, books or subscriptions, a subscription for Montreal only and commuter train tickets. Moreover, unlike the magnetic stripe cards, which had been sold alongside the new OPUS cards up until May 2009, the contactless cards are not at risk of becoming demagnetized and rendered useless and do not require patrons to slide them through a reader.|$|R
50|$|The {{card was}} issued {{to the general}} {{community}} including school and tertiary students on 7 March 2011. ACTION's old <b>magnetic</b> strip <b>tickets</b> continued to be valid during a transition period until 11 April 2011.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 Magnadata was {{the first}} company to produce <b>magnetic</b> strip <b>tickets</b> for British Rail. For this it {{received}} the Queen’s Award for Technology in 1989; it {{was the first}} printing company to receive this award.|$|R
50|$|Before 2001, {{passengers}} on the LRT Line 1 would purchase a token to enter the station. Subsequent upgrades in the fare collection system eventually transitioned the Yellow Line from a token-based system to a ticket-based system, with full conversion to a ticket-based system achieved on September 9, 2001. Starting September 2015, the old <b>magnetic</b> <b>tickets</b> were decommissioned and replaced by contactless-based smart card technology. Passengers can enter the system paid areas with either a single journey or stored value Beep Card. The Beep Card {{can be used on}} all LRT and MRT lines. Tickets can be sold from ticket booths manned by station agents or on ticket machine/s.|$|R
5000|$|Enshū-Nishigasaki Station is a {{manned station}} {{with a single}} island platform. The station {{building}} has automated ticket machines, and automated turnstiles which accept the NicePass smart card, as well as ET Card, a <b>magnetic</b> card <b>ticketing</b> system.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, the MTR and KCR {{started using}} the Octopus Access Control System {{as the main}} payment method for travel on its network, {{replacing}} the Common Stored Value Tickets. Octopus cards are rechargeable, contactless smart cards, thus {{the value of the}} money is digitally stored in the card, and the amount can be automatically calculated and deducted by Octopus card readers. The system was originally proposed and introduced by the MTR. It has been extended to different services such as minibuses, franchised buses, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants. It {{has the potential to be}} further developed in other fields of services. The older, traditional <b>magnetic</b> <b>ticketing</b> system is also still in use for single journeys.|$|R
50|$|Dai-Ichi-dōri Station is viaduct {{station with}} a single {{elevated}} side platform. It is manned during daylight hours. The station building has automated ticket machines, and automated turnstiles, which accepts the NicePass smart card, as well as ET Card, a <b>magnetic</b> card <b>ticketing</b> system.|$|R
50|$|In Japan {{most local}} railway tickets keep the Edmondson format. These are modern <b>magnetic</b> back <b>tickets</b> issued by vending machines, punched by {{automatic}} station entry gates and {{collected at the}} exit gates. In some rural stations hand-punching by railway employees is still done.|$|R
5000|$|Hamkita Station is a {{manned station}} {{with a single}} island platform, {{connected}} to a two-story station building. The station building has automated ticket machines, and automated turnstiles which accept the NicePass smart card, as well as ET Card, a <b>magnetic</b> card <b>ticketing</b> system.|$|R
50|$|In August 2010 it {{was awarded}} the £24 million {{contract}} to produce the <b>magnetic</b> strip <b>tickets</b> for train tickets in the UK for the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC). This is for around 750 million tickets a year at over 2500 railway stations.|$|R
