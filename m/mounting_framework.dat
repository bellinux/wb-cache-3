From 1939, companies in other Australian states {{had been involved in}} manufacturing aircraft engines for the RAAF, notably the Gipsy Major engines for DH82 Tiger Moths and single-row Wasp radial engines for the Wirraway fighter. From the beginning of 1942, as part of the general gearing up of industry in Queensland, aviation companies commenced the overhaul of aircraft engine for the USAAF. Australian National Airways Pty Ltd at Archerfield Aerodrome produced its first two reconditioned radial engines in May 1942.

This is achieved by use of a handle located near the helmsman which lowers a scoop to fill the tanks while the boat is underway. There are two fuel tanks, which are embedded in polystyrene, located on the port and starboard sides of the hull. The tanks can fuel each engine independently or one tank can fuel both engines if needed.

It had a number of issues with its ammunition, namely the black powder used as a propellant gave off copious smoke clouds on firing that revealed the tube's location and the mortar bomb fuzes had a high rate of failure. The breech-loading mortar tube was <b>mounted</b> on a <b>framework</b> that didn't allow for any traverse, which meant {{that it was impossible to}} engage different targets without relaying the mortar.

50|$|In 1885, Joseph Edmondson of Halifax, UK, {{patented}} his 'Circular Calculator' - {{essentially a}} 20-digit arithmometer with a circular carriage (the slides being arranged radially around it) {{instead of the}} straight sliding carriage. One benefit of this was that the carriage always remained within the footprint (to use a modern term) of the machine instead of overhanging the case at one side when the higher decimal places were in use. Another was that one could make a calculation of up to ten places, using half the circumference of the carriage, and then turn the carriage through 180°; {{the result of the}} calculation was locked in place by means of brass prongs <b>mounted</b> on the <b>framework,</b> and one could leave it there while making an entirely new calculation using the fresh set of display windows now brought into alignment with the sliders. Thus the machine could be said to have a rudimentary memory. See the Rechenmaschinen-Illustrated website (External links below) for pictures and a description.|$|R

AIR ART© is a radical and in-situ experimental workshop (2013). We tested innovative structural capacities of inflatable structures and hydrophobic nets to increase the yield of atmospheric water collection. AIR ART© will work on visionary design able to ‘milk’ fog and transform it into water for drinking and irrigation. AIR ART© mainly focused on the experimental teaching and learning system of eco-design implemented in several design studios and compact workshops. The selected case shows how engaged students and tutors can rapidly develop key structural and ludic skills such as spatial games, pneumatic tests, environmental awareness, lifecycle thinking and collaborative research-by-doing applied to radical mock-ups and 1 : 1 prototypes.

40|$|In this thesis, {{multiple}} {{approaches for}} the use of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) are reported and described in three chapters: Chapter 1 – Surface <b>Mounted</b> Imidazolate <b>Frameworks</b> An attempt was made to gain control over the growth of ZIFs on gold surfaces functionalized with specific thiols. With the use of carboxylic acid-, imidazole- and methyl-terminated SAMs, no homogeneous growth was observed. This result was ascribed to a bad quality of gold coated silicon wafers. Characterization of the products was performed with AFM, grazing Angle IR and contact angle measurements. Chapter 2 – Post-synthetic Cation Exchange (PScE) A method to exchange zinc ions in the framework with manganese ions from solution was reproduced from Fei et al. [1] With atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), exchange yields were observed to be 2 - 20 % after an exchange period of 1 day; this was increased to a maximum of 35 % after 3 days. Although it was proven that the particles did not leach zinc or manganese ions, no evidence was found with X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS and N 2 -physisorption that manganese was truly incorporated into the framework. Chapter 3 – Catalytic Testing of ZIF- 8 [Zn 1 -xMnx] Exchanged ZIF- 8 crystals were used as a catalyst in the oxidation reaction of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde and in the epoxidation of olefins. An increase in the conversion of veratryl alcohol was measured with Gas Chromatography (GC). Additionally, no leaching of metal ions was observed with ICP-OES and after hot-filtration. The ZIF- 8 [Zn 1 -xMnx] material exhibited no catalytic activity in the epoxidation of olefins...|$|R

40|$|Processing {{of large}} numbers (hundreds of thousands) of small files (i. e., up to a few KB) is {{notoriously}} problematic for all modern parallel file systems. While modern storage solutions provide high and scalable bandwidth through parallel storage servers connected with a high-speed network, accessing small files is sequential and latency-bounded. Paradoxically, performance of file access is worse than if the files were stored on a local hard drive. We present a generic solution for large-scale HPC facilities that improves the performance of workflows dealing {{with large numbers of}} small file. The files are saved inside a single large file containing a disk image, similarly to an archive. When needed, the image is mounted through the Unix loop-back device, and the contents of the image are available to the user {{in the form of a}} usual directory tree. Since mounting of disks under Unix often requires super-user privileges, security concerns and possible ways to address them are considered. A complete Python implementation of image creation, <b>mounting,</b> and unmounting <b>framework</b> is presented. A seamless integration into HPC environments managed by SLURM is discussed on an example of read-only software modules created by administrators, and user-created disk images with read-only application input data.

5000|$|At several points, MacCullagh {{addresses}} the physical nature of an ethereal medium having such properties. Not surprisingly, he argues against a mechanical {{interpretation of the}} Luminiferous aether because he readily admits that no known physical medium could have such a potential function resisting only rotation of its elements. [...] "Concerning the peculiar constitution of the ether, we know nothing and shall suppose nothing, except what {{is involved in the}} foregoing assumptions vibrations in a medium of constant density... Having arrived at the value of potential function, we may now take it for the starting point of our theory, and dismiss the assumptions by which we were conducted to it." [...] Despite the success of the theory, physicists and mathematicians were not receptive to the idea of reducing physics to a set of abstract field equations divorced from a mechanical model. The notion of the ether as a compressible fluid or similar physical entity was too deeply ingrained in nineteenth century physical thinking, even for decades after the publication of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in 1864. MacCullagh's ideas were largely abandoned and forgotten until 1880, when George FitzGerald re-discovered and re-interpreted his findings in the light of Maxwell's work. William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin succeeded in developing a physically realizable model of MacCullagh's rotationally elastic but translationally insensitive ether, consisting of gyrostats <b>mounted</b> on a <b>framework</b> of telescoping rods, described in his paper [...] "On a Gyrostatic Adynamic Constitution for Ether" [...] (1890).|$|R
40|$|In {{terrestrial}} ecosystems most carbon (C) occurs below-ground, {{making the}} activity of soil decomposer organisms critical to the global carbon cycle. Temperate grassland ecosystems, contain large, diverse and active soil meso- and macrofauna decomposer communities. Understanding the {{effects of climate change}} on their ecology offers a first step towards meaningful predictions of changes in soil organic carbon mineralisation. We examined the effects of soil warming on the abundance, diversity and ecology of temperate grassland soil fauna functional groups, ecosystem net CO 2 flux and respiration and plant above- and below-ground productivity in a 2 -year plant–soil mesocosm experiment. Low voltage heating cable <b>mounted</b> on a <b>framework</b> of stainless steel mesh provided a constant 3. 5 °C difference between control and warmed mesocosm soils. Results showed that this temperature increment had little effect on soil respiration and above-ground plant biomass. There was, however, a significant effect on the soil fauna due to warmer conditions and increased root growth, with significant decreases in the numbers in the large oligochaete groups and Prostigmata mites and the re-distribution of enchytraeids to deeper soil layers. Functional groups exhibited individualistic responses to soil warming, with the total disappearance of epigeic species {{in the case of the}} ecosystem engineers and an increased diversity of fungivorous mites that, together, produced significant changes in the composition and trophic structure of the fauna community. The observed switch towards a fungal driven food web has important implications for the fate of soil organic carbon in temperate ecosystems subjected to sustained warming. Accordingly, soil biology needs to be properly incorporated in C models to make better predictions of the fate of SOC under warmer scenarios. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a massive drilling machine <b>mounted</b> on a <b>framework</b> {{that is a little}} like a short section of railroad track. At one end of the track, nearest the audience, is a raised frame large enough to hold a person. At the beginning of the performance the drill is positioned {{at the far end of}} the track with its long helical drill bit pointing horizontally forwards. The performer is chained to the frame with her torso in line with the drilling axis. A cover, consisting of translucent paper stretched on a circular frame, is attached to the apparatus in front of the performer, obscuring the centre of her torso. The machine is then started: the drill bit rotates and the machine begins advancing slowly towards the performer. Then the device appears to go out of control and speed up (sometimes with pyrotechnics for added drama). The drill appears to penetrate through the struggling performer, whose legs, shoulders, arms and head remain in full view and whose lower torso is seen in silhouette through the translucent cover. The tip of the drill emerges and rips through the cover, at which point both the forward motion and rotation of the drill bit stop. The cover is removed to show the limp body of the performer seemingly impaled on the end of the drill. The machine then begins to tilt the drilling axis upwards, in the process pulling the performer from her restraints and raising her high into the air. When the drill's axis is vertical the bit begins to rotate again, spinning the performer's limply spreadeagled body around. The drill then stops and lowers the performer back onto the frame, where assistants cover her torso with a blanket and seemingly push the drill back out of her. The performer then appears to revive and steps from the apparatus to take a bow.|$|R
40|$|El Aissaoui Abdellah (2015). A {{feasibility}} study of direct injection spraying technology for Small Scale Farming: Modeling {{and design of}} a process control system. University of Liege-Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech. Belgium. 175 p., 11 tabl., 75 fig. The study aims to develop a process controller of direct injection spraying system (DIS) that can fit to carry out precise chemical application using variable rate application based on speed sensing {{in the context of}} small scale farming. It has the specific objectives of studying the feasibility of DIS by optimizing the hydraulic system and the process control designs as the main requirements for the best system reactivity and performance. The final design of DIS assessed to implement hydraulic system (hardware) and process controller (software) of a sprayer <b>framework</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rolling chariot propelled by walker operator. A logical approach is used of reviewing the state of art and formulating a specification book to develop a cost effective prototype to eventually adapt DIS expertise to the context of small scale farming. The demarche consists on giving low cost solution of variable rate technology to solve the technical problems related to usage and inefficiency of pesticide application mainly done by portable sprayers. The state of art gives a light on the development process of direct injection spraying technology (DIS) within the scope of precision agriculture progress. It also deals with technical options, advantages and problems related to DIS and control engineering solutions developed for improving spraying application efficiency and safety measures for human and environment. After that we have specified requirements of the researched DIS prototype by referring to existing art of DIS technologies and by diagnosing problems of chemical application in the context of small scale farming. It concerns specifically the technical requirements, setting values and performance of DIS process controller according to the working conditions of intensive cropping in small farming. The materials and methods consist on presenting the approach used for modeling the DIS prototype (splitting the problematic to the two main design aspects of hydraulic system and process control system) and evaluating it in laboratory conditions using simulated velocity data input. The data acquisition system is implemented for assessing the performance of DIS hydraulic and process controller performances. After that, the process controller is implemented in a cost effective electronic kit (box) to be mounted on a small sprayer framework propelled by worker. The hydraulic modeling of DIS served for optimizing the lag transport task as main problem of system reactivity performance and concentration process change. An algorithm is implemented in VB program to assess effect of hydraulic serial boom design (diameter and number of mounted nozzles in serial scheme) on flow dynamic to find compromise between lag transport, mixing ability (turbulence) and friction loss tasks that yield lateral and longitudinal uniformities application of standard boom layout. The modeling results showed lag transport and uniformity of respectively 2 s and 96 % for optimal conventional boom of 6 mm inner diameter having ten tip nozzles (ISO 11003, 1. 2 L/min~ 3 bars). To solve systematic problem of lateral miss uniformity of serial boom layout (standard scheme), improved parallel boom layout (equidistant tubing lines of 4 mm diameter) is adopted for obtaining an even lag transport between nozzles. The test of parallel boom layout showed even lag transport approximating 1. 5 s for ten mounted nozzles. The total response time of DIS is optimally improved to be within 2. 5 s by installing electrical pumps close to boom and injecting chemical in suction side to the carrier pump assumed to perform online mixing without use of static mixer. The PID feedback controller is modeled in MATLABTM software. The process is considered as a first order process having a time constant of 0. 2 s and a delay transport less than 2 s. Two control strategies of constant carrier flow control (CCFC) and total flow control (TFC) are modeled and implemented for test in laboratory conditions. Both strategies were tested and evaluated on the basis of different solicitations of variable speed input within the range of 0 - 2 m/s as a field working condition of walker operating a rolling sprayer chariot. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results of modeling and experimental assessment, an affordable kit of PLC process controller and PWM modules for actuating carrier pump and metering pump is performed in compact electronic box for potential usage on small sprayer framework to be propelled by walker operator in agricultural field. The controller is based on a PLC microcontroller implemented for carrying out a constant carrier flow rate and a variable chemical injection rate proportionally to the operating speed. The prototype is tested for applying variable rate application using simulated step solicitations within the range of the operator working conditions of 0 - 2 m/s. The study showed the feasibility of implementing a cost effective process controller design for applying variable rate chemical in small farming context. The controller is adaptable for sprayer mounted on wheeled chariot to be propelled by worker assumed to walk at variable velocity...|$|R
