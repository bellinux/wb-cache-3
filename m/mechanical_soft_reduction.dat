40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of <b>mechanical</b> <b>soft</b> <b>reduction</b> of steel billets with liquid core on the internal quality of billets, casting and soft reduction experiments were carried out. Moreover, the temperature, stress and strain fields in billets were calculated with the finite Element Software ABAQUS to determine the shell thickness, the solid fraction, the reduction efficiency {{and the reasons for}} crack formation during the soft reduction. The Finite Element Models were verified with the measured mould and billet surface temperatures. The results show that the centre segregation and shrink holes in the core area have been improved and the core density has increased by applying the soft reduction, especially with a solid fraction of ca. 0. 9. With a smaller solid fraction the internal cracks will be caused in the area near the zero ductility temperature. On the contrary, the reduction efficiency will be very small if the solid fraction is larger. In this case, the volume contraction in the core area due to the solidification will not be compensated any more...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the central quality of {{continuously}} cast tool steel slabs, the simple model has been developed to simulate the macrosegregation quality criteria. The model calculates different quality criteria such as average macro-segregation level criterion “ASL”, its fluctuation level “FSL” and its segregation quality number “SQN”. These criteria are calculated based on the previous measurements of carbon and sulfur concentrations distributions in final region of spray zones and centerline area of lower and upper slab sides. The effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>soft</b> <b>reduction</b> Technique “MSR ” on the slab centerline quality is examined and analyzed. The model results show that MSR affects the quality of centerline areas significantly by different ways based on the casting speed.

The model results show also that {{the accuracy of the}} macro-se-gregation quality criteria increases quantitatively with increasing the number of analyzed segre-gated elements. Therefore, the macrosegregation quality criteria and their distributions can be considered as the most simple and vital tool to evaluate the various slab qualities. Finally, th...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care referral center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventeen patients underwent 220 implantations. Sixty five cases underwent implantation {{by means of}} a skin punch resection without <b>soft</b> tissue <b>reduction</b> (punch group) and 155 cases underwent epidermal flap and <b>soft</b> tissue <b>reduction</b> (dermatome group). Main outcome measures were duration of surgery, perioperative adverse events, skin tolerance, and revision surgery. RESULTS: The duration of surgery was shorter in the punch group (p <  0. 001). The percentage of normal to moderate skin reactions, by Holgers classification, was higher in the punch group (90 %) than in the dermatome group (84 %). No severe reactions occurred in the punch group, but did occur in 7 % in the dermatome group. These differences, although clinically important, did not reach statistical significance (p =  0. 071). The rate of revision surgeries was not significantly different between the two groups. The indication for revision was different: mainly for skin issues in the dermatome group, against implant dislocation in the punch group. CONCLUSION: The implantation of the currently available percutaneous bone-anchored hearing implants with a minimal skin punch resection shortened duration of surgery and improved postoperative appearance, while preserving a good skin tolerance. In the punch group, there were less skin issues leading to revision surgery, however we did observe more implant dislocations needing revision surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Advanced tactile {{tools in}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery have become a pressing {{need in order to}} reduce time and improve accuracy in localizing potential tissue abnormalities. In this regard, one of the main challenges {{is to be able to}} estimate tissue parameters in real time. In palpation, tactile information felt at a given location is identified by the viscoelastic dynamics of the neighboring tissue. Due to this reason the tissue examination behavior and the distribution of viscoelastic parameters in tissue should be considered in conjunction. This paper investigates the salient features of palpation behavior on soft tissue determining the effectiveness of localizing hard nodules. Experimental studies involving human participants, and validation tests using finite element simulations and a tele-manipulator, were carried out. Two distinctive tissue examination strategies in force-velocity modulation for the given properties of target tissue were found. Experimental results suggest that force-velocity modulations during continuous path measurements are playing an important role in the process of <b>mechanical</b> <b>soft</b> tissue examination. These behavioral insights, validated by detailed numerical models and robotic experimentations shed light on future designs of optimal robotic palpation. I...|$|R

Especially, the influence of the heat flux to the solidification end point is needed to research thoroughly.

The simulation reveals that the steel droplet (the radium is 7. 2 mm) is solidified quickly in 4. 3 seconds on water cooling copper plate, and in 3 seconds there is half of the droplet is frozen to solid. If there are materials resisting heat transfer inserted between cooling plate and liquid steel, the solidification end position would be moved to the deeper place below the shell in obvious extent, and the influence of heat flux to the ratio of mushy zone is weaker than that to solidification end point position...|$|R

Owning to their <b>mechanical</b> compliance, <b>soft</b> dielectrics subject to voltages frequently undergo large deformation and mechanical instabilities.
