25|$|Icarus II docks with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, {{and former}} {{communications}} officer now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board Icarus II. They discover Icarus Is mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of Icarus I is found charred {{to death in}} the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the un-shielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus Is outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew <b>member</b> <b>stay</b> behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind. Capa is sealed in the only space suit, while Harvey and Mace wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material. Searle releases the airlock and the three crew members rocket into space. Harvey misses the airlock and freezes to death, while Capa and Mace make it back to Icarus II. Searle, having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun, voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the observation room.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identified}} and examined saving behaviour and determinants of saving mobilization by the rural co-operators in Southern Tigrai Ethiopia. The input {{for the study}} was obtained from randomly selected 120 rural household savers from six purposively selected rural savings and credit cooperatives. The result of the study using least squares method showed that savings mobilized is determined by household annual income, amount of loan borrowed and year of <b>member</b> <b>stay</b> in the cooperative. These factors therefore {{have to be considered}} in designing strategies aimed at improving the saving mobilization of cooperative members in the study area. Besides, economically feasible cooperative societies in the region should be encouraged among the rural households by supporting them with revolving funds as they are more effective and efficient in mobilizing rural savings and provide collateral plus guarantor-based loans with low default rate. This will enable them to boost up their production output and increase their savings thereby stimulating the rural economy...|$|E
