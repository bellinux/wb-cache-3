50|$|Vernier, dial {{and digital}} {{calipers}} {{can be used}} with accessories that extend their usefulness. Examples are a base that extends their usefulness as a depth gauge and a jaw attachment that allows measuring the center distance between holes. Since the 1970s a clever modification of the <b>moveable</b> <b>jaw</b> on the back side of any caliper allows for step or depth measurements in addition to external caliper measurements, in similar fashion to a universal micrometer (e.g., Starrett Mul-T-Anvil or Mitutoyo Uni-Mike).|$|E
5000|$|Miter clamps are {{designed}} to hold miter joints together. The earliest miter clamps are a simple spring in a C-shape with sharpened points that are sprung onto the outside corner of the miter joint. The right angled plates are higher than the screws and the red holder. The screws go under the frame (work-piece) to be held, and the red bit clamps down on the lower-edge of the frame. Recent designs are more complicated; a rigid body holds one fixed and one <b>moveable</b> <b>jaw</b> activated by a cam. Examples of the newer clamps are Jim Chestnut's [...] "Clam Clamp" [...] and the Maestro Miter Clamp.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{masks are}} part of a very old and highly {{sophisticated}} and stylized theatrical tradition. Although the roots are in prehistoric myths and cults, they have developed into refined art forms. The oldest masks are the gigaku. The form no longer exists, and was probably a type of dance presentation. The bugaku developed from this – a complex dance-drama that used masks with <b>moveable</b> <b>jaws.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{vibratory}} {{jaw crusher}} with double cavities {{was designed for}} reducing energy consumption by more crushing and less grinding. The dynamic model is established based on its structural characteristics, and the standard state equations are built by using Lagrange method. Based on MATLAB, the trajectory diagrams of the <b>moveable</b> <b>jaws</b> in the two cavities are obtained by Range-Kutta method. The influence of dynamic characteristics on yield and grain size is gained,and the optimization design idea for the crusher is put forward...|$|R
50|$|Seaweed's art was {{considered}} illegal {{because of its}} ceremonial nature to coincide with potlatch ceremonies. Seaweed's masks acted as visual aids to tell a narrative, some containing <b>moveable</b> <b>jaws</b> or hidden wooden hair tendrils that allowed the masks to transform throughout the performance. The Kwakwaka'wakw's winter Hamatsa ceremony was especially elaborate, {{and the majority of}} native artwork, including Seaweed's, was meant to be displayed as an active part of the particular ceremony. Seaweed's personal effort to continue making artwork during the potlatch ban was a major factor in preserving traditional Kwakwaka’wakw culture.|$|R
40|$|Gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase (Pol) II {{requires the}} coactivator complex Mediator. Mediator connects transcriptional regulators and Pol II, and {{is linked to}} human disease 1 – 4. Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a molecular mass of 1. 4 megadaltons and comprises 25 subunits that form the head, middle, tail and kinase modules 5 – 7. The head module constitutes one-half of the essential Mediator core 8, and comprises the conserved 9 subunits Med 6, Med 8, Med 11, Med 17, Med 18, Med 20 and Med 22. Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae head module at 4. 3 A˚ resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, fixed jaw and <b>moveable</b> <b>jaw</b> 10. Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3. 4 A˚ resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med 6 and the fixed jaw, and previous structures of the <b>moveable</b> <b>jaw</b> 11 {{and part of the}} neck 12, and required deletion of Med 20. The S. pombe head module resembles the head of a crocodile with eight distinct elements, of which at least four are mobile. The fixed jaw comprises tooth and nose domains, whereas the neck submodule contains a helical spine and one limb, with shoulder, arm and finger elements. The arm and the essential shoulder contact other parts of Mediator. The jaws and a central joint are implicated in interactions with Pol II and its carboxy-terminal domain, and the joint is required for transcription in vitro. The S. pombe head module structure leads to a revised model of the S. cerevisiae module, reveals a high conservation and flexibility, explains knownmutations, and provides the basis for unravelling a central mechanism of gene regulation...|$|E
50|$|Encheliophis homei is {{a slender}} fish that grows {{to a maximum}} length of 19 cm. The body is {{transparent}} and melanophores and silvery patches are found on the abdomen, which contains a large swim bladder. It has a free and <b>moveable</b> upper <b>jaw,</b> small conical teeth, large eyes, and 116 to 128 vertebrae. The elongated dorsal fin has 33 to 38 soft rays and the anal fin 53 to 61. A pair of pectoral fins but no pelvic fins are present.|$|R
40|$|For medical accelerators {{operating}} above about 10 MeV, {{there is}} an unavoidable production of photoneutrons which add to the head leakage. The yield of photoneutrons produced by electron beams incident on thick targets has been calculated (1, 2) and found to increase rapidly with primary electron energy up to approximately 25 MeV, and more slowly thereafter (Fig. 1). Dividing the neutron fluence for W (or Pb) by the photon absorbed dose (calculated by the Monte Carlo code EGS (3)) f or the same conditions gives us the ratio plotted in Fig. 2. This ratio, representing the maximum achievable with practical materials, becomes nearly constant above about 25 MeV incident electron energy where its value is about 2. 1 ~ lo 5 neutrons cmm 2 rad-I. Measurements that fall significantly below the curve of Fig. 2 are likely due to photon absorption in components that are not high-Z materials, or measurements made with the <b>moveable</b> <b>jaws</b> open. Points that fall significantly above probably mean there is substantial loss of electron beam elsewhere than the intended target. Neutron spectra in the giant resonance can be adequately described by a Maxwellian distribution which involves a single parameter, the nuclear temperature T (in MeV) for the particular nucleus. The spectrum peaks at &=T and has an average energy of En= 2 T. The neutrons are emitted almost isotropically and values of T generally lie in the range 0. 5 to 1. 0 MeV for high-Z materials...|$|R
