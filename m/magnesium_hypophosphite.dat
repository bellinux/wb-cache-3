40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether oral administration of sodium phosphate in conjunction with intravenous calcium is more efficaceous than intravenous calcium alone for the treatment of parturient paresis. Thirty cows with parturient paresis were examined and treated by the same veterinarian. The cows were divided randomly into two groups of 15 cows each. Cows in group A received 500 ml of a 40 per cent calcium borogluconate solution containing 15. 65 g calcium gluconate and borogluconate, with a supplement of 6 per cent <b>magnesium</b> <b>hypophosphite</b> (9. 85 g <b>magnesium</b> <b>hypophosphite)</b> intravenously over a period of approximately 15 min. Cows in group B received the same treatment as well as 350 g of monobasic sodium phosphate (70 g inorganic phosphate, NaH 2 PO 4 2 H 2 O, Streuli) dissolved in 0. 5 litres of distilled water orally via a stomach tube. After treatment, the heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, superficial body temperature, rumen motility, appetite and defecation of the cows were monitored every hour for eight h. The cows' attempts to rise and their ability to stand were also noted. Initially, the results of clinical examination and serum electrolyte analyses did not differ between the two groups of cows. Within one hour of treatment, stupor was not observed in any of the cows. The general demeanour after treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups. In both groups, the average rectal temperature increased within two hours of the initiation of treatment, from 38. 0 +/- 0. 95 degrees C to 38. 5 +/- 0. 40 degrees C. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate between the groups. Of the 30 cows, 22 (73. 3 per cent) stood within eight hours of treatment (10 cows from group A and 12 cows from group B). The type of treatment did not affect the time required to stand: cows in group A stood within 47. 3 +/- 44 minutes and cows in group B stood within 24. 2 +/- 32 minutes after the start of treatment. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that oral treatment with 350 g of sodium phosphate together with intravenous infusion of calcium in cows with parturient paresis results in an improved outcome, even though all the cows had hypophosphataemia as well as hypocalcaemia...|$|E
