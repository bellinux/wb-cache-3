50|$|Forty-three {{percent of}} the genes in the Genome Project were found to contain introns in 4,739 genes. Fission yeast does not have as many {{duplicated}} genes compared to budding yeast, only containing 5%, making fission yeast a great <b>model</b> <b>genome</b> to observe and gives researchers {{the ability to create}} more functional research approaches. S. pombes having a large number of introns gives opportunities for an increase of range of protein types produced from alternative splicing and genes that code for comparable genes in human.81% of the three centromeres in fission yeast have been sequenced. The lengths of the three centromeres were found to be 34, 65, and 110 kb. This is 300-100 times longer than the centromeres of budding yeast. An extremely high level of conservation (97%) is also seen over 1,780-bp region in the DGS regions of the centromere. This elongation of centromeres and its conservative sequences makes fission yeast a practical model system to use to observe cell division and in humans because of their likeness.|$|E

Tos 17 exists in two copies in the standard Nipponbare japonica genome (n = 12 and 379 Mb). Tos 17 copies are inactive in the plant grown under normal conditions. However, the copy located on chromosome 7 can be activated upon tissue culture. Plants regenerated from 3 - and 5 -month-old tissue cultures harbor, respectively, an average of 3. 5 and 8 newly transposed copies that are stably inserted at new positions in the genome. Due to its favorable features, Tos 17 has been extensively used for insertion mutagenesis of the <b>model</b> <b>genome</b> and 31, 403 sequence indexed inserts harbored by regenerants/T-DNA plants are available in the databases. The corresponding seed stocks can be ordered from the laboratories which generated them.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which cultured strains {{represent}} the genetic diversity of a population of microorganisms is poorly understood. Because they do not require culturing, metagenomic approaches {{have the potential to}} reveal the genetic diversity of the microbes actually present in an environment. From coastal California seawater, a complex and diverse environment, the marine cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus were enriched by flow cytometry-based sorting and the population metagenome was analysed with 454 sequencing technology. The sequence data were compared with <b>model</b> Synechococcus <b>genomes,</b> including those of two coastal strains, one isolated from the same and one from a very similar environment. The natural population metagenome had high sequence identity to most genes from the coastal model strains but diverged greatly from these genomes in multiple regions of atypical trinucleotide content that encoded diverse functions. These results can be explained by extensive horizontal gene transfer presumably with large differences in horizontally transferred genetic material between different strains. Some assembled contigs showed the presence of novel open reading frames not found in the <b>model</b> <b>genomes,</b> but these could not yet be unambiguously assigned to a Synechococcus clade.

First, we developed a sim-plified, cost-effective method for constructing BAC libraries, particularly appropriate for plant species of rela-tively minor economic importance. Second, we used the library to investigate the abundance and local distribution of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in peach. Our results indicate that microsatellite loci are locally much more highly abundant than previously estimated, and BAC se-quencing results suggest that microsatellite repeats are not randomly distributed within gene-containing regions of the peach genome. This makes it relatively easy to identify SSRs in peach by hybridization to BAC clones, and even by random sequencing of BAC clones, not known a priori to contain SSRs...|$|E

The activated PKR catalyzed phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF 2 α). The NS 1 protein efficiently eliminated the PKR-activating activity of these RNAs by binding to them. Two mutant NS 1 proteins, each harboring a single amino acid substitution at different regions, exhibited temperature sensitivity in their RNA binding activity in the mutant virus-infected cell lysates as well as when they were prepared as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. The virus strains carrying these mutant NS 1 proteins exhibited temperature sensitivity in virus protein synthesis at the translational level, as reported previously, and could not repress the autophosphorylation of PKR developing during the virus growth, which is normally suppressed by a viral function(s). As a result, the level of eIF 2 α phosphorylation was elevated 2. 5 - to 3 -fold.
