40|$|The German {{health care}} system has entered an era of {{specialist}} centers and certification. Hospitals are required to introduce quality management with external monitoring, refining and improving their quality of treatment. These statutory requirements can only be met through specialization, centralization, and establishing centers and networks with internal and external interdisciplinary collaboration. The breast centers certified according to the criteria of the German Cancer Society (DKG) and German Society for <b>Mastology</b> (DGS) are pioneers here. Simultaneously, there are increasing demands for more cost-effective medical services despite limited resources – making economic analysis of health care provision necessary. Few economic studies of the centers and certification system have been conducted, however. General long-term quality data, particularly for results, are not yet available from certified breast centers. At present, a certified breast center is not itself a proven independent prognostic parameter for treatment results. However, the individual criteria required for breast center certification show a significant positive influence on clinical efficacy.

Verificou-se que o Ambulatório foi de extrema importância e que mostrou um aumento no diagnóstico precoce de quase cinco vezes. Porém, a ocorrência de estadiamentos avançados e alta porcentagem de axila comprometida mostraram que falta muito a ser investido nesta área. O Ambulatório está se tomando centro de referência para patologia mamária na região, desenvolvendo um importante trabalho social, visto que a população atendida é pobre e depende unicamente do Serviço gratuito oferecido pela Universidade.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} and present our initial {{results of a}} new marker (hemosiderin) for mammary sentinel lymph node identification in an experimental model. METHODS: Skins mapped like a lymphatic duct draining to the axilla in patients submitted to breast biopsy, in our <b>mastology</b> service, stimulated us to try it in an animal model (female dogs). Our theory was that some blood derivate (hemosiderin) was captured by macrophages and accessed the lymphatic ducts in direction to the axilla. Six female dogs of no defined race were studied. We injected 0, 2 ml of technetium on both superior mammary glands. After ten minutes, a 2, 5 ml solution of hemolized blood (hemosiderin) from the own animal was injected in the subareolar lymphatic plexus on the left superior mammary gland and 2, 5 ml of patent blue concomitantly and equally on the contralateral gland. Ten minutes after, incisions on both axilas were made to search, through the lymphatic mapping and a gamma probe, the sentinel lymph nodes. RESULTS: Seven brown sentinel lymph nodes were indentified and also radiomarked on the left axilla. Six blue sentinel lymph nodes were identified and also radiomarked on the right axilla. CONCLUSION: Preliminary studies of a potential new dye for sentinel lymph node identification are presented. It may be the change of the current use of the blue dyes and their severe side-effects on patients submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsies...|$|E

DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial carried out in the <b>Mastology</b> Sector, Department of Gynecology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo. METHODS: We studied 33 women with fibroadenomas. Ten were placed in group 1 and took an oral contraceptive consisting of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol together with placebo material in the same capsule, for four consecutive cycles with a seven-day interval between them. The other 23 patients constituted group 2 and took the oral contraceptive as above together with estriol in the same capsule, in the same way as done by the group 1 patients. We took ultrasound measurements of their tumors (in three dimensions) before and after the intake of medication. At the end of the study, all the patients had their tumors removed by surgery. RESULTS: We observed decreased fibroadenoma width among the users of oral contraceptives with placebo, and this decrease was statistically significant. In the other group, we did not observe any changes (in width, length or height).

Methods: this is a cross-sectional study of 220 breast cancer patients submitted to radical mastectomy or quadrantectomy with axilar emptying, from the <b>Mastology</b> Service of the Assis Chateaubriand Maternity School, Ceará, Brazil. We submitted the tumors to histological processing and determined the histological (HG), tubular (TG) and nuclear (NG) grades, and the mitotic index (MI) by the classification of Scarff-Bloom-Richadson, verified the presence of angiolymphatic invasion (AI) and measured the largest tumor diameter (TD). We then correlated these variables {{with the presence of}} axillary metastases. Results: the mean patients'age was 56. 81 years ± 13. 28. Tumor size ranged from 0. 13 to 22 cm, with an average of 2. 23 cm ± 2. 79. HG 3, TG 3 and NG 3 prevailed, respectively 107 (48. 6 %), 160 (72. 7 %) and 107 (48. 6 %). Mitotic indexes 1, 2 and 3 presented a homogeneous distribution, respectively 82 (37. 2 %), 68 (31 %) and 70 (31. 8 %). We observed no relation between the HG, TG and NG with the occurrence of axillary metastases (p= 0. 07, p= 0. 22 and p= 0. 21, respectively). Mitotic indices 2 and 3 were related with the occurrence of axillary metastases (p= 0. 03).

Results: the patients' profile {{indicated that they were}} mostly born and raised in Santa Maria (respectively 11. 1 %, n= 16, and 26. 3 %, n= 68). They were about 55. 6 years old (SD&# 177; 12. 3), white (90. 2 %, n= 213), had already given birth and breastfed their children, were nonsmokers, but also overweight (average BMI of 27 kg/m 2). On physical examination of the first medical consultation, these patients, as described in the records: had a palpable mass (81. 1 %, n= 184) measuring over three centimeters, located in the left breast, precisely in the upper outer quadrant (41. 4 %, n= 81). Mammography (39 %, n= 109) showed that this lump was classified as BIRADS &# 174; 5 (40 %, n= 81). On histopathological examination, the lump was diagnosed as an invasive ductal cancer (71. 1 %, n= 191). Surgery was generally a radical mastectomy (84. 7 %, n= 236) with axillary dissection (92. 5 %, n= 222). Conclusion: some of the epidemiological, clinical and mammographic features mentioned above resembled those found in the literature reviewed. However, these patients had advanced disease and underwent non conservative surgical procedures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prophylactic {{antibiotics}} (PAs) are {{beneficial to}} breast cancer patients undergoing surgery because they prevent surgical site infection (SSI), but limited information regarding their use has been published. This study aims to determine the use of PAs prior {{to breast cancer}} surgery amongst breast surgeons in Colombia. Methods An online survey was distributed amongst the breast surgeon members of the Colombian Association of <b>Mastology,</b> the only breast surgery society of Colombia. The scope of the questions included demographics, clinical practice characteristics, PA prescription characteristics, {{and the use of}} PAs in common breast surgical procedures. Results The survey was distributed amongst eighty-eight breast surgeons of whom forty-seven responded (response rate: 53. 4 %). Forty surgeons (85. 1 %) reported using PAs prior to surgery of which > 60 % used PAs during mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, and/or breast reconstruction. Surgeons reported they targeted the use of PAs in cases in which patients had any of the following SSI risk factors: diabetes mellitus, drains in situ, obesity, and neoadjuvant therapy. The distribution of the self-reported PA dosing regimens was as follows: single pre-operative fixed-dose (27. 7 %), single preoperative dose followed by a second dose if the surgery was prolonged (44. 7 %), single preoperative dose followed by one or more postoperative doses for > 24 hours (10. 6 %), and single preoperative weight-adjusted dose (2. 1 %). Conclusion Although this group of breast surgeons is {{aware of the importance of}} PAs in breast cancer surgery there is a discrepancy in how they use it, specifically with regards to prescription and timeliness of drug administration. Our findings call for targeted quality-improvement initiatives, such as standardized national guidelines, which can provide sufficient evidence for all stakeholders and therefore facilitate best practice medicine for breast cancer surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Breast centers (BRCs) in Austria are {{currently}} managed {{and will be}} managed {{in the future as}} interdisciplinary and largely virtual, well-structured entities. The goals of the initiative to set up these centers are convergence of care, enhancement of the quality of care delivered to women diagnosed with breast cancer, and a significant actual benefit for the affected women. Given the geographical and infrastructural circumstances and partly already existing diagnostic and therapeutic facilities, a collaborating center model seems to be the target-oriented solution to employ the already existing resources. Evaluation and optimization of outcome quality (i. e. overall survival rate, disease-free survival, breast conservation rate, etc.) necessitate the implementation of treatment pathways with data collection and recording in a central registry. The aim should be to create an independent ‘neutral’ certification commission (a standard setter) in order to adapt the requirements of BRCs to Austrian circumstances. An appointed certification agency reviews compliance with the specifications of the certification commission. The European Society of <b>Mastology</b> (EUSOMA) specifications, as laid down in the European Parliament, serve as guidelines. These specifications were compiled by the brain trust of the Austrian Federal Institute of Health (ÖBIG) in Chapter 3. 6. 11 ‘Breast Health Centers’ for implementation in the Austrian Health Care Structure Plan (ÖSG). BRCs in Austria should demonstrate a minimum caseload of 100 primary diagnoses per year. The collaborating partners – the affiliated centers – may, however, join a BRC with a demonstrated minimum caseload of 30 per year. In this model, the outcome quality should be achieved even with a smaller caseload with structure quality assurance. It is planned that, by the end of 2016, breast health centers will take over the comprehensive care of breast cancer patients nationwide. Center certification is viewed as quality enhancement since care is provided to all patients on a verifiable high quality level, subject to constant improvements...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: The {{malignant}} {{variety of}} the phyllodes tumor is rare. The occurrence of invasive lobular carcinoma within fibroadenoma is rare as well. DESIGN: Case report. CASE REPORT: A 58 -year-old black female patient was referred to the <b>Mastology</b> unit of the Department of Gynecology, Federal University of São Paulo / Escola Paulista de Medicina, in February 1990, presenting an ulcerated tumor in the right breast with fast growth over the preceding six months. She was a virgin, with meno-pause {{at the age of}} 45 years and had not undergone hormone replacement treatment. The physical examination showed, in her right breast, an ulcerated tumor of 20 x 30 cm which was not adher-ent to the muscle level, multilobular and with fibroelastic consistency. The axillary lymph nodes were not palpable. The left breast showed a 2 x 3 cm painless, movable nodule, with well-defined edges, and fibroelastic consistency. We performed left-breast mammography, which showed several nodules with well-defined edges, the largest being 2 x 3 cm and exhibiting rough calcification and grouped microcalcifications within it. The patient underwent a frozen biopsy that showed a malignant variant of the phyllodes tumor in the right breast and fibroadenoma in the left one. After that, we performed a total mastectomy in the right breast and an excision biopsy in the left one. Paraffin study confirmed the frozen biopsy result from the right breast, yet we observed that in the interior of the fibroadenoma that was removed on the left, there was a focal area of invasive lobular carcinoma measuring 0. 4 cm. The patient then underwent a modi-fied radical mastectomy with total axillary lymphadenectomy. None of the 21 dissected lymph nodes showed evidence of metastasis. In the follow-up, the patient evolved asymptomatically and with normal physical and laboratory examination results up to July 1997...|$|E

Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study with 39 women > 18 years who underwent surgical treatment for unilateral breast cancer and manipulation of the axillary lymph node chain through either ALND or SLNB, with subsequent comparison of the lymphatic flow of the arm by LS. The variables analyzed were the area reached by the lymphatic flow in the upper limb and the sites and number of lymph nodes identified in the ALND or SLNB groups visualized in the three phases of LS acquisition (immediate dynamic and static images, delayed scan images). For all analyses, the level of significance was set at 5 %. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} between the ALND and SLNB groups, with predominant visualization of lymphatic flow and/or lymph nodes in the arm and axilla (P= 0. 01) and extra-axillary lymph nodes (P< 0. 01) in the ALND group. There was no significant difference in the total number of lymph nodes identified between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in the distribution of lymph nodes in these groups. The cubital lymph node was more often visualized in the immediate dynamic images in the ALND group (P= 0. 004), while the axillary lymph nodes were more often identified in the delayed scan images of the SLNB group (P< 0. 01). The deltopectoral lymph node was only identified in the ALND group, but with no significant difference. Conclusion: The lymphatic flow from the axilla was redirected to alternative extra-axillary routes in the ALND group.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} screening and diagnostic mammography in a geographically defined population attending a regional <b>mastology</b> referral hospital of the State Public Service of São Paulo. Methods: A total of 7508 women, who received screening or diagnostic mammography examinations from 06 / 2004 to 06 / 2005, with follow-up until 06 / 2006, were included in this study. Data corresponding to age, the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), biopsy, surgery and the stage of breast cancer were collected. Five-year survival of patients with breast cancer was posteriorly calculated during this period. Results: This study included a total of 713 diagnostic and 6795 screening mammograms. {{the average age of}} the population was 51. 2 years, with a BI-RADS end result of 4 and 5 (abnormal) in 1. 9 % of the screening and 11. 4 % of the diagnostic mammograms, respectively. All BI-RADS category zero was complemented. of the 228 nonsurgical biopsies performed (71 CNB, 94 mammotomy and 63 FNAB), 63 (27. 6 %) biopsies were malignant findings. Among the 33 surgical biopsies, 10 (30. 3 %) biopsies were malignant findings, and of the 82 surgeries, 55 (67, 1 %) procedures showed malignant findings. Seventy-one (0. 9 %) breast cancers (25 / 6795 on screening exams and 46 / 713 on diagnostics) were diagnosed. A total of 28. 6 % small cancers (<= 10 mm) were observed, with 27 % of the cancers in stages zero and I. Approximately 47. 6 % of the cases showed nodal invasion, and 4. 5 % of cases were not staged. Overall detection rate of breast cancer was 8. 8 / 1000 (3. 2 / 1000 screening and 61. 7 / 1000 diagnostic). the overall 5 -year survival rate of patients with breast cancer in this population was 79. 1 %. Conclusion: Survival is a key index of the overall effectiveness of health services in the management of patients with cancer. Our results suggest that this approach is feasible and can potentially improve breast cancer outcomes for many women in São Paulo.

40|$|Abstract Background Across the globe, {{breast cancer}} {{is one of the}} leading causes of death among women and, currently, Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) with visual {{interpretation}} is the easiest and fastest biopsy technique for the diagnosis of this deadly disease. Unfortunately, the ability of this method to diagnose cancer correctly when the disease is present varies greatly, from 65 % to 98 %. This article introduces a method to assist in the diagnosis and second opinion of breast cancer from the analysis of descriptors extracted from smears of breast mass obtained by FNA, with the use of computational intelligence resources - in this case, fuzzy logic. Methods For data acquisition of FNA, the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Data (WDBC), from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository, available on the internet through the UCI domain was used. The knowledge acquisition process was carried out by the extraction and analysis of numerical data of the WDBC and by interviews and discussions with medical experts. The PDM-FNA-Fuzzy was developed in four steps: 1) Fuzzification Stage; 2) Rules Base; 3) Inference Stage; and 4) Defuzzification Stage. Performance cross-validation was used in the tests, with three databases with gold pattern clinical cases randomly extracted from the WDBC. The final validation was held by medical specialists in pathology, <b>mastology</b> and general practice, and with gold pattern clinical cases, i. e. with known and clinically confirmed diagnosis. Results The Fuzzy Method developed provides breast cancer pre-diagnosis with 98. 59 % sensitivity (correct pre-diagnosis of malignancies); and 85. 43 % specificity (correct pre-diagnosis of benign cases). Due to the high sensitivity presented, these results are considered satisfactory, both by the opinion of medical specialists in the aforementioned areas and by comparison with other studies involving breast cancer diagnosis using FNA. Conclusions This paper presents an intelligent method to assist in the diagnosis and second opinion of breast cancer, using a fuzzy method capable of processing and sorting data extracted from smears of breast mass obtained by FNA, with satisfactory levels of sensitivity and specificity. The main contribution of the proposed method is the reduction of the variation hit of malignant cases when compared to visual interpretation currently applied in the diagnosis by FNA. While the MPD-FNA-Fuzzy features stable sensitivity at 98. 59 %, visual interpretation diagnosis provides a sensitivity variation from 65 % to 98 % (this track showing sensitivity levels below those considered satisfactory by medical specialists). Note that this method will be used in an Intelligent Virtual Environment to assist the decision-making (IVEMI), which amplifies its contribution. </p...|$|E
