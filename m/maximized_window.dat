The new North Carolina Building Energy Conservation Code requires that new construction be 30 percent more efficient than the ASHRAE 90. 1 - 2007 standard.

This model {{was used to assess}} the effect of energy efficiency projects on the building’s overall energy use. Projects fell into four categories: heating ventilating and air conditioning, thermal performance, solar gain, and lighting. The results of the analysis found that the entirety of the new NC Building Energy Conservation Code could be met through four projects, each with no upfront costs: reducing the minimum percentage of outside air to 15 percent (from 17 - 21 percent), altering the time at which thermostats return to set points from 5 am to 7 am, reducing the lighting power density to 0. 9 watts per square foot (from 1. 8 watts per square foot), and <b>maximizing</b> the <b>window</b> area at 30 percent of total wall area. These projects will result in a building that uses 43 percent less energy use than the ASHRAE 90. 1 - 2007 standard, more than meeting the goals of the code.

30|$|Our {{approach}} {{is reminiscent of}} techniques already known in the literature as super-resolution or super-directivity, even though the application framework, the constraints, and the objectives pursued here are definitely different. In the literature, the mentioned techniques have been addressed with reference to different categories of problems. On the one hand, super-resolution algorithms have been studied extensively {{in the past in}} conjunction with ingenious extrapolation schemes to improve the discrimination capability of specific instrumentation, such as optical sensors or spectrum analyzers, in response to one- or two-dimensional band-limited signals observed in truncated intervals [4 – 9]. In these references the interest of researchers is mainly focused on the extrapolation schemes and the relevant performance limits, with no reference to their possible applications to beamforming issues. On the other hand, the potential super-directive properties of dense arrays are long since known, and super-directivity is defined mathematically as the solution to an optimization problem, namely, the search of the weighing <b>window</b> <b>maximizing</b> the array directivity for a fixed array response in the steering direction [12, Sect. 9.2. 1 and overview notes in Sect. 9.1]. Similar concepts are also found in the theory underlying the Capon beamformer and variants thereof [13, Chap. 6] and in the immense literature dealing with super-directivity issues (examples of recent papers are in [14], e.g., [15] and [16], or [17, 18], just to cite different contexts).|$|R
30|$|Respiratory gating {{typically}} bins {{the imaging}} acquisition or treatment delivery {{according to the}} direct or indirect measures of target motion amplitude[53, 54], or alternatively according to the phase of the their periodic cycle[55]. As an example, the Real-time Position Management SystemTM (RPM) (Varian Medical Systems Inc., Palo Alto, CA) uses the abdominal displacement of infrared reflective markers to respiratory-gate both CT and PET image acquisitions on General Electric scanners, as well as treatment delivery[56]. Despite measuring identical markers of the respiratory signal, RPM-gated CT is accomplished retrospectively on triggers at peak inspiration in the RPM trace following image acquisition[45], whereas RPM-gated PET is achieved prospectively on the same peak inspiration triggers to define the gating cycle during image acquisition[57, 58]. CT projections and PET coincidence events within the cycle are then sorted into bins according to a fixed percentage of the estimated breathing phase, typically 10 percent phases for CT and 20 percent phases for PET. While in principle one can choose an arbitrary gate during the breathing cycle for simulation imaging and treatment delivery, two techniques are used most frequently: end-of-exhale gating and peak-inhale gating. The end-of-exhale gating window features a longer dwell time during each breathing period and minimal residual tumor motion relative to other phases, whereas the peak-inhale gating <b>window</b> <b>maximizes</b> the lung volume to potentially increase separation between the tumor and neighboring critical structures.|$|R

The treatment effect sizes in ongoing and future trials {{are likely to}} be small, necessitating large sample sizes. We searched online trial registries for randomized controlled trials investigating an acute treatment for ICH. For the trials whose eligibility criteria could be assessed in a prospective, community-based ICH cohort study (2010 - 2011), we quantified the proportions of patients who were eligible and investigated influences on these proportions. We applied the eligibility criteria of 17 trials to 166 adults with ICH, of whom between 0. 6 % (95 % confidence interval, 0. 1 - 3. 3) to 40 % (95 % confidence interval, 33 - 48) were eligible for each trial. Fewer patients were eligible for trials restricted to patients randomized within 12 hours of ICH onset (versus trials with a longer time window; P= 0. 03) and trials restricting eligibility according to premorbid disability (versus trials without this restriction; P= 0. 046).

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{to optimize the}} tradeoff between diversity, multiplexing, and delay in MIMO systems to minimize end-to-end distortion. We first focus on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in MIMO systems, and develop analytical results to minimize distortion of a vector quantizer concatenated with a space-time MIMO channel code. In the high SNR regime we obtain a closed-form expression for the end-to-end distortion {{as a function of}} the optimal point on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff curve. For large but finite SNR we find this optimal point via convex optimization. We then consider MIMO systems using ARQ retransmission to provide additional diversity at the expense of delay. For sources without a delay constraint, distortion is minimized by <b>maximizing</b> the ARQ <b>window</b> size. This results in an ARQ-enhanced multiplexing-diversity tradeoff region, with distortion minimized over this region in the same manner as without ARQ. Under a source delay constraint the problem formulation changes to account for delay distortion associated with random message arrival and random ARQ completion times. We use a dynamic programming formulation to capture the channel diversity-multiplexing tradeoff at finite SNR as well as the random arrival and retransmission dynamics; we solve for the optimal multiplexing-diversity-delay tradeoff to minimize end-to-end distortion associated with the source encoder, channel, and ARQ retransmissions. Our results show that a delay-sensitive system should adapt its operating point on the diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff region to the system dynamics. We provide numerical results that demonstrate significant performance gains of this adaptive policy over a static allocation of diversity/multiplexing in the channel code and a static ARQ window size.

40|$|PURPOSE: Regional nodal {{metastasis}} after neoadjuvant chemoradiation of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) predicts survival. We {{aimed to}} clarify the lymph node (LN) distribution of AEG according to location of the tumor mass and invasion of neighboring areas for the selection of radiotherapy planning target volume (PTV) margins. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patterns of regional spread were analyzed in pathology reports of 326 patients patients with AEG who had undergone primary resection, with > or = 15 lymph nodes examined. Tumors were classified into AEG types based on endoscopy and pathology reports. Fisher's exact {{test was used to}} compare nodal disease and tumor characteristics. Pulmonary dose-volume histograms were tested in 8 patients. RESULTS: Nodes were positive in 81 % of T 2 to T 4 tumors. Type of AEG, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, and grading significantly influenced nodal distribution. We found that marked esophageal invasion of AEG II/III significantly correlated with paraesophageal nodal disease, and T 3 to T 4 AEG II/III had a significant rate of splenic hilum/artery nodes. Middle and lower paraesophageal nodes should be treated in T 2 to T 4 AEG I and AEG II with > or = 15 mm involvement above the Z-line, and T 3 to T 4 AEG II. The splenic hilum and artery nodes can be spared in T 2 AEG tumors, especially Type I tumors. The influence of paraesophageal nodal treatment on the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications can be estimated from dose-volume histograms. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate pretherapeutic staging predicts the risk of subclinical nodal disease and should be used to select the appropriate radiotherapeutic PTV. Careful selection of the PTV can be used to <b>maximize</b> the therapeutic <b>window</b> in multimodal therapy for AEG...|$|R
40|$|In {{glaucoma}} treatment, ocular {{devices such}} as drug-loaded contact lenses have recentlyemerged as preferred candidates over eyedrops. Timolol maleate (TM), a prevalent glaucoma drug, exhibits side effects when excess drug enters the systemic circulation. Unlike eyedrops and drug-soaked lenses, new designs should provide sustained release and minimize undesirable burst release. Current innovations have not addressed the important issue of drug elution from contact lens during wet storage and shipment. Here we present a nanodiamond (ND) -embedded contact lens capable of lysozyme-triggered release of TM for sustained therapy. We found that ND-nanogel containing lysozyme-cleavable polymers enabled the controlled and sustained release of TM {{in the presence of}} lysozyme. Nanodiamonds also improved the mechanical properties of the poly-HEMA lenses without compromising on water content, oxygenpermeability and optical clarity. In vitro cell viability assays on primary trabecular meshwork cells revealed that the released TM retained their antioxidant activity – an indicator of timolol efficacy. This successful lysozyme activation of our functionalized ND nanogel can be easily applied to other diseases and drugs where localized triggered release is desired. Conventional combinatorial treatment for multiple myeloma and other cancers uses an additive approach of maximum tolerated doses from single-drug experiments. These doses do not reflect true drug behavior in combinatorial therapy. A rapid and robust platform is necessary to optimize multiple parameters to find the best drug combination for improved efficacy and safety. Here, we present Response Surface Optimization (RSO) where we rapidly narrowed down our top three myeloma drug candidates (Bortezomib-Panobinostat-Dexamethasone) from a starting list of fourteen drugs in a short span of five months. The mechanism-independent RSO platform screens drugs based on <b>maximizing</b> the therapeutic <b>window</b> – increased healthy cell viability and decreased cancer cell viability. After the 1 st iteration experiment, a linear regressionexperimental process (equation) is generated using MATLAB to reconcile the empirical data. Undesirable candidates are removed before performing a 2 nd screening iteration. In the 3 rd iteration, the optimum drug concentrations of the best drug combinations are determined. Response surface maps for output based on multi-parameters are plotted and the optimum is determined. Interestingly, this three-drug combination was the focus of recent myeloma clinical trials for refractory and relapsed patients. While conventional drug screening approaches demand huge time and money investment, the RSO platform rapidly and accurately converges on prime solutions. The RSO is applicable to the clinic where inter-patient variability requires adaptive treatment interventions based on individual clinical outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Logistic {{regression}} (LR) classifiers {{have been}} used successfully in the single-trial analysis of EEG data, especially in tasks of perceptual decision-making 12, but heuristics govern the choices for classifier parameters, such as window size (δ). Furthermore, no rigorous definition exists as {{to the number of}} epochs (N) of either class that would allow sufficient classifier training before testing using leave-one-out cross-validation. Here, we attempt to address these issues by exploring this discrete parameter space {{with the aid of a}} genetic algorithm. In doing so, we draw preliminary conclusions on both subject-specific and subject-general trends of these classifiers. To establish a baseline for comparison, we utilize EEG data from a previous study using LR to classify neural response to a two-choice forced-decision face vs. car visual task 1. In this study, a window size (δ) of 60 ms was used to segment epochs for classification. Other studies using this technique also employ a comparable window size 23, even though δ has the potential to drastically affect classifier training and performance. Similarly, the number of epochs used to train the classifier can greatly affect its performance, a number too low causing an insufficient number of points through which a dividing hyperplane can be found. Recognizing the dependence of classifier performance on these discrete parameters, we use a genetic algorithm to explore the δ vs. N design space. In doing so, we track an objective function whose value depends on <b>maximizing</b> an epoch <b>window's</b> leave-one-out A_z (area under receiver-operating characteristic) value while decreasing its variability (determined from bootstrapping), which increases with a low number of epochs. Once converging to subject-specific values of δ* and N*, we then test the classifier solution for statistical significance using the false discovery rate across all windows 4, as there are approximately E/ 2 δ* multiple comparisons for an E milliseconds epoch with 50 % window overlap. First, minimizing our objective function with N held constant at its maximum, we find that δ* can be tuned in a subject-specific way and we find on average a 3. 7 ± 1. 1 % improvement in maximum A_z from that of the earlier study. Second, we vary δ (δ ∈ [5, 6, [...] ., 149, 150]ms) and N (N ∈ [10, 11, [...] ., N_max- 1, N_max]) simultaneously and converge using a genetic algorithm (6 -bit resolution, 36 -member population, 0. 7 crossover probability, 0. 7 /(population size) mutation probability, 5) to a subject-specific δ* and N*. In each subject but one we find that N* < N_max and that δ* is a subject-specific parameter that differs from the heuristics offered by previous work. Finally, on a group level, we find that the components of our objective function exhibit distinct variation with respect to δ and N, with an epoch's maximum A_z optimizing for low N and low δ, while its A_z variability minimizes for high N and maximizes for low N, nearly irrespective of δ...|$|R
