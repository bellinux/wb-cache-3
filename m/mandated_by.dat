Collaboration among the colleges is frequent, as <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> a number of interdisciplinary degree programs and research centers. Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its {{undergraduate and}} graduate offerings in less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E

Services were held in Hebrew and Yiddish, men and women sat separately, and men covered their heads, as <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E

5|$|As <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> the Olympic Charter, various {{elements}} frame {{the opening ceremony}} of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. <b>Mandated</b> <b>by</b> the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E

5|$|Congress created {{executive}} departments during Washington's {{first months}} in office in 1789, including the State Department on July 27, the Department of War in early August, and the Treasury Department on September 2. The President also received two additional officers without departments: the Attorney General and Postmaster General. Washington appointed Richmond lawyer Edmund Randolph as Attorney General and Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General. He also appointed fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson to be Secretary of State and Henry Knox as Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed Alexander Hamilton to head the Treasury Department. Washington's cabinet eventually developed into a consultation and advisory body, although this was not <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that have already been put into place. One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> the previous Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
