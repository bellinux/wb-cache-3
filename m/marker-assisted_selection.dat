Various difficulties that a user can encounter during the ontogeny of marker`s application have also been discussed. Marker mediated varietal fingerprinting and germplasm characterization appeared most common and most pervasive application with AFLP and SSR markers. Being cost effective, easy to handle and devoid of any radioisotope requirement, SSR markers are considered as the most suitable and reliable system for DNA fingerprinting. Capturing heterosis appeared most difficult with very little success due to lack of a facile marker system that could unconditionally identify the heterotic groups, population and progenies. <b>Marker-assisted</b> <b>selections</b> for qualitative traits appeared most successful after DNA fingerprinting while for quantitative characters, major disease resistance genes and genes controlling QTL for abiotic stress tolerance, the success is limited. It is anticipated that application of markers will remain restricted in these areas till the allele-specific markers are available and the cost of marker analysis is reduced significantly...|$|R

Here, we report the use of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach for a large-scale SNP discovery and genotyping of a mapping population. Reduced representation libraries of 108 F 2 progeny were sequenced and a total of 524 million reads were obtained. We detected 21, 471 single nucleotide substitutions, most of which (62. 6 %) represented transition events. Of 3417 fully informative SNP markers, we were able to place 1085 on a linkage map, which spanned 1429. 6 cM and had an average of one marker every 1. 26 cM. Three QTL affecting trunk height were detected on LG 10, 14 and 15, whereas a single QTL associated with fruit bunch weight was identified on LG 3.

40|$|A {{perennial}} ryegrass F 2 family, comprising 194 individuals {{was used to}} develop a linkage map of RFLPs, AFLPs, SSRs, and isozymes. Seven linkage groups were identified and aligned with the ILGI reference map and other maps investigating feed value and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the EC project NIMGRASS. Traits mapped in the family include water-soluble carbohydrate content (WSC), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), plant size, leaf extension rate and regrowth rate. QTL for morphological and growth traits that explained between 23 - 40 % of the phenotypic variation in the trait were found on all seven linkage groups. QTL for nutritive quality traits (total WSC, crude protein and NDF) were found on four linkage groups and explained around 20 - 25 % of trait variation. QTL for individual WSC components were found on six linkage groups. Leaf carbohydrate QTL did not coincide with tiller base carbohydrate QTL. Total WSC QTL usually coincided with high molecular weight fructan QTL, and NDF QTL coincided with QTL for WSC on LG 1 and 2. Initial work on <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selections</b> for WSC generally produced responses in the directions expected but differences were small.

The objectives are to improve KDML 105 and RD 6 to be resistant to blast and bacterial leaf blight diseases, brown plant hopper, drought, flood and salinity whereas eating quality has to be maintained as recipients. BIOTEC takes action on developing of populations and selecting by MAS whereas Thai Rice Department takes action on field selection for agronomic characteristics and evaluation {{of the performance of}} lines under different rainfed lowland environments in northeast and upper north also farmers evaluation for their preference. This poster shows progress of the project conducted by Thai Rice Department part.

Within 2 years (2005 - 2006), there were several populations have been selected and evaluated under field condition. It has been found that integration of conventional and MAS is an effective approach for rice breeding. The MAS is an effective approach in selecting of desirable traits for developing populations whereas conventional selection in the field is required for selecting of agronomic characteristics.

40|$|Cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} (CMS) is {{a cornerstone of}} hybrid production in many crops. In three-line hybrid systems, use of CMS, maintainer, and fertility restorer lines is necessary for production of hybrid seeds. Limited resources of CMS and low variation of CMS lines cause genetic vulnerability to pathogens. Therefore, diversifying the CMS sources is indispensible for a sustainable production system of hybrid seed. In this study, we attempted {{for the first time}} to transfer CMS into maintainer line Yosen B in restricted generations using the marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) method. The resultant F hybrid of IR 68897 A/Yosen B cross was backcrossed to Yosen B, and CMS plants in each backcross generation (from BCF to BCF) were selected based on phenotyping test and MABC. Molecular assessment of backcross progenies was conducted using a mitochondrial CMS-specific marker and 34 polymorphic nuclear simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers in early generations (from BCF to BCF) and was continued using 9 additional SSRs and 82 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers in BCF. A MABC strategy could successfully recover the recurrent parent genome (RPG) in BCF generation, and decreased heterozygosity of final CMS plants. Restorability test with known wild-abortive restorer lines (viz. IR 36 and IR 24) showed that combination of Yosen A × IR 24 could produce highly fertile F hybrid. Evaluation of some important agronomic traits of the final CMS line (BCF) at field condition showed that it was comparable to the original maintainer fertile counterpart. Phenotypic and <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selections</b> could considerably decrease the time needed for full recovery of RPG so that final CMS line could show a high similarity to original fertile counterpart...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the concept}} of {{conditional}} coancestry, given observed markers, an explicit expression of the accuracy of marker-based selection is derived in situations of linkage equilibrium between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL), for the general case of full-sib families nested within half-sib families. Such a selection scheme is rather inaccurate for moderate values of family sizes and QTL variance, and the accuracies predicted for linkage disequilibrium can never be reached. The result is used to predict the accuracy of <b>marker-assisted</b> combined <b>selection</b> (MACS) and is shown to agree with previous MACS results obtained by simulation of a best linear unbiased prediction animal model.

40|$|Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{requires}} 19 years per {{cycle of}} phenotypic selection. The use of molecular markers {{may reduce the}} generation interval and cost of oil palm breeding. Our objectives were to compare, by simulation, the response to phenotypic <b>selection,</b> <b>marker-assisted</b> recurrent <b>selection</b> (MARS), and genomewide selection with small population sizes in oil palm, and to assess the efficiency of each method in terms of years and cost per unit gain. Markers significantly associated with the trait were used to calculate marker scores in MARS, whereas all markers were used (without significance tests) to calculate marker scores in genomewide selection. Responses to phenotypic selection and to genomewide selection were consistently greater than the response to MARS. With population sizes of N = 50 or 70, responses to genomewide selection were 4 to 25 % larger than the corresponding responses to phenotypic selection, depending on the heritability and number of quantitative trait loci. Cost per unit gain was 26 to 57 % lower in genomewide selection than in phenotypic selection when markers cost $ 1. 50 per data point, and 35 to 65 % lower when markers cost US$ 0. 15 per data point. With population sizes of N = 50 or 70, time per unit gain was 11 to 23 years in genomewide selection and 14 to 25 years in phenotypic selection.

50|$|The {{sequence}} of the cacao genome identified 28,798 protein-coding genes, compared to the roughly 23,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome. About 20% of the cacao genome consists of transposable elements, a low proportion compared to other plant species. Many genes were identified as coding for flavonoids, aromatic terpenes, theobromine and many other metabolites involved in cocoa flavor and quality traits, among which a relatively high proportion code for polyphenols, which constitute up to 8% of cacao pods dry weight. The cacao genome appears close to the hypothetical hexaploid ancestor of all dicotyledonous plants, and it is proposed as an evolutionary mechanism by which the 21 chromosomes of the dicots' hypothetical hexaploid ancestor underwent major fusions leading to cacao's 10 chromosome pairs.The genome sequence will help accelerate research on cacao molecular biology and breeding for elite varieties through <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selection,</b> in particular for genetic resistance to fungal, oomycete and viral diseases responsible for huge yield losses each year.|$|E

30|$|The world-renowned Thai Hom Mali Rice {{has been}} the most {{important}} aromatic rice originating in Thailand. The aromatic variety was collected from Chachoengsao, a central province, and after pure-line selection, it was officially named as Khao Dawk Mali 105, (KDML 105). Because of its superb fragrance and cooking quality, KDML 105 has been a model variety for studying genes controlling grain quality and aroma. The aromatic gene was cloned in KDML 105, as an amino aldehyde dehydrogenase (AMADH) or better known as BADH 2 located on chromosome 8. Later on, all other aromatic rice genes were discovered as allelic to the AMADH. As a selection of local landrace variety found in rainfed areas, the Thai Jasmine rice showed adaptive advantages over improved irrigated rice in less fertile lowland rainfed conditions. Because KDML 105 was susceptible to most diseases and insect pests, <b>marker-assisted</b> backcross <b>selection</b> (MABC) was used for the genetic improvement since 2000. After nearly 17  years of MABC for integrating new traits into KDML 105, a new generation of KDML 105, designated HM 84, was developed which maintains the cooking quality and fragrance, and has gained advantages during flash flooding, disease, and insect outbreak.|$|R
30|$|While MAGIC populations offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for the extraction of new alleles, additional breeding approaches should be considered depending on breeding objectives. For introducing simple traits, marker assisted backcrossing (MABC) has been widely used to improve a single genotype by adding a favourable donor allele. In the case of complex traits, however, MABC becomes complicated as multiple donor alleles have to be introgressed to obtain the desired phenotype. <b>Marker-assisted</b> recurrent <b>selection</b> (MARS) is an improvement over MABC. Essentially, MARS involves marker-aided selection (MAS) of lines followed by inter-mating to derive recombined lines carrying multiple donor alleles of interest. Phenotypic recurrent selection with no MAS {{has been used as}} an alternate approach, although this could be a time-consuming process. For both MAGIC and MARS, careful selection of parental lines is important to capture multiple favourable traits. Unlike multi-allelic MARS, the selection of MAGIC parents is not guided by known QTLs but by their phenotypes. This increases the potential of capturing novel QTLs with small phenotypic variance and QTL combinations to enhance the improvement of complex traits. An insightful review of different backcrossing and breeding approaches is provided by Ribaut and Ragot (2007).|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{inaccurate}} estimates of variance {{and of the}} location of the quantitative trait locus on the genetic response to <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selection</b> was studied by simulation of an adult multiple ovulation and embryo transfer nucleus breeding scheme. Two genetic models were simulated for the quantitative trait locus: a total of 10 alleles or 2 distinct alleles per base parent. For both models, the locus explained either 5 or 10 % of phenotypic variance. A polygenic component was simulated, and the two genetic components were summed to 35 % heritability for a trait measured on females. Overestimation of variance of the quantitative trait locus had minimal effect on genetic gain for <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selection</b> over the short term, but decreased long-term response. The long-term loss was reduced when variance of the quantitative trait locus was reestimated after four generations of <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selection.</b> Selection for favorable alleles at a nonexistent quantitative trait locus resulted in first generation losses of 3 and 7 % for postulated quantitative trait loci, explaining 5 and 10 % of variance, respectively. The larger the degree of error in location, the larger was the genetic loss compared with the correct location scenario. For the largest simulated location error of 15 cM, genetic superiority of <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>selection</b> was reduced by 80 % in the first generation.

Our analyses suggest that the number of generations to fully inbred status can be substantially reduced with minimal impact on genetic diversity through combinations of parental backcrossing and marker-assisted inbreeding.
