50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of cities and states in the US passed policies to ensure safety of milk. The laws were a response to the food industry's deception at that time. There were types of alteration in milk products on the market, such as water-dilution or adding butter or cheaper substitutes. In addition, spoiled milk is danger to health: infant mortality rate was lower in cities that had monitored milk production and sale. The Association was established in 1911 based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there were 35 members. One of the members was from Canada, and one from Australia; the rest were from the US. According to the Association's constitution, an object is to develop “uniform and efficient inspection of dairy farms, <b>milk</b> <b>establishments,</b> milk and milk products” by “men who have a thorough knowledge of dairy work.” The object reflects the historical context when the Association was born.|$|E

It occurred to my mind at last that, with so many cows, {{it might be possible to}} procure some milk and introduce a little change into our diet. In the evening I broached the subject, proposing that on the following day we should capture a cow and tame her. Some of the men approved of the suggestion, remarking that they had never thought of it themselves; but the old negress, who, being the only representative of the fair sex present, was always listened to with all the deference due to her position, threw herself with immense zeal into the opposition. She affirmed that no cow had been <b>milked</b> at that <b>establishment</b> since its owner had paid it a visit with his young wife twelve years before. A milch-cow was then kept, and on the señora partaking of a large quantity of milk [...] "before breaking her fast," [...] it produced such an indigestion in her that they were obliged to give her powdered ostrich stomach, and finally to convey her, with great trouble, in an ox-cart to Paysandù, and thence by water to Montevideo. The owner ordered the cow to be released, and never, to her certain knowledge, had cow been milked since at La Virgen de los Desamparados.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how the {{centrality}} of successful gestation and lactation in early maternal identity becomes problematic when unexpected complications arise. It is widely accepted that lactation and subsequent breastfeeding is an automatic and ‘natural’ response to having a baby. Yet {{it is not uncommon}} for women to encounter difficulties producing sufficient breast milk or breastfeeding, particularly those who have premature babies. In considering a group of women who have premature babies and experience difficulties with lactation, this research examines how they are constructed as ‘failed’ because they cannot perform in ways that most mothers take for granted. For women who are not able to produce their own breast milk, breast milk banks (BMBs) have been established to provide pasteurized, donor breast <b>milk.</b> The <b>establishment</b> of contemporary BMBs is supported by current medical and scientific discourses which endorse the benefits of breast milk over formula, where it is said that premature babies benefit considerably. Due to the powerful meanings associated with mothering, breastfeeding and breast milk, the concept of sharing breast milk in a BMB destabilises what is considered ‘normal’. Women who rely on another woman’s breast milk to feed their babies experience the use of the BMB as a challenge to their maternal identity, and they have to strategically manage and negotiate this process. To explore how women navigate the experience of breast milk banking in an Australian context, this thesis draws on qualitative research, utilising the first person narratives of women who have been involved in a BMB either as donors and/or as recipients. Taking a post-structural and an inductive approach, this research uses semi-structured interviewing, observations and a detailed discourse analysis to interpret data. Based on these methodological foundations, this thesis applies and extends Foucault’s theorisation on the body and power, which is central to the operation of the BMB. To extend the work of Foucault, this thesis engages with feminist critiques of his work to argue that women participate in a network of power through a project of ‘body work’, which is both constraining and enabling. A key orientating device of this thesis is the concept of redemptive mothering. Redemptive mothering is a transformative process whereby women attempt to shift from being constructed as failed and inadequate, to successful mothers. This requires their active participation in a project of normalisation enacted in an attempt to correct their failed bodies. If they are unable to normalise their bodies they must manage the perceived risks associated with receiving donor breast milk in order to realign the uncertainties regarding the exchange of bodily fluids. In considering the ways women navigate the BMB, this research argues that redemptive mothering is a technology of the self, which becomes a way that women free themselves from the constraining aspects of power and responsibility associated with infant feeding practices.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{analyzing}} dairy value chain in Laelay Maychew and Adwa districts of Tigray Region. The main focus was to describe and characterize different value chain actors, functions and services providers along the dairy value chain, to quantify the economic contribution of dairy value chain to actors and to investigate factors of small holder farmer’s participation in dairy value chain. To accomplish these tasks formal and informal data collection tools for both primary and secondary data. A total of eighty smallholder dairy farmers from Laelay Maychew and eighty smallholder dairy farmers from Adwa district were selected at random and were interviewed using structured questionnaire. Milk and butter {{were the most important}} dairy products marketed in the areas. Dairy producers and retailers (café and restaurants) are found to be important milk market chain actors in the study area. From the milk value chain actors, 66. 5 % of retailers (café and restaurants) and 33. 5 % of milk producers added a value to the milk. In milk market, milk retailers enjoyed the highest net profit. The econometric estimation procedure was employed to identify factors that determine milk market participation decision and milk sale volume of the farm household in the area. The logistic regression results showed that educational level, cross breed type, access to credit and access to extension service are significantly affecting milk market participation decision. Similarly estimation results of second stage Heckman selection model showed that breed type and total milk product were significantly affecting volume of milk supply. The major constraints of dairy production and marketing in the studied areas were inadequate availability and supply of feed, low volume of milk, lack of training access, low house hold income/low purchasing power, unavailability of cooling facilities for milk storing, distance to market, low market demand of the product, low breed performance, access to transport, land access, access to water. Dairy product value chain in the study area seemed to be ineffective and underdeveloped. Thus, dairy development interventions should be aimed at addressing both dairy production technological gaps and marketing problems. The study further suggested strengthening of dairy cooperatives and <b>milk</b> processing industries <b>establishment,</b> improving access to services and consolidating the linkage among dairy value chain actors should receive due attention in order to improve dairy production and marketing.

40|$|One of {{the main}} trends {{emerging}} from the agroindustrialization process is the rise of 'grades and standards' (G&S) in food products. G&S were initially developed by the public sector to reduce transaction costs and ensure product quality and safety but have become a strategic instrument of competition in differentiated product markets (Reardon et al, 2001). Firms are using grades and standards to protect and develop brands in the international marketplace {{and in some cases}} to fill in for missing public standards. While producers in developed countries have the resources to meet these requirements, in developing countries these changes have tended to exclude small firms and farmers from participating in market growth, because of the implied investment requirements (Reardon et al, 2001). This is leading to already disadvantaged farmers in these countries being forced to produce basic subsistence food crops and become further excluded from the opportunity to join the global food industry. While past research has evaluated the effects and trends of G&S (Reardon, et al, 2001; Farina & Reardon, 2000; Reardon & Farina, 2002) the organizational structure to enable small farmers to meet these requirements has largely been overlooked. In this paper we use a theoretical contract enforcement framework to argue that private enforcement capital developed through the facilitation of an external aid agency can be an effective means for creating credible and sustainable relationships capable of meeting G&S. We draw upon theory from Cocks and Gow (2002), Oliver and Gow (2002) and Gow et al. (2000) to argue that in situations characterized by high discount rates and low reputation or trust levels (such as transition agriculture) that the use of a third party external enforcement agent can be used to provide the necessary linkage between the parties to facilitate transactions. Through the facilitation role of the external agency, private enforcement capital is developed between the firm and the farmers, opening the path for a sustainable mutually beneficial relationship. Empirical evidence is provided by the case of the United States Department of Agriculture Marketing Assistance Project (USDA MAP) in Armenia and its role in establishing farmer owned milk marketing cooperatives. By acting as an external facilitator in the initial establishment and ongoing development of milk supply cooperatives the USDA MAP has provided a solution to the dual market failure problems of reliable supply of the consistent quality of milk required by processors while enabling farmers access to markets and ensuring timely payment and therefore enabling farmers and firms to credibly contract for the collective marketing of their <b>milk.</b> Through the <b>establishment</b> of a unique and flexibly designed combination of leadership development, training in governance, financial management, dairy management, and quality improvement programs, the USDA MAP has assisted the groups in expanding the self enforcing range in such a manner that the cooperative should be capable of sustaining long term credible exchange relationships once the external agency withdraws. This is important as aid programs have often failed at ensuring sustainability once external management and financial support is removed. Data for this paper was collected through a series of semi-structured interview with USDA MAP staff, dairy processing firm managers, cooperative managers, and cooperative presidents during the fall of 2002, and over a two week period in March, 2003.

40|$|The {{series of}} {{experiments}} described in this thesis were designed to investigate the role of suckling or late weaning in the response of young lambs to nematode infection. All experiments were conducted outdoors with grazing animals and no supplementation but for suckled groups of lambs whose counterparts were weaned to ryegrass – white clover swards. The parasite of interest was mainly Teladorsagia circumcincta solely but with mixed infection of Trichostrongylus colubriformis in one instance. In Chapter 3 (first experiment), the hypothesis that milk per se may have a direct effect on nematode development, rather than an indirect effect through enhancement of host immunity by superior nutrient supply was tested. Sixty, twinborn lambs were used, allocated to one of eight groups formed by either dosing lambs from 42 days of age or not with the equivalent of 1000 or 250 L₃ T. circumcincta larvae d⁻¹ until five days before necropsy, while a twin was either weaned at 39 days of age, suckled as single or twin until necropsy on day 84. The possibility that weaning one of a twin set onto pasture {{in close proximity to}} the ewe would cause abnormal ewe and lamb behaviour was tested by replicating the work in twins maintained as twins but in which one twin received equivalent of 250 and the other 1000 L₃ T. circumcincta larvae d⁻¹. This showed no abnormal ewe nursing or lamb suckling behaviour as a result of weaning a twin in a set. Relatively low faecal egg counts (FEC) and a two to three fold lower worm burdens suggest suckling could reduce larval establishment. Inability to detect peripheral titres of immunoglobulins supports this conclusion. An intra worm-population regulation of T. circumcincta, indicated by a pattern of greater egg-laying by a numerically smaller but physiologically better developed nematode population in suckled lambs measured in eggs 'in utero' and worm length made interpretation of FEC difficult. Suckling significantly improved weight gain and carcass weights, but early weaning did not reduce resilience to infection. In Chapter 4 (second experiment), 40 pairs of twin lambs, average age of 39 days, were either infected with the equivalent of 1000 L₃ T. circumcincta larvae d⁻¹ or not, while one twin was weaned and the other allowed to continue suckling. Necropsy was carried out on groups of five and six lambs from each of the uninfected and infected treatments, respectively, at mean age of 84, 112, and on six lambs from each group at 140 days of age. This serial slaughter allowed further confirmation of the hypothesis in Chapter 3 but also investigated the long-term effect of suckling on resistance or resilience of lambs at the trial when immune responses were anticipated to be developing. An in vitro direct larval challenge (IVDC) study, to monitor larval establishment, was carried out on tissue explants from necropsied lambs. Suckled lambs consistently showed lower FEC (P < 0. 05) and worm burdens (P < 0. 05) at every phase of the trial. Within the infected groups, % in vitro larval rejection suggested earlier immune responses in the weaned lambs by day 84, which was not consistent with lower worm burdens in suckled lambs but appeared similar in the subsequent necropsies. Lambs continued to show better growth due to suckling while weaning did not reduce the resilience of lambs confirming observations in Chapter 3. The immunoglobulin profile suggested the commencement of immune responses in lambs from the period after the 84 th day necropsy, with significantly greater (P < 0. 01) IgA titre in the infected groups, and the suckled lambs {{towards the end of the}} trial on day 140. A vaccinating effect of early exposure to parasites was coincidentally revealed as a result of unintentional pasture larval contamination, seen in suckled non-infected lambs shedding fewer eggs and harbouring fewer worms during the later necropsies compared with their weaned non-infected counterparts. In Chapter 5 (third trial), 93 pairs of twin lambs, 47 pairs of which received a vaccinating mixed infection of T. circumcincta and T. colubriformis larvae (60 L₃ / kg W / d) at ratio 40 : 60, respectively during the period 36 – 103 days of age, were either weaned early on day 51 or later on day 108. All lambs were drenched on day 108 and groups received challenge infections from day 116, at same rate with the vaccinating infection, or not, which ceased five days before respective necropsies. Necropsies were carried out on selected lambs on days 108, 184 and 218. The direct effect of <b>milk</b> on larval <b>establishment</b> appeared to feature only in the T. circumcincta populations on slaughter day 108. The long-term benefit of late weaning for development of resistance was conditional on lambs receiving the vaccinating infection, and appeared to be more pronounced in the small intestine, reflected by a greater reduction of T. colubriformis populations in that organ than of T. circumcincta populations in the abomasum. A negative consequence of enhanced immune response was the suggestion of an increased metabolic cost in reduced performance of lambs. In conclusion, the work provides support to the hypotheses that: (a.) suckling may reduce the establishment of nematode larvae through the direct effect of milk, (b.) may enhance rapid development of host immunity to infection, and (c.) it further suggests that lack of larval experience during suckling may have long term negative implications for host resistance. Finally, it suggests that milk may play little role in the enhancement of host resilience to infection and, on the contrary, that additional metabolic cost may be associated with a more rapid development of immunity resulting from larval challenge while suckling...|$|R
