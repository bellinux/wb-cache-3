5|$|These are all sterile. In addition, several <b>man-made</b> hybrids {{have been}} made.|$|E
5|$|A few {{jumping spider}} species, {{including}} M. inclemens, {{have been able}} to establish themselves in <b>man-made</b> structures. Most often these spiders are found on outbuildings or structures such as fences, rather than in permanently inhabited houses.|$|E
5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or <b>man-made,</b> that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of <b>man-made</b> bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|Mallard {{have often}} been {{ubiquitous}} in their regions among the ponds, rivers, and streams of human parks, farms, and other <b>man-made</b> waterwayseven {{to the point of}} visiting water features in human courtyards.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people still}} walk between the 'inner' and 'outer' fences, {{due to a}} number of natural and <b>man-made</b> gaps in the outer fence and the natural hedges. Although the site is monitored, only some of the 'gaps' are resecured.|$|E
5|$|To {{help the}} {{existing}} colonies rebound, several private {{projects have been}} initiated {{in an attempt to}} limit the encroachment of overshadowing trees and bushes, the construction of new highways and neighborhoods, and other natural and <b>man-made</b> threats.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), <b>man-made</b> {{sources of}} {{thallium}} pollution include gaseous emission of cement factories, coal burning power plants, and metal sewers. The {{main source of}} elevated thallium concentrations in water is the leaching of thallium from ore processing operations.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} male {{may have}} a repertoire of more than 100phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of <b>man-made</b> items like telephones, and the song thrush will also repeat the calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.|$|E
5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with a single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near <b>man-made</b> structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these <b>man-made</b> structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|Completed {{in early}} 1942, Lake Winfield Scott is a <b>man-made</b> {{reservoir}} created {{as part of}} the Civilian Conservation Corps' efforts to establish recreational areas in north Georgia. It was the final CCC project in Georgia and one of the last in the nation, completed just after the United States' entry into World War II. It is located in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains near Blood Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Diamond Valley Lake is a <b>man-made</b> off-stream {{reservoir}} {{located near}} Hemet, California, United States. It {{is one of}} the largest reservoirs in Southern California and also one of the newest. With a capacity of , the lake nearly doubled the area’s surface water storage capacity and provides additional water supplies for drought, peak summer, and emergency needs.|$|E
5|$|Further {{refinements}} in the process, such {{as basic}} oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing {{the quality of the}} final product. Today, steel {{is one of the most}} common <b>man-made</b> materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations.|$|E
5|$|In his 1892 work La planète Mars et ses {{conditions}} d'habitabilité, Camille Flammarion {{wrote about}} how these channels resembled <b>man-made</b> canals, which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying Martian world. He advocated {{for the existence of}} such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more advanced than humans.|$|E
5|$|It was, at first, {{merely a}} folly. It {{was used as}} a summer-house, and seven {{counties}} could be seen, as now, {{from the top of the}} flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set amidst a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a <b>man-made</b> body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby at the behest of the Duke.|$|E
5|$|Miri Crocodile Farm cum Mini Zoo {{is located}} near the Baram Delta. It houses 1,000 estuarine {{crocodiles}} including Malayan gharial crocodiles. <b>Man-made</b> sanctuary pools are also constructed for the crocodiles. Other animals {{can also be found}} here such as cassowary, sun bears, python, monkeys and porcupines. Visitors are allowed to feed the animals with bananas available from the canteen.|$|E
5|$|Section 2.3(c): The AFL shall provide command, communications, logistical, medical, transportation, and {{humanitarian}} {{support to the}} civil authority {{in the event of}} a natural or <b>man-made</b> disaster, outbreak of disease, or epidemic. Such assistance shall be authorized by the President of Liberia.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{and water}} {{conservation}} projects markedly changed practices {{in the state and}} led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and <b>man-made</b> lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The North Saskatchewan River flows {{east from}} Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, {{into what is}} known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the <b>man-made</b> Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.|$|E
5|$|The South West {{boundary}} of the city overlaps with the Peak District National Park, the first national park in England (est. 1951). As a consequence, several communities actually reside within both entities. The Peak District is home to many notable, natural, features and also <b>man-made</b> features such as Chatsworth House, the setting for the BBC series Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable <b>man-made</b> structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a number of natural and <b>man-made</b> lakes, most of which are used for recreation. Examples include Štrkovec lake in Ružinov, Kuchajda in Nové Mesto, Zlaté Piesky and the Vajnory lakes in the north-east, and Rusovce lake in the south, which is popular with nudists.|$|E
5|$|The park {{contains}} two belvederes, the more prominent {{of which is}} the Kondiaronk Belvedere, a semicircular plaza with a chalet, overlooking Downtown Montreal. Other features of the park are Beaver Lake, a small <b>man-made</b> lake, a short ski slope, a sculpture garden, Smith House, an interpretive centre, and a well-known monument to Sir George-Étienne Cartier. The park hosts athletic, tourist and cultural activities.|$|E
5|$|The report {{ruled out}} any doomsday {{scenario}} at the LHC, {{noting that the}} physical conditions and collision events which exist in the LHC, RHIC and other experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any <b>man-made</b> collider.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in west {{southern}} Canada, and in the United States its distribution forms a crescent from the north mid-west through New England and south to Florida. M. inclemens {{has been able to}} establish itself in <b>man-made</b> structures such as outbuildings or fences.|$|E
5|$|These animals exploit more <b>man-made</b> environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are not {{designed}} to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>man-made</b> oil {{drilling}} {{islands in the}} harbor off Long Beach, California, are named Grissom, White and Chaffee. A fourth island is named for Theodore Freeman, an astronaut chosen from the USAF in 1963, killed in a 1964 T-38 jet crash at Ellington Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the <b>man-made</b> light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{tradition}} of innovation {{continued into the}} 19th century. Birmingham was the terminus for both of the world's first two long-distance railway lines: the 82 mile Grand Junction Railway of 1837 and the 112 mile London and Birmingham Railway of 1838. Birmingham schoolteacher Rowland Hill invented the postage stamp and created the first modern universal postal system in 1839. Alexander Parkes invented the first <b>man-made</b> plastic in the Jewellery Quarter in 1855.|$|E
5|$|Bristol has a {{long history}} of trade, {{originally}} exporting wool cloth and importing fish, wine, grain and dairy products; later imports were tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods. Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products. Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, <b>man-made</b> channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in <b>man-made</b> areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and <b>man-made.</b> Flooding struck {{in the eastern part}} of the state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E
5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner and site fidelity. Both species build a bulky nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in <b>man-made</b> locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and <b>man-made.</b> They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such <b>man-made</b> problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in <b>man-made</b> ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E
5|$|Göbekli Tepe is {{the site}} of the oldest known <b>man-made</b> {{religious}} structure, a temple dating to circa 10,000 BC, while Çatalhöyük is a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 5700 BC. It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and in July 2012 was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The settlement of Troy started in the Neolithic Age and continued into the Iron Age.|$|E
