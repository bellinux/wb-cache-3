25|$|Nemechek {{moved up}} to the Busch Series in 1990, running the No. 87 with {{sponsorship}} from <b>Master</b> <b>Machine</b> & Tool, posting two top-fives and finishing seventeenth in points, winning Rookie of the Year honors. He had sixteen top-ten finishes and finished sixth in points the following year. In 1992, Nemechek got full-time sponsorship from Texas Pete sauce, and got his first two career wins and defeated Bobby Labonte for the championship by three points. He did not win again in 1993, but he won three poles and finished fifth in points. That season, he made his Cup debut at New Hampshire International Speedway for his NEMCO team, starting 15th before finishing 36th after suffering rocker arm failure. After running two more races in the 87, he ran a pair of races for Morgan-McClure Motorsports, his best finish 23rd at Rockingham.|$|E
50|$|Another {{process on}} each machine called the Bridge is {{responsible}} for passing requests from one machine to another. This allows Tuxedo to spread load across the various machines within a domain and allows servers and services to be running on multiple machines. In addition the BBL and Bridge monitor each other and restart the other should one fail. In {{the advent of a}} failure of the <b>master</b> <b>machine,</b> another machine designated as a backup master can take over the function of <b>master</b> <b>machine.</b> Also, since machines within a single domain can be of different architectures (x86, IA32, SPARC, P-Series, etc.), the Bridge is also responsible for handling differences in things like endianness.|$|E
50|$|One way of {{increasing}} the number of tracks available for recording is to synchronise tape machines together. Since the early 1970s SMPTE timecode has been used to synchronise tape machines. Modern SMPTE timecode controlled recorders provide a mechanism so that the second machine will automatically position the tape correctly and start and stop simultaneously with the <b>master</b> <b>machine.</b> However, in 1967, SMPTE timecode was not available and other techniques had to be used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the Tuxedo system is the Bulletin Board (BB). This is a shared memory segment that {{contains}} the configuration and state of a Tuxedo domain. Servers, services, transactions, and clients are all registered in the BB providing a global view of their state across the machines within a domain. To coordinate updates to the BB a process called the Bulletin Board Liaison (BBL) runs on each machine to keep the local copy of the BB up-to-date. A <b>master</b> <b>machine</b> runs a process called the “Distinguished Bulletin Board Liaison” that coordinates the updates to the BB. This allows each machine to have a view of what servers, services, transactions, and clients are on each machine within the domain.|$|E
50|$|PROFS {{itself was}} descended from an {{in-house}} system developed by IBM Poughkeepsie laboratory. Poughkeepsie developed a primitive in-house solution for office automation {{over the period}} 1970-1972; OFS (Office System), which evolved into PROFS, was developed by Poughkeepsie laboratory {{as a replacement for}} that earlier system and first installed in October 1974. Compared to Poughkeepsie's original in-house system, the distinctive new features added by OFS were a centralised database virtual machine (data base manager or DBM) for shared permanent storage of documents, instead of storing all documents in user's personal virtual machines; and a centralised virtual machine (mailman <b>master</b> <b>machine</b> or distribution virtual machine) to manage mail transfer between individuals, instead of relying on direct communication between the personal virtual machines of individual users. By 1981, IBM's Poughkeepsie site had over 500 PROFS users.|$|E

5000|$|Shokri and Varshovi {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} Dynamic Marking and Mark-based Detection with [...] "Dynamic Deterministic Packet Marking," [...] (DDPM). In dynamic marking {{it is possible to}} find the attack agents in a large scale DDoS network. In the case of a DRDoS it enables the victim to trace the attack one step further back to the source, to find a <b>master</b> <b>machine</b> or the real attacker with only a few numbers of packets. The proposed marking procedure increases the possibility of DRDoS attack detection at the victim through mark-based detection. In the mark-based method, the detection engine takes into account the marks of the packets to identify varying sources of a single site involved in a DDoS attack. This significantly increases the probability of detection. In order to satisfy the end-to-end arguments approach, fate-sharing and also respect to the need for scalable and applicable schemes, only edge routers implement a simple marking procedure. The fairly negligible amount of delay and bandwidth overhead added to the edge routers make the DDPM implementable.|$|E
50|$|Zarrko {{was left}} amnesiac for a time, but his memory was {{eventually}} restored by Loki using the Well of Centuries {{at a time}} when Thor had been de-powered; Zarrko returned to the 20th Century with a giant mining robot that he had adapted for his purposes and coerced Thor, whose lesser strength had caused him to be defeated by the robot, into helping him conquer the government of the 23rd Century, saying he would not attack Thor's century if this happened. They returned to the future, and Thor caused chaos, until he and Zarrko got to the ruling World council. A robot octopus was released to attack the two, but Thor defeated it. Thor left a note to the Council advising them to let him take care of Zarrko himself. The location of the machine was learnt from the Council and the two got there. Thor said he would help Zarrko enter the area if he would be released from his bargain, to which Zarrko agreed. Thor overcame a defense device's gravitational power. However, despite gaining access to the <b>Master</b> <b>Machine</b> which controlled the entire planet after getting the location from the Council, Thor, now released from his debt, then defeated him by turning the Master Machine's defense system back on. Zarrko was imprisoned and arrested by the guards soon after. Zarrko later clashed with Kang when he tried to conquer Zarrko's 23rd century. Zarrko enlisted the aid of Spider-Man and Iron Man, as Kang had captured the other Avengers, to get inside Kang's base. Zarrko then sent three devices to the Present to de-evolve that era to pre-industrial times, except for an area containing an American missile base, from which he planned to steal nuclear weapons and rule the 23rd Century, but this was stopped by Spider-Man and the Human Torch. Spider-Man then returned to the 23rd Century with the Inhumans and defeated the two villains.|$|E

40|$|We propose communication-efficient {{distributed}} estimation and inference {{methods for}} the transelliptical graphical model, a semiparametric {{extension of the}} elliptical distribution in the high dimensional regime. In detail, the proposed method distributes the d-dimensional data of size N generated from a transelliptical graphical model into m worker machines, and estimates the latent precision matrix on each worker machine based on the data of size n=N/m. It then debiases the local estimators on the worker machines and send {{them back to the}} <b>master</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally, on the <b>master</b> <b>machine,</b> it aggregates the debiased local estimators by averaging and hard thresholding. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimator based on all the data, provided that the number of machines satisfies m ≲{N d/d,√(N/(s^ 2 d)) }, where s is the maximum number of nonzero entries in each column of the latent precision matrix. It is worth noting that our algorithm and theory can be directly applied to Gaussian graphical models, Gaussian copula graphical models and elliptical graphical models, since they are all special cases of transelliptical graphical models. Thorough experiments on synthetic data back up our theory. Comment: 42 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables. This work has been presented at the ENAR 2016 Spring Meeting on March 8, 201...|$|E
