5|$|Goliath is a clone {{after the}} Bolliger & Mabillard's Batman model. The {{original}} was introduced 1992 {{and became a}} huge success where multiple parks introduced the same model to their lineup. The Batman <b>model</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found all over the world. Goliath is different then the rest as the roller coaster mirrored from the other clones. Goliath {{is not the only}} Batman model in San Antonio as SeaWorld had introduced one first in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species <b>model</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> applied.|$|E

40|$|This article reports Monte Carlo {{results on}} the {{simulated}} maximum likelihood estimation of discrete dynamic panel models introduced by James Heckman (1981 a). The simulated maximum likelihood method is numerically stable even for long panels. Regression models and Polya and Renewal <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> better estimated than Markov models. With a moderate number of simulation draws, most of these complex <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> adequately estimated for panels with length up to 30. Polya and Renewal <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accurately estimated for panels up to 50 periods. Estimates of Markov <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sensitive to misspecified initial states but Polya, Renewal, and Habit Persistence models may not. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S. A...|$|R

Another typical use is integration of an AnyLogic model with TXT, MS Excel, or MS Access files and databases (MS SQL, My SQL, Oracle, etc.). Also, Anylogic models include their own databases based on HSQLDB.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to phenomenological <b>modelling,</b> {{nonlinear}} <b>modelling</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{utilized in}} processes and systems where {{the theory is}} deficient or {{there is a lack}} of fundamental understanding on the root causes of most crucial factors on system. Phenomenological modelling describes a system in terms of laws of nature. Nonlinear <b>modelling</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> utilized in situations where the phenomena are not well understood or expressed in mathematical terms. Thus nonlinear <b>modelling</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> an efficient way to model new and complex situations where relationships of different variables are not known.|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of architectural models in enterprise architecture {{is a problem}} for their integration. In this paper we distinguish three kinds of models from each other and their visualization, and we illustrate how the distinctions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used for <b>model</b> integration within the architectural approach. Symbolic models express properties of architectures of systems, semantic models interpret the symbols of semantic models, and subjective models are purposely abstracted conceptions of a domain. Building on results obtained in the ArchiMate project, we illustrate how symbolic <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> integrated using an architectural language, how integrated <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> updated using the distinction between symbolic models and their visualization, and how semantic <b>models</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> integrated using a new kind of enterprise analysis called semantic analysis.

25|$|The Stackelberg <b>model</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> solved to {{find the}} subgame perfect Nash {{equilibrium}} or equilibria (SPNE), i.e. the strategy profile that serves best each player, given the strategies of the other player and that entails every player playing in a Nash equilibrium in every subgame.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} used {{to model}} the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example Black–Scholes equation). Once expressed in this form, a finite difference <b>model</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit finite difference, implicit finite difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option pricing <b>model</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{shown to be a}} simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs– for example dividend yield, risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these– that are not tractable in closed form.|$|E
