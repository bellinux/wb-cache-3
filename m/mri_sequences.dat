5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E

While spoiled gradient-echo sequences refer to a steady state of the longitudinal magnetization only, SSFP gradient-echo sequences include transverse coherences (magnetizations) from overlapping multi-order spin echoes and stimulated echoes. This is usually accomplished by refocusing the phase-encoding gradient in each repetition interval {{in order to keep the}} phase integral (or gradient moment) constant.

MR imaging helps to consolidate the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle atrophy. Extracellular edema after traumatic events causing neural damage show an increased signal intensity on T2-weighted <b>MRI</b> <b>sequences</b> and normal intensity on T1-weighted sequences. Posterior humeral circunflex artery compression and reduced blood flow in stressful arm positions and or maneuvers can be diagnosed by a Doppler ultrasonography. The nerve should be detected adjacent to the vessel. In an elevated arm position the axillary neurovascular bundle {{can be seen at}} the posterior axillary fold just before it perforates the deltoideus, while the posterior course is well visible in the neutral position. For a detailed assessment of the artery, a MR angiography is required. The major task of an ultrasonographic examination is to rule out any space occupying mass.

40|$|We {{describe}} a noninvasive method of detecting and quantifying left atrial (LA) wall injury after pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF). Using a 3 -dimensional (3 D) delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (<b>MRI)</b> <b>sequence</b> and novel processing methods, LA wall scarring is visualized at high resolution after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Radiofrequency ablation to achieve PVAI is a promising approach to curing AF. Controlled lesion delivery and scar formation within the LA are indicators of procedural success, but the assessment of these factors is limited to invasive methods. Noninvasive evaluation of LA wall injury to assess permanent tissue injury {{may be an important}} step in improving procedural success.
