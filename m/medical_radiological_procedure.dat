30|$|As {{laid down}} in the revised European BSS Directive (21), Member States shall ensure that {{clinical}} audits are carried out in accordance with national procedures. Clinical audit {{is a relatively new}} concept in radiation protection. It seeks to improve the quality and outcome of patient care through structured review of <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> practices, <b>procedures</b> and results, whereby these are examined against agreed standards for good <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures,</b> with modification of practices, where appropriate, and the application of new standards if necessary.|$|R
30|$|Clinical audit in the {{document}} {{is defined as a}} ‘systematic examination or review of <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures.</b> It seeks to improve the quality and outcome of patient care through structured review whereby <b>radiological</b> practices, <b>procedures</b> and results are examined against agreed standards for good <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures.</b> Modifications of practices are implemented where indicated and new standards applied if necessary’. It emphasises that clinical audit is not research, quality system audit, accreditation or a regulatory activity, but a multi-professional activity that is both scheduled and systematic, carried out by auditors with knowledge of the procedures, combining internal assessment of performance with external review and identifying areas for future improvement. All those involved in audit should respect the confidentiality of patient data, staff discussions, audit reports and other performance data. Much emphasis is placed on the difference between clinical audit and other quality systems and regulatory inspections, there being clear differences in the purpose, focus, scope, methods and consequences {{of the results of the}} observations, their impact and use. Regulatory bodies should neither carry out clinical audits directly not exclusively set up the criteria for the audits.|$|R
40|$|Radionuclide {{content in}} the {{environmental}} objects (water, soil) and food has been studied in Ambrolauri, Oni and Lentekhi districts of Ratkha-Lechkhumi region, Georgia. Defined internal and total irradiation doses for the population and proposed preventive measures for its reduction were detected. Internal irradiation dose for the population due to K- 40 was identified as 2, 72 mSv/y, total irradiation dose – 3, 87 mSv/y. To reduce the total irradiation dose of a population {{it is necessary to}} prohibit the use of high activity water for drinking; provision of the population with new sources of low activity water; minimize and control of irradiation doses from artificial sources including means of regulation of <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures</b> and rational use of fertilizers with K- 40 content...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Elastofibroma dorsi is an {{uncommon}} benign tumor, typically {{located in the}} subscapularis region. Our goal is to describe the main features of elastofibroma dorsi to increase awareness of its existence and proper management. Material and Methods: We report {{a case of a}} 59 -year-old woman with bilateral Elastofibroma dorsi and made a brief review of the epidemiological, clinical and radiodiagnostic features of this entity. Results: Imaging features can confidently diagnose this lesion, especially MRI, in addition to physical examination, with no need for biopsy. Conclusions: This entity {{should be part of the}} differential diagnosis in patients with chest pain in order to avoid unnecessary <b>medical,</b> <b>radiological</b> or surgical <b>procedures</b> and provide proper management of such lesions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the clinical data and prognosis of the cases of hydatid disease during a 8 -year period who were followed up by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic. Methods: Demographic, clinical, laboratory data and prognosis of 41 patients with hydatid disease were evaluated between the period of 2000 to 2008 years retrospectively. Results: A total of 41 children were included in this study. There were 21 females (51 %) and 20 males (49 %). The patients were aged between 5 and 17 years {{with a mean of}} 11. 50 ± 3. 14 years. Most children presented with the complaint of cough (36 %), abdominal pain (29 %) and rash (17 %). Decreased breath sounds were observed in 46 % of patients, urticarial rash in 12 % of patients. The hydatid disease was located in the lung only in 37 %, in the liver only in 35 %, simultaneously in the lung and liver in 17 %, and the spleen only in 5 % of the all patients. A positive indirect hemagglutination assay result was obtained (titration ≥ 1 / 32) in 32 (78 %) patients and a negative result was obtained in 9 (22 %) patients initially. Albendazole was given as 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. The cure times were between 3 and 27 cycles with a mean of 7. 31 ± 5. 75. In all, 71 % of the patients were given medical treatment and underwent surgery, 12 % of patients were given <b>medical</b> and invasive <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures,</b> 10 % of patients were given medical treatment only and 7 % of patients were given <b>medical</b> treatment, invasive <b>radiological</b> <b>procedure</b> and underwent surgery. All of the patients were cured. Recurrence of hydatid disease was not seen during the follow up period. Conclusion: Planning of the optimal treatment regimen of hydatid disease according to clinical involvement and characteristics of the patients can increase the treatment success. The cure may take a long time, although the patient undergoes surgery and invasive drainage...|$|R
40|$|Successfully {{communicating}} {{the complex}} {{risks associated with}} radiation exposure is a difficult undertaking; communicating those risks within the high-risk context of space travel is uniquely challenging. Since the potential risks of space radiation exposure {{are not expected to}} be realized until much later in life, it is hard to draw comparisons between other spaceflight risks such as hypoxia and microgravity-induced bone loss. Additionally, unlike other spaceflight risks, there is currently no established mechanism to mitigate the risks of incurred radiation exposure such as carcinogenesis. Despite these challenges, it is the duty of the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at NASA's Johnson Space Center to provide astronauts with the appropriate information to effectively convey the risks associated with exposure to the space radiation environment. To this end, astronauts and their flight surgeons are provided with an annual radiation risk report documenting the astronaut's individual radiation exposures from space travel, <b>medical,</b> and internal <b>radiological</b> <b>procedures</b> throughout the astronaut's career. In an effort to improve this communication and education tool, this paper critically reviews the current report style and explores alternative report styles to define best methods to appropriately communicate risk to astronauts, flight surgeons, and management...|$|R
