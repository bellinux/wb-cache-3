40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are precursor compounds {{for the formation}} of summer smog. To protect health and the environment, a reduction of 80 % in the emission of these compounds is to be achieved Europe-wide by the year 2010, compared to 1990 levels. The EC Solvents Directive, which entered into force in March 1999, will presumably only effect reductions of about 14 % following its transposition into German law. The Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency) has therefore given thought to the idea of achieving higher reductions in VOC emissions by introducing not only plant-related regulations, but also limitations on the VOC content of specific products placed on the market. In the present study, an orientative analysis was carried out as to whether such a regulatory approach is compatible with existing legislation in Germany and the EU or what prerequisites need to be fulfilled to achieve such compatibility. The study explores the extent to which product-related regulations resulting in a reduction of VOC emissions already exist in Germany and, in addition, presents Austria's Solvents Ordinance, which pursues a product-related approach. Based on two practice-oriented fictitious case studies, it subsequently explores whether product-related regulations are permissible under German and Community law. The study concludes that such regulations are, in principle, permissible under German and Community law and hence may be employed in addition to plant-related regulations in the implementation of the EC Solvents Directive. Under Community law, however, such a product-related regulation is in need of justification, because pursuant to Article 28 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, it is, as a <b>measure</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect,</b> in principle just as impermissible as quantitative restrictions on trade between the Member States. The proposed regulatory approach is permissible nonetheless, because it serves the protection of the environment and hence an imperative requirement acknowledged in the rulings of the European Court of Justice, which justifies measures having equivalent effect. However, permissibility presupposes demonstrability of the effectiveness and proportionality of this regulatory approach in comparison with other measures. (orig.)

40|$|The subject {{developed}} in my thesis {{relates to the}} "Exclusions from prohibition of quantitative restrictions". The origin of these exclusions {{can be found in}} the internal market law and more precisely in the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which is based the internal market of the European Union. The free movement of goods is ensured by removing fiscal and non-fiscal barriers that hinder trade between Member States and which are prohibited between Member States. The fiscal barriers involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties, all charges <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> and other fiscal barriers such as internal taxations. The non fiscal barriers involve direct quantitative restrictions which are quotas and bans, as well as <b>measures</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> to quantitative restrictions (MEE). These non fiscal barriers are prohibited but they can be justified in some cases. Direct quantitative restrictions almost disappeared while <b>measures</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> to quantitative restrictions may exist in various forms and variations. <b>Measures</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> on imports are prohibited by the article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

Viewing market freedoms as fundamental constitutional rights on which individuals can rely in private relations is logical consequence of such interpretation.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of free movement is {{the elimination of}} obstacles to trade between Member States and thus by such, create free movement within the entire union. Therefore art 34 in the Treaty of Lisabon (FEUF) states that all quantative restrictions on imports and measures of <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> are prohibited. The legal approach to <b>measures</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> is still unclear {{and the purpose of}} this paper is therefore to propose a solution to that particular problem. What can be said when it comes to this rule is that the EU-Court has gone from applying a discrimination test to a market access doctrine. According to the Court´s case law, <b>measures</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effects</b> to quantative restrictions are “All trading rules enacted by Member States which are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-community trade”.   The question of how to apply the test when it comes to a potential hinder to intra-community trade is still unclear. Connected to this is the remoteness test where hinders that are too indirect and uncertain cannot fall within the ambit of art 34 FEUF. The Courts case law has made it clear that a de minimis rule should not be applied so even small and unsubstantial hinders can fall within art 34 FEUF. The Court has also stated that a Member State that impedes a product from being imported to it´s territory when it has been lawfully produced and marketed in the member state of origin, constitutes a measure of <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> to quantative restrictions. This is referred to as the Cassis doctrine. In the case law after Cassis, there were a lot of contradicitions as to what constitutes measures of <b>equivalent</b> <b>effects.</b> That problem was solved by the Court in the Keck case where all measures relating to “certain” selling arrangements is not as such as to hinder trade between Member States. However, that is the case as long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and as long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those from other Member States (Keckcriterias). The problem today in connection to Cassis and Keck is that it can be hard to make a distinction between selling arrangements and rules connected to product requirements. After the development in Keck, the Court stated in the Trailers case that those measures relating to the use of goods which prohibits or impedes the use of them, constitutes measures of <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> and thus are prohibited because they impede the good´s access to the market. Post Keck case law confirmes that when it comes to Member States national measures, one must apply both the discrimination test and the market access test in order to find out whether the rules falls within the ambit of art 34 FEUF. How this test should be applied is still unclear today, which creates legal uncertainty. This is something for the Court to work on in the future.    Hiba Zeyd...|$|R
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all <b>measures</b> <b>having</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>effect</b> shall be prohibited between Member States'. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all [...] "trading rules" [...] that are [...] "enacted by Member States" [...] which could hinder trade [...] "directly or indirectly, actually or potentially" [...] would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This [...] "wide test", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former [...] "Buy Irish" [...] company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, [...] "protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants", [...] "national treasures" [...] of [...] "artistic, historic or archaeological value" [...] and [...] "industrial and commercial property." [...] In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association {{is one of the}} 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free {{movement of}} goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the <b>measures</b> it takes <b>have</b> to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.|$|R
