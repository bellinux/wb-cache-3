500|$|Well, let’s see… the {{guy with}} the poodle on his head would be me. The very {{pregnant}} woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for [...] "The Saga Begins"). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E

"After the bounden duty {{of my most}} humble {{submission}} unto your excellent majesty, whereas it hath pleased the same, of your mere {{mercy and}} infinite goodness, notwithstanding the heinous trespasses and most grievous offences of <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> yet so graciously to extend your benign pity towards my poor husband and me, as the extreme indigence and poverty wherewith my said father-in-law's most detestable offences hath oppressed us, is thereby right much holpen and relieved, like as I have of long time been right desirous presently as well to render most humble thanks, as also to desire continuance of the same your highness' most benign goodness. So, considering your grace's most high and weighty affairs at this present, fear of molesting or being troublesome unto your highness hath disuaded me as yet otherwise to sue unto your grace than alonely by these my most humble letters, until your grace's said affairs shall be partly overpast. Most humbly beseeching your majesty in the mean season mercifully to accept this my most obedient suit, and to extend your accustomed pity and gracious goodness towards my said poor husband and me, who never hath, nor, God willing, never shall offend your majesty, but continually pray for the prosperous estate of the same long time to remain and continue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{her last}} {{birthday}} we breakfasted with <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> Cantacuzene, and Madame Phoebus {{found in her}} napkin a check for five thousand pounds. I expended it immediately in jewels for her personal use; for I wished <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> {{to understand that there}} are other princely families in the world besides the Cantacuzenes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What," [...] cried my aunt; [...] "this is too much, sir, that I am {{thrust out}} of <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law's</b> house, and <b>my</b> place {{taken by a}} menial. That woman able!" [...] she fumed, {{dropping}} suddenly her cloak of dignity; [...] "Mr. Carvel's charity is all that keeps her here." ...|$|R

6000|$|Now {{nothing had}} been heard or seen of Hendrika since her expulsion, and though at first she and her threats had haunted me somewhat, by degrees she {{to a great extent}} had passed out of my mind, which was fully preoccupied with Stella and <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law's</b> illness. I started violently. [...] "How do you know this?" [...] I asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} have;--I have not chosen to see <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> ruined; what an outrage {{that has been}} to your feelings!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father-in-law</b> {{watched him}} {{disappear}} through the crowd, and stood patiently {{by my side}} while I exchanged greetings with a few newly arrived friends.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (as he enters). Come along: you {{can spare}} us {{quarter of an}} hour, at all events. This is <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> Mr. Burgess--Mr. Marchbanks.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned toward}} <b>my</b> {{prospective}} <b>father-in-law.</b> Mr. Bundercombe {{for the first}} time was looking a little annoyed.|$|R
60|$|Ant. I would, {{if he had}} {{not thought}} more of thy mother than of thee. Once more, come along in silence, <b>my</b> Pythagorean <b>father-in-law.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Richard agreed. [...] "You've {{done your}} best to head me off. So did <b>my</b> future <b>father-in-law.</b> Sort of hopeless task, I can assure you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In fact, if you weren't {{going to}} be <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> I doubt if I could bring myself to forgive you. As it is, I {{overlook}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! there's no {{talking of}} it; but if I {{had been a}} fashionable London physician, as <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> wanted to make me, I should have been dead long ago!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{can come}} with us as <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> Mynheer Marais. At any rate, {{it is certain that}} I will not go away and leave her here to starve." ...|$|E
6000|$|That day the Frank lord was {{entertaining}} a {{large number}} of guests, among them his daughter's husband, a jovial young man, given to jesting. On going to rest he fancied he should be thirsty at night and called Leo to set a pitcher of hydromel by his bedside. As the slave was setting it down, the Frank looked slyly from under his eyelids, and said in joke, 'Tell me, <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law's</b> trusty man, wilt not thou some night take one of those horses, and run away to thine own home?' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{movements}} of <b>my</b> prospective <b>father-in-law</b> were, {{for the next}} few days, wrapped in a certain mystery. He arrived home one evening, however, in a state of extreme indignation. As usual when anything had happened to upset him he came to look for me in the library.|$|R
6000|$|... "Furthermore," [...] I continued, {{feeling it}} {{my duty to}} speak frankly to <b>my</b> future <b>father-in-law,</b> [...] "a man of your {{position}} needs {{to be very careful}} when he has financial transactions with a good-looking young woman like Miss Blanche. The young lady herself might take advantage of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, halloa-halloa!" [...] he said, affably, [...] "We {{were just}} glancing through your spare scenery {{to see if}} we couldn't find {{something}} for my pal here. This is Mr. Brewster, <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> old man." ...|$|E
60|$|Odd the littleness of {{the things}} that exasperate when the fountains of life are embittered! <b>My</b> <b>father-in-law</b> was perpetually {{catching}} me in moody moments and urging me to take to gardening. He irritated me beyond measure.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{stood on}} one side. My hand {{was on the}} handle of the door. I looked at <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> questioningly. My sympathies were now almost with the enemy, but I felt bound to see the affair through.|$|E
3000|$|Last year, my {{mother-in-law}} broke her leg, after {{surgery in the}} hospital, she returned home to recuperate. <b>My</b> <b>father-in-law’s</b> health situation was not really good at that time, {{he was able to}} take care of himself, but it was difficult for him to look after my mother in law as well as to do the domestic work. I was on my winter holiday during that period. So I took responsibility for looking after {{my mother-in-law}}, including cooking lunch, doing laundry and other household work, supporting her with my hand when she was walking and helping her to bath. I spent 3 or 4 hours doing these things everyday. This situation lasted for around 3 weeks until I went back to my work. It is not easy to nurse a sick elder parent, but that’s the burden I have to undertake as a xiao daughter-in-law. (Administrator, 32) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Awfully good of you, old bean," [...] he said. [...] "I {{wonder if}} you'd mind telling <b>my</b> jolly old <b>father-in-law</b> that? It'll {{be a bit}} of news for him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{somebody}} {{would tell me}} whether it's that American fellow, Emerson, or young Freddie who's supposed to be engaged to Miss Peters. Hanged if you ever see her and Freddie together, but she and Emerson are never to be found apart. If <b>my</b> respected <b>father-in-law</b> had any sense I should have thought {{he would have had}} sense enough to stop that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a favour {{to ask of}} your Majesty, and I beg you {{to believe}} that it is in no way {{prompted}} by my husband. It is that you will allow us both to visit <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> King Schahzaman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you are {{thinking}} of going, Desailles, I {{will give you a}} letter to <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law,</b> at Poole. I hear that my mother and sister have escaped, and they have doubtless gone there, so you will not find yourself friendless.|$|E
60|$|I frowned. It {{seemed to}} me the affair had now gone much too far. Lord Porthoning had {{staggered}} to a chair and was sitting there with his face buried in his hands. He was a stricken man. I turned to <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "On that, sir, I have {{reserved}} my judgment; {{there may}} be much good, and there are certainly saving means in both; but every man must act according to his own lights. I hope I have done, and am {{in the course of}} doing, my Master's work in this Highland parish; and it would ill become me, for the sake of lucre, to leave my sheep in the wilderness. But, even in the temporal view which you have taken of the matter, Sir George, this hundred pounds a-year of stipend hath fed and clothed us, and left us nothing to wish for; <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law's</b> succession, and other circumstances, have added a small estate of about twice as much more, and how we are to dispose of it I do not know--So I leave it to you, sir, to think if I were wise, not having the wish or opportunity of spending three hundred a-year, to covet the possession of four times that sum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What should I do with Chowton Farm? I shall {{probably}} {{be in my}} grave before the slow lawyer would have executed the deeds." [...] And I in mine, thought he to himself, before the present owner has quite {{made up his mind}} to part with his land. [...] "What would a little place like that do for me? But in <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law's</b> time {{it was part of the}} Bragton property. He sold it to pay the debts of a younger son, forgetting, as I thought, what he owed to the estate;"--It had in truth been sold on behalf of the husband of this old woman who was now complaining. [...] "And if it can be recovered it is our duty to get it back again. A property like this should never be lessened. It is in that way that the country is given over to shopkeepers and speculators and is made to be like France or Italy. I quite think that Chowton Farm should be bought. And though I might die before it was done, I would find the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do hope Mr. Tudor {{will think}} of what he is doing,' {{continued}} Mrs. Val. 'It is certainly most good-natured and most disinterested of <b>my</b> dear <b>father-in-law,</b> Lord Gaberlunzie, to place his borough at Mr. Tudor's disposal. It is just like him, dear good old nobleman. But, my dear, {{it will be a}} thousand pities if Mr. Tudor should be led on by his lordship's kindness to bring about his own ruin.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sherwin {{stood at}} the garden-gate to watch my departure, and to make his {{farewell}} bow. Thick as was the atmosphere of illusion in which I now lived, I shuddered involuntarily as I returned his parting salute, and {{thought of him as}} <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|MORELL (brusquely). Oh, all right, all right. (Burgess {{goes out}} pathetically in the {{character}} of the weary old man. Morell stands at the table, turning over his papers, and adding, across to Proserpine, half humorously, half absently) Well, Miss Prossy, why have you been calling <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> names? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have {{a garden}} {{and plenty of}} pears," [...] said Tessa, [...] "and two cows, besides the mules; and I'm very fond of them. But <b>my</b> <b>father-in-law</b> is a cross man: I wish my mother had not married him. I think he is wicked; he is very ugly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Curtis Dall is most {{well known}} in recent times for his book <b>My</b> Exploited <b>Father-in-law,</b> in which he speaks of his ex-father-in-law, and his {{relationship}} with, as he saw them, the corrupt power of the banking elite of the time. In reference to the Great Depression of the 1930s he states: [...] "Actually it was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World Money-Powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of the supply of call money in the New York money market." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dall's short memoir adds {{little to}} the history of the New Deal and skips over his {{relationship}} with Anna. Eleanor Roosevelt's and Anna's correspondence reveals that they loathed Dall, who admitted to be on acerbic terms with Louis Howe and other FDR advisers. The title <b>My</b> Exploited <b>Father-in-law</b> refers to Dall's belief that sinister forces, represented in part by Howe, Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and Henry Morgenthau, manipulated FDR {{in the service of the}} [...] "Godless Dictatorship" [...] of the [...] "One-Money-One-World-Super State".|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say, laddie, I don't want {{to spoil}} your day and {{disappoint}} you and so forth, but <b>my</b> jolly old <b>father-in-law</b> {{would never let}} me keep a snake. Why, it's as much as I {{can do to make}} him let me stop on in the place." ...|$|R
