Method A community sample of 6050 mothers and their children (born between April 1991 and December 1992) were assessed. <b>Maternal</b> anxiety <b>and</b> depression <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> alcohol <b>and</b> tobacco consumption were assessed during pregnancy (18 and 32 weeks gestation). Postnatal risks, including maladaptive parenting (suboptimal parenting and parent conflict), family adversity, <b>maternal</b> anxiety <b>and</b> depression <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> alcohol <b>and</b> tobacco consumption, were assessed during early childhood. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed in late childhood. Trained psychologists interviewed children in late childhood to ascertain the presence of BPD (at least five probable/definite symptoms). Results In unadjusted analyses, all prenatal risk factors (i. e. <b>maternal</b> alcohol <b>and</b> tobacco consumption <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> anxiety <b>and</b> depression) were significantly associated with BPD.

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{estimating}} the genetic effects {{that affect the}} pre-weaning performance of animals from multibreed crosses. In order to do so, it was used information of the weight at weaning of 79, 521 animals, sired by 1, 020 bulls and 61, 898 cows from Aberdeen Angus and Nellore breeds and from many genetic groups resulted from their crosses. Five genetic models were tested: model 1, containing the fixed breed genetic effects (additive direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> effects, heterozygote direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> effects, epystatic direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> effects, joint additive direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> effects); model 2, equal to model 1, excluding direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> joint additive effects; model 3, equal to model 1, excluding direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> epystatic effects; model 4, equal to model 1, excluding direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> epystactic effect <b>and</b> direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> joint additive effects; and model 5, equal to model 1, excluding direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> heterozygotic effects, direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> epystatic effects <b>and</b> direct <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> joint additive effects. The models were analyzed by the following methods: least square means method, ridge regression method, and the restricted maximum likelihood method. The dominant additive models usually used for genetic evaluations do not give a good description of the pre-weaning performance variations, making it necessary to add the heterozygote and epystatic effects; the joint additive effects do not significantly improve the adjustment of the analysis model and the heterozygote effects are efficient in representing a quadratic breed additive effect, in addition to insert an unnecessary bias assigned to multicollinearity related to the joint additive effects...|$|R
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

This study examined whether early childhood cognition is associated with <b>maternal</b> educational level <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> ethnicity. Three age cohorts (children up to 1. 5 years, children from 1. 5 years up to 2. 5 years and children from 2. 5 years up to and including 3. 5 years) were distinguished in the sample to study the importance of <b>maternal</b> education <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> ethnicity for early childhood cognition in relation to developmental phase. The sample used in this study consisted of 823 Dutch participants.

Early childhood cognition was assessed using the Bayley-III-NL Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. A Three-Way Independent Factorial ANOVA revealed no significant differences in mean cognition scores for the groups based on <b>maternal</b> education <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> ethnicity, which indicates that in the Dutch society, <b>maternal</b> education <b>and</b> <b>maternal</b> ethnicity are not associated with early childhood cognition. The child’s age was found to be related to cognition, with better cognition scores for the second and third age cohorts. Several explanations for these findings were given.

5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 percent of {{the national}} budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs and its ability to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including <b>maternal</b> <b>and</b> child mortality, education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten poorest countries in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} advance our {{understanding}} of the etiol-ogy of individual differences in child maladjustment (i. e., conduct and emotional problems), we tested hypotheses about the statistical interactions between child temperament and two aspects of the family environment: <b>maternal</b> negativity <b>and</b> positivity, and household chaos (e. g., crowding, noise, lack of routines). Mothers (n= 149) reported on their child’s effortful control, negative affect, surgency, and behavioral/emotional problems. The age range of the children was 3 to 7 years old and half of the sample was girls. Observers rated <b>maternal</b> negativity <b>and</b> positivity based on brief structured interaction tasks in the laboratory. Child temperament moderated the association between <b>maternal</b> negativity/positivity <b>and</b> child maladjustment. <b>Maternal</b> negativity <b>and</b> child problem behav-ior were associated only for those children who also were high in surgency or negative affectivity. Maternal positivity was associated with less child problem behavior for those high in surgency. Child effortful control interacted with both <b>maternal</b> negativity <b>and</b> chaos. <b>Maternal</b> negativity <b>and</b> child problem behavior were most strongly associated for children who were low in effortful control and living in chaotic homes.

Participants were 39 mothers and their 11 to 15 month-old children. Mothers completed measures of trait affect and self-efficacy at home, then came to a research lab to complete state versions of these measures, and to participate in a free-play interaction in the lab, where responsiveness was assessed through observations of their interaction.

International commitments to eliminate preventable <b>maternal</b> mortality <b>and</b> reduce HIV-related deaths among pregnant and postpartum women by 50 % will not be achieved without {{a better understanding of the}} links between HIV <b>and</b> poor <b>maternal</b> health outcomes <b>and</b> improved health services for the care of women living with HIV (WLWH) during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. Methods:This article summarizes priorities for research and evaluation identified through consultation with 30 international researchers and policymakers with experience in <b>maternal</b> health <b>and</b> HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and a review of the published literature. Results:Priorities for improving the evidence about effective interventions to reduce <b>maternal</b> mortality <b>and</b> improve <b>maternal</b> health among WLWH include better quality data about causes of maternal death among WLWH, enhanced and harmonized program monitoring, and research and evaluation that contributes to improving: (1) clinical management of pregnant and postpartum WLWH, including assessment of the impact of expanded antiretroviral therapy on <b>maternal</b> mortality <b>and</b> morbidity, (2) integrated service delivery models, and (3) interventions to create an enabling social environment for women to begin and remain in care. Conclusions:As the global community evaluates progress and prepares for new <b>maternal</b> mortality <b>and</b> HIV targets, addressing the needs of WLWH must be a priority now and after 2015.
