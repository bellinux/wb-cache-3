5|$|The <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> globule is {{surrounded}} by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting mammary epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> globule, it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> globule is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E
5|$|The MFGM {{structure}} {{is complex and}} comprises a variety of phospholipids, glycolipids, proteins, and glycoproteins, along with cholesterol and other lipids. Specific lipids and proteins are localized to different layers of the membrane, with carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids directed toward the outer surface of the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> globule; the lipid-to-protein weight ratio in MFGM is approximately 1:1.|$|E

5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> on plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of whipping cream (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

40|$|Heritability, {{repeatability}} {{and genetic}} phenotypic correlations among <b>milk</b> yield, <b>fat</b> yield and fat percentage were estimated using an animal model and 19855 records of 10225 Holstein-Friesian cows {{enrolled in the}} Iran, Natural Resources Research center of W.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{estimate}} the genetic parameters and trends of <b>milk</b> yield, <b>fat</b> yield and fat percentage in Iranian Holstein population using animal model (multiple-traits) and Derivative-Free Restricted Maximum Likelihood (DFREML) procedure. First lactation data of 1128, 1093 and 1093 Mazandaran Holstein cows were collected from National Animal Breeding Center from 1988 to 2004 for <b>milk</b> yield, <b>fat</b> yield and fat percentage, respectively.

50|$|To {{replicate}} the mouthfeel of <b>milk</b> <b>fats,</b> nondairy creamers often contain hydrogenated vegetable-based fats, although nonfat nondairy creamers/whiteners also exist.

40|$|The {{potential}} of proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) {{as a tool}} for classification of <b>milk</b> <b>fats</b> was evaluated in relation to quality and authentication issues. Butters and butter oils were subjected to heat and off-flavouring treatments in order to create sensorially defective samples. The effect of the treatments was evaluated by means of PTR-MS analysis, sensory analysis and classical chemical analysis. Subsequently, partial least square-discriminant analysis models (PLS-DA) were fitted to predict the matrix (butter/butter oil) and the sensory grades of the samples from their PTR-MS data. Using a 10 -fold cross-validation scheme, 84 % of the samples were successfully classified into butter and butter oil classes. Regarding sensory quality, 89 % of the samples were correctly classified. As the <b>milk</b> <b>fats</b> were fairly successfully classified by the combination of PTR-MS and PLS-DA, this combination seems a promising approach with potential applications in quality control and control of regulations...|$|R
