30|$|This study {{investigates the}} causal impacts of {{integrating}} <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>technologies</b> into traditional public labor-market intermediation services on employment outcomes. By providing faster, cheaper and up-to-date information on job vacancies via SMS, <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>technologies</b> {{might affect the}} rate at which offers arrive as well as the probability of receiving a job offer. We implement a social experiment with multiple treatments that allows us to investigate both the role of information channels (digital versus non-digital) and information sets (restricted [public] versus unrestricted [public/private]). The results show positive and significant short-term effects on employment for public labor-market intermediation. While the impacts from traditional labor-market intermediation are not large enough to be statistically significant, the unrestricted digital treatment group shows statistically significant short-term employment effects. As for potential matching efficiency gains, the results suggest no statistically significant effects associated with either information channels or information sets.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} how {{the figure}} of the 'user' is deployed to imagine the assembling of location-based <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>technologies</b> in the context of UK policy. Drawing on the sociology of expectations, we address the performativity of the 'user' in the think tank Demos' publication Mobilisation. In the process, we analyze how discourses about users enact particular futures that feature arrangements of, for example, persons, <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>technologies,</b> and political institutions. We present two narrative strategies operating in Mobilisation: first, the purification of the social and technological in the portrayal of futures and their impediments; second, how existing, emergent, and future users serve as 'narrative joints', reconnecting the social and technological in the enactment of preferred policy trajectories. In conclusion, we explore Mobilisation as a `catalogue of expectations' in which the representation of a multiplicity of users is itself performative, enacting a particular future policy terrain while bracketing off others...|$|R
