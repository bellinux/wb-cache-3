5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E
5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E

Even before publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ER. Spielberg considered that what really fascinated him was that Jurassic Park was [...] "a really credible look at how dinosaurs <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie.|$|E

50|$|How Induguay came {{to possess}} the Mattel dies is uncertain; one story is that the DeConti {{brothers}} stole the dies from Mattel, but two other prevalent theories exist, both logical. One is that the models were carefully copied from blueprints (Frasinetti 2009; Frasinette No date). Another is that third party agents, {{with the approval of}} Mattel, sold some dies to the De Contis (Frasinetti 2009). In any event, perusal of catalogs of old and new models shows that few of the 37 models originally manufactured by Induguay were ever reissued by Mattel. Apparently, the Arciprete family has kept the tooling and doesn't deny that they <b>might</b> again <b>someday</b> make more Mukys (Frasinetti No date).|$|R
500|$|For a {{few years}} after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> become President of the United States. Peskin noted that, [...] "In {{mourning}} Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations." [...] As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield. Beginning in 1882, the year after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office began issuing postage stamps honoring the late President. Despite his short term as President, nine different issues were printed over the years. In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes. Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{science fiction}} differs from fantasy {{in that the}} former {{concerns}} things that <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> be possible or that at least embody the pretense of realism. [...] Supernaturalism, usually absent in science fiction, is the distinctive characteristic of fantasy literature. [...] A dictionary definition referring to fantasy literature is [...] "fiction characterized by highly fanciful or supernatural elements." [...] Examples of fantasy supernaturalism include magic (spells, harm to opponents), magical places (Narnia, Oz, Middle Earth, Hogwarts), supernatural creatures (witches, vampires, orcs, trolls), supernatural transportation (flying broomsticks, ruby slippers, windows between worlds), and shapeshifting (beast into man, man into wolf or bear, lion into sheep). Such things are basic themes in fantasy.|$|E

He speculated that there might be a detectable change in the level of some neurotransmitter or neurohormone when people pray. He might have been imagining substances such as dopamine that are released by the brain under certain conditions and produce rewarding sensations. Crick's suggestion that there <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> be a new science of [...] "biochemical theology" [...] seems to have been realized under an alternative name: there is now the new field of neurotheology. Crick's view of the relationship between science and religion continued to play a role in his work as he made the transition from molecular biology research into theoretical neuroscience.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the film, it is {{apparent}} that Trinity has been in love with Neo from afar for some time, although she continues to conceal her feelings for him. Near {{the end of the first}} film, after he is killed by Agent Smith inside the Matrix, she speaks to his interfaced physical body and reveals that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with The One, a prophesied individual capable of manipulating the Matrix to an unprecedented degree. She then kisses him, whereupon he miraculously returns to life both in the real world and within the Matrix. The resurrected Neo easily defeats the three Agents and returns to his body back on the ship. The first film ends with Neo returning to the Matrix to show people still unknowingly trapped there what they, too, <b>might</b> achieve <b>someday.</b> This marks the beginning of a romantic relationship between Neo and Trinity which proves decisive in the outcome of the series.|$|R
2500|$|The {{situation}} was obviously less than ideal. [...] The lines were {{a vital part}} of the West Berlin transit network, but because part of the route of some of the lines lay in East Berlin territory, it was difficult for Western support staff to perform maintenance work on the tracks and tunnels. If a train on a West Berlin line broke down in East Berlin territory, then passengers had to wait for Eastern border police to appear and escort them out. The East German government occasionally hinted that it <b>might</b> <b>someday</b> block access to the tunnels at the border and run its own service on the East Berlin sections of these lines. However, this awkward status quo persisted for the entire 28-year period of the division of Berlin.|$|E

40|$|By {{focusing}} petawatt {{peak power}} laser light to intensities up to 10 Wcm - 2, highly relativistic plasmas {{can now be}} studied. The force exerted by light pulses with this extreme intensity {{has been used to}} accelerate beams of electrons and protons to energies of a million volts in distances of only microns. This acceleration gradient is a thousand times greater than in radio-frequency-based accelerators. Such novel compact laser-based radiation sources have been demonstrated to have parameters that are useful for research in medicine, physics and engineering. They <b>might</b> also <b>someday</b> be used to ignite controlled thermonuclear fusion. Ultrashort pulse duration particles and x-rays that are produced can resolve chemical, biological or physical reactions on ultrafast (femtosecond) timescales and on atomic spatial scales.
