The effects of these materials on the hydration heat with respect to a control cement were studied. The first hours show that most of the additions, which present highet activity at early stages, increase the hydration heat of their <b>mixed</b> <b>cements</b> in relation to the control cement. The use of pozzolans reduces the heat given off by the cements during hydration.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} mixing on compressive strength, relative porosity {{and reliability of}} strength data of a brushite forming cement at different powder to liquid ratios (PLRs) was investigated. Mean compressive strengths were measured, associated reliability (Weibull moduli) and survival probability distributions of the data sets were analysed. Relative porosities were determined using helium pycnometry. For low PLR (2. 2 g/ml), {{no significant differences in}} compressive strength were observed for either mechanical or hand mixed samples, although reliability of the former was significantly increased. At high PLR (3. 4 g/ml), mechanically <b>mixed</b> <b>cements</b> exhibited approximately twice the mean compressive strength compared with hand mixing, although Weibull moduli remained statistically similar. At medium PLR (2. 8 g/ml) strength and reliability of cements were similar and independent of mixing regime. For all PLRs, a significant decrease in porosity of mechanical- compared with hand-mixed cements was observed. Mechanical mixing of a brushite cement can provide lower porosity, increased reliability and higher strength...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{feasibility}} of making calcium carbonate-calcium phosphate (CaCO 3 -CaP) <b>mixed</b> <b>cements,</b> comprising at least 40 % (w/w) CaCO 3 {{in the dry}} powder ingredients, has been demonstrated. Several original cement compositions were obtained by mixing metastable crystalline calcium carbonate phases with metastable amorphous or crystalline calcium phosphate powders in aqueous medium. The cements set within at most 1 hour at 37 °C in atmosphere saturated with water. The hardened cement is microporous and exhibits weak compressive strength. The setting reaction appeared to be essentially related {{to the formation of}} a highly carbonated nanocrystalline apatite phase by reaction of the mestastable CaP phase with part or almost all of the metastable CaCO 3 phase. The recrystallization of metastable CaP varieties led to a final cement consisting of a highly carbonated poorly crystalline apatite (PCA) analogous to bone mineral associated with various amounts of vaterite and/or aragonite. The presence of controlled amounts of CaCO 3 with a higher solubility than the apatite formed in the well-developed calcium phosphate cements might be of interest to increase resorption rates in biomedical cement and favor its replacement by bone tissue. Cytotoxicity testing revealed excellent cytocompatibility of CaCO 3 -CaP mixed cement compositions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} activation mode (immediate or delayed light activation vs. no light activation) on diametral tensile strength (DTS), elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and degree of conversion (DC) in dual-cured resin cements. Three resin cements were evaluated: Enforce, RelyX ARC, and Panavia F. The <b>mixed</b> <b>cements</b> were inserted into circular molds for the DTS test and into dumbbell-shaped molds for the UTS test. Inside the molds, the cements were light-activated either immediately or after 5 min (delayed light activation). If no light activation was performed, the materials were protected from light exposure (control). The DTS and UTS tests were performed until fracture. The elastic modulus was calculated {{using data from the}} DTS test, and DC was evaluated 24 h after manipulation using near-infrared spectroscopy. Data for each variable were individually analyzed by two-way ANOVA and the post-hoc Tukey test (?? = 0. 05). Regarding DTS, activation mode influenced only Panavia F specimens, which had the lowest DTS values in the absence of light activation. Activation mode did not influence the elastic modulus or UTS of any resin cement evaluated. Immediate light activation yielded higher DC values as compared with the absence of light activation.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we aim to}} {{evaluate}} {{the contribution of the}} co-grinding process in controlling calcium carbonate-dicalcium phosphate dihydrate cement properties. We set a method designed to evaluate phase separation, usually occurring during paste extrusion, which is quantitative, reliable, and discriminating and points out the determining role of cogrinding to limit filter-pressing. We show that solid phase co-grinding leads to synergistic positive effects on cement injectability, mechanical properties, and radio-opacity. It allows maintaining a low (< 0. 4 kg) and constant load during the extrusion of paste, and the paste’s composition remains constant and close to that of the initial paste. Analogous behavior was observed when adding a third component into the solid phase, especially SrCO 3 as a contrasting agent. Moreover, the cement’s mechanical properties can be enhanced by lowering the L/S ratio because of the lower plastic limit. Finally, unloaded or Sr-loaded cements show uniform and increased optical density because of the enhanced homogeneity of dry component distribution. Interestingly, this study reveals that cogrinding improves and controls essential cement properties and involves processing parameters that could be easily scaled up. This constitutes a decisive advantage for the development of calcium carbonate-calcium phosphate <b>mixed</b> <b>cements</b> and, more generally, of injectable multicomponent bone cements that meet a surgeon’s requirements...|$|E

Freshly <b>mixed</b> <b>cements</b> were placed into a strain-controlled rheometer (1 rad. s with an applied strain of 0. 01 %). From measurements of elastic modulus over time, the time taken to reach 90 % of the plateau elastic modulus (designated as the setting time) was determined for each cement. In increasing order, the setting times were as follows: Fuji VII EP 3. 3 min, Fuji VII 3. 6 min, Fuji IX 3. 7 min, ProRoot MTA 5. 1 min, Biodentine 15. 9 min, RealSeal 22. 2 min, AH Plus 5933 min, and AH 26 5067 min.

The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the radiopacity, pH variation and cytotoxicity of this material to ProRoot® MTA. Material and Methods <b>Mixed</b> <b>cements</b> were exposed to a digital x-ray along with an aluminum stepwedge for the radiopacity assay. pH values were verified after incubation period of 3, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours. The cytotoxicity of each cement was tested on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts using a multiparametric assay. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey&# 8217;spost hoc in GraphPad Prism. Results ProRoot® MTA had higher radiopacity than RetroMTA®(p 0. 05) although pH levels of both materials reduced over time. Both ProRoot® MTA and RetroMTA® allowed for significantly higher cell viability when compared with the positive control (p< 0. 001). No statistical difference was observed between ProRoot® MTA and RetroMTA® cytotoxicity level in all test parameters, except for the ProRoot® MTA 48 -hour extract media in the NR assay (p< 0. 05). Conclusion The current study provides new data about the physicochemical and biological properties of Retro® MTA concerning radiopacity, pH and cytotoxic effects on human periodontal ligaments cells. Based on our findings, RetroMTA® meets the radiopacity requirements standardized by ANSI/ADA number 572, and similar pH values and biocompatibility to ProRoot® MTA.
