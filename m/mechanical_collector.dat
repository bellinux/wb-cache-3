For this reason the <b>mechanical</b> <b>collector</b> design solution is very important.

40|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>collector</b> of {{conventional}} DC machine is the element that limits {{the current and}} the armature speed and increases inertia. DC machine rectification realized on the basis {{of conventional}} DC machine is described; it externally rectifies the switch which is the analogue of the collector. The armature has a design similar to a phase-wound rotor of induction machine. It is shown that the switching frequency is determined by the armature rotation speed. Static mechanical characteristic of the rectifying DC machine {{is similar to that of}} the independent excitation of DC motor. The proposed variant of the DC motor is actually a synchronous machine of inverse design with armature regulation frequency. The motor is described as traditional salient pole synchronous machine. Starting dynamics simulation shows that the rectifying DC machine has better dynamic properties compared to the conventional DC motor due to overload capability and reduces the inertia of the armatur...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} variables that are difficult to measure in a permanent magnet DC motor. These kinds of motors are still frequently used as car starters. The commutation of the current in a coil is done by classical means, via brushes and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>collector.</b> Measuring experimentally the contact electrical resistance at the rotary contact between a brush and a segment is a complex and expensive procedure. An advanced and inexpensive approach is adopted to estimate this quantity. An identification method combining characteristic measurement data and numerical analyses is used to determine the brush-segment contact resistance and to describe its behavior regarding rotational speed. A validation is done by an approximate formula of the contact resistance as a function of angular speed. And then an incorporation of this behavior is carried out in the numerical model, which shows a good concordance with the measurement...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{the use of}} {{biological}} air pollution control has become a popular treatment alternative for contaminated gas streams. The objective of this licentiate thesis {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of a compact rockwool biofilter to treat emissions from a restaurant, to identify an appropriate microbial population for the inoculation of the biofilter, and suitable environmental conditions for this culture. Rockwool mats with pre-set structures were shown to have a good structural stability, developed low pressure drop, did not compact, and seemed to be a appropriate habitat for microorganisms. Bacteria from different environments were enriched in batch cultures; it was found that all cultures were able to oxidize rape-seed oil. Nutrients, mainly phosphorus and nitrogen, must be added occasionally to the bacterial culture. Clogging due to high depositions of grease could be prevented by using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>collector</b> installed upstream of the biofilter. The off-gas from the fryer consisted of a complex mixture of partially oxidized hydrocarbons and the short residence times (< 10 s) provided in the filter were not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction of aldehydes or fatty acids.

30|$|Even {{though the}} Malaysian Standard of Performance Evaluation for <b>Mechanical</b> Dust <b>Collector</b> has been {{introduced}} since 2003, implementation of the application is not as encouraged as expected. Moreover, as reported by De Kock and Yap [7], the performance of dust collectors installed at palm oil mills are generally low in efficiency due to improper design and lack of quality control as well as poor maintenance. The efficiency of a typical multi-cyclone after a biomass boiler can be as low as 40 % only. This study simulates the dust emissions for dust collection system efficiencies of 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, 90 % and 95 %.|$|R
40|$|Long-range {{transport}} and residence time of elemental Hg (Hg°) in air promote global dispersion and deposition in remote ecosystems. Many biotic and abiotic {{factors contribute to}} the photoreduction and phytovolatilization of Hg from terrestrial ecosystems, and the assessment of deposition and volatilization fluxes is very challenging. Mosses and lichens are widespread in nature and constitute the dominant vegetation in alpine and polar ecosystems. This review surveys the results of Hg biomonitoring with cryptogams in areas with different Hg sources and deposition processes. Lichen and moss ecophysiology, and factors affecting Hg uptake and bioaccumulation are discussed. Although some laboratory experiments indicate a linear accumulation of Hg in cryptogams exposed to Hg°, without any significant release, in nature the Hg accumulated in cryptogams is in a dynamic equilibrium with Hg in air and decreases when organisms are transplanted to clean environments. Mercury concentrations in mosses and lichens have often been used to estimate concentrations and deposition fluxes of atmospheric Hg; however, Hg° exchanges between cryptogams and air, and the time necessary for mosses and lichens to equilibrate elemental composition with changing atmospheric chemistry, preclude reliable estimates. Biological processes of Hg uptake and exchange with air cannot be reproduced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>collectors,</b> and comparisons between Hg concentrations in biomonitors and those in atmospheric deposition are scarcely reliable. However, the Hg biomonitoring with mosses and lichens is easy and cheap and allows to locate “hot spots” of natural or anthropogenic emissions and to assess spatio-temporal changes in Hg deposition patterns. Climate change is affecting the global Hg cycle through the melting of sea-ice in coastal Polar Regions, and modifying Hg sequestration in mountain ecosystems. Despite limitations, large-scale monitoring of Hg with mosses and lichens {{may be used as}} a tool to evaluate the impact of global processes in remote ecosystems...|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of <b>mechanical</b> dust <b>collector</b> (MS 1723 : 2003) involves simultaneous isokinetic measurements at the inlet and outlet {{of the dust}} collector {{in order to determine}} the actual dust collection performance characteristic of the system installed. This performance characteristic as measured can be used for verifying the design specifications. After the performance characteristic has been determined, future measurements will show if any deterioration has taken place. These measurements should be part of the maintenance programme of the mill. This will assist not only in ensuring that the emission complies with the set of standards, but also in planning maintenance work on dust collector in advance. Evaluation results should be kept as records by state branches under the Department of Environment. Establishing a databank is not only for {{performance evaluation}} and monitoring purpose, but also for the identification of inefficient systems so that action can be taken to control the pollution. Setting a short-term or long-term reduction target can help to improve dust emission. For example, with reference to Table 6, by knowing the current status of the industry’s total emission of 155, 984 tonnes/year at overall efficiency of 60 % and considering the industry and its affordability in terms of profit, the most cost-effective solution available can be recommended and a target can be set at increasing the efficiency to 95 % to reduce the emission to 19, 498 tonnes/year.|$|R
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no <b>mechanical</b> <b>collectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|The TVA Kingston Fossil Power Plant {{has nine}} units and is located near Kingston, Tennessee. Units 1 through 4 have {{a rating of}} 148 MW and units 5 through 9 have a rating of 197 MW. Each unit has two induced draft fans {{manufactured}} by Westinghouse Electric Corp., Sturtevant Division. A table showing design data for the induced draft fans is located on page 16 of this report. The fan blade design details for units 5 through 9 are shown on pages 11 through 14. There is a <b>mechanical</b> fly ash <b>collector</b> and a small electrostatic precipitator preceding the induced draft fans in the boiler flue gas stream and a large, efficient electrostatic precipitator downstream of these fans. The steam generators and pulverizers were supplied by Combustion Engineering. The average temperature of the flue gas is about 340 degrees Fahrenheit for units 5 through 9. All induced draft fans in the boiler flue gas stream experience erosion from fly ash. When the precipitators and fly ash collectors were new the fan blades would last about three years before they were eroded severely {{and had to be}} replaced. Kingston Plant personnel say the fly ash collectors are presently in need of major repairs; therefore, the fan blades are not expected to last as long as they did when the plant was new...|$|R
