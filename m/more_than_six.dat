5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though he would never again score <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> goals in a season, this made him more an effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach. As a disinfectant in water, chlorine {{is more than}} three times as effective against Escherichia coli as bromine, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> times as effective as iodine.|$|E

Wild chum salmon can be {{consumed}} safely as often as once a week, pink salmon, Sockeye and Coho about twice a month and Chinook just under once a month." ...|$|R
5|$|Criminal {{cases with}} an assumed {{perpetrator}} {{are sent to}} the public prosecutor, who will consider issuing an indictment. If positive, the trial {{will take place at}} a district court, with a police prosecutor presiding over the case. Cases with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> years maximum penalty will normally be carried out with public prosecutors prosecuting. Either party can, on specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the court of appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Division II works {{similarly}} to Division I, with two six-team groups where group 'A' promotes one team to Division I and group 'B' exchanges its last placed team with Division III. Division III is now composed of {{one group of}} six, and if <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> nations register for this, the lowest level, then a qualification tournament will be held.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1958, Kelly {{recorded}} his second album as leader, the quartet Piano, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> {{years after his}} first. In the same year, he played for recordings led by, among others, vocalist Betty Carter, and made {{the first of several}} appearances on albums led by Cannonball Adderley, Blue Mitchell, and Hank Mobley. Kelly also played organ on one track of Pepper Adams and Jimmy Knepper's The Pepper-Knepper Quintet, an unusual departure from his usual instrument.|$|E

5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|In January 1969, {{after an}} absence of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months, Hendrix briefly moved back into his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham's Brook Street apartment, which was {{next door to the}} Handel House Museum in the West End of London. During this time, the Experience toured Scandinavia, Germany, and gave their final two {{performances}} in France. On February 18 and 24, they played sold-out concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall, which were the last European appearances of this lineup.|$|E

At one time there were <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> widebody aircraft painted with the special liveries.|$|E
500|$|Since the October reports, {{analysis}} of the satellite data has continued to be refined. In March2015, ATSB Chief Commissioner Mark Dolan remarked that he is [...] "slightly <b>more</b> optimistic <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months ago, because we have more confidence in the data".|$|R

5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> weeks.|$|E
5|$|Not {{all of the}} ship's mishaps were storm-related. In late April 1911, Kroonland hit the {{breakwater}} in Dover Harbour, disabling {{the steering}} gear and delaying the ship by a day. On 8 January 1913, Kroonland ran aground in Ambrose Channel during a heavy fog while outbound from New York. It took <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> hours for tugs to free the liner from the soft mud.|$|E

The demonstration followed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> months of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of the railroad tracks leading to the site. Large pro-nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year.|$|E

5|$|Overall, the Myst {{series has}} been commercially and {{critically}} successful. Rand and Robyn Miller were expecting Myst to {{perform as well}} as previous Cyan titles, making enough money to fund the next project. Instead, Myst sold <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> million units, becoming the top-selling PC game of all time until The Sims surpassed its sales in 2002. The first three games in the series have sold more than twelve million copies.|$|E

It built <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> thousand steam locomotives for railroads around the world. Most railroads in 19th-century United States rostered {{at least one}} Rogers-built locomotive. The company's most famous product was a locomotive named The General, built in December 1855, {{which was one of}} the principals of the Great Locomotive Chase of the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Herald-News {{praised the}} game for being {{original}} and worth playing, unlike other movie adaptations. In 2013, Game Informer listed Ghost in the Shell {{as one of the}} best anime and manga-based games released in English, and the best of the franchise's titles; the other seven games in the list were released <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> years after Ghost in the Shell.|$|E
2500|$|On January 9, 1892, Academic Hall, the institution's main building, {{burned in}} a fire that {{completely}} gutted the building, leaving little <b>more</b> standing <b>than</b> <b>six</b> stone Ionic columns. [...] Under the administration of Missouri Governor David R. Francis, the university was rebuilt, with additions that shaped the modern institution.|$|R

Units cleared {{more than one-half}} million acres (2,000km²) of jungle, paved 500 kilometers of highway, and constructed bridges totaling <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> miles (10km) in length.

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{language of the}} region is Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land. As it is a strong language with hundreds of speakers and {{a high rate of}} child acquisition, members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language to their children. As a result, many Wagiman people speak Mayali, while only a handful of elders, possibly no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six,</b> speak Wagiman.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} Levin J. Marvel {{during the}} {{hurricane}} prompted the United States Congress {{to pass a law}} in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>six</b> passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700tons, greatly higher than the 183tons that the Marvel weighed. A federal courthouse charged the inexperienced captain with negligence, giving him a one-year probation.|$|E
50|$|Voters had {{the choice}} of only one major {{political}} party in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one in <b>six</b> U.S. House elections nationwide, including <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one in four races in the Southern region.|$|R
60|$|Now at {{last the}} houses became more sparse. Only here and there {{up the side of}} the hill a tiny light glittered feebly.
