40|$|In this {{research}} a single span simply supported steel truss railway bridge is analyzed when subjected to train loads. The {{study was conducted}} by using three different methodologies namely modal analysis using three dimensional finite element models of a bridge based on As-built drawn from scratch; a time history analysis and field measurement on an existing bridge. The finite element models of the bridge were modeled using two methodologies; using beam and shell elements. A time history analysis involves developing an equation of motion for the forced and free vibration of the bridge when subjected to both a single- and successive train loads. The dynamic responses studied include the displacement, acceleration and natural frequency of the bridge which were compared for different train speeds, span length, and {{the mass of the}} bridge. Field measurement was conducted using accelerometers and displacement transducers which were mounted on a self-designed <b>mounting</b> <b>section.</b> Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Civil EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} in most manganese steel melting furnace {{is to raise}} the melting and pouring temperatures to 15000 C and above so as to enhance fluidity of the molten metal and ease removal of slag. High temperature promotes micro and macro carbide segregation of alloy elements and formation of embritting transformation products. The presence of segregation at the grain boundaries, acts as barrier to dislocation movement. This could be responsible for uneven, inconsistent wear rate and pattern of the steel. This paper studies the effect of pouring/melting temperature on the propensity of carbide segregation of austenitic manganese steel and by translation on the wear characteristics of jaw crushers. Austenitic manganese steel (AMS) was subjected to different heat/melt temperatures ranging from 1380 to 15500 C (H 1 -H 3) in an induction furnace of 1 -ton capacity. Samples obtained from the edge, middle and <b>mounting</b> <b>section</b> of the heat treated steel were examined by means of optical metallurgical microscope and the relative abundance of elements was determined by means of energy dispersed X-ray (EDX) elemental spectrometer. The results indicated high segregation of alloy elements at high melting temperatures. However, uniform dispersion of carbide particles {{in the base of}} the austenitic grains was noticed at pouring temperature range of 1400 - 15000 C...|$|E

40|$|Procurement {{of fresh}} tissue of {{prostate}} cancer is critical for biobanking and generation of xenograft models as an important preclinical step towards new therapeutic strategies in advanced prostate cancer. However, handling of fresh radical prostatectomy specimens has been notoriously challenging given the distinctive physical properties of prostate tissue and the difficulty to identify cancer foci on gross examination. Here, we have developed a novel approach using ceramic foam plates for processing freshly cut whole <b>mount</b> <b>sections</b> from radical prostatectomy specimens without compromising further diagnostic assessment. Forty-nine radical prostatectomy specimens were processed and sectioned from the apex to the base in whole mount slices. Putative carcinoma foci were morphologically verified by frozen section analysis. The fresh whole mount slices were then laid between two ceramic foam plates and fixed overnight. To test tissue preservation after this procedure, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded whole <b>mount</b> <b>sections</b> were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence, and silver in situ hybridization (FISH and SISH, respectively). There were no morphological artifacts on H&E stained whole <b>mount</b> <b>sections</b> from slices that had been fixed between two plates of ceramic foam, and the histological architecture was fully retained. The quality of immunohistochemistry, FISH, and SISH was excellent. Fixing whole mount tissue slices between ceramic foam plates after frozen section examination is an excellent method for processing fresh radical prostatectomy specimens, allowing for a precise identification and collection of fresh tumor tissue without compromising further diagnostic analysis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Transitional cell {{carcinoma}} (TCC) of the prostate/prostatic urethra {{is a risk}} factor for urethral recurrence after radical cystoprostatectomy for TCC. Using conventional sectioning techniques, prostate involvement (prostatic urethra, acini, ducts and/ or stroma) has been detected in a range of 10 - 20 % of the patients, whereas transversal whole <b>mount</b> <b>sectioning</b> has revealed 43 % prostate involvement in two reported series. Due to different mechanisms of prostate involvement (intraurethral, extravesical and direct overgrowth into the prostatic stroma), preoperative transurethral biopsies of the prostate might not accurately determine such involvement. In this study we examine the prostate using a longitudinal whole <b>mount</b> <b>sectioning</b> technique, correlate TCC of the prostate with the characteristics of the bladder tumour and, thus, validate the preoperative transurethral resection biopsies. Material and methods: Patients scheduled for cystoprostatectomy or cystoprostatourethrectomy were investigated by preoperative resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra and mapping of the bladder. The cystectomy specimen was fixated with the bladder filled with formalin, and the prostate and bladder neck examined using longitudinal whole <b>mount</b> <b>sectioning.</b> Results: In 13 of the 43 (30 %), patients TCC was identified in the prostate. Of these 13 patients, 9 had been identified in the preoperative resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra. Of the patients with prostatic involvement, 46 % had carcinoma in situ (Cis) in the bladder neck/trigone and 38 % had multifocal Cis in the bladder. Comparing this to the group of patients without prostatic involvement, the respectively figures are 20 % and 23 %. A tumour in the trigone, either invasive or Cis, was detected in 5 / 13 patients with prostatic involvement as compared to one patient (3 %) without TCC of the prostate. Multiple bladder tumours were more common in patients with prostatic involvement and were larger (3. 2 cm compared to 2. 2 cm). Conclusions: Preoperative resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra do not always detect TCC in the prostate. Cis in the bladder neck/trigone or multifocal and multiple bladder tumours could be risk factors for prostate involvement of TCC...|$|R
