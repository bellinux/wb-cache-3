The effect of plant growth regulator powder (0. 5 mg/g indole butyric acid and 0. 5 mg/g naphthalene acetic acid), honey, combined honey + plant growth regulator powder, different growth stages of the donor plant, and rooting substrates on rooting rate, root number, root length, and survival rate were investigated. The highest propagation success rate was achieved when cuttings were taken at the pre-flowering stage, treated with plant growth regulator powder and grown in a sand + potting mix substrate. The rooting rate ranged from 87. 5 to 100 % for chickpea, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum, and interspecific hybrids.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Seedling root {{fluorescence}} (SRF) {{has been}} used as a test in the USA since 1941 to discriminate Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) from perennial ryegrass (L. perenne L.). Generally, roots of Italian ryegrass fluorescece when exposed to ultraviolet light, while roots of perennial ryegrass do not. Presence of fluorescent seedlings in lots of perennial ryegrass can cause concern among buyers who fear contamination of Italian ryegrass. The SRF trait has introgressed between the two species of ryegrass, and since 1991 breeders have documented inherent varietal fluorescence levels (VFL) of ryegrass cultivars before <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> under seed certification programs. Studies were conducted to further elucidate plant growing condition aspects of SRF in ryegrass. Four populations with different fluorescence levels were assembled from among ryegrass half-sib families. The four populations were increased independently for three generations at each of three Oregon locations. There was considerable variation for SRF among locations within populations, and for generations within location. Generally, each population increased in SRF each generation of multiplication at Corvallis, but did not increase at the Aurora and Madras sites. Significant location X population and location X generation interactions indicated a strong location effect on SRF. Heritabilities of SRF were estimated using realized response from 26 half-sib families at the three locations. Heritability estimates ranged from 97 to 99...|$|E

In addition to viral elimination, tissue culture offers other advantages such as rapid <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> stock for basic seed production within a short period of time. The method is also useful for germplasm conservation. Although, in-vitro multiplication of potato was started 40 years ago and is promising, extensive use in developing countries has been limited by the high costs of media. There is thus need to explore cheaper alternatives without compromising on quality of in -vitro plantlets. A study was carried out to compare the effects of the liquid medium and solid medium on performance of three popular Kenyan potato cultivars i. e. Dutch, Kenya Sifa and Tigoni. Liquid medium consisted of Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with normal vitamins and sucrose while solid medium consisted of the same chemicals into which phytagel were added to solidify the medium. Data taken were number of roots, nodes and leaves per plantlet over time. From the results, the liquid medium gave more roots, more nodes and more leaves per plantlet than the solid medium. The results therefore indicated that liquid media {{have a significant effect on}} the plant growth. In addition, liquid medium was found to be cheaper than solid media by USD 1. 65. It appears more economical to use liquid media than solid media for in vitro micro-propagation of potato.

40|$|The present {{research}} work presents {{the use of}} some fungal biotechnological techniques for biological control of soil borne fungal pathogens of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) by employing vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza and other antagonistic fungi i. e. Aspergillus niger (Van) Tiegh, and Trichoderma viride Pers with different soil amendments and variable ranges of pH and temperature under glasshouse, screen house and field conditions. Because of aphid virus vectors, which transmit viruses in potatoes resulting in low yield, a {{study was conducted to}} determine the best season to raise healthy potato seed crop by avoiding aphid attack. The vector for the transmission of PLRV in potatoes is the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulz). It was found that the population of Myzus persicae was maximum in the months of March and April. It was concluded that the spring crop in the plains of Punjab province is not fit for seed potato production purposes. The potato planting materials i. e. plants and tubers were raised through tissue culture techniques of apical meristem culture, nodal stem cuttings, layering, micro propagation in in-vitro and in-vivo and micro tuberization in-vitro and <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> tubers. Plants were grown out under field conditions and under controlled conditions in glass houses through out the course of the study. Murashige and Skoog Medium of inorganic salts with various amendments both in solid and liquid media were used for the commercial production of micro plants and micro tubers in in-vitro propagation. The liquid medium proved most suitable to elucidate the virus problem in the potato crop. Virus free seed tubers and plants used in experiments were screened through Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the potato viruses i. e. PVX, PVY, PLRV and PVS. An elaborate survey was carried out of endogonaceous spore density. Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi status and pathogenic infections. This was done in the root systems and in rhizosphere soil of the four potato varieties approved by the Seed Council of Pakistan i. e. Cardinal, Desiree, (red skin) Diamant and Patrones (white skin), growing in different areas of Pakistan (Plains and Northern Hilly Areas). All major vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza (V AM) forming fungi genera were found in both potato growing areas. During this study the significance of various potato pathogens was determined in these four potato varieties. The investigations took place in both hilly areas and plains of Pakistan using the potatoes crop raised through tissue culture. A survey was also carried out of mycoflora in the rhizosphere of potato plants and a number of potato pathogens were isolated and identified. Fungi were isolated on malt extract agar (MEA) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) media except for obligate parasites. The potato pathogens identified were Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn (stem canker and black scurf), Verticillium alba-atrum Reinke and Berth, V dahliae (Verticillium wilt), Fusarium oxysporum schlect, Fusarium. spp. (Fusarium wilt), Alternaria solani Soraner (early blight), Phytophthora infestans (Mont) de Bary (late blight), Spongospora subterranea (wallr) Lagerh, (Powdery scab) and Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.) waks and Henric (common scab). The preparations of culture media and inoculum were carried out on various types of substrata including agricultural byproducts. Amongst these, sorghum seeds and wheat straw were the most successful substrates for inoculum. They were treated with 0. 1 normal (N) and 0. 2 N concentration of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) before being inoculated with antagonistic fungi. A new method was developed for the sterilization of compost and solid media through direct Sun light (Solarizaiton) at 60 - 75 Â°C by polythene sheets covering. It was observed that the single and dual inoculations of antagonists of Trichoderma viride and VAM resulted in significant control of R. solani, Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium albo-atrum. Significant biocontrol of disease severity was also obtained with dual inoculations (VAM + Aspergillus niger) made against R. solani and Verticillium spp. Fusarium oxysporum, the cause of wilting disease of potatoes, was suppressed and controlled biologically by using. T viride and VAM. There was a synergistic interaction of R. solani and F. oxysporum during interaction with each other and the wilt disease control in sterilized compost media. Pre inoculations with VAM of tissue culture raised microplants from test tubes to glass houses showed considerable hardening toward water and light stresses and a reduced mortality rate. Spongospora subterranea, the cause of powdery scab in potatoes, was controlled biologically through pre-inoculation of antagonist Trichoderma viride and by adjusting pH levels (i. e. 5. 5 to 7. 90) under field conditions by amending rhizosphere soils with Single Super Phosphate (SSP) and 1 N Sulphuric acid I-H 2 SO 4...|$|E

The recent disease outbreak in the district coincided with a significant introduction <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> potatoes. This research was therefore initiated to genetically characterize the pathogen so as to trace its source, identify its relationship with outbreaks {{in the rest of the}} country, and make intervention recommendations. Ralstonia solanacearum isolates were sampled both from seed and ware potato fields in Chencha and from seed potato fields in production regions suspected of being potential sources of the pathogen. Multiplex PCR and phylogenetic analysis of partial endoglucanase gene sequences identified all of the isolates as phylotype IIB sequevar 1. VNTR sequence analysis distinguished 11 different haplotypes, nine of which were unique to the Chencha district. However, one of the haplotypes was common to all seed potato producer regions of Ethiopia except for the Shashemene area. The unique and diverse VNTR haplotypes of the pathogen in Chencha indicates that it is well established in the district. When a geographical map of the VNTR haplotypes was superimposed with the main cross-regional seed potato distribution pattern of the country, it became evident that the pathogen was being disseminated via latently infected seed from the Holeta-Jeldu area in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia.

40|$|In Kenya potato is an {{important}} food crop, second after maize. Potatoes are grown on 128, 000 ha per year with average yields of about 8 tonnes per ha. The yield is far below its po-tential and should be improved to enhance food security. Of all potato growers in Kenya, 98 % are characterised as small-scale farmers, producing less than 0. 4 ha of potatoes per year per farm (total of two planting seasons). They produce 83 % of the national production. Lack <b>of</b> good quality <b>seed</b> is a main reason for low yields. The fast-track seed project aims to improve availability <b>of</b> certified <b>seed.</b> Imported seed needs to be multiplied locally once or twice {{to reduce the cost}} price and make it affordable for small-scale growers. It is estimated that there is potential for at most 1, 000 ha <b>of</b> professional <b>seed</b> production in Kenya to meet the market demand for certified seed. In Kenya about 98 % of ware potatoes are sold for 'fresh' consumption. For industrial processing the most favourable opportunities are the production of crisps and fresh - not frozen - French fries. To change the low-input low-output strategy of many small-scale farmers linkages between producers and markets need to be improved. In the short term, improvement of potato growing and crop management should receive higher priority than storage and mechanisation. Storage and mechanisation should be adapted to local conditions and needs. Two cases have been indicated in which investments in professional cooled storage facilities are necessary; - storage <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> potatoes <b>of</b> varieties with a long dormancy period; - storage of ware potatoes for processing industry and some high-end retailers. Long-term seed storage in modern stores required for varieties with long dormancy increases the cost price <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> by 50 % compared with short-term storage in diffused light stores. This makes short dor-mancy {{an important}} trait for potato varieties in Kenya, where potatoes are planted during two growing seasons. Machinery supplied for potato growing in Kenya should be geared to local needs. Higher yields and more <b>multiplications</b> <b>of</b> imported <b>seed</b> reduce the cost price <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> potatoes produced in Kenya. The cost price <b>of</b> imported <b>seed</b> after two multiplications is competitive with locally produced seed from minitubers after three multiplications. This report describes the current situation of the potato sector in Kenya and opportunities for further de-velopment. The study focuses on possibilities of the Dutch agribusiness to facilitate these developments. Existing information has been collected, although information on potato production was not easily availa-ble. In addition, during a mission to Kenya stakeholders were visited and interviewed. This resulted in cost- price calculations for seed potato production (short and long-term storage, imported seed and minitubers) and market information...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTop-shoot {{cuttings}} {{were planted}} {{with the whole}} tuber (as a control) at different dates using three spacings at the Horticultural Research Farm of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University to evaluate the performance of top-shoots as planting material and to determine the optimum time of planting and the optimum spacing for top-shoot cuttings as planting material for breeder seed production. The survival of top shoot cuttings was more than 97. 8 % irrespective of the planting time and plant spacing. Significant variations were found among the treatment combinations for plant height at 45 and 60 days after planting (DAP), foliage coverage at 45 and 60 DAP, number of branches per plant, number of tubers per plant, individual tuber weight, tuber yields per plant and per hectare yield. The highest mean yield (46. 57  t/ha) was produced by whole tubers planted on 10 November with 50  ×  10  cm spacing which was similar to whole tubers planted on 1 November with 50  ×  10  cm spacing. On the other hand, plants from top-shoot cuttings yielded 34. 82  t/ha in T 3 S 2 followed by T 1 S 1 (33. 34  t/ha), T 3 S 3 (30. 70  t/ha). The total yield of potato increased 122. 8 % from a single, early crop due to taking two repeated cuttings compared with 89. 6 % from a single late crop. Early planting of top-shoot cuttings with closer spacing (50  ×  10  cm and 50  ×  15  cm) is recommended for the <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> breeder <b>seed</b> potato...|$|R
40|$|African {{agriculture}} is at a crossroads. The current high food {{prices and the}} instability they have provoked in several countries have added impetus for African countries to review their agricultural policies and programs. New agricultural policies {{will have to be}} more focused on staple food crops and on their main producers-smallholders, most of whom are women. The new policies must remove constraints that impede access by smallholder farmers to the knowledge, technology, and financial services they need to increase farm productivity in a profitable and environmentally sustainable manner. Institutional mechanisms that lower the risks of lending to the agriculture sector and to smallholders in particular should be established and programs developed to leverage financial resources from the commercial banking sector. Governments and the private sector have an opportunity to work together to support the procurement, blending, and packaging of fertilizers. Together they can also support the breeding and <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> improved <b>seeds.</b> Government policies should support agro-dealers to ensure that improved seeds and other inputs are available to farmers. The many issues that African countries must address will be beyond the capacity of most countries, even after financial resources in private banks are leveraged. External assistance will be very much needed, especially to develop essential road infrastructure, irrigation, and rural energy. Other issues, including land policy, will also need attention. The road ahead for African agricultural development, especially the attainment of food security, will not be easy. African governments will need to formulate and implement bold pro-poor, pro-smallholder farmer policies that will increase farm productivity, trigger a sustainable green revolution, and end the cycle of food crises in Africa.

40|$|The {{consideration}} of virulence must distinguish between infectivity {{and the ability}} to cause progressive disease once the infection is established. Several investigators have reported the presence of naturally occurring isolates which differ in virulence for guinea pigs. Isolates from south India which differed with respect to gross disease and number of bacilli recovered from spleen after an intramuscular infection also differed in their efficiencies to initiate an infection, once inhaled and retained. Also, this difference was correlated with differences in the rate <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> at the site of implantation and rate <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> at sites <b>of</b> hematogenous <b>seeding,</b> as well as the extent <b>of</b> hematogenous <b>seeding.</b> The number <b>of</b> metastatic foci was identified as a quantitative measure <b>of</b> hematogenous <b>seeding,</b> which was not confounded by the rate <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> bacilli.

Before the war Rwanda's national agricultural research system, L'Institut Scientifique d'Agriculture Rwandaise (ISAR), was involved in numerous research projects with various international agencies and governments, {{all of which were}} suspended when the fighting began. In January, an important step in the re-establishment of ISAR was taken with the appointment of a new Director General, who subsequently received a visit from a delegation of scientists representing the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The CGIAR centres are involved in a project called 'Seeds of Hope'. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> Hope is to re-introduce germplasm into the country so that Rwandan farmers can start growing their own food crops again. The initiative is led by the Centro International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), which has the world mandate for beans, a very important food crop in Rwanda. Another centre the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), conducts research on sorghum, Rwanda's most important cereal crop. Organizations such as World Vision and CARE International have been involved through their distribution networks in ensuring that the <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> Hope reach the farmers who most need them. The CGIAR centres have also been working in close collaboration with national agricultural research programmes in the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire which provided facilities and technical support to the <b>seed</b> <b>multiplication</b> efforts <b>of</b> the <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> Hope even before the civil war had ended.
