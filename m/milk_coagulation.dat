In addition to calcium and milk protein concentrations, titratable acidity influences all the phases of <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation.</b> The objective {{of this research was}} to study the feasibility of prediction of titratable acidity directly in bovine milk using mid-infrared spectrometry. In order to maximize the variability in the measurements of titratable acidity, milk samples were collected on basis of several criteria (e. g. breeds). The titratable acidity was recorded as Dornic degree. All samples were also analyzed by MIR spectrometry. Using partial least squares regressions and first derivative pretreatment of spectral data, a calibration equation was built to predict the Dornic degree in cow milk. First results were promising and showed the potentiality to this calibration. The calibration and cross-validation coefficients of determination were 92. 25 and 89. 88 %, respectively.

A total of 17, 577 test-day records from 4, 191 Estonian Holstein cows in 73 herds across the country were collected during routine milk recordings. Measurements of RCT and E 30 determined with the Optigraph (Ysebaert, Frepillon, France) are based on an optical signal in the near-infrared region. The cows had at least 3 measurements taken during the period from April 2005 to January 2009. Data were analyzed using a repeatability animal model. There was substantial variation in <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> traits with a coefficient of variation of 27 % for E 30 and 9 % for the log-transformed RCT. The percentage of variation explained by herd was 3 % for E 30 and 4 % for RCT, suggesting that <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> traits are not strongly affected by herd conditions (e. g., feeding). Heritability was 0. 28 for RCT and 0. 41 for E 30, and repeatability estimates were 0. 45 and 0. 50, respectively. Genetic correlation between both <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> traits was negligible, suggesting that RCT and E 30 have genetically different foundations. <b>Milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> time had a moderately high positive genetic (0. 69) and phenotypic (0. 61) correlation with milk pH indicating that a high pH is related to a less favorable RCT. Curd firmness had a moderate positive genetic (0. 48) and phenotypic (0. 45) correlation with the protein percentage. Therefore, a high protein percentage is associated with favorable curd firmness. All reported genetic parameters were statistically significantly different from zero. Additional univariate random regression analysis for <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> traits yielded slightly higher average heritabilities of 0. 38 and 0. 47 for RCT and E 30 compared with the heritabilities of the repeatability model...|$|E

The data included the following traits: <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> time; curd firmness; pH and titratable acidity; fat, protein, and casein contents; somatic cell score; and daily milk, fat, and protein yields. A single-trait animal model was assumed with fixed effects of herd, days in milk, parity, composite casein genotype of CSN 2 and CSN 3 (CSN 2 -CSN 3), and random additive genetic effect of an animal.

A total of 654 records from 36 herds located in central Italy with information on milk yield, somatic cell score, milk chemical composition, milk acidity [pH, titratable acidity (TA) ], and <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties (rennet coagulation time, curd firming time, and curd firmness) were available for statistical analysis. Reference measures of milk acidity and coagulation properties were matched with milk spectral information, and FT-MIR prediction models were built using partial least squares regression. The data set was divided into a calibration set (75 %) and a validation set (25 %). The capacity of FT-MIR spectroscopy to correctly classify milk samples based on their renneting ability was evaluated by a canonical discriminant analysis. Average values for <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> traits were 13. 32 min, 3. 24 min, and 39. 27 mm for rennet coagulation time, curd firming time, and curd firmness, respectively. Milk acidity traits averaged 6. 66 (pH) and 7. 22 Soxhlet-Henkel degrees/ 100 mL (TA). All <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> and acidity traits, except for pH, had high variability (17 to 46 %).

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of whole casein and fat are the factors which play {{the most important}} {{role in determining the}} cheese-making qualities of milk. Plasmin (PL) is the main proteolytic enzyme in milk and {{has been found to be}} associated with enhanced casein hydrolysation. ß-casein is the most susceptible to breakdown by this enzyme. Most of the enzyme is in the form of the inactive zymogene plasminogen (PG), which is converted to PL by the action of PG activators. PL activity is also associated with alteration of mammary epithelium permeability and a subsequent increase in paracellular flow. These proteolytic activities worsen the <b>milk</b> quality, <b>coagulation</b> properties and cheese yield. The level of PL in milk increases towards the end of lactation, with mastitis, and with the increasing age of the animals.

40|$|Substantial {{variation}} in <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties {{has been observed}} among dairy cows. Consequently, raw milk from individual cows and breeds exhibits distinct coagulation capacities that potentially affect the technological properties and milk processing into cheese. This variation is largely influenced by protein composition, which is in turn affected by underlying genetic polymorphisms in the major milk proteins. In this study, we conducted a large screening on 3 major Scandinavian breeds to resolve the {{variation in}} <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> traits {{and the frequency of}} milk with impaired coagulation properties (noncoagulation). In total, individual coagulation properties were measured on morning milk collected from 1, 299 Danish Holstein (DH), Danish Jersey (DJ), and Swedish Red (SR) cows. The 3 breeds demonstrated notable interbreed differences in coagulation properties, with DJ cows exhibiting superior coagulation compared with the other 2 breeds. In addition, milk samples from 2 % of DH and 16 % of SR cows were classified as noncoagulating. Furthermore, the cows were genotyped for major genetic variants in the alpha(S 1) - (CSN 1 S 1), beta- (CSN 2), and kappa-casein (CSN 3) genes, revealing distinct differences in variant frequencies among breeds. Allele I of CSN 2, which had not formerly been screened in such a high number of cows in these Scandinavian breeds, showed a frequency around 7 % in DH and DJ, but was not detected in SR. Genetic polymorphisms were significantly associated with curd firming rate and rennet coagulation time. Thus, CSN 1 S 1 C, CSN 2 B, and CSN 3 B positively affected <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation,</b> whereas CSN 2 A(2), in particular, had a negative effect. In addition to the influence of individual casein genes, the effects of CSN 1 S 1 -CSN 2 -CSN 3 composite genotypes were also examined, and revealed strong associations in all breeds, which more or less reflected the single gene results. Overall, <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> is under the influence of additive genetic variation. Optimal milk for future cheese production can be ensured by monitoring the frequency of unfavorable variants and thus preventing {{an increase in the number}} of cows producing milk with impaired coagulation. Selective breeding for variants associated with superior <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> can potentially increase raw milk quality and cheese yield in all 3 Scandinavian breeds...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. For dairy {{producers}} {{who want to}} transform their milk, the ability of milk to coagulate is an important parameter. It {{makes it possible to}} transform milk into cheese.

The objective of this review is to describe the <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> process, the factors influencing it and the methods for measuring the coagulation of milk at lab level. Literature. The processing of milk into cheese involves three steps: coagulation, dewatering and refining. Coagulation is a key step which involves the use of rennet and depends on several parameters (pH, calcium content, temperature, etc.). Some milks never coagulate. To measure the coagulation ability of milk and identify different parameters in <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties, the Formagraph, the computerized renneting meter and the Optigraph have been developed (reference methods).

Sire breeding value for <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties (IAC) combining RCT and a 30 in equal weight has been developed using a repeatability single-trait animal model, which included herd-test-day, days-in-milk, age at parity and season of parity as fixed effects, and cow permanent environment and animal additive genetic as random effects. However this direct IAC is not yet available at whole population level, which is mainly due to the absence, up to now, of a collection of individual cow data on a large scale. For this reason, a stepwise approach was chosen in order to combine existing official EBVs fo...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to define direct and {{indirect}} indices for <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties (MCP) in Italian Holstein Friesian sires. A total of 315, 700 individual milk samples from 49, 183 cows were collected in 479 dairy farms from September 2011 to February 2014. Rennet coagulation time (RCT) and curd firmness (a 30) were predicted using mid-infrared spectroscopy. Sire breeding values (EBV) for RCT and a 30 were estimated using a repeatability single-trait animal model, which included herd-test-day, days in milk, age at parities and season of parity as fixed effects, and cow permanent environment and animal as random effects. The direct genetic index for <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> ability (IAC) was defined as the combination of EBV for RCT and a 30 with equal weight, and then expressed on a scale with mean 100 and standard deviation of 5. A stepwise method was chosen to combine official EBVs for traits published by the Italian Holstein Friesian Cattle Breeders Association in a genetic index able to predict the direct IAC. Only sires with at least 10 daughters (scored for MCP) in 5 different herds were considered. The official EBVs retained by the regression analysis were those of protein and fat content, somatic cell score and the genetic variants for k-casein. Results of direct and indirect selection for MCP are presented. (Keywords: genetic evaluation, <b>milk</b> <b>coagulation</b> properties, Holstein Friesian bulls...|$|E
2500|$|Lore Alford Rogers (7 February 1875 - 21 March 1975) was an American {{bacteriologist}} {{and dairy}} scientist. He {{is credited with}} discovering that butter made from pasteurized sweet cream over sour ripened cream remained fresher, while suggesting that surplus milk could be sold as concentrated sour milk products. [...] He [...] refined the steps for the manufacture of high quality Swiss cheese and, new to the United States, production of Roquefort cheese. He was instrumental in finding ways to discourage fungal growth in sweetened condensed milk and preventing losses in evaporated <b>milk</b> from heat <b>coagulation.</b> [...] His pioneering work on freeze drying bacterial cultures had immediate applications in World War I. As Chief of the Research Laboratories of the Bureau of Dairy Industry, USDA for nearly four decades, [...] Rogers was praised for a leadership style that allowed the [...] "creativity of others" [...] to be [...] "developed and expressed." [...] In retirement he gave {{back to his own}} community by co-founding the Patten Lumbermen's Museum.|$|R
40|$|Background : Nephropathy is {{a common}} {{complication}} of diabetes {{and it is the}} major cause of disability and death among these patients. We aimed {{to determine the effects of}} soy <b>milk</b> on inflammation, <b>coagulation</b> and oxidative stress among type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. Methods: This randomized crossover controlled clinical trial was conducted on type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. This study had two trial phases, each for 4 weeks and one washout period for two weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to consume a diet containing soy milk, or a diet containing cow’s milk. Results: Soy milk consumption, in comparison to cow’s milk, resulted in a significant reduction in D-dimer level. This significant effect remained even after adjustment of cofounding factor (carbohydrate intake). However, soy milk consumption had no significant effects on inflammation and oxidative stress levels. Conclusion: Soy milk consumption for 4 weeks could decrease serum D-dimer level in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of dairy {{industry}} has been to identify an efficient and economical way of increasing milk production and its constituents without increasing {{the size of the}} dairy herd. The use of milk protein polymorphisms as detectable molecular markers has been studied intensively because of their effect on the yield and processing properties of milk and its products. Thus, molecular markers are promising alternative to the current methods of trait selection once these genes are proven to be associated with traits of interest in animals. Kappa-casein (CSN 3) and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) are two of the most important proteins in the milk of mammals that {{play a crucial role in}} the <b>milk</b> quality and <b>coagulation,</b> an essential process for cheese and butter. The A and B variant of k-casein and β-lactoglobulin were distinguished by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in 108 Romanian Simmental and 60 Holstein Friesian cattle...|$|R
