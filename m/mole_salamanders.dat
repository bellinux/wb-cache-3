The Ambystomatidae are also members of suborder Salamandroidea, which includes all the salamanders capable of internal fertilization. The sister species to A.macrodactylum is A. laterale, distributed in eastern North America. However, the species-level phylogeny for Ambystomatidae is tentative and in need of further testing.|$|E
2500|$|Examples {{in animals}} {{are more common}} in non-vertebrates such as flatworms, leeches, and brine shrimp. Within vertebrates, {{examples}} of stable polyploidy include the salmonids and many cyprinids (i.e. carp). Some fish {{have as many as}} 400 chromosomes. Polyploidy also occurs commonly in amphibians; for example the biomedically-important Xenopus genus contains many different species with as many as 12 sets of chromosomes (dodecaploid). Polyploid lizards are also quite common, but are sterile and must reproduce by parthenogenesis. Polyploid <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> (mostly triploids) are all female and reproduce by kleptogenesis, [...] "stealing" [...] spermatophores from diploid males of related species to trigger egg development but not incorporating the males' DNA into the offspring. While mammalian liver cells are polyploid, rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result in prenatal death.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> are stocky, {{with short}} bodies and large heads. They can grow to 10 cm (4 in) in length. They are {{normally}} gray or dark brown in color, with darker mottling and lighter gray undersides.|$|E
50|$|Like other <b>mole</b> <b>{{salamander}}s,</b> the Jefferson salamander burrows; {{they have}} well-developed lungs suited for this purpose. Nocturnal by nature, {{they can be}} spotted by day during the mating season. Breeding occurs in early spring, after the snow in the area has melted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> (genus Ambystoma) are a {{group of}} {{advanced}} salamanders endemic to North America, the only genus in the family Ambystomatidae. The group has become famous due {{to the presence of}} the axolotl (A. mexicanum), widely used in research, and the tiger salamander (A. tigrinum, A. mavortium) which is the official amphibian of many states, and often sold as a pet.|$|E

50|$|The marbled {{salamander}} is a stocky, boldly banded salamander. The {{bands of}} females {{tend to be}} gray, while those of males are more white.

50|$|The {{first known}} fossil {{salamanders}} are Kokartus honorarius from the Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan and {{two species of}} the apparently neotenic, aquatic Marmorerpeton from England of a similar date. They looked superficially like robust modern salamanders but lacked a number of anatomical features that developed later. Karaurus sharovi from the Upper Jurassic of Kazakhstan resembled modern <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> in morphology and probably had a similar burrowing lifestyle.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "newt" [...] has {{traditionally}} been seen as an exclusively functional term for salamanders living in water, and not a clade. Phylogenetic analyses have however shown that species in the Salamandridae traditionally called newts do form a monophyletic group. Other, more distantly related salamander families also contain fully or in part aquatic species, such as the <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders,</b> the Proteidae, or the Sirenidae.|$|E

50|$|Rhyacosiredon was {{previously}} considered a separate genus {{within the family}} Ambystomatidae. However, cladistic analysis of the <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> found the existence of Rhyacosiredon makes Ambystoma paraphyletic, since the species are {{more closely related to}} some Ambystoma species than those species are to others in Ambystoma. The stream-type morphology of these salamanders (which includes larvae and neotenes with short gills and thicker gular folds) may have led to their misclassification as a different genus.|$|E
50|$|The Santa Cruz long-toed {{salamander}} (Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum) is an endangered subspecies of the {{long-toed salamander}}, which is found only {{close to a}} few isolated ponds in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties in California. It has a black body, broken yellow or orange irregular striping along its spine, and a tail fin well evolved for swimming. Like other <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders,</b> it is found near pools or slow-moving steams and has a very secretive lifestyle, {{making it difficult to}} find.|$|E

50|$|Ambystoma rivulare is {{a species}} of <b>mole</b> <b>salamander</b> in the Ambystomatidae family.It is endemic to Mexico.Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and rivers.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R

50|$|All <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> are oviparous and lay {{large eggs}} in clumps in the water. Their fully aquatic larvae are branchiate, with {{three pairs of}} {{external}} gills behind their heads and above their gill slits. Larvae have large caudal fins, which extend {{from the back of}} their heads to their tails and to their cloacae. Larvae grow limbs soon after hatching, with four toes on the fore arms, and five toes on the hind legs. Their eyes are wide-set and lack true eyelids.|$|E
5000|$|Terrestrial <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> are {{identified}} by having wide, protruding eyes, prominent costal grooves, and thick arms. Most have vivid patterning on dark backgrounds, with marks ranging from deep blue spots to large yellow bars {{depending on the}} species. Terrestrial adults {{spend most of their}} lives underground in burrows, either of their own making or abandoned by other animals. Some northern species may hibernate in these burrows throughout the winter. They live alone and feed on any available invertebrate. Adults spend little time in the water, only returning to the ponds of their birth to breed.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{spend most}} of their time in their burrows or under logs, as is the case with most <b>mole</b> <b>{{salamanders}}.</b> Juvenile marbled salamanders hatch early compared to most salamanders and gain a size advantage by feeding and growing for several months before the Jefferson salamanders and spotted salamanders hatch later in the spring. Larvae typically mature as quickly as two months in the southern part of their range, but take up to six months to mature in the northern part.Marbled salamanders, like other members of this genus, are reported to have relatively long life spans, 8-10 years or more.|$|E
50|$|The barred tiger {{salamander}} or western {{tiger salamander}} (Ambystoma mavortium) is {{a species of}} <b>mole</b> <b>salamander</b> found from southwestern Canada in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, south through the western United States to Texas and northern Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Specimens {{are up to}} 30 cm long, and {{are found}} in the western United States and southwestern British Columbia. Except for their size, they are similar to the <b>mole</b> <b>salamander</b> family (Ambystomatidae), in which they were {{originally}} included.|$|R
50|$|The Yellow-Peppered Salamander (Ambystoma flavipiperatum) {{also known}} as Salamandra de Champala and the Yellow-Headed Salamander, is a species of <b>mole</b> <b>salamander</b> native to areas at an {{elevation}} of 4900 ft around Santa Cruz, Rancho Malveste and Tapalpa in Jalisco, Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The spotted {{salamander}} is about 15 - 25 cm long. They are stout, like most <b>mole</b> <b>salamanders,</b> and have wide snouts. The {{spotted salamander}}'s main color is black, but {{can sometimes be}} a blueish-black, dark grey, dark green, or even dark brown. Two uneven rows of yellowish-orange spots run {{from the top of}} the head (near the eyes) to the tip of the tail. The spotted salamander's spots near the top of its head are more orange, while the spots on the rest of its body are more yellow. The underside of the spotted salamander is slate gray and pink.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mole</b> <b>salamanders</b> {{are found}} in south eastern lowland areas of the Gulf Coastal Plains of the United States. Their main range extends from eastern Texas to {{southern}} South Carolina and inland as far as southern Illinois. It is absent from southern Florida and Louisiana, and there are separate populations in Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, northern South Carolina, northern Georgia and northern Alabama. There is also a small isolated population within the southernmost tip of Indiana. They inhabit floodplain pine or broadleaf forests, especially near gum and cypress ponds. Adults live {{under the surface of}} leaf litter while larvae are aquatic and found in ponds and ephemeral, fish-free waters.|$|E
