The study reveals that the application of these purely contractual legal constructions is often affected by the mandatory law, which regulates such neighboring areas as civil liability, criminal liability for fraud and misrepresentation, and bankruptcy procedure. The deficiencies in regulation of the traditional securities have also affected the use of the covenants, {{as is the case with}} the negative pledge. Its substitution by the assignment of rights seems to be problematic because this device is not properly regulated in the Czech law. This lack of regulation combined with the influence of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> created a unique legal environment where covenants have evolved and diversified in the form of international standards, which were then adapted to the specifics of the domestic legal environment. Another important element that works as a countervailing force to these developments is the approach of the Czech judiciary. The lack of judicial activism and traditional formalism of the Czech courts makes the enforcement of covenants uncertain. This formalism and lack of legal certainty in the enforcement of the contractual provisions which have no basis in the substantive law might deter their further development. The absence of any guidance from the part of the judiciary leaves businesses and their legal counsel on their own in developing the workable legal constructions that would not contradict to the <b>mandatory</b> <b>legal</b> norms...|$|R

CSR funds in Indonesia are really potential to be managed properly for the benefits of relevant stakeholders and to support the national economic growth. Huge potential CSR funds in Indonesia should be managed by providing transparent and accountable policies. Currently, there is no mandatory CSR guidelines being used by companies who operating in natural resources or related to natural resources.

40|$|Published {{in final}} form at [URL] Scaling up {{community-based}} adaptation (CBA) needs strong policy support. This paper aims {{to shed light}} onto the policy context of mainstreaming CBA in Nepal. Design/methodology/approach- The content and processes of Nepal’s development policies and climate change policies and programmes were examined. The policy analysis {{was supported by a}} literature review, review of policy documents, and interviews and discussions undertaken with policy makers, practitioners and communities. Findings- The findings show that despite a lack of clear focus on climate change, the decentralization provisions and bottom-up practices within Nepal’s development policies and plans could be entry points for mainstreaming CBA. However, experience shows that decentralization alone is insufficient because it benefits only a few institutions and individuals, while marginalizing the real beneficiaries. One of the policy conditions to mainstreaming CBA in development is to ensure that there are specific provisions for decentralization and inclusive devolution that can provide power and authority to local institutions and communities to make independent decisions and benefit the needy. There should also be <b>mandatory</b> <b>legal</b> <b>provisions,</b> endorsed by a country’s government, for an inclusive, citizen-centric, participatory, and bottom-up policy making process that involves the most vulnerable households and communities. Originality/value- This paper is of relevance to policy makers and practitioners in Nepal seeking to make informed policy decisions on effectively mainstreaming CBA into development. The analysis provided of the synergy and tradeoffs within existing policy provisions and processes can be used to guide the government and stakeholders in Nepal and other Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in creating favorable national and local-level policies and action plans...|$|R

This restriction is also binding for the Supreme Courts, which declare the unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> [...] "inapplicable". Nonetheless, if a case concerning the constitutionality of a law is introduced into the Supreme Special Court (after the issuing of contradictory decisions of the Supreme Courts), the Court has the constitutional right to declare an unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> as [...] "powerless". This means that the unconstitutional <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> still exists (it is not formally [...] "null and void"), but it is expelled from the Greek [...] "law and order".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} planned damages actions for {{breaches}} of EC antitrust law {{in order to}} assess their impact on consumer welfare. It first examines the current legal situation and concurs that the European Union needs to regulate damages actions for breaches of EC antitrust law so that a higher number of consumers could be compensated for their losses. This paper then discusses the main <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> proposed by the Commission in the Green and in the White paper on damages actions for breaches of EC antitrust law. The analysis of these proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> is done using arguments specific to the economic analysis of law. It is demonstrated that most of these proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> will enhance consumer welfare but that there are also proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> which will damage consumer welfare. The paper concludes that the planned damages actions for breaches of the EC law will be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, the Commission should amend some of the proposed <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> in order to help consumers further...|$|R

We introduce the provision space; the growing set of all <b>legal</b> <b>provisions</b> existing in the world's constitutions over time. Through this we uncover a third mechanism influencing constitutional change: hierarchical dependencies between <b>legal</b> <b>provisions,</b> under which the adoption of essential, fundamental provisions precedes more advanced provisions. This third mechanism appears to play an especially important role in the emergence of new political rights, and may therefore provide a useful roadmap for advocates of those rights. We further characterise each <b>legal</b> <b>provision</b> in terms of the strength of these mechanisms...|$|R
