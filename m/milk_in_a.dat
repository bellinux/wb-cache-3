5|$|In the Neolithic period, {{from around}} 6,000 years ago, there is {{evidence}} of permanent settlements and farming. This includes the well-preserved stone house at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE and the village of similar houses at Skara Brae on West Mainland, Orkney from about 500 years later. Evidence of prehistoric farming includes small plots of improved land, with simple stone boundaries. On Shetland these have been found under peat and on the mainland they are associated with cairnfields (piles of rocks that have been cleared from fields). Archaeological evidence of pollen, pottery, settlements and human remains indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow <b>milk,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pattern that probably remained constant until the High Middle Ages. There is also some limited evidence of the cultivation of flax from this period.|$|E
25|$|The Bonyu Bar (Mother’s Milk Bar), {{located in}} Tokyo’s {{entertainment}} and red-light district of Kabukicho, employs nursing women who provide customers with breast <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass for 2,000 yen (about 15 euros) or {{directly from the}} nipple for 5000 yen (about 37.50 euros). In the latter case the women can run their fingers through the customers' hair, coo and say their name as they suckle.|$|E
25|$|Prebiotics are undigestible {{carbohydrates}} {{that promote}} {{the growth of}} probiotic bacteria in the gut. Human milk contains a variety of oligosaccharides believed {{to be an important}} factor in the pattern of microflora colonization of breastfed infants. Because of variety, variability, complexity and polymorphism of the oligosaccharide composition and structure, it is currently not feasible to reproduce the oligosaccharide components of human <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strictly structural fashion.|$|E

25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E
500|$|Attanasio {{also based}} the {{characters}} in Homicide on the detectives featured in Simon's book. The difficulties Bayliss experienced with the case, {{as well as the}} extremely personal approach he took in attempting to solve it, were inspired by the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, who was the primary detective in the Wallace case. Most of the detectives featured in the Homicide book said they were happy with their on-screen counterparts, although Detective Harry Edgerton, the inspiration for Frank Pembleton, objected to a scene in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] in which the character drinks <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bar, something Edgerton said he never does.|$|E

40|$|Oxytocin can {{attenuate}} {{the physiological}} and behavioral response to stress in animals. In {{this study we}} investigated the relationship between plasma oxytocin concentrations and the behavioral and physiological response of dairy cows to a repeated psychological stressor (novel environment). Twenty lactating multi-parous dairy cows were <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> familiar <b>milking</b> parlor and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> novel environment. Blood samples were collected before and after <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the familiar parlor (baseline) and on the second and fifth day in the novel parlor to measure plasma cortisol and oxytocin concentrations. Heart rate was recorded on all cows during <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the familiar and novel environment. On all test days, the behavioral response of cows to milk cluster attachment was scored. On day 2 in the novel parlor, the oxytocin response, cortisol concentrations and heart rate were greater, and heart rate variability was lower than baseline values recorded in the familiar parlor. The {{results from this study}} suggest that oxytocin release is increased in response to exposure to a psychological stressor (novel environment) and that cows adapt to this stressor over time. After initial suppression, oxytocin levels increased over days of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> novel environment, whereas indicators of stress simultaneously decreased. Furthermore, the oxytocin increase was associated with habituation of the cortisol response <b>in</b> anticipation of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> novel environment, suggesting that oxytocin may be involved <b>in</b> habituation to <b>a</b> novel environment <b>in</b> dairy cows. This mechanism of habituation to novel environments may reflect an association between oxytocin and a "familiarization-habituation response" to repeated exposure to an initially novel environment that has previously been reported in humans...|$|R

2500|$|Two anachronisms are {{presented}} by Cunningham in his book. [...] The first is on page 30 (1998 edition) where he writes of Virginia Woolf, [...] "She rises {{from her bed}} and goes into the bathroom." [...] Hogarth House was built in 1720 and in 1923, {{it did not have}} a bathroom, only an outhouse. The second is on p.43 where Mrs. Brown in 1949 sees [...] "beside the roses stand cereal box and milk carton..." [...] Although Lucerne Dairy did have milk cartons in 1938, they did not come into common use until the 1960s. These are both corrected in the film; Woolf is depicted using a ewer and basin to wash in the morning, and the Browns have <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bottle.|$|E
