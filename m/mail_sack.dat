Miller came into conflict with the U.S. Postal Service's bureaucracy following a dispute over a misplaced <b>mail</b> <b>sack,</b> in which he refused to follow the chain of command and insisted on corresponding directly with the St. Louis postal inspector. As a result, he was transferred out of Little Rock to the Memphis, Tennessee–McAlister, Indian Territory, route.|$|E
2500|$|With the city's {{economic}} boom, the Chamber of Commerce of Barranquilla {{was created}} on June 28, 1905. On September 7, 1909, a bill {{was passed by}} Congress recognizing the opening of Bocas de Ceniza as a national necessity. In June of the same year, [...] "The Barranquillazo" [...] coup was attempted by followers of General Ramón González Valencia against the General Jorge Holguín who was designated the rank of president of the republic after {{the resignation of the}} incumbent, General Reyes. The first flight of a Colombian airplane occurred in Barranquilla in December 1912, the plane being flown by the Canadian pilot George Schmitt. On December 10, 1919, the first commercial airline arrived in the Americas, and second in the world; Scadta later became Avianca. In June 1919, U.S. pilot William Knox Martin and Mario Santo Domingo inaugurated industrial airmail in Colombia with a flight between Barranquilla and Puerto Colombia, where Santo Domingo delivered the <b>mail</b> <b>sack.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Australia has {{pre-paid}} <b>mail</b> <b>sack</b> service {{within the}} country. A person buys a pre-paid [...] "satchel" [...] (<b>mail</b> <b>sack)</b> to put mail into. The [...] "satchels" [...] (mail sacks) {{can be bought}} in bulk (sets of 10) for further discount. The sizes are 500 gram, 3 kg, and 5 kg. The [...] "satchel" [...] (<b>mail</b> <b>sack)</b> full of mail is then placed into an Australian red post box at certain street locations for pick-up. The [...] "satchels" [...] (mail sacks) can also {{be taken to the}} nearest post office for processing, especially if it is too big to fit through the opening of the street red post box. Certain paperwork must be filled out, especially if it is going by airmail. A proof of mailing is available with an additional fee paid at the post office (Australian retail outlet). There is an online tracking tool available for this pre-paid <b>mail</b> <b>sack</b> service.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>mail</b> <b>sack</b> is not {{a locked}} bag since they need little security. In {{contrast}} to a similar mailbag [...] {{referred to as a}} mail pouch (for more sensitive mail such as personal letters and military mail) that employs a locking mechanism {{on the top of the}} bag. A mail pouch has special closely spaced eyelets and a strong strap to secure the top where access into the bag is closed off and locked, where a <b>mail</b> <b>sack</b> has none of these features.|$|E

The ship SS Kwinana was wrecked on Cockburn Sound in 1922, and blown {{on to the}} beach.

25|$|On September 29, 1921, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were {{transferred}} to the Library of Congress.

He subsequently dropped light bombs from shallow dive on the enemy and was successful in completing of the mission. Although Sanderson called it [...] "Glide bombing", it helped develop the later Dive bombing technique.|$|R
5|$|As the {{lifeboats}} {{were brought}} alongside Carpathia, the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, {{and the children were}} hoisted in <b>mail</b> <b>sacks.</b> The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|R
5000|$|According to the National Postal Museum, [...] "V-mail {{ensured that}} {{thousands}} of tons of shipping space could be reserved for war materials. The 37 mail bags required to carry 150,000 one-page letters could be replaced by a single <b>mail</b> <b>sack.</b> The weight of that same amount of mail was reduced dramatically from 2,575 pounds to a mere 45." [...] This saved considerable weight and bulk in a time in which both were hard to manage in a combat zone.|$|E

50|$|A {{mail pouch}} or mailpouch is a {{container}} for mail, designed to transport first-class, registered mail, domestic mail and military mail.

50|$|Mail {{was loaded}} onto the train at Glasgow and also during station stops en route, and from line-side {{collection}} points where local post office staff would hang <b>mail</b> <b>sacks</b> on elevated track-side hooks that were caught by nets deployed by the on-board staff. Sorted mail {{on the train}} could be dropped off at the same time. This process of exchange allowed mail to be distributed locally without delaying the train with unnecessary stops. One of the carriages involved in the robbery is preserved at the Nene Valley Railway.|$|R

During the Christmas rush of 1944 NYPOE handled about 2,600,000 mail bags.|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{security}} seals are manufactured normally in two styles; adjustable or fixed length. Adjustable length seals can fit many applications from securing {{the neck of}} a bag or <b>mail</b> <b>sack</b> to sealing chemical drums, first aid kits and fire extinguishers. They have an adjustable length much like a cable seal but offer a much higher security level and an audit trail due to sequential numbering and the ability on some seals to be bar-coded and have a company name and logo printed or laser etched on.|$|E
5000|$|Riverboarding is {{believed}} to have originated in the late 1970s. It is claimed to have originated in France, where raft guides stuffed a burlap <b>mail</b> <b>sack</b> with life vests and went down rapids. [...] Soon, riders adapted a personal submarine shell for their molds, and the plastic version of the riverboard was born. Sometime in the late 1980s, Robert Carlson began running rivers in California using an ocean bodyboard and ended up making his own board that was bigger and thicker and had handles. In 1986, Ged Hay began taking his body board down the Kawarau River near Queenstown in New Zealand while on his days off as a rafting guide.|$|E

50|$|Any primary POE {{could have}} sub-ports and cargo ports even {{in other cities}} or {{temporarily}} assigned for movements between the United States {{to one of the}} overseas commands it normally served. In World War I port facilities in Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and even in Canada served as sub-ports to the NYPOE. An important special cargo function involved mail in which the POE was required to ensure all <b>mail</b> <b>sacks</b> were properly labeled, met the earliest sailing date and were distributed {{in such a way that}} loss of one ship would not destroy all mail destined for a unit.|$|R
5000|$|Temple sang [...] "The World Owes Me a Living", {{a version}} of which also {{featured}} in a Silly Symphonies animation of The Ant and the Grasshopper in the same year. Louella Parsons was amazed [...] "at {{the ease with which}} Temple reels off her lines, saying big words and expressions. There is nothing parrot-like about Shirley. She knows what she is talking about." [...] Temple-fever spread with the release of the film. Her fan mail (which numbered 400 - 500 letters a day) was delivered in huge <b>mail</b> <b>sacks</b> to the studio and a secretary was hired to manage it (Edwards 66).|$|R
50|$|The Titanics five postal clerks—two British, three American—were {{charged with}} the {{supervision}} and processing of all incoming and outgoing mail on board the ship. On {{the night of the}} disaster, the five postal clerks were celebrating Oscar Woody’s 44th birthday. After the ship hit the iceberg, Jago Smith was sent to report to Captain Smith on the mailrooms conditions, confirming the knowledge that the ship was sinking. The five clerks set themselves to the task of attempting to save the 200 registered <b>mail</b> <b>sacks</b> by hauling them to the upper decks, with little thought of their own safety. All five mail clerks died; only Starr and Woods bodies were recovered.|$|R
