25|$|The university's modern roots can {{be traced}} back to 1901, when Sunderland Technical College was {{established}} as a municipal training college. It was the first to offer sandwich courses.

In 1930, a <b>Mining</b> <b>Department</b> was established and pharmacy students could read for the Bachelor of Pharmacy degree of the University of London.

25|$|In late 2004 {{and early}} 2005, two professors of Rajshahi University got assassinated within three months: Professor Yunus from the Economics {{department}} in December 2004 and Professor Taher from the Geology and <b>Mining</b> <b>department</b> in February 2005. Both murders were suspected {{to be driven}} by political motivations. In 2006, the commander of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh admitted to the RAB interrogators that his operatives carried out the attack on Yunus, as well as the 2004 attack on writer Humayun Azad, the murder of another writer, bomb blasts, and attacks on cinemas. A controversy over the hiring of over 500 new employees broke around the same time; detractors suggested that they were hired illegally, either in return for money or for political reasons. Since the new millennium, much attention has been focused on politics among university teaching staff. Observers have claimed that the teaching staff have been thoroughly polarised according to party lines in national politics. In 2005, Muhammad Asadullah Al-Ghalib of the university was arrested for links with the Ahle Hadith Andolon Bangladesh, but was acquitted in 2008.|$|E
