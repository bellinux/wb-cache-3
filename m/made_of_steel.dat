5|$|Bulker hulls are <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to}} reduce the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions are made of corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement: Since {{the time}} that steel was first used as a {{construction}} material, engineers have attempted to increase strength, reduce weight and produce more economical structures by using elegant member sections. However, the increase in steel strength and the decrease in cross section area are not always useful {{and in some cases}} it is necessary to reduce the strength to allow the structure to behave in a specific manner. This issue is seen in systems designed to withstand lateral loads, such as wind and earthquake loads. Approach: To improve the seismic behavior of braced frames, the V-EBF system with shear panels <b>made</b> <b>of</b> easy-going <b>steel</b> is presented. Using the finite element method, braced frames with shear panels <b>made</b> <b>of</b> easy-going <b>steel</b> were analyzed and compared to the behavior of the same frame with shear panels <b>made</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>steel.</b> The influence <b>of</b> shear panel systems <b>made</b> <b>of</b> easy-going <b>steel</b> is investigated by inserting this system in 4, 8 and 12 -storey frames and analyzing them under earthquake loads. Results: The results indicate that contrary to shear panels <b>made</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>steel</b> no local buckling occurs in shear panels <b>made</b> <b>of</b> easy-going <b>steel</b> and the energy dissipation and ductility are increased considerably. Consequently, frames with shear panels <b>made</b> <b>of</b> easy-going <b>steel</b> exhibit better performance and energy absorption. Conclusion: In this research, it is attempted to improve the behavior of V-EBF frames by using a new type <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> EGS, which has a lower yield stress than construction steel. The study shows that if EGS is used in a shear panel, seismic behavior of these frames improves noticeably...|$|R
5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined {{all-metal}} cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings {{were made of}} Duralumin sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel,</b> concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate {{the look of the}} real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of rapid}} firing {{machine guns and}} long range breech loading {{artillery}} quickly led to camouflaging of vehicles and positions. Artillery pieces were soon painted in contrasting bold colours to obscure their outlines. Another early trend was building observation trees, <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> with bark camouflage. Such trees became popular with the British and French armies in 1916. The observation tree was invented by French painter Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola, who led the French army's camouflage unit, {{the first of its}} kind in any army. He also invented painted canvas netting to hide machine gun positions, and this was quickly taken up for hiding equipment and gun positions from 1917, 7 million square yards being used by the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, {{commodity}} prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel)</b> still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E
