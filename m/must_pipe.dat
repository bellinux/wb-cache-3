Now Mr. Fearing was one that played upon this bass; he and his fellows sound the sackbut, whose notes are more doleful than the notes of other music are; though, indeed, some say the bass is the ground of music. And, for my part, I care not at all for that {{profession}} that begins not in heaviness of mind. The first string that the musician usually touches is the bass, when he intends to put all in tune. God also plays upon this string first, when he sets the soul in tune for Himself. Only here was the imperfection of Mr. Fearing, he could play upon no other music but this, till towards his latter end.[218] ...|$|E

50|$|Caps, usually liquid- or gas-tight, {{cover the}} {{otherwise}} open {{end of a}} pipe. A cap attaches to the exterior of a pipe, and may have a solvent-weld socket end or a female-threaded interior. The exterior of an industrial cap may be round, square, rectangular, U- or I-shaped, or may have a handgrip. If a solvent-weld cap is used to provide for a future connection point, several inches of <b>pipe</b> <b>must</b> be left before the cap; when the cap is cut off for the future connection, enough <b>pipe</b> <b>must</b> remain to allow a new fitting to be glued onto it.|$|R

50|$|After {{manufacture}} of {{all parts of}} a new organ, the <b>pipes</b> <b>must</b> be pre-tuned and voiced to the desired pitch and sound characteristics.

50|$|A {{relatively}} modern drilling technique involves using {{coiled tubing}} instead of conventional drill pipe.

50|$|Running the {{pipeline}} along the existing route would involve a serious environmental impact, {{due to its}} proximity to Dead Run.

5000|$|The {{insulating}} material usually used is polyurethane foam or similar, with a {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} k=0.033-0.024 W/mK (thermal conductivity). Outer casing is usually high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Production of preinsulated pipes for district heating in the European Union is {{regulated by the}} standard EN253. According to EN253:2003, <b>pipes</b> <b>must</b> be produced to work at constant temperature of [...] for 30 years, keeping thermal conductivity {{less than or equal to}} 0.033 W/mK. There are three insulation thickness levels.|$|R
40|$|To {{properly}} {{design a}} pipe heating system, {{the basic principles}} of heat transfer from an insulated <b>pipe</b> <b>must</b> be understood. The three methods of heat flow are conduction, convection (both forced and natural) and radiation. The total heat loss from a <b>pipe</b> <b>must</b> be determined first, since this is the heat which must be replaced to maintain a pipe at a given temperature. A steam heating system requires an analysis of the heat loss from the pipe as well as an analysis of the capacity of the heating system. The economics of steam heat include the accessories as well as the inefficiencies of steam heat. The design of an electric heating system normally involves far fewer components and engineering complexities than does a comparable steam system. The basic system is comprised of the heater, controls and connection accessories. Today there are several economic trade-offs to be made in selecting a pipe heating system. These involve engineering and design costs, maintenance costs, installation costs and energy costs. The economic trade-offs to be made in selecting a pipe heating system do not universally favor one system over another for all cases...|$|R

To this end the permeability (real or equivalent) of the <b>pipe</b> <b>must</b> be selected properly. As we shall see, more constraints may have to be imposed, if for instance the flow in the pipe is required to be laminar.|$|R

50|$|A {{gas network}} {{is in the}} steady state when the values of gas flow {{characteristics}} are independent of time and system described by the set of nonlinear equations. The goal of simple simulation of a gas network is usually that of computing the values of nodes' pressures, loads and the values of flows in the individual pipes.
