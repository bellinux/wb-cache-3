Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> domino set made of card stock like that for playing cards. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.|$|E
25|$|Government, {{bankruptcy}} and general auctions are amongst {{the most common}} auctions to be found today. A government auction is simply an auction held {{on behalf of a}} government body generally at a general sale. Here one <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> vast range of materials that have to be sold by various government bodies, for example: HM Customs & Excise, the Official Receiver, the Ministry of Defence, local councils and authorities, liquidators, as well as material put up for auction by companies and members of the public. Also in this group you will find auctions ordered by executors who are entering the assets of individuals who have perhaps died in testate (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. One of the most interesting bodies to look out for at auction is HM Customs & Excise who may be entering at auction various items seized from smugglers, fraudsters and racketeers.|$|E
25|$|For every {{feasible}} set S in the antimatroid, {{and every}} element x of S, one <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> path subset of S for which x is an endpoint: to do so, remove {{one at a}} time elements other than x until no such removal leaves a feasible subset. Therefore, each feasible set in an antimatroid is the union of its path subsets. If S is not a path, each subset in this union is a proper subset of S. But, if S is itself a path with endpoint x, each proper subset of S that belongs to the antimatroid excludes x. Therefore, the paths of an antimatroid are exactly the sets that do not equal the unions of their proper subsets in the antimatroid. Equivalently, a given family of sets P forms the set of paths of an antimatroid if and only if, for each S in P, the union of subsets of S in P has one fewer element than S itself. If so, F itself is the family of unions of subsets of P.|$|E

500|$|A {{system of}} public parks was {{developed}} in Missoula in 1902 with the donation by lumber baron Thomas Greenough and his wife Tessie. They gave a [...] tract of land along Rattlesnake Creek for Greenough Park, {{on the condition that}} [...] "the land forever be used as a park and for park purposes to which the people of Missoula <b>may</b> ... <b>find</b> <b>a</b> comfortable, romantic and poetic retreat". In a follow-up nine years later {{in a letter to the}} Missoulian, he stressed his interest in having the park remain in as close to a native state as possible. That request, along with the discovery that non-native Norway maples were inhibiting the growth of native trees and shrubs such as cottonwoods, ponderosa pines and Rocky Mountain maples, led to the controversial decision to remove Norway maples from the park with the hope of returning it to its natural state.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, a {{moderate}} tropical storm developed 200 miles (323km) east of Sint Maarten. Operationally, {{the system was}} treated as an easterly wave until it moved through the Bahamas. It is believed that the system originated near the Cape Verde islands. On August 24, the tropical storm passed north of the Leeward Islands and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then strengthened to a minimal hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds on August 25. Subsequently, it strengthened rapidly, and the cyclone was noted as [...] "well developed" [...] when it passed near Nassau with 115mph (185km/h) winds {{on the morning of}} August 26. At the time, it was the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm strengthened further over the Gulf Stream, and it moved ashore over the city of West Palm Beach as a strong Category 4 hurricane around 7:20 p.m. EDT. The city's airport reported calm conditions from 7:20–7:40 p.m., and the minimum central pressure of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg) was measured at the site. Peak gusts were recorded at 125mph (205km/h) before the anemometer blew away. A maximum sustained wind of 153mph (246km/h) was reported from the Jupiter Inlet Light station prior to the loss of the anemometer; although conditions were slightly more severe after the reading, reliable estimates are unavailable. The Atlantic hurricane database lists the cyclone as a strong Category 4 hurricane at landfall. The wind reading is the basis for the Category 4 designation in the Atlantic hurricane database, although a reduction from the anemometer's elevated location lends credence to the concept of a weaker system. Originally, the system was designated as a Category 3 hurricane in the state of Florida, based on the minimum central pressure reading of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg); this pressure corresponds to the original classification of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. However, modern analysis applies Saffir-Simpson rankings based on maximum sustained wind speeds. The 1949 Florida hurricane will be eventually reanalyzed by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, which <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> weaker hurricane in Florida. The central pressure of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg) is unusually high for a strong Category 4 hurricane; the reanalysis project has discovered that hurricanes erroneously featured stronger winds than the typical pressure/wind relationship in the 1940s–1960s, unlike subsequent hurricanes in the 1970s–1980s. The evidence suggests wind speeds may have been overestimated for hurricanes in the 1940s–1960s.|$|E

2500|$|In hip hop, {{since the}} {{beginning}} of MCing, there have been producers who work in the studio, behind the scenes, to create the beats for MCs to rap over. Producers <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> beat they like on an old funk, soul or disco record, and then isolate the beat {{and turn it into a}} loop. Alternatively, producers may create a beat with a drum machine or by hiring a drumkit percussionist to play acoustic drums. The producer could even mix and layer different methods, such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live, newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player. A beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat, such as a sampled bassline from a funk or disco song, dialogue from a spoken word record or movie, or rhythmic [...] "scratching" [...] and [...] "punches" [...] done by a turntablist or DJ.|$|E

2500|$|... {{observed}} that the separator theorem {{may be used to}} obtain polynomial time approximation schemes for NP-hard optimization problems on planar graphs such as finding the maximum independent set. Specifically, by truncating a separator hierarchy at an appropriate level, one <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> separator of size O(n/√lognbsp&n) the removal of which partitions the graph into subgraphs of size cnbsp&lognbsp&n, for any constant c. By the four-color theorem, there exists an independent set of size at least n/4, so the removed nodes form a negligible fraction of the maximum independent set, and the maximum independent sets in the remaining subgraphs can be found independently in time exponential in their size. By combining this approach with later linear-time methods for separator hierarchy construction and with table lookup to share the computation of independent sets between isomorphic subgraphs, it can be made to construct independent sets of size within a factor of 1nbsp&minus&nbsp&O(1/√lognbsp&n) of optimal, in linear time. However, for approximation ratios even closer to 1 than this factor, a later approach of [...] (based on tree-decomposition but not on planar separators) provides better tradeoffs of time versus approximation quality.|$|E
