40|$|Abstract. Using {{previously}} published data from flume studies, we test {{a new approach}} for quantifying the effects of sediment supply (i. e., bed material supply) on surface grain size of equilibrium gravel channels. Textural response to sediment supply is evaluated relative to a theoretical prediction of competent <b>median</b> grain <b>size</b> (D� 50). We find that surface <b>median</b> grain <b>size</b> (D 50) varies inversely with sediment supply rate and systematically approaches the competent value (D� 50) at low equilibrium transport rates. Furthermore, equilibrium transport rate is a power function {{of the difference between}} applied and critical shear stresses and is therefore a power function of the difference between competent and observed <b>median</b> grain <b>sizes</b> (D� 50 and D 50). Consequently, we propose that the difference between predicted and observed <b>median</b> grain <b>sizes</b> can be used to determine sediment supply rate in equilibrium channels. Our analysis framework collapses data from different studies toward a single relationship between sediment supply rate and surface grain size. While the approach appears promising, we caution that it has been tested only on a limited set of laboratory data and a narrow range of channel conditions. 1...|$|R
