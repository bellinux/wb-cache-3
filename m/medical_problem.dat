Espejo used the {{opportunity}} to write his most complete and best-written work, Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox), denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so {{in the aftermath of}} a serious <b>medical</b> <b>problem.</b> They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1917, Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) of the Desert Mounted Corps, {{while still}} {{retaining}} {{the post of}} ADMS AIF Egypt. He was therefore answerable to three superiors—to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{the commander of the}} Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt; to Major General Neville Howse, the DMS AIF in London; and to the new British DMS EEF, Major General William Travers Swan. As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major <b>medical</b> <b>problem</b> remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and prophylactic efforts were required in order to bring it under control.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} the population is medically compromised. Dental and medical staff need to communicate and cooperate to afford these patients the best possible health care. In this study, the attitude towards and awareness of <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> were examined in final-year predoctoral (undergraduate) dental and in final-year medical students. The results revealed that most dental students felt their knowledge of and training in <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> in dentistry to be moderate to good. In contrast, most medical students thought both their knowledge and training in <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> in dentistry to be only poor to moderate. Dental students rated the importance of <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> in dentistry higher than did medical students...|$|R

25|$|Unintentional {{weight loss}} {{may result from}} loss of body fats, loss of body fluids, muscle atrophy, or even a {{combination}} of these. It is generally regarded as a <b>medical</b> <b>problem</b> when at least 10% of a person's body weight has been lost in six months or 5% in the last month. Another criterion used for assessing weight that is too low is the body mass index (BMI). However, even lesser amounts of weight loss can be a cause for serious concern in a frail elderly person.|$|E

25|$|Head lice (especially in children) have been, {{and still}} are, subject to various {{eradication}} campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice {{are not the}} vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, {{and they have been}} regarded by some as essentially a cosmetic rather than a <b>medical</b> <b>problem.</b> Head lice infestations might be beneficial in helping to foster a natural immune response against lice which helps humans in defense against the far more dangerous body louse, which is capable of transmission of dangerous diseases.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence). Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a symptom of a greater <b>medical</b> <b>problem</b> in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E
25|$|Filing a claim {{with the}} Court of Federal Claims {{requires}} a $250 filing fee, {{which can be}} waived for those unable to pay. Medical records such as prenatal, birth, pre-vaccination, vaccination, and post-vaccination records are strongly suggested, as medical review and claim processing may be delayed without them. Because this is a legal process most people use a lawyer, though this is not required. By 1999 the average claim took two years to resolve, and 42% of resolved claims were awarded compensation, as compared with 23% for medical malpractice claims through the tort system. There is a three-year statute of limitations for filing a claim, timed from the first manifestation of the <b>medical</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

25|$|Newson {{had worked}} for London Underground since 1969 and the {{post-mortem}} examination {{did not find any}} evidence of a <b>medical</b> <b>problem,</b> such as a stroke or heart attack, that could have incapacitated him. There was some doubt as to whether he had consumed alcohol. Testing for this was hampered by the four-and-a-half days it took to retrieve his body from the wreckage. Analysis showed that his blood alcohol level, {{at the time of the}} post-mortem, was 80mg/100ml, but it was not possible to reach a definite conclusion as to whether this was the result of consumption of alcohol or a product of the process of decomposition. 80mg/100ml is the current English legal limit for driving a car (the limit at the time of the accident was higher), and the medical experts disagreed with each other on whether any amount consumed would have affected his ability to drive the train. Medical evidence to the official inquiry raised the possibility that the driver had been affected by a condition such as transient global amnesia, or akinesis with mutism, where the brain continues to function and the individual remains aware, although not being able to move physically, but it was stated that there was no evidence to indicate either condition: to positively diagnose akinesis with mutism would depend on a microscopic examination of the brain, which was not possible owing to decomposition, and transient global amnesia would leave no traces at post-mortem in any case.|$|E

500|$|There is {{significant}} {{debate over whether}} or not asexuality is a sexual orientation. It has been compared and equated with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone; HSDD has been used to medicalize asexuality, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a sexual dysfunction (such as anorgasmia, anhedonia, etc.), because it does not necessarily define someone as having a <b>medical</b> <b>problem</b> or problems relating to others socially. Unlike people with HSDD, asexual people normally do not experience [...] "marked distress" [...] and [...] "interpersonal difficulty" [...] concerning feelings about their sexuality, or generally a lack of sexual arousal; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic. One study found that, compared to HSDD subjects, asexuals reported lower levels of sexual desire, sexual experience, sex-related distress and depressive symptoms. Researchers Richards and Barker report that asexuals do not have disproportionate rates of alexithymia, depression, or personality disorders. Some people, however, may identify as asexual even if their non-sexual state is explained by {{one or more of the}} aforementioned disorders.|$|E

40|$|Performing Arts Medicine has {{developed}} into a highly specialised field {{over the past three}} decades. The Performing Arts Medical Association (PAMA) has been the leading proponent of this unique and innovative field with ground-breaking research studies, symposia, conferences and journals dedicated specifically to the <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> of performing artists. Similar to sports medicine, performing arts medicine caters specifically for the <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> of performing artists including musicians and dancers. In South Africa there is a tremendous lack of knowledge of the field and unlike our international counterparts, we do not have specialised clinical settings that cater for the <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> of performing artists. There is also a tremendous lack of research on performance-related <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> of performing artists in South Africa. Accordingly {{the purpose of this paper}} is to present an overview of the field of performing arts medicine, highlight some of the significant findings from recent research studies and present a model for conducting research into the field of performing arts medicine. It is hoped that this research model will lead to increased research on the <b>medical</b> <b>problems</b> of performing artists in South Africa...|$|R

500|$|Feldman {{noted that}} the advent of online support groups, {{combined}} with access to vast stores of medical information, enabled [...] individuals seeking to gain sympathy by relating a series of harrowing medical or psychological problems that defy comprehension to misuse the groups. Communication forums specializing in medical or psychological recovery were established to give lay users support in navigating often confusing and frustrating medical processes and bureaucracy. Communities often formed on those forums, {{with the goal of}} sharing information to help other members. Medical websites also became common, giving lay users access to literature {{in a way that was}} accessible to those without specific medical training. As Internet communication grew in popularity, users began to forgo the doctors and hospitals often consulted for medical advice. Frequenting virtual communities that have experience with a <b>medical</b> <b>problem,</b> Feldman notes, is easier than going through the physical pain or illness that would be necessary before visiting a doctor to get the attention sought. By pretending to be gravely ill, Internet users can gain sympathy from a group whose sole reason for existence is support. [...] Health care professionals, with their limited time, greater medical knowledge, and tendency to be more skeptical in their diagnoses, may be less likely to provide that support.|$|E
