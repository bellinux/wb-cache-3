5|$|As {{with almost}} all sexually {{transmitted}} infections, women are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> acquiring genital HSV-2 than men. On an annual basis, {{without the use}} of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is about 8–11%.|$|E
5|$|Glass fibers {{are useful}} thermal {{insulators}} {{because of their}} high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(m·K).|$|E

40|$|Phototherapy {{is largely}} {{used in the}} {{management}} of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, but its safety is very far from being proved. The Authors studied the effectiveness of daylight in low-birth-weight newborns. The results obtained show that the reduction of bilirubin induced by phototherapy is related with gestational age and intra-uterine growth. The very low-birth-weight infants, at higher risk of kernicterus, as they are more responsives to phototherapy, as well they are, probably, <b>more</b> <b>susceptibles</b> <b>to</b> side-effects. The Authors think that phototherapy should be planned on the basis of such observations...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> TB infections. The most {{important}} risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E
5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> opportunistic infections.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting {{a cause of}} action resulting in failure {{to return to the}} hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the susceptibility of 312 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates {{with that of}} 1, 216 ESBL nonproducers.

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} {{burned through}} the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> insect infestations and disease.|$|E
50|$|These {{health effects}} are more {{damaging}} {{in those with}} preexisting heart disease, asthma, or other lung problems. Children are also <b>more</b> <b>susceptible,</b> due <b>to</b> their faster breathing rate {{and the fact that}} their respratory system is still developing. Idling pollutants also disproportionately affect the elderly, who have limited physiological reserve to compensate for the adverse effects of the pollutants.|$|R

5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> the further oxidative stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5000|$|Gender: Women are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> {{than men}} <b>to</b> virtual reality sickness.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative uropathogens isolated from pregnant women. Methods: We performed a snapshot cohort study of women receiving {{care in the}} University of Florida prenatal clinics during March 2000. Subjects with asymptomatic bacteriuria or cystitis were identified and the antimicrobial susceptibility of each pathogen was recorded. Data were analyzed using chi-square, Fisher’s exact test and ninety-five percent confidence intervals, as appropriate. Results: Ninety-five positive cultures were identified. Isolates were <b>more</b> often <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (87 %) and nitrofurantoin (89 %) than to ampicillin (72 %) (p < 0. 03). Escherichia coli accounted for 71 (75 %) cases and was <b>more</b> often <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> nitrofurantoin (100 %) than to TMP-SMX (87 %) (p < 0. 01). Proteus isolates were all <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMX and resistant to nitrofurantoin (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Both TMP-SMX and nitrofurantoin are superior to ampicillin for empiric treatment of lower urinary tract infection in pregnant women. Nitrofurantoin is superior to TMP-SMX for treatment of infections caused by E. coli. For suspected or confirmed cases caused by Proteus organisms, TMP-SMX is the preferred agent...|$|R

5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> the disease.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> disease. Exhibition standards {{had led to}} selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
