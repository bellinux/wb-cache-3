Experiments have been carried out in order to investigate the effects of input parameters such as dielectric conductivity, pulse width, time between pulses, maximum feed rate, servo control mean reference voltage, short pulse time, wire feed rate, wire mechanical tension and dielectric injection pressure on performance <b>measures</b> like <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and material removal rate. The optimal setting of parameters has been determined through experiments planned, conducted and analyzed using Taguchi method.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{fuzzy logic}} {{integrated}} with the Taguchi method is used to optimize Wire Electro Discharge Machining (WEDM) process with multiple quality characteristics. Rough machining with EDM gives poor surface finish and has micro cracks and pores. Finish machining gives better surface finish but with very poor machining speed (MRR). <b>Spark</b> <b>gap</b> width {{is one of the}} important performance <b>measures</b> in WEDM. <b>Spark</b> <b>gap</b> width is the measure of the amount of the material that is wasted during machining. It determines the dimensional accuracy of the finishing part. In setting the machining parameters, the main goal is the maximum MRR with the minimum surface roughness and minimum <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> width. Hence achieving higher MRR along with lower SR and SG can be considered as a multi-objective optimization problem. This paper discusses the application of the Taguchi method with fuzzy logic to optimize the machining parameters for Wire electrical discharge machining of Inconel 825 with multiple characteristics. A multi-response performance index (MRPI) was used for optimization. The machining parameters viz., pulse on time, pulse off time, corner servo voltage, flushing pressure, wire feed, wire tension, <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> voltage, servo feed were optimized with consideration of multiple performance characteristics. The results from confirmation runs indicated that the determined optimal combination of machining parameters improved the performance of the machining process...|$|R
40|$|Series {{capacitors}} offer considerable {{technical and}} economical advantages in long distance a. c. transmission. In particular, their excellent reliability and minimal maintenance requirements make series compensation the most cost effective method of enhancing the power transfer capability {{of an existing}} or proposed interconnection. E. H. V. lines employing series capacitors however, pose difficult problems for the line protection relays, not encountered with plain feeders. One important cause of these problems is the resonance between the series capacitor and the line series inductance, which in turn imposes a sub-synchronous oscillation on the system signals. Also, the rapid changes in the circuit parameters, resulting from {{the operation of the}} capacitor protection equipment, namely the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps,</b> introduce some difficulties for the line protection schemes, especially an impedance <b>measuring</b> relay. These <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are installed in parallel with the series capacitors to prevent the development of very high voltages across the capacitor which could cause excessive damage to the equipment. The work presented herein describes a new digital distance relay suitable for series compensated line applications. The errors in the impedance measurement for a phase to earth fault when the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> do not flash over, are discussed and new methods are proposed to compensate for these errors. The new concept of a complex residual compensation factor, as opposed to a real one, is also discussed. A new adaptive filtering is incorporated in the relay in order to minimise the detrimental effect of the subsynchronous oscillation on the relay decision logic. Finally, the relay is thoroughly tested for many different system configurations, to fully evaluate the relay response...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} construction uses two capacitors connected as a Blumlein generator. Two capacitors {{are connected}} {{so that one}} plate is a common earth, the others are each connected to the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> electrodes. These capacitors are often constructed from a single layer of printed circuit board, or similar stack of copper foil and thin dielectric. The capacitors are linked through an inductor, a simple air-spaced coil. One capacitor also has a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> across it. When HT is applied, the two capacitors are charged slowly, effectively linked by the inductor. When the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> reaches its triggering voltage, it discharges and quickly reduces that capacitor's voltage to zero. As the discharge is rapid, the inductor acts as an open circuit and so the voltage difference across the transverse <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> (between the two capacitors) rises rapidly until the main <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> discharges, firing the laser.|$|R

The minimum temperature at which the DMSO vapors that are in equilibrium with liquid DMSO has been determined using two types of strong ignition sources. This temperature is 172 F for chemical igniters, and 178 F for spark ignition. Numerous tests have been conducted using controlled intensity sparks to define {{the shape of the}} minimum ignition energy curve as a function of temperature. The ignition energies spanned four orders of magnitude (approximately from 20, 000 to 2 mJ) while the DMSO vapor mixture temperature varied from 185 to 207 F. The Sandia Generator was used to simulate worst case electrostatic sparks that can be produced by the human body. Although it was not designed for air discharges, this device had been used by LLNL for 1 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and the resultant spark energy had been measured to fall within the range from 3. 2 to 8. 8 mJ.

50|$|Smaller <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{are often}} used to protect {{sensitive}} electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from lead wire to lead wire across the gap left by the sawing process.
