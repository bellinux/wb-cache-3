60|$|But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{listening}} {{with growing}} impatience, her puzzled glances giving place gradually to flashes of anger; {{and now she}} turned her face full upon him, her question written plainly thereon, demanding answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>MY</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> living she wouldn't {{have let}} Adam be killed," [...] said Faith. [...] "For that matter, father wouldn't have either, if he'd been home and known of it. I'm SURE he wouldn't, Miss West." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Laura,' said Philip, with a smile, 'I am equally {{far from}} {{guessing}} what I should do if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> anything {{but what she}} was, as from guessing what I should do if I had a talent for music.' ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Oh, no; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{so good to}} me. No {{one ever}} <b>had</b> such a <b>mother</b> as I <b>have</b> had.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since that I have {{suffered}} a great deal," [...] said Lucius. [...] "Of course you know that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> staying at The Cleeve?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} it--I did {{not read the}} newspapers. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dead a long time. I should not have {{answered}} this if I had seen it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I swear {{you shall}} tell me. It {{was such a}} cruel thing to answer me as you did, unless you meant it. And yet you never saw me again till after <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> over for you to Mrs. Crawley's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were {{to enter}} {{a room full of}} people," [...] said the fishy-eyed young man, [...] "and tell them that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> run over by an omnibus, they would think it the funniest story they had heard in years." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thank God, that {{faithful}} love helped me, and I {{sat down}} again without saying a word. SHE knew what I had suffered and what I had suppressed. She ran round to me, with the tears streaming from her eyes. [...] "Oh, Marian!" [...] she whispered softly. [...] "If <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> alive, she could have done no more for me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{the news}} that has reached me true," [...] he asked him, [...] "that the princess, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> grossly insulted by this foul rabble, and that the archbishop, treasurer, and others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> murdered?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{own that}} we were wrong,' said she. 'But I have {{suffered}} for it. I am very poor now, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dead these twelve months [...] . But won't you come in, Mr. Stockdale?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "S'nore, si--though <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> a French woman, {{they tell}} me that I have caught a little from her. We all get {{something}} from our mothers, eccellenza; and it's a pity we could not keep more of it." ...|$|R
60|$|My poor dear mother, I suppose, {{had some}} {{momentary}} intention of committing an {{assault and battery}} upon my aunt, who could easily have settled her with one hand, even if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed with the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very meekly, and fainted.|$|E
60|$|To my mind {{there was}} no reason why I should be treated as one so far beneath the family. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a gentlewoman and my father a gentleman, and I was {{conceited}} enough to think that by both breeding and education I was fully the equal of my cousins. Besides, my father had been well-to-do, and had, no doubt, left me a fair inheritance.|$|E
6000|$|The parting with Thora, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sad, for {{her heart}} foreboded ill of this war, {{and her face}} could not hide what her heart told her. Indeed, she wept bitterly, and cursed the name of Iduna the Fair, who had brought this trouble on her House. Freydisa was sad also. Yet, {{watching}} her opportunity, she glided up to me just before I embarked and whispered to me, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I can {{say what}} I mean, now," [...] said Mirah, who had not heard the {{intermediate}} talk. [...] "When the best thing comes into our thoughts, it <b>is</b> like what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to me. She <b>has</b> <b>been</b> just as really with me as {{all the other people}} about me--often more really with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going?" [...] {{a whisper}} said. [...] "Why are you going?" [...] And Eveleth had {{me by the}} hand and was drawing me gently into the dim drawing-room that opened from the place. [...] "I don't know all <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> saying to you. I had to let her say something; she thought she ought. I knew you would know how to excuse it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see your}} drift, Gil. You {{want to be}} a comfort to me, but I've been digging down into my memory, and I know now that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> trained into these habits, these delusions, for over twenty years. It won't be an easy thing {{to get her out of}} them. She is as much deceived as the rest. I am sure of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Every devoted son {{who reads}} this line will shiver as I shivered. That warning came like a {{wind from the}} dark spaces of a bleak, uncharted deep. It changed my world. For twenty years <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> my chief care. My daily thought ran to her. Only when deeply absorbed in my work had she been absent from my {{conscious}} mind. For her I had planned, for her I had saved, for her I had built, and now----! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't do {{anything}} of the sort, Evan," [...] the cripple lad answered hotly. [...] "Holl's my name, and you don't suppose I am going to drop {{the name of the}} father and mother who brought me up, and have tended me all these years, for Bayley or any other name; besides, even if it should turn out that I am remotely connected with the family, there is no reason why my name should be Bayley, for, of course, if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a Bayley, she would have changed her name when she married." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes {{she would}} muse upon the past, rubbing {{together}} her poor rough hands--they never got softened--one over the other. She told me much I {{had not heard}} before about my father, and her own early life. It was like finding flat and faded flowers in a book still faintly sweet, to realize that once <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> loved with passion; that my remote father had once shed hot tears of tenderness in her arms. And she would sometimes even speak tentatively in those narrow, old-world phrases that her lips could rob of all their bitter narrowness, of Nettie.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{knew the}} risk!' said Arthur, {{in a low}} voice; 'but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> once <b>been</b> good to him, and he dared {{everything}} for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} of this row about Joseph Mason and <b>my</b> <b>mother?</b> It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so talked of that I fear you must have heard it." ...|$|R
60|$|After I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> married {{about four}} years, {{my own father}} died, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> dead before. He liked my match so ill, and saw so little room to be {{satisfied}} with the conduct of my husband, that though he left me five thousand livres, and more, at his death, yet he left it in the hands of my elder brother, who, running on too rashly in his adventures as a merchant, failed, and lost not only what he had, but what he had for me too, as you shall hear presently.|$|R
60|$|I {{was sick}} for days afterward, and I needed {{none of my}} mother's {{injunctions}} to avoid John Barleycorn in the future. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dreadfully shocked. She held that I had done wrong, very wrong, and that I had gone contrary to all her teaching. And how was I, who was never allowed to talk back, who lacked the very words with which to express my psychology--how was I to tell my mother {{that it was her}} teaching that was directly responsible for my drunkenness? Had it not been for her theories about dark eyes and Italian character, I should never have wet my lips with the sour, bitter wine. And not until man-grown did I tell her the true inwardness of that disgraceful affair.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in a tremble {{ever since}} the first rumour of the {{preliminaries}} came to our ears, for {{she knew that he}} might come as soon as his message. She said little, but she saddened my life by insisting that I should be for ever clean and tidy. With every rumble of wheels, too, her eyes would glance towards the door, and her hands steal up to smooth her pretty black hair. She had embroidered a white [...] "Welcome" [...] upon a blue ground, with an anchor in red upon each side, and a border of laurel leaves; and this was to hang upon the two lilac bushes which flanked the cottage door. He could not have left the Mediterranean before we had this finished, and every morning she looked to see if it were in its place and ready to be hanged.|$|E
60|$|I was a Harbury boy as {{my father}} and {{grandfather}} were before me and as you are presently to be. I went to Harbury {{at the age of}} fourteen. Until then I was educated at home, first by a governess and then by my father's curate, Mr. Siddons, who went from us to St. Philip's in Hampstead, and, succeeding marvellously there, is now Bishop of Exminster. My father became rector of Burnmore when I was nine; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dead four years, and my second cousin, Jane Stratton, was already his housekeeper. My father held the living until his resignation when I was nearly thirty. So that all the most impressionable years of my life centre upon the Burnmore rectory and the easy spaciousness of Burnmore Park. My boyhood and adolescence alternated between the ivied red-brick and ancient traditions of Harbury (and afterwards Christ-church) and that still untroubled countryside.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} that. There is an {{old saying}} that you {{need not be a}} horse because you were born in a stable. Nor do I quite know that I was born in Italy, though I feel sure of it. Of my father I have never known anything,--except that he was {{certainly}} a bad husband to <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> There are circumstances which do make me almost sure that I was born in Italy; but as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> unwilling to talk to me of my earliest days, I have never chosen to ask her. Now I shall perhaps know it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unhappy if I {{had stayed}} away. It is the leaving the poor child that grieves me. She is in a fearful state, between sore throat, starvation, and blows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bartol {{suggests}} that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hypnotized by Pettus {{and made to}} work his will, and I think he's right. He thinks the whole thing comes down to illusion--to hypnotic control and telepathy." ...|$|R
60|$|But I was not destined {{never to}} see him again. My father's new-born {{interest}} in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit. Father was not a sociologist. His marriage with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> very happy, and in the researches of his own science, physics, he had been very happy. But when mother died, his own work could not fill the emptiness. At first, in a mild way, he had dabbled in philosophy; then, becoming interested, he had drifted on into economics and sociology. He had {{a strong sense of}} justice, and he soon became fired with a passion to redress wrong. It was with gratitude that I hailed these signs of a new interest in life, though I little dreamed what the outcome would be. With the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new pursuits, regardless of whither they led him.|$|E
60|$|My {{own case}} with my mother, however, does not awaken the same regret I feel when I {{think of how}} she misjudged and irked my father, and turned his {{weaknesses}} into thorns for her own tormenting. I wish I could look back without that little twinge to two people who were both in their different quality so good. But goodness that is narrow is a pedestrian and ineffectual goodness. Her attitude to my father seems to me one of the essentially tragic things {{that have come to}} me personally, {{one of those things that}} nothing can transfigure, that REMAIN sorrowful, that I cannot soothe with any explanation, for as I remember him he was indeed the most lovable of weak spasmodic men. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trained in a hard and narrow system that made evil out of many things not in the least evil, and inculcated neither kindliness nor charity. All their estrangement followed from that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He was {{the grandest}} gentleman I ever saw, and had such, a manner,' said the mother, passing over the latter suggestion. 'Anyway, I never thought {{what it all}} meant--all alone with the {{children}} as I was--till I found people looking at me, and laughing at me, and then I heard Lady de Lyonnais and Mr. Egremont were coming down, very angry, to send me away. I ought, I know it now, to have waited, for they would have written to my aunt. But I was horribly frightened, and I couldn't bear to think of never seeing him again, and he came and comforted me, {{and said he would}} take me to Mrs. Houghton, the kind lady who was staying in the Ninon, and they would make it all square for me--and then--oh! it was very sweet--but I never knew that we were sailing away to Jersey to be married! I knew it was very dreadful without any one's leave, but it was so noble of him to take the poor little governess and defend her, and it wasn't as if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> alive. I didn't know Aunt Ursel then as I did afterwards. And Mrs. Houghton said {{there was nothing else to}} be done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was to explain poor Frank's conduct at the races. Perhaps, as the {{servants}} at Revelrig {{had no knowledge of}} you, it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> returned, and <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> letter <b>have</b> <b>been</b> left untouched. I will see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Mrs. Light {{is a great}} gossip, Mordaunt, {{and it may be}} {{questioned}} if she know her own meaning half the time. All the Bayards we know are the family at the Hickories; and with them, you <b>have</b> doubtless heard, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> long <b>been</b> intimate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lots of <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the navy.” Lady Agatha {{perceived}} vaguely and good-naturedly {{that she}} had said something the odd Americans thought odd and that she must justify herself. Something most unnatural was happening to her standard of oddity.|$|R
