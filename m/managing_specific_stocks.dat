40|$|During 2002, {{resistance}} board weirs {{were used}} to record escapement information from Chinook Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and summer chum O. keta salmon in three tributaries within the Koyukuk River drainage, Alaska: Gisasa River; Kateel River; and Henshaw Creek. Annual escapement counts were 2, 025 Chinook and 33, 481 chum salmon for Gisasa River, 73 Chinook and 2, 853 chum salmon for Kateel River, and 649 Chinook and 25, 249 chum salmon for Henshaw Creek. Additional biological information was collected on age, sex, and length of each spawning population. Passage information was also recorded for longnose sucker Catostomus catostomus, northern pike Esox lucius, Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus, and whitefish (Coregoninae). Chinook and summer chum salmon escapement counts from these three tributaries assist fisheries managers in making in-season decisions during the Yukon River commercial and subsistence fishing season, provide post-season evaluation of various management practices, and assist in developing future run projections. Due {{to the complexity of}} the mixedstock Yukon River fishery and the difficulty in <b>managing</b> <b>specific</b> <b>stocks,</b> it is essential to continue collecting information from individual salmon populations, including stocks from the Koyukuk River drainage. It is recommended that the Gisasa River (lower Koyukuk River) and Henshaw Creek projects (upper Koyukuk River) be continued for the long term, so population trends can be analyzed over an extended time-series. Tributary streams containing small salmon stocks, like the Kateel River, should be monitored on a periodic basis...|$|E
