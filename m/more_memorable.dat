5|$|In the 1995–96 season UConn ended Tennessee's home court {{winning streak}} at Thompson Boling Arena in Knoxville. Tennessee avenged {{itself in the}} Final Four that year in Charlotte, {{defeating}} UConn 88–83 in overtime; the game is often thought {{to be one of}} the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> tournament games in tournament history with many back and forth swings of momentum.|$|E
5|$|Micheline Connery, Sean's wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a {{hotel in}} London and {{suggested}} her to Connery, which he agreed upon. For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter might make him <b>more</b> <b>memorable.</b> Others cast included comedian Rowan Atkinson, who would later parody Bond in his role of Johnny English.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> as a character.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} by Ron Hauge, {{directed}} by Bob Anderson, and guest starred Alex Trebek as himself. Hauge was inspired to write the episode after learning of an orphanage that had been ripped off. The episode was selected, among other Christmas themed episodes of the series, on an 2005 Christmas special boxed set on DVD. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide criticized the episode as a rehash of older themes, {{but it was also}} described as one of The Simpsons’ <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> episodes in a review of the 2005 DVD boxed set release.|$|E
5|$|Mario Bros. {{was only}} {{modestly}} successful in Japanese arcades. The arcade cabinets have since become mildly rare. To date in Japan, the NES version of Mario Bros. {{has sold more}} than 1.63 million copies, and the Famicom Mini re-release of the NES version {{has sold more than}} 90,000 copies. Despite being released during the North American video game crash of 1983, the arcade game (as well as the industry) was not affected. Video game author Dave Ellis considers it one of the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> classic games.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

50|$|Two {{historical}} {{aspects of}} these logographically arranged Japanese jikeibiki dictionaries are {{reducing the number}} of radicals and semantically ordering them. The radical systems ranged from 542 (the Yupian), 534, 160, 120, down to 100. Both the Shinsen Jikyō and Jikyōshū refined logographic categorization with bunruitai-type arrangements. While Chinese dictionaries have occasional examples of semantically ordered radicals (for instance, Kangxi radicals 38 and 39 are Woman and Child), Japanese lexicography restructured radicals into <b>more</b> easily <b>memorable</b> sequences.|$|R

50|$|Various {{findings}} {{have shown that}} events such as hospitalization {{and the birth of}} a sibling are correlated with an earlier offset of childhood amnesia, which may be because they were <b>more</b> emotionally <b>memorable.</b> However, other seemingly emotional memories such as the death of a family member or having to move do not affect offset, possibly because the events were not as meaningful to the child. Some memories are therefore available from earlier in childhood than others, which has led to the conclusion that very emotional events can be encoded and recalled earlier than non-emotional events.|$|R
25|$|One of the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> {{moments of}} 2015 from Murphy was his touch to Ryan McHugh for Donegal's second {{goal in their}} Championship victory over Galway at Croke Park. It was {{considered}} {{one of the goals of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|In late 2003, Zimbabwe toured Australia in a two-match series. The {{series was}} <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> for Australian opener Matthew Hayden's innings {{in the first}} Test– in which he overcame a back strain to score a then record 380 runs– than for the Zimbabwean performance.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the game, coach Lombardi {{was carried}} off the field by his victorious Packers in one of the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> images of early Super Bowl history. It would in fact be Lombardi's last game as Packer coach and his ninth {{consecutive}} playoff victory.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not only}} on the dreams of sleep, so easily {{forgotten}} as they are, that the savage pondered, in his early speculations about the life and the soul.

500|$|Nigel Kneale {{conceived}} {{the character of}} Quatermass in 1953, when he was assigned {{in his capacity as}} a BBC television staff drama writer to create a new six-part serial to run on Saturday nights in July and August.

60|$|For Joan that faint trail {{seemed a}} broad road, blazoned through the wild canons {{and up the}} rocky {{fastness}} and through the thick brakes. She led {{on and on and}} up and down, never at fault, with familiar landmarks near and far. Cleve hung close to her, and now his call to her or to the pack-horse took on a keener note. Every rough and wild mile behind them meant so much. They did not halt at the noon hour. They did not halt at the next camp-site, still <b>more</b> darkly <b>memorable</b> to Joan. And sunset found them miles farther on, down on the divide, at the head of Lost Canon.|$|R
25|$|The {{characteristics}} of an episodic onset vertigo {{is indicated by}} symptoms lasting for a smaller, <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> amount of time, typically lasting for only seconds to minutes.

25|$|One of the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> extinguishings {{occurred}} at the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Organizers quickly doused it again and relit it using a backup of the original flame.|$|E

50|$|These true autobiographical {{memories}} {{can then}} {{be presented to the}} participants at a later date in a recognition test, often in comparison to falsified diary entries or 'foils'.

5000|$|Multiple intelligences-based methods, which {{draw upon}} the reader's diverse ways of {{thinking}} and knowing to enrich his or her appreciation of the text. Reading is fundamentally a linguistic activity: one can basically comprehend a text without resorting to other intelligences, such as the visual (e.g., mentally [...] "seeing" [...] characters or events described), auditory (e.g., reading aloud or mentally [...] "hearing" [...] sounds described), or even the logical intelligence (e.g., considering [...] "what if" [...] scenarios or predicting how the text will unfold based on context clues). However, most readers already use several intelligences while reading, and making a habit of doing so in a more disciplined manner—i.e., constantly, or after every paragraph—can result in <b>more</b> vivid, <b>memorable</b> experience.|$|R
25|$|With {{two outs}} {{in the bottom}} of the 9th inning, September 18, Ichiro hit a walk-off, two-run home run against Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, scoring Michael Saunders in one of the <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> {{victories}} of the season.

25|$|Tampa Bay hosted Cleveland, and notched {{their first}} ever win against the Browns {{franchise}} by {{a score of}} 17–3. Fullback Mike Alstott was the most notable of the day, rushing 17 times for 126 yards and two touchdowns.

25|$|The {{horror and}} revulsion at the cruelty and inhumanity that he {{witnessed}} still {{left him with}} a deep-seated hostility towards Germany; in the late-1980s he wrote that he would disembark from a lift rather than ride with a German of his generation. Nevertheless, three of his <b>more</b> <b>memorable</b> film roles were as Germans, one of them as a former SS officer in The Night Porter (1974).|$|E
50|$|This role {{includes}} {{identification of}} various types of figurative language, including {{but not limited to}} simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, and idiom. This may lead to discussion about the author's craft - why the author chose to use those particular words or phrases, {{and whether or not they}} were effective. This in-context identification can be <b>more</b> relevant and <b>memorable</b> than isolated instruction by the teacher of these types of tools.|$|R
30|$|Our central {{question}} is whether there is any effect {{of the level of}} abstraction at which the behaviors are described. Previous studies showed that concrete examples affect judgments more strongly than abstract descriptions do, because concrete examples are <b>more</b> salient, <b>memorable,</b> or convincing (e.g. Borgida & Nisbett, 1977; Jenni & Loewenstein, 1997; see also Semin & Fiedler, 1991 for different ways of construing abstract versus concrete descriptions). In the current work, we ask whether learning about behaviors in the abstract versus from a concrete instance significantly shifts the kinds of inferences laypeople then draw about the behavior. In particular, we approach this question in terms of two different types of explanations for behaviors that are pervasive in lay discourse (as well as scientific): psychological and biological explanations.|$|R
50|$|Smackout was {{broadcast}} from Chicago's NBC radio affiliate WMAQ before becoming nationally syndicated through the NBC Blue Network beginning in April 1933.

The series, after capturing the eye of the wife of an executive at Johnson Wax, was the basis to Jim and Marian Jordan's <b>more</b> successful and <b>memorable</b> radio series Fibber McGee and Molly.|$|R
