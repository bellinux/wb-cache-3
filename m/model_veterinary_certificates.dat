40|$|Summary: The {{role of the}} {{veterinary}} {{profession is}} to promote animal health, animal welfare, {{public health and the}} protection of the environment. Veterinarians must adhere to high ethical standards and be prepared to apply their specialised knowledge and skills in the interest of others. The organisation, structure and functioning of the Veterinary Statutory Bodies and Veterinary Associations are prerequisites not only for the quality of Veterinary Services but also for private veterinary practice in a country. Both organisations provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure that veterinarians in the public and the private sectors have the necessary qualifications, scientific expertise and experience and are free from any financial, commercial, hierarchical, political and other pressures which might affect their competence to make sound professional judgments based on existing scientific data. It is essential that all veterinarians and veterinary para-professionals are licensed to practice by an autonomous Veterinary Statutory Body and subject to legal disciplinary provisions for any professional misconduct. The existing structures and functional arrangements in most Member Countries of the OIE 2 Regional Commission for the Middle East are not up to standards. Change is therefore necessary for compliance with the provisions of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code dealing with the quality of Veterinary Services, the issue of international <b>veterinary</b> <b>certificates</b> and the regulation of the practice of veterinarians and veterinary para-professionals in the public and the private sector...|$|R

40|$|Case study {{research}} into the mandatory veterinary requirements on Dutch exports of live animals and animal products provides empirical evidence on the trade effects of nontariff measures (NTMs). The paper discusses the analytical approach to assess how veterinary health attestation may create (temporary) obstacles for Dutch exports, what these obstacles are, and whether competing exporters in EU countries have encountered similar barriers. We have a dataset on 166 cases in 2004 - 06 where the process of issuing <b>veterinary</b> <b>certificates</b> for Dutch exports to non- EU destinations was disrupted. Products covered are animal-based products, live animals and feed. We use a sample of 30 cases that continued after 2006, the ‘longlasting problems’, and 39 cases that came up and got solved between 2004 and 2006, the temporary problems. The main challenge is to link the available record of recognition problems to the disruptions in exports. In order to assess trade disruptions, statistical tests of outliers and trend breaches are performed on detailed monthly trade data, {{and the issue of}} not-observed trade needs to be addressed. This raises the need to address disruption patterns around the imposition of measures in trade. The alternative patterns under examination are (i) measures that have an immediate trade impact, (ii) measures due to which trade gradually expands or reduces, and (iii) measures that divert trade to alternative export destinations. Finally, we want to examine whether the impact of veterinary health attestation on trade can be specified towards the type of trade barrier. For that, we suggest to introduce a distinction between three different types of barriers, based on whether obstacles relate to the non-conformity of products to import requirements or a failure in the conformity assessment or both. non-tariff measures, conformity assessment, animal products, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

Career development, for most people, is a lifelong process of engaging the work world through choosing among employment opportunities made available to them. Each individual undertaking the process is influenced by many factors, including the context in which they live, their personal aptitudes, and educational attainment. A sample of 374 was used to gather information form participants of the <b>veterinary</b> science <b>certificate</b> program. Data was collected with the use of an online survey instrument and resulted in a total of 224 responses (59. 8 %) with 122 (54. 4 %) completed surveys.

There are some areas as indicated in the research that might need to be re-visited and changed to meet the needs of those involved in the program. It can also be concluded that the VSCP is helping participants successfully determine career choices. VSCP combines lessons, activities and hands on learning that help different learning styles to better understand veterinary medicine, in return help them in career choices. The results also indicate why participants are not completing all components of the VSCP. It is evident that if the VSCP is going to continue and prosper these finding should be addresses, and it needs to become priority for the betterment of this career development program. It is time for VSCP to look at short term verses long term experiences. The researcher feels by doing this it would determine if the time commitment is too much for the participant, or is it the commitment of the participant to complete the requirements of VSCP. The researcher also reveals it is relevant to continue the 500 clinical hours due to the parallel of the TVMA certification program, for students that want to become a certified veterinary assistant. However, to get more participants to complete VSCP educational component it might need to be communicated better that the 500 clinical hours are secondary to the overall VSCP...|$|R

40|$|Canine {{distemper}} {{is generally}} considered the most contagious disease of domestic dogs. 8, 9 The disease has become rare in dogs in the United States due largely to effective vaccines. 12 The disease persists because of persisting wildlife reservoirs of Canine distemper virus (CDV; order Mononegavirales, family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Morbillivirus), particularly in raccoons and skunks. 13 Canine distemper {{is most likely to}} affect dogs when they are crowded, stressed, immunologically susceptible, and directly or indirectly exposed to infected wildlife (Hurley, KF: 2005, Canine distemper in the shelter: lessons learned from a Chi-cago outbreak.

Sepsis initiated by MDRGNB is {{a leading cause of}} shock and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. To date however, the biological effects of LpxC- 2 and related molecules in companion and production animals remain largely unexplored in vivo and are therefore unknown.
