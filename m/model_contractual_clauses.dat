40|$|Purpose – It {{analyzes}} to {{what extent}} the intervention of the controlling shareholder and its inherent provisions in power distribution utilities contracts are validated in the light of reflexive law constructs. Methodology/approach/design – The dogmatic and socio-legal approach is applied, based on the theory of autopoiesis and reflexive law. It proceeds with the normative selection, tabulation and comparison of the <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses</b> related to the controlling shareholder, constant in the contracts of the ten most prominent power distribution utilities with the largest number of consumers and power distribution in 2013. It performs the critical examination of reflexivity of selected rules.

Practical implications – The application of theoretical principles disclosed in the article and the suggestions offered can be applied in new power distribution utilities contracts, with the purpose of increasing the regulatory effectiveness of the clauses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe law {{in matters}} of {{consumer}} protection {{was born in the}} 18 th century, and started to develop {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century. In the period 1960 – 1970 European states like Sweden, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, France adopted laws regarding the protection of consumer's rights. In Romania, such laws protecting the rights of consumers were adopted after th e Revolution in December 1989. Thus, the first laws on the matter were the Government Ordinance no. 21 / 1992 - which is presently applicable and Law no. 193 / 2000 also currently applicable although it was republished and modified. The specificity of the legislation in Romania is represented by the fact that the notion of “consumer” represents only the privat e person, the individual. The companies are assimilated to the professionals and are not protected against abusive <b>contractual</b> terms and <b>clauses.</b> Although the same private service can be granted and offered by the same company, the contract and its clauses will vary due to the quality of the contractor. If the contractor is a private person, a particular, he will be protected by law against abusive <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses,</b> while the contractor, which is a company will not be protected against the same <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses.</b> Thus, one and the same <b>contractual</b> <b>clause</b> cannot be abusive to the particular and legal to a company which is assimilated by the legislator to the professionals. In our opinion, this lack of protection regarding the professionals, the companies, not only represents a breech of the Romania's Constitution where in article 16, the fundamental right regarding the equality of all ci tizens in front of the law is being guaranteed, but it also represents a discrimination of the professionals...|$|R

40|$|The {{capitalist}} {{financial market}} {{is governed by}} terms and conditions imposed by large banking corporations and institutions. In creditor-debtor relations, the creditor (lender, lessor) is in a dominant economic and legal position {{at the moment of}} entering into a credit agreement, which enables him to impose different terms and conditions upon the debtor (borrower, lessee) and introduce unfair <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses.</b> Therefore, the legislator and government institutions have to protect debtors (consumers) as credit beneficiaries from such credit terms and conditions that unfairly aggravate the debtors legal position. In this article, the author analyzes the legal position of subjects of credit relations, with particular reference to the legislative provisions governing the protection of the debtor (consumer) as an economically and legally dependant contracting party. Apart from being significantly affected by financial market reforms and changes in the mortgage legislation, the legal position of debtors (consumers) has been additionally aggravated in Serbian legislation in the past decade. After discussing the creditor-debtor relations, the author focuses on the issue of establishing a balance of interests; the balance of the creditor and the debtor interests may be achieved by enabling the creditor to keep the financial incentive (earnings form the interest rate) and obliging the debtor (credit-user) to provide legal certainty and protection against unfair <b>contractual</b> <b>clauses...</b>|$|R
