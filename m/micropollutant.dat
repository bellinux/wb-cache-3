40|$|Four {{experiments}} were performed in sequencing batch reactors, two by two in parallel, {{to study the}} effect of <b>micropollutants</b> (organic xenobiotics and heavy metals) {{on the performance of}} activated sludge processes.

It was observed that production of biological solids, COD removal, and settling properties were not affected by the presence of <b>micropollutants</b> significantly. On the other hand, ammonia removal was much lower in the reactors fed with <b>micropollutants</b> (29 - 37 % removal) than in the reactor without <b>micropollutants</b> (82 % removal). Batch tests allowed the measurement of maximal activities of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass. The activity of nitrifying microorganisms grown without <b>micropollutants</b> was greatly reduced (about 50 %) by the addition of the <b>micropollutants,</b> but the residual <b>micropollutants</b> after treatment did not exert any inhibiting effect. Nitrate balances on the four runs confirmed that the fraction of nitrifying microorganisms was much higher in the reactor without <b>micropollutants</b> (4. 5 % of overall VSS) than in the reactors fed with <b>micropollutants</b> (maximum 0. 5 % of VSS). In spite of the fact that in the reactors fed with <b>micropollutants</b> the fraction of nitrifying microorganisms increased at increasing sludge age, a satisfactory nitrogen removal was not achieved in the whole tested range of experimental conditions, even after the 11 -month acclimation.

40|$|Ozonation is {{effective}} in {{improving the quality of}} municipal wastewater effluents by eliminating organic <b>micropollutants.</b> Nevertheless, ozone process design is still limited by (i) the large number of structurally diverse <b>micropollutants</b> and (ii) the varying quality of wastewater matrices (especially dissolved organic matter). These issues were addressed by grouping 16 <b>micropollutants</b> according to their ozone and hydroxyl radical (•OH) rate constants and normalizing the applied ozone dose to the dissolved organic carbon concentration (i. e., g O 3 /g DOC). Consistent elimination of <b>micropollutants</b> was observed in 10 secondary municipal wastewater effluents spiked with 16 <b>micropollutants</b> (2 μg/L) in the absence of ozone demand exerted by nitrite. The elimination of ozone-refractory <b>micropollutants</b> was well predicted by measuring the •OH exposure by the decrease of the probe compound p-chlorobenzoic acid. The average molar •OH yields (moles of •OH produced per mole of ozone consumed) were 21 ± 3 % for g O 3 /g DOC = 1. 0, and the average rate constant for the reaction of •OH with effluent organic matter was (2. 1 ± 0. 6) × 104 (mg C/L) − 1 s– 1. On the basis of these results, a DOC-normalized ozone dose, together with the rate constants for the reaction of the selected <b>micropollutants</b> with ozone and •OH, and the measurement of the •OH exposure are proposed as key parameters for the prediction of the elimination efficiency of <b>micropollutants</b> during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents with varying water quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of organic <b>micropollutants</b> with {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) can influence their transport, degradation and bioavailability. While this has been well established for natural organic carbon, very little is known regarding the influence of DOC {{on the fate of}} <b>micropollutants</b> during wastewater treatment and water recycling. Dissolved organic carbon-water partition coefficients (K(DOC)) for wastewater derived and reference DOC were measured for a range of <b>micropollutants</b> using a depletion method with polydimethylsiloxane disks. For <b>micropollutants</b> with an octanol water partition coefficient (log K(ow)) greater than 4 {{there was a significant difference}} in K(DOC) between reference and wastewater derived DOC, with partitioning to wastewater derived DOC over 1000 times lower for the most hydrophobic <b>micropollutants.</b> The {{interaction of}} nonylphenol with wastewater derived DOC from different stages of a wastewater and advanced water treatment train was studied, but little difference in K(DOC) was observed. Organic carbon characterisation revealed that reference and wastewater derived DOC had very different properties due to their different origins. Consequently, the reduced sorption capacity of wastewater derived DOC may be related to their microbial origin which led to reduced aromaticity and lower molecular weight. This study suggests that for hydrophobic <b>micropollutants</b> (log K(ow) > 4) a higher concentration of freely dissolved and thus bioavailable <b>micropollutants</b> is expected in the presence of wastewater derived DOC than predicted using K(DOC) values quantified using reference DOC. The implication is that naturally derived DOC may not be an appropriate surrogate for wastewater derived DOC as a matrix for assessing the fate of <b>micropollutants</b> in engineered systems.

40|$|Nitrifying {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs) are more efficient than non-nitrifying WWTPs to remove several micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. This {{may be related to}} the activity of nitrifying organisms, such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOBs), which could possibly co-metabolically oxidize micropollutants with their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). The role of AOBs in <b>micropollutant</b> removal was investigated with aerobic granular sludge (AGS), a promising technology for municipal WWTPs. Two identical laboratory-scale AGS sequencing batch reactors (AGS-SBRs) were operated with or without nitrification (inhibition of AMOs) to assess their potential for <b>micropollutant</b> removal. Of the 36 micropollutants studied at 1 mu g l(- 1) in synthetic wastewater, nine were over 80 % removed, but 17 were eliminated by less than 20 %. Five substances (bisphenol A, naproxen, irgarol, terbutryn and iohexol) were removed better in the reactor with nitrification, probably due to co-oxidation catalysed by AMOs. However, for the removal of all other micropollutants, AOBs did not seem to play a significant role. Many compounds were better removed in aerobic condition, suggesting that aerobic heterotrophic organisms were involved in the degradation. As the AGS-SBRs did not favour the growth of such organisms, their potential for <b>micropollutant</b> removal appeared to be lower than that of conventional nitrifying WWTPs...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that wastewater treatment facilities meet legislated discharge limits {{for a range}} of micropollutants. However, the heterogeneity of these micropollutants in wastewaters make removal difficult to predict since their chemistry is so diverse. In this study, a range of organic and inorganic micropollutants known to be preferentially removed via different mechanisms were selected to challenge the activated sludge process (ASP) and determine its potential to achieve simultaneous <b>micropollutant</b> removal. At a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8 h, the influence of an increase in solids retention time (SRT) on removal was evaluated. Maximum achievable <b>micropollutant</b> removal was recorded for all chemicals (estrogens, nonylphenolics and metals) at the highest SRT studied (27 days). Also, optimisation of HRT by extension to 24 h further augmented organic biodegradation. Most notable was the enhancement in removal of the considerably recalcitrant synthetic estrogen 17 a-ethinylestradiol which increased to 65 analysis indicates that this enhanced <b>micropollutant</b> behaviour is ostensibly related to the concomitant reduction in food: microorganism ratio. Interestingly, extended HRT also initiated nonylphenol biodegradation which has not been consistently observed previously in real wastewaters. However, extending HRT increased the solubilisation of particulate bound metals, increasing effluent aqueous metals concentrations (i. e., 0. 45 ± 19 %. Regressionmm filtered) by > compliance. Consequently, identification of an optimum process condition for generic <b>micropollutant</b> removal is expected to favour a more integrated approach where upstream process unit optimisation (i. e., primary sedimentation) is demanded to reduce loading of the particle bound metal phase onto the ASP, thereby enabling longer HRT in the ASP to be considered for optimum removal of organic micropollutants. 100 %.

Characterizing the source of micropollutants is important for reducing their burden and thus mitigating adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, chemical analysis and bioanalysis were applied to assess the <b>micropollutant</b> burden during low flow conditions upstream and downstream of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharging into small streams in the Swiss Plateau. The upstream sites had no input of wastewater effluent, allowing a direct comparison of the observed effects with and without the contribution of wastewater. Four hundred and five chemicals were analyzed, while the applied bioassays included activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, activation of the androgen receptor, activation of the estrogen receptor, photosystem II inhibition, acetylcholinesterase inhibition and adaptive stress responses for oxidative stress, genotoxicity and inflammation, as well as assays indicative of estrogenic activity and developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. Chemical analysis and bioanalysis showed higher chemical concentrations and effects for the effluent samples, with the lowest chemical concentrations and effects in most assays for the upstream sites. Mixture toxicity modeling was applied to assess the contribution of detected chemicals to the observed effect. For most bioassays, {{very little of the}} observed effects could be explained by the detected chemicals, with the exception of photosystem II inhibition, where herbicides explained the majority of the effect.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{essential}} to monitor the release of organic <b>micropollutants</b> from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for developing environmental risk assessment and assessing compliance with legislative regulation. In this study the impact of sampling strategy on the quantitative determination of <b>micropollutants</b> in effluent wastewater was investigated. An extended list of 90 chiral and achiral <b>micropollutants</b> representing {{a broad range of}} biological and physico-chemical properties were studied simultaneously for the first time. During composite sample collection <b>micropollutants</b> can degrade resulting in the under-estimation of concentration. Cooling collected sub-samples to 4 °C stabilised ≥ 81 of 90 <b>micropollutants</b> to acceptable levels (± 20 % of the initial concentration) in the studied effluents. However, achieving stability for all <b>micropollutants</b> will require an integrated approach to sample collection (i. e., multi-bottle sampling with more than one stabilisation method applied). Full-scale monitoring of effluent revealed time-paced composites attained similar information to volume-paced composites (influent wastewater requires a sampling mode responsive to flow variation). The option of monitoring effluent using time-paced composite samplers is advantageous as not all WWTPs have flow controlled samplers or suitable sites for deploying portable flow meters. There has been little research to date on the impact of monitoring strategy on the determination of chiral <b>micropollutants</b> at the enantiomeric level. Variability in wastewater flow results in a dynamic hydraulic retention time within the WWTP (and upstream sewerage system). Despite chiral <b>micropollutants</b> being susceptible to stereo-selective degradation, no diurnal variability in their enantiomeric distribution was observed. However, unused medication can be directly disposed into the sewer network creating short-term (e. g., daily) changes to their enantiomeric distribution.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{within the framework}} of Lloyd's Register's Marine Exhaust Emissions Research Programme. Phase II of this research programme [] evaluated exhaust emissions from ships in service under steady state and transient modes of operation and incorporated measurements of CO, CO 2, 02, SO 2, NOa and hydrocarbons on board eight ships. Additional measurements of heavy metal and organic <b>micropollutant</b> emissions were undertaken on three of these vessels. The organic <b>micropollutant</b> measurement exercise is reported herein. The purpose of the investigations reported here is to get a first impression of the emissions of organic microcontaminants from ship engines under "real world" conditions, at sea as well as on inland waterways. The work was also meant to find out whether more elaborate investigations Íìre needed or should not have priority. We will describe here in short the reasons for the investigation and for the choice of the substances measured. For each topic only one reference will be given, selected from the voluminous scientific literature...|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{pesticides}} {{are often}} present as micropollutants with concentrations {{too low for}} efficient biodegradation and growth of heterotrophic pollutant degrading bacteria. Instead, organic carbon present in environmental dissolved organic matter (eDOM) constitutes the main carbon source in nature. Information on how natural organic carbon affects degradation of pollutants and micropollutants in particular, is however poor. Linuron degrading Variovorax sp. strains SRS 16, WDL 1 and PBLH 6 and a triple-species bacterial consortium from which WDL 1 originated, were examined {{for their ability to}} degrade linuron at <b>micropollutant</b> concentrations and the effect hereon of different eDOM formulations of varying biodegradability as supplementary C-source was explored. Individual strains and the consortium degraded linuron at initial concentrations as low as 1 µg L- 1 till concentrations below 4 ng L- 1. Degradation kinetics differed among strains with rates that differed up to 70 -fold at the lowest linuron concentrations and with lag phases ranging from 0 to 7 days. Linuron biodegradation by the individual strains was inhibited by an easily biodegradable compound such as citrate but stimulated by eDOM at a linuron concentration of 10 mg L- 1. Effects were strongly reduced or became non-existent at <b>micropollutant</b> linuron concentrations. Effects of eDOM on degradation at 10 mg L- 1 linuron by WDL 1 were reduced when WDL 1 was incubated together with its original consortium members. This is the first report on eDOM effects on degradation of pesticides at <b>micropollutant</b> concentrations and indicates these effects are limited and depend on linuron and eDOM concentrations, eDOM quality and the bacterial culture. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of insufficient removal during treatment of wastewater released from industry and households, different classes of organic <b>micropollutants</b> are nowadays detected in surface and drinking water. Among these <b>micropollutants,</b> bioactive substances, e. g., endocrine disrupting compounds and pharmaceuticals, have been incriminated in negative effects on living organisms in aquatic biotope. Much research {{was done in the}} last years on the fate and removal of those compounds from wastewater. An important point it is to understand the role of applied treatment conditions (sludge retention time (SRT), biomass concentration, temperature, pH value, dominant class of <b>micropollutants,</b> etc.) for the efficiency of conventional treatment plants (CTP) and membrane bioreactors (MBR) concerning the removal of <b>micropollutants</b> such as pharmaceuticals, steroid- and xeno-estrogens. Nevertheless, the removal rates differ even from one compound to the other and are related to the ph ysico-chemical characteristics of the xenobiotics...|$|R
40|$|Global water {{scarcity}} {{is driving the}} need for identifying new water source. Wastewater could be a potential water resource if appropriate treatment technologies could be developed. One of the barriers to obtaining high quality water from wastewater arises from the presence of organic <b>micropollutants,</b> which are biologically active at trace levels. Removal of these compounds from wastewater by current physico-chemical technologies is prohibitively expensive. While biological treatment processes are comparatively cheap, current systems are not capable of degrading {{the wide range of}} organic <b>micropollutants</b> present in wastewater. As current wastewater treatment processes were developed for treating conventional pollutants present at mg/L levels, degrading the ng/L levels of <b>micropollutants</b> will require a different approach to system design and operation. In this paper we discuss strategies that could be employed to develop biological wastewater treatment systems capable of degrading organic <b>micropollutants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{chemicals}} used in everyday {{personal care products}} are today amongst the most commonly detected compounds in surface waters throughout the world. Collectively referred to as <b>micropollutants,</b> they include paraben preservatives, organic UV filters, alkylphenols, triclosan, and bisphenol-A. <b>Micropollutants</b> enter the aquatic environment predominantly via wastewater discharges. To date there has been only limited assessments on their presence and impacts in coastal environments. The wastewater treatment plants in Lyttelton, Governors Bay, and Diamond Harbour were found to discharge <b>micropollutants</b> into Whakaraupo Harbour. Similarly, the sewage effluents of the Antarctic research stations Scott Base and McMurdo Station were found to discharge <b>micropollutants</b> into Erebus Bay. Strong seasonal changes in the Whakaraupo effluent concentrations were observed, with concentrations higher in winter than in summer. Concentrations fluctuated greatly in Scott Base, reaching concentrations higher than have been previously reported internationally. The nine most commonly detected analytes were octylphenol, 4 -MBC, BP- 3, BP- 1, triclosan, methyl triclosan, bisphenol-A, estrone, and coprostanol. The marine environments in Whakaraupo Harbour and Erebus Bay {{were found to be}} similarly impacted. The most commonly detected <b>micropollutants</b> in seawater in Whakaraupo Harbour were mParaben, 4 -MBC, BP- 3, OMC, bisphenol-A, and estrone. The marine sediments in Whakaraupo Harbour accumulated mParaben, octylphenol, 4 -MBC, BP- 3, BP- 1, bisphenol-A, OMC, estrone, and coprostanol, while mussels bioaccumulated mParaben, octylphenol, and BP- 3. The same range of <b>micropollutants</b> were detected in seawater throughout Erebus Bay, including the reference sites. Marine biota (clams, urchins, and fish), including those from the reference site, were shown to readily bioaccumulate mParaben, pParaben, octylphenol, BP- 3, E 2, EE 2, and coprostanol. A much larger coastal area of Antarctica and New Zealand is therefore impacted than was previously thought. Photodegradation was identified as an important environmental degradation pathway for <b>micropollutants.</b> mParaben, BPA, EE 2, and BP- 3 are highly photo-stable, while triclosan and OP readily photodegrade. The low temperature and irradiance conditions in Antarctica were modelled to investigate their potential environmental persistence. Field measurements suggest the model may underestimate the photodegradation potential of some <b>micropollutants...</b>|$|R
