Factors affecting efficiency, coverage, and financing of tetanus immunization programs are assessed. While expansion of the routine EPI program is the preferred goal, mass campaigns are judged to be a reasonable part of the multi-year strategy for tetanus control in the province.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{burden of}} {{disability}} is more severe among children in low income countries. Moreover, {{the number of}} children with disabilities (CWDs) in sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to increase with reduction in child mortality. Although the issue on CWDs is important in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few researches on risk factors of disabilities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the risk factors of neurological impairment (NI) among children in western Kenya. Methods The present study was conducted in Mbita district (which has high HIV infectious prevalence), Kenya from April 2009 to December 2010. The study consisted of two phases. In phase 1, the Ten Question Questionnaire (TQQ) was administered to all 6362 caregivers of children aged 6 – 9 years. In phase two, all 413 children with TQQ positive and a similar number of controls (n= 420) which were randomly selected from children with TQQ negative were examined for physical and cognitive status. In addition, a structured questionnaire was also conducted to their caregivers. Results The prevalence was estimated to be 29 / 1000. Among the types of impairments, cognitive impairment was the most common (24 / 1000), followed by physical impairment (5 / 1000). In multivariate analysis, having more than five children [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) : 2. 85; 95 %IC: 1. 25 – 6. 49; p= 0. 013], maternal age older than 35 years old [AOR: 2. 31; 95 %IC: 1. 05 – 5. 07; p= 0. 036] were significant factors associated with NI. In addition, monthly income under 3000 ksh [AOR: 2. 79; 95 %IC: 1. 28 – 6. 08; p= 0. 010] and no <b>maternal</b> <b>tetanus</b> shot during antenatal care [AOR: 5. 17; 95 %IC: 1. 56 – 17. 14; p= 0. 007] were also significantly related with having moderate/severe neurological impairment.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in the potential of maternal immunisation to protect maternal, fetal, and infant health. <b>Maternal</b> <b>tetanus</b> vaccination is part of routine antenatal care and immunisation campaigns in many countries, and it has played {{an important part in}} the reduction of maternal and neonatal tetanus. Additional vaccines that have been recommended for routine maternal immunisation include those for influenza and pertussis, and other vaccines are being developed. Maternal immunisation is controversial since regulators, professionals, and the public are often reluctant to accept pharmaceutical interventions during pregnancy. So far, little attention has been given to the ethics of vaccination during pregnancy.

40|$|Neonatal and <b>maternal</b> <b>tetanus</b> infections {{remain an}} {{important}} {{cause of death}} in many countries. Few studies have reported tetanus toxoid antibody levels of adolescent girls. As part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization most girls receive up to 3 injections in early childhood, and many subsequently do not receive booster vaccinations until pregnant. We determined (by ELISA) tetanus antibody seropositivity in adolescent girls from Malawi (in 1996), Nigeria (in 1993) and Pakistan (in 1996), and response to tetanus vaccination in adolescent girls from Pakistan. Geometric mean titres (GMT, IU/mL) were 0. 94 in 117 Malawian, 0. 32 in 154 Nigerian and 1. 08 in 162 Pakistani girls. In Nigeria, 54. 7 % of adolescents were seronegative, of whom 26. 8 % had a history of unsafe abortion. In Malawi and Pakistan all girls were seropositive and in Pakistan, following a booster vaccination, titres increased 3 -fold, with a lower response in older girls. The results indicated that adequate childhood immunization is likely to provide protective levels through adolescence. Booster vaccination in late childhood/early adolescence should protect the majority of women throughout their reproductive lives. This practice would reduce the risks of girls exposed to infection through unsafe abortions, and may be the best option for countries seeking to improve their vaccination schedule, especially where tetanus vaccine coverage in pregnant women is unacceptably lo...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{clinical}} trials, <b>maternal</b> <b>tetanus</b> toxoid (TT) vaccination {{is effective}} in protecting newborns against tetanus infection, but inadequate placental transfer of tetanus antibodies may contribute to lower-than-expected rates of protection in routine practice. We studied the effect of placental malaria and maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on placental transfer of antibodies to tetanus. METHODS: A total of 704 maternal-cord paired serum samples were tested by ELISA for antibodies to tetanus. The HIV status of all women was determined by an immunoglobulin G antibody-capture particle-adherence test, and placental malaria was determined by placental biopsy. Maternal history of TT vaccination was recorded. RESULTS: Tetanus antibody levels were reduced by 52 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 30 %- 67 %) in newborns of HIV-infected women and by 48 % (95 % CI, 26 %- 62 %) in newborns whose mothers had active-chronic or past placental malaria. Thirty-seven mothers (5. 3 %) and 55 newborns (7. 8 %) had tetanus antibody levels < 0. 1 IU/mL (i. e., were seronegative). Mothers' self-reported history of lack of tetanus immunization was the strongest predictor of seronegativity and of tetanus antibody levels in maternal and cord serum.

40|$|Objectives: Preventable {{neonatal}} mortality due to tetanus infection remains common. We aimed to examine antenatal vaccination impact {{in a context}} of continuing high {{neonatal mortality}} in rural northern India. Methods and Findings: Using the third round of the Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2005 – 06, mortality of most recent singleton births was analysed in discrete-time logistic model with <b>maternal</b> <b>tetanus</b> vaccination, together with antenatal care utilisation and supplementation with iron and folic acid. 59 % of mothers reported receiving antenatal care, 48 % reported receiving iron and folic acid supplementation and 68 % reported receiving two or more doses of tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination. The odds of all-cause neonatal death were reduced following one or more antenatal dose of TT with odds ratios (OR) of 0. 46 (95 % CI 0. 26 to 0. 78) after one dose and 0. 45 (95 % CI 0. 31 to 0. 66) after two or more doses. Reported utilisation of antenatal care and iron-folic acid supplementation did not influence neonatal mortality. In the statistical model, 16 % (95 % CI 5 % to 27 %) of neonatal deaths could be attributed to a lack of at least two doses of TT vaccination during pregnancy, representing an estimated 78, 632 neonatal deaths in absolute terms. Conclusions: Substantial gains in newborn survival could be achieved in rural North India through increased coverage of antenatal TT vaccination. The apparent substantial protective effect of a single antenatal dose of TT requires further study.
