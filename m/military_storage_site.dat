Brunvand found elements in common among many Mothman reports and much older folk tales, suggesting that something real may have triggered the scares and became woven with existing folklore. He also records anecdotal tales of Mothman supposedly attacking the roofs of parked cars inhabited by teenagers.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} and risk communication affect everybody’s daily life. Local authorities have {{the duty to}} manage public structures, to inform civilians of the risks coming from these structures, to implement prophylaxis procedures. <b>Military</b> <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> are fully included in this category. This article presents – through a qualitative methodology based on risk analysis – how risk {{management and}} communication in weapons and ammunition warehouses is managed in a “partially free” country, using as a case-study, the Malhazine depot in Mozambique, which resulted in more than 100 deaths. In 2007, an extraordinary accident related to the management of obsolete conventional weapons occurred at the Malazhine warehouse. In this circumstance, the Mozambican Government adopted a policy of classifying the information “highly confidential”. This policy aimed at obscuring facts and responsibilities by hiding the causes of such a huge tragedy. This article concludes with the consideration that {{a high level of}} confidentiality in treating issues of public interest, such as the one kept in regard to Malhazine, does not help public authorities to effectively manage and prevent similar risks from occurring again, with resulting negative impacts on local populations...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} decision for policy makers is selecting strategic petroleum reserve sites. However, policy makers may not choose {{the most suitable}} and efficient locations for strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) due to the complexity {{in the choice of}} sites. This paper proposes a multi-objective programming model to determine the optimal locations for China’s SPR <b>storage</b> <b>sites.</b> This model considers not only the minimum response time but also the minimum transportation cost based on a series of reasonable assumptions and constraint conditions. The factors influencing SPR sites are identified to determine potential demand points and candidate <b>storage</b> <b>sites.</b> Estimation and suggestions are made for the selection of China’s future SPR <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> {{based on the results of}} this model. When the number of petroleum <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> is less than or equals 25 and the maximum capacity of <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> is restricted to 10 million tonnes, the model’s result best fit for the current layout scheme selected thirteen <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> in four scenarios. Considering the current status of SPR in China, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Daqing and Zhanjiang, Chengdu, Xi’an, and Yueyang are suggested to be the candidate locations for the third phase of the construction plan. The locations of petroleum <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> suggested in this work could be used as a reference for decision makers.|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that an old mineral <b>storage</b> <b>site</b> removed in 1998 {{due to high}} lead content, remains {{as a source of}} exposure in the city of Antofagasta, Chile. The aim was to determine the association between blood lead levels in children and the residential proximity to the old mineral <b>storage</b> <b>site.</b> A cross sectional study was conducted with 185 children aged 7 to 16 years. The outcome variable was blood lead levels measured in 2005. The exposure variable was the distance between the current residence and the old mineral <b>storage</b> <b>site.</b> The distance was measured in meters by Geographic Information System (GIS). The median blood lead level in 2005 was 3. 3 &# 956;g/dL (interquartile range &# 8210; IQR: 2. 0 - 4. 3).
