40|$|Root {{and stem}} wood anatomy of C. myrianthum (Verbenaceae) from a semideciduous {{seasonal}} forest in Botucatu municipality (22 º 52 ’ 20 ”S and 48 º 26 ’ 37 ”W), São Paulo state, Brazil, were studied. Growth increments demarcated by semi-ring porosity and marginal bands of axial parenchyma {{were observed in}} the wood of both root and stem. Many qualitative features were the same in both root and stem: fine helical thickenings, and simple and <b>multiple</b> <b>perforation</b> plates in vessel elements; large quantities of axial parenchyma in the growth rings, grading from marginal bands and confluent forming irregular bands in earlywood to lozenge aliform in latewood; axial parenchyma cells forked, and varied wall projections and undulations; septate fibres; forked and diverse fibre endings. Quantitative features differing between root and stem wood were evaluated using student’s t-test, and vessel frequency, vessel element length, vessel diameter, ray height, and vulnerability and mesomorphy indices differed significantly. Root wood had lower frequency of vessels, narrower and longer vessel elements, and taller rays than wood of the stem. The calculated vulnerability and mesomorphy indices indicated that C. myrianthum plants are mesomorphic. Roots {{seem to be more}} susceptible to water stress than the stem...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the noise reduction of perforated liners with bias flow that are applied in jet engines and gas turbines, {{a better understanding of}} the inherent aeroacoustic sound damping mechanisms is necessary. For that purpose, the interaction between sound and flow that is responsible for the damping process needs to be localized, analyzed and balanced. To this aim, laser optical measurements are needed that both acquire the complex sound field and flow field contactlessly. Acoustic particle image velocimetry (A-PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry with sinusoidal frequency modulation (FM-DGV) are applied for this measurement task in comparison. The results show that both methods are advantageous due to their ability for multipoint measurement. In particular, A-PIV offers a wide overview of <b>multiple</b> <b>perforation</b> orifices, whereas FM-DGV satisfies with a high measurement rate of up to 100 kHz allowing the spectral analysis of the velocity field. Both methods were applied at a generic bias flow liner, showing acoustically induced flow velocity oscillations near the rim of the perforation orifices. The spatially resolved oscillation magnitude shows a correlation to the dissipation coefficient and indicates an acoustically induced flow vortex generation and collapse in the vicinity of the liner perforation, respectively, which depends on the relative position to the orifice. As shown in this paper, the measurement methods have the potential to enhance current knowledge about the aeroacoustic interaction at liners, especially in the scenario with both grazing and bias flow. In order to fully understand these interaction phenomena an expansion to volumetric measurements is needed in the future...|$|E

40|$|Typhoid fever is {{a severe}} febrile illness caused {{primarily}} by the gram negative bacillus Salmonella enteritidis serovar Typhi. The most lethal complication of it is bleeding and ileal perforation, both arising from necrosis of Peyer’s patches in the terminal ileum. The present {{study was conducted in}} 172 adult patients of Typhoid perforation admitted in 2008 - 2013 treated surgically. The aim of the study to show simple repair of perforation is the justified surgical procedure in terms of morbidity, mortality and cost effectiveness. Duration of perforation, number of perforation and development of faecal fistula are the factors which significantly affect mortality. Primary temporary ileostomy and ileo transverse anastomosis were performed in some patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>perforations</b> and/or with perforation situated near/on the ileocaecal junction having greater risk of “repair leak”. Resection and anastomosis is considered in some cases of <b>multiple</b> <b>perforations</b> and unhealthy gut with or without defunctioning ileostomy.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of using pin fin heat sinks with <b>multiple</b> <b>perforations</b> are investigated using complementary experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods. An experimental heat sink with <b>multiple</b> <b>perforations</b> is designed and fabricated and parameter {{studies of the}} effect of perforated pin fin design on heat transfer and pressure drops across the heat sinks undertaken. Experimental data is found to agree well with predictions from a CFD model for the conjugate heat transfer into the cooling air stream. The validated CFD model is used to carry out a parametric study of the influence of the number and positioning of circular perforations, which shows that the Nusselt number increases monotonically with the number of pin perforations, while the pressure drop and fan power required to overcome the pressure drop all reduce monotonically. Pins with five perforations are shown to have a 11 % larger Nu than for corresponding solid pin cases. These benefits arise due to not only the increased surface area but also heat transfer enhancement near perforations through the formation of localised air jets. In contrast, the locations of the pin perforations are much less influential. When examined in the context of CPU cooling, a conjugate heat transfer analysis shows that improved heat transfer with pin perforations translates into significantly reduced processor case temperatures with the additional benefit of a reduction in the weight of the heat sink’s pins. To achieve these benefits care must be taken to ensure that pin perforations are aligned with the dominant flow direction and manufactured with a good quality surface finish...|$|R
