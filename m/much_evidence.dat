5|$|Although little {{trace of}} the 10th-century church has been discovered, save {{possibly}} some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave, there is <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> of the monastery of 1093. This work in the Norman style {{may be seen in}} the northwest tower, the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings. The abbey church, beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end, was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14thcenturies. At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the cloister, the central tower, a new south transept, the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style, and the southwest tower of the façade had been begun. The west front was given a Tudor entrance, but the tower was never completed.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038. Portions {{of an earlier}} structure were alleged {{to be included in}} the present edifice, which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later, and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115. <b>Much</b> <b>evidence</b> which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Iron Age, {{there is}} <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> for the use of horses in {{transport}} and battle, and for extensive trade between the inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast copper alloy cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. The horse was an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and myth, and is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the person who was killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone that she knew. Her request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple and Julie had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick and Julie. Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he beat him to death. Julie also found out, so he panicked, and shot her. Alan begs for forgiveness towards Martin, who in anger, shoots Alan, in front of Bud and Samantha and is consequently arrested, whilst Alan dies.|$|E

5|$|The golden swallow (Tachycineta euchrysea) is a {{passerine}} in the swallow family, Hirundinidae. Two subspecies are recognised, the Jamaican T. e. euchrysea and T. e. sclateri of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). It usually inhabits {{the hills}} {{on the interior}} of islands, preferring open country. Currently, this swallow is restricted to isolated montane forests that primarily consist of the Hispaniolan pine. This species {{is considered to be}} a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although the nominate subspecies, T. e. euchrysea, is likely extinct. The exact cause of extinction is unknown, but likely factors include predation by mammals and habitat loss, although the habitat loss theory is not supported by very <b>much</b> <b>evidence.</b> The last sighting of the nominate subspecies was in Hardwar Gap (located on the boundary between Saint Andrew and Portland parishes), with three birds being seen on 8 June 1989.|$|E
5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how <b>much</b> <b>evidence</b> of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E
