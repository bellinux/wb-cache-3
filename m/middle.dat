5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the <b>middle</b> or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the <b>middle</b> class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as <b>middle</b> class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower <b>middle</b> and working class.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of <b>middle</b> class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} <b>middle</b> class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was <b>middle</b> class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the <b>middle</b> classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

40|$|It {{has been}} noted that agentive verbs, i. e. verbs {{that would not be}} {{expected}} to undergo the causative alternation, according to Levin 2 ̆ 6 Rappaport Hovav (1995), participate in a causative-like alternation in Brazilian Portuguese (BP). I call this alternation ‘the agentive alternation’ (AA). In this paper, I argue that the AA is a byproduct of the loss of the clitic se that occupies the position of an external argument in VoiceP (Schäfer 2008). I show that the AA alternation is different from the causative alternation and the verbs that participate in the AA share characteristics with BP unmarked generic <b>middles.</b> Importantly, in spite of the loss of voice morphology, BP unmarked <b>middles</b> project unnacusative syntax. As a result, there is no difference between <b>middles</b> and anticausatives in BP in respect to their transitivity status and verbs previously only licensed in <b>middles</b> were generalized as alternating verbs...|$|R
