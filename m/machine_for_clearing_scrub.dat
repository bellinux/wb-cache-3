25|$|In 1933, Bjelke-Petersen {{began work}} land-clearing and peanut farming on the family's newly {{acquired}} second property. His efforts eventually {{allowed him to}} begin work as a contract land-clearer and to acquire further capital which he invested in farm equipment and natural resource exploration. He developed a technique <b>for</b> quickly <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> by connecting a heavy anchor chain between two bulldozers. By {{the time he was}} 30, he was a prosperous farmer and businessman. Obtaining a pilot's licence early in his adult life, Bjelke-Petersen also started aerial spraying and grass seeding to further speed up pasture development in Queensland.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 a {{standard}} for machine-readable characters (MICR) was agreed and patented in the US for use with cheques. This {{opened the way for}} the first automated reader/sorting <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> <b>clearing</b> cheques. As automation increased, the following years saw a dramatic change {{in the way in which}} cheques were handled and processed. Cheque volumes continued to grow; in the late 20th century, cheques were the most popular non-cash method for making payments, with billions of them processed each year. Most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late 1980s or early 1990s, after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s {{the round}} {{was once again}} {{neglected}} with the southern entrance waterlogged and the round covered in scrub. In 1967 Cornwall County Council raised {{the level of the}} forecourt and paved the entrance to improve drainage as well as some <b>scrub</b> <b>clearing</b> and reseeding. Following the management work, Perranzabuloe Parish Council leased the site and in 1884-85 there was further scrub clearance and the fence replaced. Rose Community Association and later Rose Men's Institute took over the management until 1995. The following year Cornwall Wildlife Trust undertook an ecological assessment and the British Trust <b>for</b> Conservation Volunteers <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> from the outer face of the banks and the ditch. The Cornwall Heritage Trust now had the lease but did not maintain the site and in 2002, English Heritage handed the site to the current leaseholders, St Piran's Trust.|$|R
50|$|A slasher is an {{implement}} {{with a long}} sharp blade used to <b>clear</b> <b>scrub.</b> Its long handle, and the open face of its blade, lends it to use <b>for</b> <b>clearing</b> thin and dense low-lying bush or scrub where an axe would be too clumsy. It {{is similar to a}} billhook, but with a longer handle.|$|R

50|$|They {{have formed}} {{as a result of}} human activity. <b>For</b> example, forest <b>clearing,</b> and {{subsequent}} grazing and <b>clearing</b> of <b>scrub.</b> The plant species were formerly from woodland plants. Man has been managing land since mesolithic times.|$|R
500|$|The London Wildlife Trust's {{long-term}} {{management objective}} {{for the site}} is [...] "to manage the nature reserve to conserve its natural biodiversity, and to conserve its matrix of woodland, wetland and grassland habitats through appropriate management", which includes coppicing, <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub,</b> mowing, and controlling invasion by non-native species, while [...] "preserving the feeling of 'wilderness'".|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} management techniques {{are being used to}} maintain and bolster the reserve's benefit for wildlife. Within the wetland areas, ditches are periodically <b>cleared,</b> <b>scrub</b> is removed and trees copsed to maintain the open nature of the gravel pits. The grassland is grazed and cut on rotation to maintain a mosaic of grassland scrub habitats.|$|R
50|$|On 14 March, one townhouse and 12 ha of parkland were {{destroyed}} by a fire that prompted evacuations at Edith Cowan University and damaged facilities at university situated in the City of Joondalup. A camper who had been lodging near Grassbird Avenue in Lake Joondalup Nature Reserve was charged for lighting the fire, allegedly to <b>clear</b> <b>scrub</b> near his camp site.|$|R
2500|$|John Shaw Neilson (22 February 1872 [...] 12 May 1942) was an Australian poet. Slightly built, {{for most}} of his life he worked as a labourer, fruit-picking, <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub,</b> navvying and working in quarries, and, after 1928, working as a {{messenger}} with the Country Roads Board in Melbourne. Largely untrained and only basically educated, Neilson became known as one of Australia's finest lyric poets, who wrote a great deal about the natural world, and the beauty in it.|$|R
50|$|The {{album is}} mostly John Darnielle and his {{acoustic}} guitar, {{but it has}} sparse auxiliary instrumentation as well. Most of the songs were recorded on John's Panasonic RX-FT500 boom box, but due to either mechanical failure or desire <b>for</b> <b>clearer</b> sound quality, he used a 4-track recording <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> some tracks.|$|R
50|$|Between 1965 and 1970 {{the track}} was lifted {{and much of}} the track ballast was removed. The {{woodland}} along many of the cuttings and embankment sides remained unmanaged until 2 April 1970 when British Railways Board sold much of the trackbed to Surrey County Council and Hambledon Rural District Council (which was succeeded by Waverley Borough Council in 1974) for £17,500. The local authorities managed the land until 1984, <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> to enable the general public {{to use it as a}} recreational facility.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{significant}} history of many Punjabis being dairy farmers throughout New Zealand, many of them being great pioneers. The majority are in the Waikato region and {{have been there for}} many generations. Much hard work was undertaken in terms of <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> and tea trees to convert to farmland in the early years. Embracing the Maori culture was also an important aspect. Many of these farmers are well respected within and outside the community for the significant contribution they have made.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, as Brisbane's gaol at Petrie Terrace {{became more and}} more crowded, about 30 prisoners were {{transferred}} to an old hulk, called the Proserpine, anchored near the mouth of the Brisbane River. In 1866, as part of their labours, the prisoners were taken each morning across the waters of Moreton Bay by whaleboat to St Helena Island. Here they were put to work sinking wells, <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub,</b> quarrying stone and building accommodation for a new quarantine station. They were brought back to the hulk each night.|$|R
50|$|Sheep {{and cattle}} graze at Farthing down to {{maintain}} the chalk grassland. The Corporation of London reintroduced this practise due to the decline of rabbits and the damage from corn farming in the past. Without proper grazing, stronger plants dominate and the biodiversity declines. Shepherds historically <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> and woodland <b>for</b> their stock {{to maintain the}} grassland. The scrub at Farthing down is now an ideal habitat for important species of birds. The natural spread of the scrub is managed to protect the grassland but not cleared entirely due to its habitat benefits.|$|R
50|$|During the {{construction}} of the Grand Union Canal where it flows through Boxmoor, the navvies who carried out the work lived on an encampment at Roughdown Common. The navvies where not the only group that made use of the Common; in 1809 a Good Friday funfair was held in the chalk pit, while 1939 saw the first recorded football match on the site, played by young evacuees from London. The war theme continued in 1946 when prisoners of war - who were based in a P.O.W. camp at nearby Howes Retreat - <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> at the site.|$|R
50|$|In October 1874, Doherty {{selected}} portion 21, parish of Pimpama (158 {{acres of}} second class pastoral land on Hotham Creek, on which Laurel Hill Farmhouse was later built). The block already contained some improvements, including a slab barn {{and a small}} humpy and about 12 acres of <b>scrub</b> <b>cleared</b> and partly under cultivation, for which Doherty paid £20, and was issued with a conditional lease on the property for 10 years from 1 January 1875. At {{the same time he}} selected the adjoining portion 31 with 135 acres, on which existing improvements comprised a bark-roofed barn, a small slab house, some <b>cleared</b> <b>scrub</b> and a small stockyard. It appears that the Dohertys resided on portion 31 from October 1874 until mid-1879, when they moved to portion 21. In 1879, Doherty also acquired the lease to portion 151, an 84-acre block which abutted the eastern boundary of portion 21.|$|R
50|$|According to one theory, it was {{a sudden}} change in climate, the Younger Dryas event (c. 10,800 to 9500 BC), that {{inspired}} the development of agriculture. The Younger Dryas was a 1,000-year-long interruption in the higher temperatures prevailing since the Last Glacial Maximum, which produced a sudden drought in the Levant. This would have endangered the wild cereals, which could no longer compete with dryland scrub, but upon which the population had become dependent to sustain a relatively large sedentary population. By artificially <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> and planting seeds obtained from elsewhere, they began to practice agriculture. However, this theory {{of the origin of}} agriculture is controversial in the scientific community.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of its}} route the Downs Link {{follows the}} course of two {{dismantled}} railways - the Cranleigh Line and the Steyning Line - both of which closed in the 1960s {{as a result of the}} Beeching Axe. Between 1965 and 1970 the track was lifted and much of the track ballast was removed. The coppiced woodland along many of the cuttings and embankment sides remained unmanaged until 2 April 1970 when ownership of much of the track was sold by the British Railways Board to Surrey County Council and Hambleton Rural District Council (which became Waverley Borough Council in 1974) for £17,500. The local authorities managed the land until 1984, <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> to allow the general public to use it as a recreational facility.|$|R

50|$|In 1984, Surrey County Council {{produced}} the first management plan for Chobham Common which acknowledged invading scrub, fire and erosion {{as the main}} threats to the site. The Surrey Trust for Nature Conservation (now renamed the Surrey Wildlife Trust) had carried out small-scale scrub clearance work from 1974 onwards and Surrey County Council began <b>clearing</b> <b>scrub</b> on the Common from the 1970s onwards; however despite their best efforts the scrub continued to advance. While describing birch and pine invasion on the Common as “Possibly the most serious problem for nature conservation” the 1984 Management Plan states, “Widespread invasion control is difficult to justify financially. Intervention management will therefore {{be limited to the}} more significant open habitats and places where an acceptable level of tree cover can be maintained at low cost”.|$|R
