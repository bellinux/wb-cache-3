5000|$|As an {{improved}} {{version of the}} above <b>model,</b> <b>child</b> protection workers were cut adrift from schools in the early 1990s in districts XV and XVI of Budapest. They were employed by the Educational Service Cabinet. Their duties were appointed by and they were superintended by the educational department of the local government. This model ended the above conflict of loyalties but it continued to use educational means and an educational approach in the resolution of a problem that could only partly be handled in this fashion. The model was criticized for two reasons. On the one hand, they continued to employ teachers, who were not qualified for child protection work. On the other hand, in state schools administration and the school social worker were both employed by the government. As a consequence, in a conflict between {{the school and the}} pupil the school social worker was not able to stand up for the child's rights when her/his own employer was the adversary. [...] The above two models has proved to be dead ends with respect to school social work. Yet the employment of child protection workers remained standard practice at schools.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of three different vocal timbres on uncertain singers' ability to match and discriminate pitches. Fifty-six children between six and eight year old were randomly assigned to one of four groups. In the Own Voices group, subjects were training in pitch matching using subjects' own voices. They trained in pitch discrimination using a <b>model</b> <b>child</b> voice as stimuli. In the <b>Model</b> <b>Child</b> group, subjects were training in pitch matching and pitch discrimination using a <b>model</b> <b>child</b> voice of the same sex and age as that of the subject. Subjects in the Female Adult group were training in pitch matching and pitch discrimination using a female adult voice as stimuli. Subjects in the control group had no training. It was found that timbre affected uncertain singers' ability to match and discriminate pitches. Pitch matching to one's own voice was more accurate than pitch matching to a child's voice. The discrimination of high and low pitches was more accurate when a model child's voice was used than when an adult voice was used...|$|E

40|$|Winett and Winkler aptly {{criticized the}} “appropriate” {{behaviors}} that behavior modifiers {{have chosen to}} change. However, after reviewing 14 Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis articles concerning behavior modification in the classroom, they made the sweeping over-generalization that “as currently practised, behavior modification has done very little to change the deplorable state of our schools. ” Finally, they suggest a free classroom in which learning is accompanied by “singing, laughing, and whistling. ” A number of studies not mentioned by Winett and Winkler are here presented to illustrate the innovative ways in which behavior modification has been utilized to change the complexion of classrooms from the elementary school to the college level. A strawman <b>model</b> <b>child</b> as purportedly seen by behavior modifiers was built by Winett and Winkler, but this author could not find one instance in the literature where the teacher or behavior modifier desired the behavior thus depicted by the straw-man <b>model</b> <b>child.</b> Furthermore, this author questions the desirability of the “informal” or “free” classroom approach for children with marked social and academic problems. Nonetheless, the general admonition of Winett and Winkler should definitely by taken seriously—namely the behavior modifier should seriously question the behaviors he is being asked to change. Finally, a possible integration of reinforcement principles and {{some aspects of the}} informal school are discussed...|$|E
