5|$|On 4 May, Magdalena was {{declared}} to {{be a total}} loss, making her the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to be lost on her maiden voyage. Her insurers paid out £2,295,000 to Royal Mail Lines by cheque on 16 May. At the time, this was the biggest payout for a <b>marine</b> <b>casualty</b> in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Built as a {{replacement}} for a ship lost during the Second World War, she was to serve on route between England and the east coast of South America. She was wrecked on her maiden voyage in 1949, the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to suffer this fate. The insurance payout of £2,295,000 was the largest made at the time for a <b>marine</b> <b>casualty</b> in the United Kingdom.

5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG <b>Marine</b> <b>Casualty</b> Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder.|$|E

40|$|It is {{essential}} to maintain the safety of ships that are anchored in offshore harbors to avoid the influence of storms. Recently, <b>marine</b> <b>casualties</b> have been reported on anchored ships stranded in coastal areas after their anchors dragged in stormy weather. However, there have been very few studies on anchored ship motions in waves with dynamic mooring forces. In this study, information on the safety of ships in offshore harbors during storms was gathered through a nationwide questionnaire. Because previous numerical models for reproducing reported situations of <b>marine</b> <b>casualties</b> appear flawed, this study considers the dynamic calculation of chain forces and compares the results with those obtained by the catenary method. A new algorithm is constructed to reproduce the dragging anchor and grounding in waves and winds. This study is expected {{to contribute to the}} improvement of port planning related to anchorage...|$|R

In this study, factors which affect <b>marine</b> <b>casualties</b> examined and determined with SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis method and weighting of the factors determined by using the AHP (analytic hierarchy process) method. With this approach, strategic action plans were developed for minimizing shipping casualties at the Strait of Istanbul, taking into account the weighting factors and previously happened accidents...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{maritime}} community reassessed {{the way that}} human element used to be treated. Quite a few researches showed a very high degree of correlation between human errors and <b>marine</b> <b>casualties.</b> This paper focuses in the significance of human errors in {{the maritime}} industry. The main objectives of this project are to identify the correlation of human errors and <b>marine</b> <b>casualties,</b> to identify the main factors leading to errors, to examine {{the responsibilities of the}} shipping companies in relation to the subject and to examine the efficiency of the legal measures adopted (SOLAS Convention, STCW Convention & ISM Code) in order to prevent errors and protect safety of property and life at sea. The methodology of this research identified all the variables which may lead to an increase or a reduction of human errors at sea. Also, secondary data concerning the number of <b>marine</b> <b>casualties</b> and their correlation to human errors were presented, analyzed and examined. Thus, questionnaires responded by people directly involved in the maritime industry resulted to valuable information in relation to the subject examined. The main outcomes exacted from this research are that the human errors are the main reason which leads to marine accidents, shipping companies own a great share of responsibility regarding human error onboard of their vessels and that some of the legal measures adopted for the minimization of the mistakes can be considered as sufficient while others cannot.
