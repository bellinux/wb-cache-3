EETC (Euro-Express trein charter), {{the owner of the}} AutoSlaapTrein, suspended their services in April 2015. Another Dutch company, the travel agency Treinreiswinkel, continued the Autoslaaptrein in May 2015 with a connection between Germany (Düsseldorf) and Verona.

50|$|The {{line has}} a Regional-Express {{service on the}} Munich-Ingolstadt-Treuchtlingen-Nuremberg route at two-hourly {{intervals}} and also Regionalbahn services on the Munich-Ingolstadt-Treuchtlingen route at two-hourly intervals. The two services together provide an hourly service; in addition extra Regionalbahn services operate during peak hours between Ingolstadt and Eichstätt. The line was formerly of great importance for long-distance traffic, but since 27 May 2006 all long distance services have run on the Nuremberg-Munich high-speed line. Prior to its discontinuance in December 2010 the line was served {{by a pair of}} Eurocity services (EN 482/483) on the Munich-Copenhagen route via Ingolstadt-Treuchtlingen, because the trains did not have the required approval to operate over the high-speed line. Currently the only long-distance services running over the line are <b>motorail</b> <b>trains</b> and seasonal services.|$|E
