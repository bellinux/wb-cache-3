A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> running for the seat again in the future.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> expropriating at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E

25|$|Amateur Microscopy is the {{investigation}} and observation of biological and non-biological specimens for recreational purposes. Collectors of minerals, insects, seashells, and plants may use microscopes as tools to uncover features that help them classify their collected items. Other amateurs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> observing the life found in pond water and of other samples. Microscopes may also prove useful for the water quality assessment for people that keep a home aquarium. Photographic documentation and drawing of the microscopic images are additional tasks that augment the spectrum of tasks of the amateur. There are even competitions for photomicrograph art. Participants of this pastime may either use commercially prepared microscopic slides or engage in the task of specimen preparation.|$|E

Critics described him as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "Byronic", and noted that he [...] "appeared every inch the cocky TV producer he aspired to be".

[...] Referencing the lyrics in [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that Cyrus was [...] "just not (yet) that thorny a girl" [...] despite visible efforts of rebellion. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian thought that Cyrus lost sight of her target audience with the project, noting that [...] "if you're old enough to stay up after 9:00 PM without asking permission, it's not intended for you" [...] while also commenting that children that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the record had likely [...] "transferred their affections" [...] to the then-teenage Justin Bieber.

For example, one <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{the heights of}} adult female penguins, but is unable to measure the height of every single penguin in a population due to cost or time constraints. [...] Assuming that the heights are normally distributed with some unknown mean and variance, the mean and variance can be estimated with MLE while only knowing the heights of some sample of the overall population. [...] MLE would accomplish this by taking the mean and variance as parameters and finding particular parametric values that make the observed results the most probable given the model.|$|E

[...] Significant Jewish populations also remain in Middle Eastern and North African countries outside of Israel, particularly Iran, Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen.

2500|$|Rather than {{inferring}} {{the ancestral}} DNA sequence, one <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the larger-scale molecular {{structure and content}} of an ancestral genome. This problem is often approached in a combinatorial framework, by modelling genomes as permutations of genes or homologous regions. Various operations are allowed on these permutations, such as an inversion (a segment of the permutation is reversed in-place), deletion (a segment is removed), transposition (a segment is removed {{from one part of}} the permutation and spliced in somewhere else), or gain of genetic content through recombination, duplication or horizontal gene transfer. The [...] "genome rearrangement problem", first posed by Watterson and colleagues, asks: given two genomes (permutations) and a set of allowable operations, what is the shortest sequence of operations that will transform one genome into the other? [...] A generalization of this problem applicable to ancestral reconstruction is the [...] "multiple genome rearrangement problem": given a set of genomes and a set of allowable operations, find (i) a binary tree with the given genomes as its leaves, and (ii) an assignment of genomes to the internal nodes of the tree, such that the total number of operations across the whole tree is minimized. [...] This approach is similar to parsimony, except that the tree is inferred along with the ancestral sequences. [...] Unfortunately, even the single genome rearrangement problem is NP-hard, although it has received much attention in mathematics and computer science (for a review, see Fertin and colleagues).|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} a satire {{of society as}} a whole, characterised by {{hypocrisy}} and opportunism, {{but it is not}} a reforming novel; there is no suggestion that social or political changes or greater piety and moral reformism could improve the nature of society. It thus paints a fairly bleak view of the human condition. This bleak portrait is continued with Thackeray's own role as an omniscient narrator, one of the writers best known for using the technique. He continually offers asides about his characters and compares them to actors and puppets, but his cheek goes even as far as his readers, accusing all who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> such [...] "Vanity Fairs" [...] as being either [...] "of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood". As Lord David Cecil remarked, [...] "Thackeray liked people, and for the most part he thought them well-intentioned. But he also saw very clearly that they were all in some degree weak and vain, self-absorbed and self-deceived." [...] Amelia begins as a warm-hearted and friendly girl, though sentimental and naive, but by the story's end she is portrayed as vacuous and shallow. Dobbin appears first as loyal and magnanimous, if unaware of his own worth; by the end of the story he is presented as a tragic fool, a prisoner of his own sense of duty who knows he is wasting his gifts on Amelia but is unable to live without her. The novel's increasingly grim outlook can take readers aback, as characters whom the reader at first holds in sympathy are shown to be unworthy of such regard.|$|E

30|$|Any {{objective}} approach {{must also}} be careful to recognize that some extreme regional changes are quite plausible and grounded in strong model physics. These <b>may</b> <b>be</b> of utmost <b>interest</b> to stakeholders {{and should not be}} too quickly dismissed. For example, a maize farmer <b>in</b> Iowa <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the probability that his crop fails (an event at the distributional tail) than the expected future yield (a value {{in the center of the}} distribution). A stakeholder that <b>is</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> simply stress-testing a system <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> selecting representative GCMs that bound the projected impacts than in establishing a probability of occurrence.|$|R
