Load-shedding is traditionally considered as the main mechanism to manage the network under power deficiency conditions.

30|$|Remote and {{regional}} areas are usually supplied by isolated and self-sufficient electricity systems, which are called as microgrids (MGs). To reduce {{the overall cost}} of electricity production, MGs rely on non-dispatchable renewable sources. Emergencies such as overloading or excessive generation by renewable sources {{can result in a}} substantial voltage or frequency deviation in <b>MGs.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents a supervisory controller for such emergencies. The key idea is to remedy the emergencies by optimal internal or external support. A multi-level controller with soft, intermedial and hard actions is proposed. The soft actions include the adjustment of the droop parameters of the sources and the controlling of the charge/discharge of energy storages. The intermedial action is exchanging power with neighboring MGs, which is highly probable in large remote areas. As the last remedying resort, curtailing loads or renewable sources are assumed as hard actions. The proposed controller employs an optimization technique consisting of certain objectives such as reducing power loss in the tie-lines amongst MGs and the dependency of an MG to other MGs, as well as enhancing the contribution of renewable sources in electricity generation. Minimization of the fuel consumption and emissions of conventional generators, along with frequency and voltage deviation, is the other desired objectives.

All MG’s components are modeled in detail. The devel-oped model is used to investigate how the transient dynamic performance of the MG will affected by increasing the rating of wind generation system installed in the MG. Two cases are studied; the first case investigates the dynamic performance of the MG equipped with 10 kW fixed speed wind generation system. The second studied case indicates how the dynamic performance of the MG will be affected if the wind generation system rating increases to 30 kW. The results showed that increasing of wind generation rating on the MG causes more voltage drops and more frequency fluctuations due to the fluctuation of wind speed. Increasing voltage drops because wind turbine generator is a squirrel cage induction generator and absorbs more reactive power when the generated active power increases. The frequency fluctuations due to power fluctuations of wind turbine as results of wind speed variations.

The each injury group was randomly divided into 4 subgroups (n= 8), 3, 6, 24 and 72 h groups. The division plate {{as a whole and}} the head of 8 rats in each injury group were measured for the peak value of the solid shock wave, its rising time and the duration time of shock wave propagation in solid. To observe the physiological changes of animals after injury, plasma samples were collected for determination of brain damage markers, NSE and S- 100 β. All the animals were sacrificed, the right hemisphere of the brain was taken in each group of animals, weighting after baking, and the brain water content was calculated. Pathological examination was performed for left cerebral hemisphere in 24 -h group. The normal pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA 1 region were counted. Results 　The peak value, rising time and duration time of shock wave propagation on the division plate and head were 1369. 74 ± 91. 70 g, 0. 317 ± 0. 037 ms and 24. 85 ± 2. 53 ms, 26. 83 ± 3. 09 g, 0. 901 ± 0. 077 ms and 104. 21 ± 6. 26 ms respectively in injury group 1, 1850. 11 ± 83. 86 g, 0. 184 ± 0. 031 ms and 35. 61 ± 2. 66 ms, 39. 75 ± 3. 14 g, 0. 607 ± 0. 069 ms and 132. 44 ± 7. 17 ms in injury group 2 (P< 0. 01). After the injury, there was no abnormality in the anatomy, and brain damage markers NSE, S- 100 β increased, reached the peak at 24 h, and they were highest in injury group 2 and lowest in control group with a statistically significant difference (P< 0. 05). The brain water content increased, reached the peak at 24 h, and was the highest in injury group 2 and the lowest in control group with a statistically significant difference (P< 0. 05). No visible change was observed in the brain of injury groups, but acute neuronal damages to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were observed under microscope. The neuronal density of hippocampal CA 1 subfield was the lowest in injury group 2 and the highest in control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions 　Shock wave propagation in solids from underwater explosion may lead to pathological changes such as brain edema and neuronal degeneration in rats, and cause mild traumatic brain injury in rats, thus, it is essential to strengthen prevention and care.

ED has large time-scale while AGC has small time-scale. Thus the gap between ED and AGC may decrease the economic efficiency of a <b>MG.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> a distributed optimal automatic generation control (OAGC) algorithm is proposed to integrate the gap between ED and AGC, i. e., the MG can realize AGC and ED at the same time. In order to implement the OAGC algorithm, each DG is assigned with an agent and the agents only require the local measurements and communicate with its neighbors. The proposed OAGC algorithm is fully distributed, which involves low costs related to modify the architecture of a MG and robust against single point failure. Simulation results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is an {{endocrine}} disrupting {{environmental contaminant}} {{used in a}} wide variety of products, and BPA metabolites are found in almost everyone’s urine, suggesting widespread exposure from multiple sources. Regulatory agencies estimate that virtually all BPA exposure is from food and beverage packaging. However, free BPA is applied to the outer layer of thermal receipt paper present in very high (, 20 <b>mg</b> BPA/g <b>paper)</b> quantities as a print developer. Not taken into account when considering thermal paper as a source of BPA exposure is that some commonly used hand sanitizers, as well as other skin care products, contain mixtures of dermal penetration enhancing chemicals that can increase by up to 100 fold the dermal absorption of lipophilic compounds such as BPA. We found that when men and women held thermal receipt paper immediately after using a hand sanitizer with penetration enhancing chemicals, significant free BPA was transferred to their hands and then to French fries that were eaten, and the combination of dermal and oral BPA absorption led to a rapid and dramatic average maximum increase (Cmax) in unconjugated (bioactive) BPA of, 7 ng/mL in serum and, 20 mg total BPA/g creatinine in urine within 90 min. The default method used by regulatory agencies to test for hazards posed by chemicals is intra-gastric gavage. For BPA this approach results in less than 1 % of the administered dose being bioavailable in blood. It also ignores dermal absorption as well as sublingual absorption in the mouth that both bypass first...|$|R
40|$|In islanding, {{a portion}} of the power network, {{comprised}} of the loads and distributed generation (DG) units, is isolated {{from the rest of the}} power grid and forms a micro grid (MG). In this condition, it becomes essential for the islanded MG to operate in a stable and controlled manner by providing ancillary services. When the MG is cut off from the main grid, the islanding must be detected by the DG units. In this condition it is essential that one of the controllers should be switched to the voltage-frequency (VF) control mode. In islanding, the network loses it slack reference and this reference is established by a VF controller. The voltage and the frequency of the islanded MG deviate when disconnected from the transmission grid and these deviations are caused by the load-generation imbalance. The voltage and the frequency of the islanded MG can be restored to the permissible limits if the desired/exceeded amount of active and reactive power is injected/absorbed by the locally available sources in islanded <b>MG.</b> This <b>paper</b> proposes a control strategy which can compensate the voltage and the frequency deviations in the islanded portion of the International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE) low voltage distribution network by using advanced power electronics devices such as STATCOMs) for Photovoltaic (PV) Units and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) STATCOMs (for battery units). The selection of the VF controller for the most suitable DG unit of this test network is also presented in this paper, and the effectiveness of the controllers is verified by presenting simulation results using DIgSILENT (DIgSILENT GmbH, Gomaringen, Germany) power factory software version 15. 0...|$|R
