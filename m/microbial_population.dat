5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different <b>microbial</b> <b>population</b> in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E
25|$|Men {{generally}} do not shave their legs in any culture. However, leg-shaving is a generally accepted practice in modeling. It is also fairly common in sports where the hair removal makes the athlete appreciably faster by reducing drag; the most common case of this is competitive swimming. It is also practiced in other sports such as cycling, in which skin injuries are common: the absence of grown hair makes nicks, scratches and bruises heal faster because of the reduced <b>microbial</b> <b>population</b> on shaved skin.|$|E

2500|$|Like plants, animals {{display a}} range of {{abilities}} to cope with fire, but they differ from plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although birds are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit {{from being able to}} take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some birds are potentially responsible for intentional fire propagation to flush out prey. [...] Mammals are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. Amphibians and reptiles may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud. Some arthropods also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril. Microbial organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but {{are more likely to be}} able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire. The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil <b>microbial</b> <b>population</b> diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover. Certain species of fungi, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cooked bean powders are a {{promising}} novel protein and fiber source for dogs, which have demonstrated potential to alter microbial composition and function for chronic {{disease control and}} prevention. This study aimed to determine the impact of cooked navy bean powder fed as a staple food ingredient on the fecal microbiome of healthy adult pet dogs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fecal samples from healthy dogs prior to dietary control and after 4 wk of dietary treatment with macro- and micronutrient matched diets containing either 0 or 25 % cooked navy beans (n =  11 and n =  10, respectively) were analyzed by 454 -pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. There were few differences between dogs fed the control and navy bean diets after 4 wk of treatment. These data indicate {{that there were no}} major effects of navy bean inclusion on <b>microbial</b> <b>populations.</b> However, significant differences due to dietary intervention onto both research diets were observed (i. e., <b>microbial</b> <b>populations</b> at baseline versus 4 wk of intervention with 0 or 25 % navy bean diets). After 4 wk of dietary intervention on either control or navy bean diet, the Phylum Firmicutes was increased and the Phyla Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria were decreased compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: No negative alterations of <b>microbial</b> <b>populations</b> occurred following cooked navy bean intake in dogs, indicating that bean powders may be a viable protein and fiber source for commercial pet foods. The highly variable <b>microbial</b> <b>populations</b> observed in these healthy adult pet dogs at baseline is one potential reason for the difficulty to detect alterations in <b>microbial</b> <b>populations</b> following dietary changes. Given the potential physiological benefits of bean intake in humans and dogs, further evaluation of the impacts of cooked navy bean intake on fecal <b>microbial</b> <b>populations</b> with higher power or more sensitive methods are warranted...|$|R
