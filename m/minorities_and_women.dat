Alpha Kappa Alpha was incorporated on January 29, 1913.|$|E

In particular, {{she worked with}} the Whittier Union High School District. Friends urged her to try for elective office, and so in 1985, she ran for the Board of Trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought {{to increase the number}} of tenured faculty positions held by <b>minorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> She joined several California chambers of commerce, women's organizations, and Latino organizations. She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, a political mentor. Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator Art Torres.|$|E

25|$|Guste pleased liberals {{by being}} a strong defender of affirmative action. He {{submitted}} an amicus curiae brief in the 1986-1987 case Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, California {{on behalf of a}} female county employee who was promoted over an equally-qualified male employee. The plan provided that, in making promotions to positions within a traditionally segregated job classification in which women have been significantly underrepresented, the transportation agency was authorized to consider as one factor the sex of a qualified applicant. The agency said that women were represented in numbers far less than their proportion of the county labor force. Therefore, the county plan was intended to achieve a statistically measurable yearly improvement in the hiring, training, and promotion of <b>minorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the county government that the voluntary affirmative-action plan did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|E

The First Delta Days in the Nations Capital was held in 1990 in Washington, D.C. At the event Delta members met with congressional members to discuss policy that affected <b>minorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> In 1992, Delta Sigma Theta became the first African American organization to collaborate with Habitat for Humanity, and has built hundreds of houses for those in need. Delta held its Summit III, preparing young men for manhood, in 1993, in response to alarming drop out and incarceration rates among young men. And in 1996, in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity, Delta traveled to Ghana and built 40 homes. Delta adopted the Adelaide Tambo school for the Physically Disabled in South Africa. In that same year, Delta received $1.6 million from NSF for project SEE , and traveled to Swaziland, South Africa to break ground for the Delta house that would be housing for children who became orphans due to their parents dying from HIV/AIDS, and dedicated the computer training center in Lesotho. In 2002, Delta was the second African American organization, after NCNW, to receive Special Consultative NGO status with the United Nations.|$|E
500|$|According to Children and Television, Lesser's {{account of}} the {{development}} and early years of Sesame Street, there was little criticism of the show {{in the months following}} its premiere, but it increased {{at the end of its}} first season and beginning of the second season. Lesser put the early criticism into four categories: educational goals, how the goals were chosen and obtained, the show's possible unintended effects, and its portrayal of <b>minorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> Historian Robert W. Morrow suggested that much of the early criticism, which he called [...] "surprisingly intense", stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, [...] "the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them".|$|E

Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law; titled [...] "A Latina Judge's Voice"; it was published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal the following spring. [...] In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of <b>minorities</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> ascending to the federal bench. [...] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was [...] "shocking". She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge. [...] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent. An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time. [...] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.|$|E

This testimony discusses findings from a June 2006 GAO report and more recent work on diversity in the financial services industry. Specifically, GAO assesses (1) what the available data show about diversity at the management level from 1993 through 2006 and (2) steps that the industry has taken to promote workforce diversity and the challenges involved. To address the testimony's objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); reviewed select studies; and interviewed officials from financial services firms, trade organizations, and organizations that represent <b>minority</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> professionals. ...|$|R
