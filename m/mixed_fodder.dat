40|$|The most {{important}} {{task in the}} development of the diet of farm animals feeding is a selection of the most balanced in its composition and most nutritious feeds, which are safe and meet all the necessary requirements at the same time. To evaluate the productive value of feeds and their effectiveness the rate of food productive action η was proposed. This ratio reflects the productive part of the total value of the exchange energy of the daily feed ration and is an essential criterion of the feed quality indicators. In the feed rations of animals the most expensive, but energy-rich feed is a <b>mixed</b> <b>fodder,</b> a mixture of grinded seeds of agricultural crops and protein, mineral and vitamin additives. In the diet for its nutritional value, this feed product is for cattle – 50, pigs – 60 … 100 and birds – 100 %. The basic operation in the production of mixed fodder is seeds grinding, i. e. their destruction under the influence of external forces, exceeding the forces of molecular adhesion of the grains particles. To grind the grain different ways are used: chopping, grinding, impact «in flight», crushing, etc. In the production of <b>mixed</b> <b>fodder</b> on the existing production equipment, there is the problem of getting the grain <b>mixed</b> <b>fodder</b> the necessary degree of grinding and uniform in its particle size distribution at the same time.

It is expected, that testing the fodders to obtain the best effect in the optimizationof the performances in rearing the target fish species. The experiment {{has taken place in}} conditions of anintensive system in ground ponds (pond no 8 - HC 8 and pond no 9 - HC 9), at the Nucet Fish Farm(Experimental Base), with the two experimental feeding variants: I. feeding the material with non conventionalfodders (30 % protein) in HC 8, and II. feeding the material with <b>mixed</b> <b>fodders</b> (24. 86 %crude protein) in HC 9. Taking into consideration the almost identical environmental conditions and thepopulation density the rearing of the fish depends on additional food given and its quality.

Using good quality stockingbiological material (obtained in summer I), a “cheap formula” for feeding, a good quality and volume ofwater, it is possible to get fish that can be delivered on the market at the required dimensions next year. Taking into account the obtained production using conventional and non-conventional fodders and havingin view their price, we can conclude that fodders from the aquaculture market can be successfullyreplaced with non-conventional ones, which have a more affordable price, resulting in a lower cost perkilogram of fish in the case of mixed culture C. carpio and P. spathula...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of replacing soybean meal with mixtures of rapeseed press cake (RPC) and legume seeds in sow and piglet diets was evaluated {{in an experiment}} on 30 sows and their progeny. Group I (control) received standard feed mixture containing soybean meal as the main protein source, group II – RPC <b>mixed</b> with <b>fodder</b> pea, group III – field bean, group IV – blue lupine, group V – yellow lupine. Weaned piglets received mixtures containing RPC and legume mixtures. Considerable {{differences were found in}} amino acid composition of proteins. Differences in the apparent digestibility of essential nutrients were statistically insignificant. Sows fed with field bean and yellow lupine gave birth to heaviest piglets. After weaning piglets receiving field bean were characterized by the best weight gains. It is concluded that mixing rapeseed cake with legume seeds allows for the complete replacement of soybean meal in sow diets and for partial replacement in piglet diets...|$|R
