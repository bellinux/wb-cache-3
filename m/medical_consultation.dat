25|$|A major {{complaint}} among {{postmenopausal women}} is decreased libido, and many may seek <b>medical</b> <b>consultation</b> for this. Several hormonal changes take {{place during the}} menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels {{and an increase in}} follicle-stimulating hormone. For most women, the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages. Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the postmenopausal period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition. However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.|$|E

500|$|A {{physical}} examination, sometimes {{combined with}} a psychological examination, can determine whether {{the onset of the}} disease has begun. [...] Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking <b>medical</b> <b>consultation.</b> [...] If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. [...] Cognitive or behavioral symptoms are rarely the first symptoms diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further. [...] How far the disease has progressed can be measured using the unified Huntington's disease rating scale, which provides an overall rating system based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments. [...] Medical imaging, such as computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, as seen in the illustration to the right, but these changes are not, by themselves, diagnostic of HD. [...] Cerebral atrophy {{can be seen in the}} advanced stages of the disease. [...] Functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), can show changes in brain activity before the onset of physical symptoms, but they are experimental tools, and are not used clinically.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{look back}} at that eventful morning, I recall a scene of {{confusion}} and suspense, the bare recollection of which seems to upset my mind again, even at this distance of time. Things and persons all blend distractedly one with another. I see the charming figure of my blind Lucilla, robed in rose-color and white, flitting hither and thither, {{in the house and}} out of the house--at one time mad with impatience for the arrival of the surgeons; at another, shuddering with apprehension of the coming ordeal, and the coming disappointment which might follow. A moment more--and, just as my mind has seized it, the fair figure melts and merges into the miserable apparition of Oscar; hovering and hesitating between Browndown and the rectory; painfully conscious of the new complications introduced into his position towards Lucilla by the new state of things; and yet not man enough, even yet, to seize the opportunity, and set himself right. Another moment passes, and a new figure--a little strutting consequential figure forces its way into the foreground, before I am ready for it. I hear a big voice booming in my ear, with big language to correspond. [...] "No, Madame Pratolungo, nothing will induce me to sanction by my presence this insane <b>medical</b> <b>consultation,</b> this extravagant and profane attempt to reverse the decrees of an all-wise Providence by purely human means. My foot is down--I use the language of the people, observe, to impress it the more strongly on your mind--My FOOT is down!" [...] Another moment yet, and Finch and Finch's Foot disappear over my mental horizon just as my eye has caught them. Damp Mrs. Finch, and the baby whose everlasting programme is suction and sleep, take the vacant place. Mrs. Finch pledges me with watery earnestness to secrecy; and then confides her intention of escaping her husband's supervision if she can, and bringing British surgery and German surgery to bear both together (gratis) on baby's eyes. Conceive these persons all twisting and turning in the convolutions of my brains, as if those brains were a labyrinth; with the sayings and doings of one, confusing themselves with the sayings and doings of the other--with a thin stream of my own private anxieties (comprehending luncheon on a side-table for the doctors) trickling at intervals through it all--and you will not wonder if I take a jump, like a sheep, over some six hours of precious time, and present my solitary self to your eye, posted alone in the sitting-room to receive the council of surgeons on its arrival at the house. I had but two consolations to sustain me.|$|E

The influence of gender and ethnicity remains significant after adjusting for age and socioeconomic conditions (OR = 1. 11; 1. 49 and 1. 86 respectively). Differences between blacks and whites decrease with age, but increase with socioeconomic status. There were 10 % more <b>medical</b> <b>consultations</b> among white individuals.
