40|$|Abstract Background <b>Malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of the {{pancreas}} {{has become one}} of the leading causes of death from <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> in Japan (the 5 th in 2003). Although smoking is believed to be a risk factor, other risk factors remain unclear. Mortality from <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of {{the pancreas}} tends to be higher in northern Japan and in northern European countries. A recent study reported that standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of the pancreas were negatively correlated to global solar radiation level. People residing in regions with lower solar radiation and lower temperatures may be at higher risk of development of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of the pancreas. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between SMRs for <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of the pancreas and climatic factors, such as the amount of global solar radiation and the daily maximum temperature in Japan. Results The study used multiple linear regression models. Number of deaths and demographic data from 1998 to 2002 were used for the calculation of SMR. We employed mesh climatic data for Japan published in 2006 by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Regression coefficients for the amount of global solar radiation and the daily maximum temperature in males were - 4. 35 (p = 0. 00034) and - 2. 81 (p Conclusion This study suggested that low solar radiation and low temperature might relate to the increasing risk of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of the pancreas. Use of group data has a limitation in the case of evaluating environmental factors affecting health, since the impact of climatic factors on the human body varies according to individual lifestyles and occupations. Use of geographical mesh climatic data, however, proved useful as an index of risk or beneficial factors in a small study area. Further research using individual data is necessary to elucidate the relationship between climatic factors and the development of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasm</b> of the pancreas. </p...|$|R

25|$|DNA {{damage is}} {{considered}} to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, damage can accumulate. Such damage can cause mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Accumulated damage can also cause epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms).</b>|$|E

25|$|Immunotherapy {{developed}} in the 1970s following {{the discovery of the}} structure of antibodies and the development of hybridoma technology, which provided the first reliable source of monoclonal antibodies. These advances allowed for the specific targeting of tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Initial research on <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> found mAb therapy of limited and generally short-lived success with blood malignancies. Treatment also had to be tailored to each individual patient, which was impracticable in routine clinical settings.|$|E
25|$|Following these {{clinical}} {{trails of}} hCG vaccination as a birth control method, hCG was discovered {{to be expressed}} in certain kinds of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms,</b> including breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, progressive vulvar carcinoma, carcinoma of the bladder, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cervical carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, lung carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. Therefore, immunity against hCG has applications such as imaging of cancer cells, selective delivery of cytotoxic compounds to tumor cells, and {{in at least one}} case, direct therapeutic effect by preventing establishment, inhibiting the growth, and causing the necrosis of tumors. This has led to interest in developing hCG vaccines specifically for cancer treatment.|$|E

25|$|The pre-procedure mammograms were {{negative}} for <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms.</b> The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients). The autologous adipocyte tissue was grafted in one-to-three stages; the average volume of a tissue-graft was 278.6cm3 {{of fat per}} operation, per breast. Post-procedure, each patient was instructed to regard any lump in the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed. Moreover, the study Cell-assisted Lipotransfer for Cosmetic Breast Augmentation: Supportive Use of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells (2007), about a 40-woman cohort, indicated that the inclusion of adipose stem cells to the grafts of adipocyte fat increased the rate of corrective success of the autologous fat-grafting procedure.|$|E

Thus, lymphomas and leukemias are both tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, and as lymphoproliferative disorders, lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are closely related, to the point that some of them are unitary disease entities that can be called by either name (for example, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).|$|E

2500|$|About 70% of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> have no {{hereditary}} component and {{are called}} [...] "sporadic cancers". Only {{a minority of}} sporadic cancers have a deficiency in DNA repair due to mutation in a DNA repair gene. [...] However, a majority of sporadic cancers have deficiency in DNA repair due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence DNA repair gene expression. [...] For example, of 113 sequential colorectal cancers, only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration). [...] Five reports present evidence that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.|$|E
2500|$|Withdrawal {{effects and}} {{dependence}} are also almost identical. Alcohol at moderate levels has some {{positive and negative}} effects on health. The negative effects include increased risk of liver diseases, oropharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer and pancreatitis. Conversely moderate intake of alcohol may have some beneficial effects on gastritis and cholelithiasis. Of {{the total number of}} deaths and diseases caused by alcohol, most happen to {{the majority of the population}} who are moderate drinkers, rather than the heavy drinker minority. Chronic alcohol misuse and abuse has serious effects on physical and mental health. Chronic excess alcohol intake, or alcohol dependence, can lead to a wide range of neuropsychiatric or neurological impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms.</b> The psychiatric disorders which are associated with alcoholism include major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, neurologic deficits (e.g. impairments of working memory, emotions, executive functions, visuospatial abilities and gait and balance) and brain damage. Alcohol dependence is associated with hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke, cancer of the respiratory system, and also cancers of the digestive system, liver, breast and ovaries. Heavy drinking is associated with liver disease, such as cirrhosis. [...] Excessive alcohol consumption can have a negative impact on aging.|$|E
2500|$|DNA {{damage is}} {{considered}} to be the primary underlying cause of <b>malignant</b> <b>neoplasms</b> known as cancers. [...] Its central role in progression to cancer is illustrated in the figure in this section, in the box near the top. (The central features of DNA damage, epigenetic alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.) [...] DNA damage is very common. [...] Naturally occurring DNA damages (mostly due to cellular metabolism and the properties of DNA in water at body temperatures) occur at a rate of more than 60,000 new damages, on average, per human cell, per day [...] [...] Additional DNA damages can arise from exposure to exogenous agents. [...] Tobacco smoke causes increased exogenous DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. UV light from solar radiation causes DNA damage that is important in melanoma. Helicobacter pylori infection produces high levels of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and contributes to gastric cancer. Bile acids, at high levels in the colons of humans eating a high fat diet, also cause DNA damage and contribute to colon cancer. Katsurano et al. indicated that macrophages and neutrophils in an inflamed colonic epithelium are the source of reactive oxygen species causing the DNA damages that initiate colonic tumorigenesis. [...] Some sources of DNA damage are indicated in the boxes {{at the top of the}} figure in this section.|$|E
