500|$|In the event, the {{government}} was soundly defeated on 12 October, losing {{more than half its}} seats in parliament. To add to his humiliation, Bruce was defeated in his own seat of Flinders by Labor challenger Jack Holloway. On paper, there was no indication that Bruce was in any danger of losing his seat; he held Flinders with a reasonably safe majority of 10.7 percent in 1928. [...] However, on the second count Holloway picked up enough preferences from an independent Liberal candidate to give him the victory. Bruce was the first sitting prime minister to lose his own seat, a feat which would not be repeated until 2007. [...] He was measured in defeat however, stating, [...] "The people have said they do not want <b>my</b> <b>services,</b> and I am going into the banishment to which they have sent me." ...|$|E
500|$|Britten, {{though a}} {{reluctant}} conductor and a nervous pianist, was greatly sought after in both capacities. The piano accompanist Gerald Moore {{wrote in his}} memoirs about playing at all the main music festivals except for Aldeburgh, because [...] "as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world, <b>my</b> <b>services</b> are not needed". Britten's recital partnership with Pears was his best-known collaboration, but he also accompanied Kathleen Ferrier, Rostropovich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James Bowman and John Shirley-Quirk, among others. Though usually too nervous to play piano solos, Britten often performed piano duets with Clifford Curzon or Richter, and chamber music with the Amadeus Quartet. The composers whose works, other than his own, he most often played were Mozart and Schubert; the latter, in Murray Perahia's view, was Britten's greatest idol. As a boy and young man, Britten had intensely admired Brahms, but his admiration waned to nothing, and Brahms seldom featured in his repertory.|$|E

500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering <b>my</b> <b>services.</b> And even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E
500|$|To {{spread his}} costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] In November 1939 {{the first issue}} of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three of the magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig, who was a pacifist, received his military call-up. [...] He decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector; he continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards that he [...] "would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim, a member of a group of aspiring writers called the Futurians, heard about the offer. [...] Wollheim told Robert W. Lowndes, another member of the Futurians, about the opening, and urged him to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that {{it might be a good}} idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering <b>my</b> <b>services</b> as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig.|$|E
500|$|Saumarez {{was widely}} praised for his conduct in {{only the second}} {{successful}} frigate action of the war after Edward Pellew's capture of Cléopâtre four months earlier at the Action of 18 June 1793. In reward, Saumarez was knighted by King George III and given a presentation plate by the City of London, although Saumarez later received a bill for £103 6s and 8d (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ), from a Mr. Cooke for [...] "the honour of a knighthood". Saumarez refused to pay, telling Cooke to charge whomever had paid for Edward Pellew's knighthood after his successful action. Saumarez later wrote to his brother that [...] "I think it hard to pay so much for an honour which <b>my</b> <b>services</b> have been thought to deserve". In recognition of his success, Saumarez was subsequently given command of a frigate squadron operating against the Normandy coast from the Channel Islands. In addition, the first lieutenant, George Parker, was promoted to commander and the two other lieutenants were also praised. Réunion was purchased for service with the Royal Navy after repairs had been completed, and became HMS Reunion, rated as a 36-gun frigate carrying 12 pounder cannon. Authorisation for the payment of prize money {{was published in the}} London Gazette on 4 February 1794, amounting to £5,239 (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ) divided between the men of Crescent and Circe. More than five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from Crescent still living in 1847.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] When {{he had worked}} for Gernsback, Silberkleit had suggested [...] "Future Fiction" [...] as a possible title for the magazine Gernsback was planning to launch. [...] Gernsback eventually chose [...] "Amazing Stories" [...] instead, and Silberkleit now decided to use his original suggestion {{for one of the}} new magazines. [...] In November 1939 the first issue of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three magazines.

[...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. [...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I knew what I was doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E

I provided <b>my</b> <b>services</b> as a soldier to the Taliban last year from about August to December. In the course of doing so, I carried a rifle and two grenades. I did so knowingly and willingly knowing that it was illegal." [...] Lindh said that he [...] "went to Afghanistan {{with the intention of}} fighting against terrorism and oppression," [...] fighting for the suffering of ordinary people {{at the hands of the}} Northern Alliance. On October 4, 2002, Judge T.S. Ellis, III formally imposed the sentence: 20 years without possibility of parole.|$|E

He promised: [...] "If I do not make as good yarn, as they do in England, I will have nothing for <b>my</b> <b>services,</b> but will throw the whole of what I have attempted over the bridge." [...] In 1790, he signed a contract with Brown to replicate the British designs. Their deal provided Slater the funds to build the water frames and associated machinery, with a half share in their capital value and the profits derived from them. By December, the shop was operational with ten to twelve workers. By 1791, Slater had some machinery in operation, despite shortages of tools and skilled mechanics. In 1793, Slater and Brown opened their first factory in Pawtucket.|$|E
