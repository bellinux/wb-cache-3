5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} peregrine falcon population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no peregrine falcons were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, peregrine falcon populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> take place, only 324 pairs of peregrine falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Wings for My Flight: The Peregrine Falcons of Chimney Rock is a 1991 book by American {{wildlife}} biologist Marcy Cottrell Houle. Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> documents Houle's observations {{of a pair}} of the then-endangered peregrine falcons at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in Colorado, while employed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the summer of 1975. To protect the falcons, Houle had to halt a million-dollar project to turn ancient Anasazi ruins in the area into a tourist attraction and faced opposition and harassment by the Chimney Rock community as a result. The community eventually showed concern for Houle, however, after her trailer was broken into and vandalized.|$|E
5|$|During the {{peregrine}} falcon decline, Houle studied biology at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block scheduling system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe {{peregrine falcon}} activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E

The book was republished in 1999 by Pruett Publishing with a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. The book was updated again in 2014 and republished by the University of New Mexico Press with photographs and a preface by Houle touching upon {{the recovery of the}} peregrine falcon. In May 1996, the children's magazine Cricket published a short story written by Houle titled [...] "Albert", adapted from Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight.</b> Reception to Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> has generally been positive. In 1991, the book co-received the Oregon Book Award, which promotes literature by Oregon-based authors. Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> was also awarded a Christopher Award for books in 1992, which recognizes works that [...] "affirm the highest values of the human spirit". The Library Journal described it as [...] "well-crafted and compelling", while the Los Angeles Times referred to it as [...] "heartfelt", although [...] "naive and overdrawn at times".|$|E
500|$|Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> {{was first}} {{published}} in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled [...] "Albert" [...] that was adapted from Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight,</b> focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book {{was first published}} in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying [...] "I felt more comfortable changing the names because I worked for so long with those people, it was impossible to be honest about them if I named them".|$|E
500|$|Dolores and Roger Flaherty wrote a {{positive}} {{review in the}} Chicago Sun-Times, noting how [...] "Houle blends elements of adventure, romance, humor and pathos {{in the story of}} her rookie summer as a wildlife biologist. Along the way she offers vivid descriptions of her skydiving subjects and the seductive beauty of the wilderness." [...] David M. Schwartz, in the May 1992 edition of Smithsonian, praised Houle's prose in Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight,</b> and wrote that the story is [...] "told with a charming simplicity in fewer than 200 pages". Schwartz also praised Houle for including her notational system for documenting field observations, stating that it [...] "opens a window on field biology". Writing in the Library Journal, Henry T. Armistead referred to the book as [...] "well crafted and compelling, a dramatization of the classic conflict between the legitimate interests of conservationists and developers", and, [...] "highly recommended on several levels, as science, sociology, or a story". Andrew Gulliford, a professor of history and environmental studies at Fort Lewis College, noted in The Durango Herald the significance of Houle's efforts to prevent [...] "inappropriate development" [...] at Chimney Rock, which was proclaimed a U.S. National Monument by President Barack Obama in 2012. [...] "Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> is a personal story", wrote Gulliford, [...] "but also a chronicle of environmental success. Without a doubt, peregrines saved Chimney Rock for the rest of us." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{events of}} Wings for <b>My</b> <b>Flight</b> take place {{throughout}} 1975. Marcy Cottrell Houle (then [...] "Marcy Cottrell"), a 21-year-old wildlife biologist, is sent by her supervisor, Barry Layne, to the U.S. Forest Service office near Chimney Rock in Colorado, where {{a pair of}} peregrine falcons reside. The pair {{is one of only}} seven pairs remaining in the Rocky Mountains region. Mr. Preston Fitch, an administrator involved with the peregrine falcon project, criticizes Houle for her lack of experience in the field upon meeting her. Nevertheless, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to Chimney Rock. He explains that the Forest Service spent {{more than half a million}} dollars building a road which led to Chimney Rock; work on the road had to be discontinued upon discovery of the falcons. Further, the Chimney Rock area is home to 250 Anasazi ruins dated between 900 and 1100. The Chimney Rock community had been planning a million-dollar development to build a tourist attraction for the ruins. Houle spends several weeks with the peregrine falcons, recording her observations in her notebook. In spite of her initial attempt at maintaining an impersonal relationship with the falcons, Houle names the female peregrine [...] "Jenny" [...] and the male [...] "King Arthur". In the middle of June, after Houle had spent several days of making field observations alone and with limited equipment, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to her teammate, Alex Porter. He also provides them with a garbage truck for transportation.|$|E

2500|$|At 15:04 <b>my</b> <b>flight</b> was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is <b>my</b> <b>flight</b> engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
