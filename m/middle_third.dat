5|$|The {{first four}} Grizzlies seasons had given average {{attendance}} in the <b>middle</b> <b>third</b> of the league. However, {{the last two}} seasons saw a reduction to among the league's lowest attendances; participating reasons were the team's poor performance and the 1998–99 NBA lockout. Contributing to the conditions for relocation were a weak Canadian dollar, unwillingness of some U.S. players to live in Canada, and lack of local ownership.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the <b>middle</b> <b>third</b> contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E

25|$|The SDFT is {{narrower}} in its <b>middle</b> <b>third</b> {{than its}} top or bottom sections, making it weaker. The {{top and bottom}} of the SDFT has a better supply of blood as well, with the top third supplied by the vessels from the knee, and the bottom third supplied by the vessels in the fetlock. The <b>middle</b> <b>third</b> has a poor supply of blood, relying on the tiny vessels of the peritendon (the membrane that surrounds the tendons). If this supply is for some reason compromised, the collagen fibers in the area may die, weakening the tendon in that area and making it more likely to tear.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare microtensile bond {{strengths}} (µTBS) of glass fiber posts to different parts of intra-radicular dentin using conventional method and one-shot technique under different light intensities. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight single-rooted teeth were prepared to receive fiber posts: Group 1 : Conventional method at light intensity of 600 mW/cm 2; Groups 2, 3 and 4 : One-shot technique at light intensities of 600, 800 and 1000 mW/cm 2 respectively. Dumb-bell-shaped slices were obtained from the samples and submitted to micro-tensile testing. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and paired-samples t-test. Results: There were no significant differences in µTBS values of the cervical and <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> between the groups (P> 0. 05). µTBS values in the cervical thirds in groups 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those in the <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> (P> 0. 05). However, there were no such differences in groups 1 and 4 (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: It is proper to simultaneously cure the resin cement and the adhesive agent (one-shot technique); however, in that case, high light intensities (1000 mW/cm 2) are rec-ommended to achieve identical bond strength values in the cervical and <b>middle</b> <b>thirds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we develop methods for {{determining}} the asymptotic behavior of rational points on the Cantor <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> set. Particularly we are concerned with how many reduced rational points with denominators from 1 to N lie on the set. 1. Definitions To facilitate our exploration of rational points in the Cantor <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> set, we have included several key definitions. Definition 1. 1. A rational number pq ∈ Q is a Cantor rational if it meets the following conditions: (1) pq is in the Cantor <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> set, as defined in [1] (2) p and q are relatively prime, i. e. pq is in reduced form. Denote the Cantor rationals by the symbol MQ. Hereafter, abbreviate “ pq is a Cantor rational ” by pq ∈ MQ. Because we are working towards estimating {{the total number of}} Cantor rationals with denominator q, where 1 ≤ q ≤ N, we must introduce the notation we will use to denote this sum. Definition 1. 2. Define An to be the set of Cantor rationals with denominator n. Define |An | to be the number of elements in An. Definition 1. 3. Define Cn to be the total number of Cantor rationals with de...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of cervical preflaring on the determination of the first file that binds at working length (WL) in buccal roots of maxillary premolars. Five groups (n= 10) were formed at random and, after standard access cavities, the WL was determined 1 mm short from the apex. In group 1, the initial apical file was inserted without preflaring of cervical and <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> of the root canals. In groups 2 to 5, the cervical and <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> were enlarged with sizes 90 and 110 Gates-Glidden drills, K 3 Orifice Opener instruments, ProTaper instruments and LA Axxess burs, respectively. Canals were sized manually with K-files, starting with # 08 K-files inserted passively up to the WL. File sizes were increased until a binding sensation was felt at the WL and the size of the instrument was recorded. Transversal sections of the WL regions were examined under scanning electron microscopy and the discrepancies between the canal diameter and first file to bind at the WL were assessed. Significant differences (p 0. 05) between their results (83. 2 µm and 73. 6 µm, respectively). The discrepancy for ProTaper instruments was 35. 4 µm on average. In conclusion, the instrument binding technique for determination of the anatomical diameter at the WL was not precise. Preflaring of the cervical and <b>middle</b> <b>thirds</b> improved the determination of the anatomical diameter at the WL, and the type of instrument played a major role. Canals preflared with LA Axxess burs showed a more accurate binding of the files to anatomical diameter...|$|R
