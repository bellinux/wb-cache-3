5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) receive memories showing that they had lived and died on Earth 2,000 years ago. Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has Leoben (Callum Keith Rennie) help track the origins of the beacon. However, what they find is a crashed Colonial Viper, containing a corpse with Starbuck's dog tags. After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her, Leoben becomes scared and retreats, with Thrace wondering what she is. In shock, Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre, and decides to not tell anyone about what she found, <b>making</b> <b>people</b> believe she lost the signal.|$|E

25|$|For most exchanges, forward {{contracts}} were standard at the time. However, most forward contracts {{were not}} honored {{by both the}} buyer and the seller.

Additionally, the forward contracts market was very illiquid and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of <b>making</b> <b>people</b> bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller.|$|E

25|$|Apparent {{correlation}} between heredity and {{behavior may be}} due to social stereotypes <b>making</b> <b>people</b> with certain physical characteristics (which may be hereditary physical characteristics) behave in certain ways, without any biological link between the genetic factor and the behavior. This violatates the equal environment assumption of twin design and suggests a stronger argument for environmental influences. This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for behaviors that are culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those who consider them to be biological than by those who consider them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial). Such unequal environment biases may concentrate on {{a relatively small number of}} minor physical characteristics that are subject to stereotypes that are considered to be politically correct, with no statistically significant effect on overall ratings of physical similarity, let alone anywhere near being able to pass identical twins off as being fraternal.|$|E

25|$|Around the time, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} in the imperial court {{over the issue of}} restoring the nobles to their fiefs and allowing them to govern from their respective fiefs. When Emperor Wu sought his opinion, Xun Xu disapproved because he believed that since the nobles also held gubernatorial appointments, they might neglect their original jurisdictions once they return to their respective fiefs. He also pointed out the possible complications such as having to subdivide the fiefs into commanderies and counties, as well as the risk of <b>making</b> <b>people</b> unhappy since the subdividing would require relocating residents from one area to another. He further pointed out that they would need to reassign troops from the borders and place them under decentralised command in the various fiefs. When Emperor Wu asked Xun Xu to reconsider his views, Xun Xu explained further that the best course of action was to maintain the status quo, since the redrawing of boundaries between the fiefs might lead to resentment and potential unrest if it was not carefully managed. He also pointed out that there were far more important issues that required immediate attention, so they should focus on those first. Emperor Wu thought that Xun Xu's advice was appropriate and heeded it.|$|E
