Also in the book of Thomas The Tank Engine in which he appeared (New Little Engine) it was announced he was named after the former Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Skarloey Railway, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ivo</b> Hugh. This is a reference to Tom Rolt being named after an L.T.C Rolt on the Talyllyn Railway.|$|R

After World War II the railway was in a poor state, and the old mines had become ammunition dumps. The owner, Sir Handel Brown, thought {{he would have to}} sell the railway. At this point, the railway was taken over by Mr. Peter Sam, who became the Thin Controller. With the help of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ivo</b> Hugh and a number of volunteers, they managed to keep the railway going. The railway's main source of income was now tourist traffic.|$|R
