5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, {{the phone number}} that was printed {{was that of the}} Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|The two are arrested, and Nikki's funeral takes place. However, Samantha arrives {{to arrest}} Lillian, as Nikki's brother Billy (Eric Sheffer Stevens) found the pills Lillian wasn't giving Nikki, and Lillian {{is charged with}} interfering with her daughter’s medical care. Bill assures Megan that Nikki's money in her will, {{will be put to}} a good use and thanks her and the team for investigating. Throughout the {{investigation}} Lacey thinks that Megan and Todd are getting back together, as Todd has made <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> to Megan's work. Lacey is shocked to find out that Todd is not phoning Megan, but Kate, and the two are in a relationship. Megan is angry at Kate, but tells Lacey to respect her, even if she does not like her yet.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, {{as well as}} {{many other}} leaders and {{citizens}} of the northern states, became increasingly impatient with McClellan's slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which became a thorn in the side of many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> for McClellan's dismissal.|$|E

5|$|The revenue cutter Bear {{arrived in}} St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, {{agreed to go}} to Wrangel Island {{as soon as he}} got {{permission}} from the United States government. It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, Bear, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs and}} calls of antbirds are {{generally}} composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family {{is one of}} the suboscines (suborder Tyranni) which have simpler syrinxes ("voiceboxes") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear. Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the loudsong and the softsong. The functions of <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a territorial purpose and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment. In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart. Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds. The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in mobbing of predators. The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.|$|E

25|$|This {{may seem}} counter-intuitive since, at a glance, it is {{apparent}} that the former only makes half as <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> to its logarithmic-time sifting function as the latter; i.e., they seem to differ only by a constant factor, which never affects asymptotic analysis.|$|E
25|$|After the {{fountain}} was built, there were <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> {{for it to}} be moved to a large square where it would be more visible and proportional to its surroundings, but, given the many reconstructions of Paris squares in the 19th and 20th century, it probably survived intact only because of its obscure location.|$|E
25|$|Cramer's {{object is}} to {{showcase}} his encyclopedic knowledge of stocks and give callers a second opinion on their stock ideas. He takes as <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> as possible before a buzzer goes off to indicate {{the end of the}} round. When this happens, Cramer gets upset and usually takes a few more calls. After this, the Daktronics buzzer goes off at his signal, and the segment is over.|$|E

25|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of the Routemaster that <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> continued to be made for {{a new version of the}} vehicle to be produced. On 3 September 2007, Conservative mayoral candidate Boris Johnson announced that he was contemplating introducing a modern-day version of the Routemaster (and scrapping articulated bus operation). In December 2007, UK magazine Autocar commissioned leading bus designer Capoco, designer of the innovative Optare Solo, to come up with detailed proposals for a new-generation Routemaster.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>calls</b> {{were made}} for the {{resignation}} of Tung Chee-hwa, a leader who was blessed by the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin. Tung remained in the office until 10 March 2005, 20 months after the march against Article 23. Hong Kong's Basic Law permitted Tung to serve another 3 years, many suspected Beijing forced him to resign due to widespread public disapproval and his perceived lacklustre leadership. The 2005 election filled the seat with Donald Tsang who was the No. 2 ranking official, Chief Secretary, and career civil servant during British colonial rule.|$|E
25|$|Revertive pulsing (RP) worked {{faster than}} {{standard}} dial pulses, {{but the main}} advantage was in problem detection. In earlier systems, when a worn pawl or other problem in a Strowger selector caused it to fail to advance, only the calling party could detect the error as no connection was achieved. The caller eventually lost patience and redialed the call. The same user or another might get connected to the faulty selector again. Therefore, one bad Strowger selector could block <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> until subscriber complaints alerted staff to the problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> to the {{emergency}} services was made at 4:00p.m., although the dispatcher mistakenly directed responding officers to another McDonald's two miles (three kilometers) from the San Ysidro Boulevard restaurant. Within ten minutes, the police {{had arrived at the}} correct restaurant. They imposed a lockdown on an area spanning six blocks from the site of the shootings. The police established a command post two blocks from the restaurant, and deployed 175 officers in strategic locations (These officers were joined within the hour by SWAT team members, who also took positions around the McDonald's restaurant).|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> for {{alternative}} approaches to rupture risk assessment {{over the past}} number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. In vivo, AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths from localised weak hypoxic regions to much stronger regions and areas of calcifications.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, Hawk-Eye was {{introduced}} for all Championship matches at Croke Park in Dublin in 2013. This followed consideration by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) {{for its use}} in Gaelic football and hurling. A trial took place in Croke Park on 2 April 2011. The double-header featured football between Dublin and Down and hurling between Dublin and Kilkenny. Over the previous two seasons there had been <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> for the technology to be adopted, especially from Kildare fans, who saw two high-profile decisions go against their team in important games. The GAA said it would review the issue after the 2013 Sam Maguire Cup was presented.|$|E

50|$|In games (especially limit games) with <b>many</b> <b>calling</b> stations, {{an effect}} called {{schooling}} can cause calling stations to accidentally play less incorrectly. For example, {{it is often}} incorrect to draw to an inside straight because the probability of making the draw is too low to justify the expense of calling a bet to see the next card. However, the presence of <b>many</b> <b>calling</b> stations can inflate {{the size of the}} pot, making it correct, or at least less incorrect, to draw to inside straights and other longshot draws.|$|R
25|$|The {{assertions of}} Chinese {{philosophy}} began to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By {{the time of}} the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, there were <b>many</b> <b>calls,</b> such as the May Fourth Movement, to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate democracy, republicanism, and industrialism into Chinese philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-Sen (Sūn yì xiān, in one Mandarin form of the name) {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Mao Zedong (Máo zé dōng) added Marxist-Leninist thought. When the Communist Party of China took over power, previous schools of thought, excepting notably Legalism, were denounced as backward, and later even purged during the Cultural Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time took a very dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the women themselves, or perhaps because of fear that officials would take to stealing the wives of other men. One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E

From 4 to 5 January, UNRWA was forced to shut down 19 health centers due to hostilities in the area, and Ministry of Health closed down generators at ambulance stations, vaccine stores, labs and warehouses {{due to the lack}} of fuel to run the generators until more was delivered. There existed an urgent need for strong pain killers, body gas, bed sheets for wrapping the dead, and for neuro-, vascular-, orthopedic- and open heart surgeons. Collateral damages to hospitals like broken glass were not being repaired. The Palestinian Red Cross was unable to respond to <b>many</b> <b>calls</b> due to the military operations. Only urgent cases and surgery is being carried out in hospitals and all out-patient clinics have been closed.|$|E
