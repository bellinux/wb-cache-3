To monitor and control Palestinian movement, Israel has established 50+ checkpoints {{in and around the}} West Bank. As well, recently, Israel has begun construction of a controversial West Bank barrier. Palestinians complain that these <b>measures</b> greatly <b>restrict</b> their <b>movement</b> and are often humiliating, while Israel asserts that they are necessary for security. Palestinians also point out that Israel accelerated the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip throughout the Oslo peace process.|$|R
40|$|Pathogen {{exclusion}} through quarantine is {{the most}} effective strategy for plant disease prevention. However, phytosanitary <b>measures</b> usually <b>restrict</b> the <b>movement</b> of forest and agricultural goods, which may conflict with trade interests. In fact, increased trade in commodities has been associated with more frequent biological invasions in recent decades (Hulme, 2009). In this issue of New Phytologist, Hyatt-Twynam et al. (pp. 1317 – 1329) compare strategies for the eradication of emerging plant disease epidemics. Using the example of citrus canker, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, in residential areas in Florida (USA), the authors compare three strategies judged by the estimated number of citrus trees eliminated. The classic constant radius removal turned out to be less efficient than the proposed variable radius, and risk-based strategies, which incorporate more mathematical complexity and epidemiological background knowledge...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a questionnaire to quantify disability associated with shoulder symptoms. METHODS [...] A {{set of questions}} relevant to shoulder symptoms from a general disability interview was developed and the questionnaire applied to a cross-sectional population survey and a prospective study of general practice attenders. Subjects included adults who reported current shoulder pain in a population survey and patients from three general practices who attended with shoulder symptoms during a six month period. The main outcome measures were: frequency of problems with daily living related to shoulder symptoms, total score on 22 -item disability questionnaire, and measures of shoulder movement. RESULTS [...] A higher proportion (80 %) of patients attending their general practitioner with shoulder symptoms had five or more disabilities compared with subjects reporting shoulder pain in a community survey (34 %). The ranked frequency with which each disability was reported was similar in the two groups, although sleep disturbance {{was the most common}} problem in consulters. Self-reported disability is correlated with <b>measures</b> of <b>restricted</b> shoulder <b>movement.</b> CONCLUSION [...] This disability questionnaire was simple to complete and should prove useful for both general practice and population-based studies of shoulder pain...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic spinal {{stabilization}} {{is based}} on the concept of <b>restricting</b> <b>movement</b> of spinal segments rather than pre-venting the movement.

Dynamic spinal stabi-lization can achieve spinal stability and prevent diseases of adjacent segments without requiring fusion. Interspinous dynamic stabilization, a type of dynamic spinal stabiliza-tion, is a technique that involves the insertions of devices into interspinous processes that distract posterior spinous process and cause local segmental kyphosis. 1) The inven...|$|R

40|$|The cases {{decided by}} the Court of Justice {{concerning}} free movement {{of goods and services}} are often seen in terms of a difficult balance between trade and consumer protection. This paper suggests that their major consequences are not for the consumer at all, but for quality of life in European societies. Legislation which restricts what can be sold, and who can sell it, has consequences for equality, autonomy, social cohesion, and identity which are greater in importance than any consumer-protective effect. That the Court’s focus is so unbalanced – it ignores these social concerns - is to do with several factors. Firstly, the Court has a transactional fixation, seeing contracts as essentially private matters which are of no concern to wider society. This view point is common in economic law, but unrealistic, and embodies some very controversial implicit political standpoints. Secondly, when the Court approaches the judicial review of national <b>measures</b> which <b>restrict</b> free <b>movement</b> it does not in fact engage in balancing at all, but seeks to reconcile interests, and to push integration forward. The ability of a national community to determine its own quality of life and express its values is something which evades easy reconciliation with a single market. On the contrary, integration brings unavoidable costs in autonomy and social concerns, and denial of this fact is harmful to both Europe and the EU. This argument proceeds by an examination of the case law concerning free movement, and the process of judicial review found within that law...|$|R
