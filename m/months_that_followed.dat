5|$|A {{few days}} after Noether's death her friends and {{associates}} at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that}} the smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> the 24th Division {{played an}} {{important}} part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy firepower with its large number of armored vehicles, including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos that followed the rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and on the desert sand. The 24th remained in relatively stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> {{there were}} still some intermittent, mainly artillery, attacks from Serb-held areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Dubrovnik area and elsewhere. The {{remaining}} Serb-held area in Croatia, in Eastern Slavonia, was faced {{with the possibility of}} military confrontation with Croatia. Such a possibility was repeatedly stated by Tuđman after Storm. The threat was underlined by the movement of troops to the region in mid-October, as well as a repeat of an earlier threat to intervene militarily—specifically saying that the Croatian Army could intervene if no peace agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} groups of {{personnel}} began arriving at Redbank, in south-east Queensland, {{in the middle}} of May, the battalion's headquarters moved to the camp and basic training commenced in June under instructors from the Australian Instructional Corps. In early July, the majority of the battalion was transported by train to Pinkenba, and from there to Darwin, in Australia's north, aboard the troopship Zealandia. Tasked with defending the port and its surrounds, the battalion was based around Vestey's meatworks near Mindil Beach, and in the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> was occupied with vital asset protection and area defence in between individual and collective training exercises. Personnel were joined by the majority of their vehicles, including 14 tracked Bren carriers in August, as well as a group of reinforcements. In October, elements of the battalion were used as stevedores during a wharf labourers' strike.|$|E
40|$|The study {{indicates}} that Brownian motion, finite and infinite activity jumps {{are present in the}} ultra-high frequency VIX data. The total quadratic variation can be split into a continuous component of 29 % and a jump component of 71 %. Jump activities on ultra-high frequency VIX data are found informative in ex-ante identifying subgroups of hedge funds that deliver significant outperformance. On <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>follow</b> large jumps, strategies exposing to long volatility and extreme risk tend to deliver positive performance in extreme market environments. On <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>follow</b> small jumps, possibly as a result of market illiquidity, most fund strategies exhibit losses in the jumping-around market environments. On <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>follow</b> Brownian motion, strategies exposing to short volatility tend to deliver best performance. Hedge funds therefore deliver out-of-sample performance respective of types of jump activities on ultra-high frequency VIX. JEL classification: G 12; G 13; G 1...|$|R

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community {{constitutional}} referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E

Louis abandoned his troops and travelled by ship to the Principality of Antioch, where his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine's uncle, Raymond, was prince. Raymond expected him to offer military assistance against the Seljuk Turks threatening the principality, but Louis refused and went to Jerusalem to fulfil his crusader vow. Conrad, stricken by illness, had earlier returned to Constantinople, but arrived in Jerusalem {{a few weeks later}} in early April 1148. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry {{and the players}} became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements in the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement. During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also {{turned his back on}} Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 1914, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Verge enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps. He was subsequently attached to the 6th Light Horse Regiment as its medical officer. After completing rudimentary training in Sydney, his regiment embarked on HMAT A29 Suevic on 21 December, reaching Egypt on 1 February 1915. When the light horse regiments were sent to Gallipoli as reinforcements following the initial landing, Verge was attached to the 1st Australian Division. The reinforcements landed on 20 May, just after the failed Turkish attack on Anzac Cove. The 6th Light Horse Regiment was tasked with securing the right hand flank of the Allied lodgement, and during the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> undertook mainly defensive duties around the beachhead. The conditions on the peninsula were very harsh, and sanitation was poor. Several months after landing, Verge contracted dysentery and was evacuated to No. 17 British General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. He died on 8 September 1915, and was buried at the Chatby War Memorial Cemetery (Row Q, Grave No. 523) in Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} controversy of Sanford's presidency was {{his effort to}} establish the presidential library of former US President Richard Nixon at Duke. Sanford raised the subject with Nixon {{during a visit to}} the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the <b>months</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b> The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, Yorba Linda, California, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.|$|E

James made one final attempt to kiss Stratus at Saturday Night's Main Event on March 18, after the duo defeated Candice Michelle and Victoria. After she was rebuffed, James attacked Stratus and later vowed to destroy her, turning James into a villainess. At WrestleMania 22, the evil James defeated Stratus to capture the Women's Championship for the first time in her career. In the following weeks, James continued her mind games by dressing like Stratus and claiming to be her. Stratus eventually confronted James by dressing like her and mocking her personality. It was later announced that a Women's Championship rematch between James and Stratus would take place at Backlash.|$|E
