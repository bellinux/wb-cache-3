40|$|Deficit {{theories}} have historically influenced school policy {{in determining the}} best methods to assist low achieving <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students. The educational community perceive the <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> Students' backgrounds, such as family, culture, language, and community, as the obstacles that prevent them from obtaining academic achievement in school. Their response is usually to develop programs that will "fix" the perceived deficits in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students. These school practices have yet to produce academic achievement in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students. This study challenges, through research and personal narratives of six successful <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students, def!ct thories that exacerbate the continuous and disproportionate low academic achievement of <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students; supports resilient research {{and the development of}} a more culturally responsible pedogogy that validates and affirms the cultural backgrounds, realities and experiences of <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students.

40|$|Limited {{research}} has been conducted to examine traditional female <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> gender role beliefs and its impact on depression. In order to address the research questions, this dissertation developed two manuscripts. The first manuscript is a literature review that examines research concerning depression, <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> female gender role beliefs, and Self-Discrepancy theory. The second manuscript is a quantitative study that investigates the impact gender role beliefs and partner status has on depression in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women. Furthermore, the second manuscript suggests variables that contribute to depression in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women and recommendations for clinicians. The aim of the second manuscript is to examine the literature concerning depression in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women {{and the ways in which}} traditional gender role beliefs and self-discrepancies may impact <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women's mental health. This dissertation begins by examining the literature concerning depression in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women. It then explores <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women's gender role socialization, including a review of the values that are taught through this process. This study then provides an in depth inspection of the ideal of marianismo, which guides traditional <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women's gender role beliefs. Next it progresses to discuss Self-Discrepancy theory and possible mental health outcomes. Examples of possible self-discrepancies related to traditional <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women's gender role beliefs are provided to illustrate how depression may occur when self-discrepancies are present. Finally, it provides recommendations for clinicians who work with depressed <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women. The second manuscript examines the impact of traditional gender role beliefs and partner status on depression in a sample of 325 <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women. It is hypothesized that an interaction effect between partner status and gender role beliefs will be found, whereas <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women who are unpartnered and have traditional gender role beliefs will experience a greater amount of depression, due to the presence of a discrepancy. Contrarily, results from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) found no interaction between partner status and gender role beliefs on depression. The manuscript provides possible explanations for such findings. In addition, results from a hierarchical regression indicate that level of education and the family pillar aspect of marianismo significantly impact depression in <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> women...|$|R

The MAES study focused on five southwest states Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. To learn the current status of <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students, a three-tier scale of analysis was created. Each level of analysis had a specific focus: macro, meso, and micro. The macro level presented a descriptive analysis of the educational status of <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students in the five states presented in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> Education Study (MAES) reports. The second level of analysis (meso) focused on the state of Texas and examines the achievement gaps between student groups in state standardized assessments since assessment policies were introduced in the state. In micro level of analysis, the educational achievement of <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students in Ysleta Independent School District, located in El Paso, Texas, was examined by analyzing student outcomes over a nine-year period (2003 - 2011).

40|$|The {{relationships}} between student achievement, student culture and practitioners' attitudes and expectations were investigated. Student achievement {{was defined as}} academic performance but also included perceptions, rationales and explanations for student behaviors and conduct. Student culture described student's <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> origins, customs and beliefs. Practitioners' attitudes described how middle school personnel perceived <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> high and underachieving students generally, and practitioners' expectations described how personnel interacted and behaved toward <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students. Results indicated that <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students perceived themselves and school personnel perceived these students as different from Anglo students. <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> cultural traditions were also perceived as inferior and disadvantageous by high achieving <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students and by personnel. Underachieving <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students generally valued their cultural traditions more positively than high achieving students becoming resistant to learning when these traditions were marginalized in school. Student achievement was also related to student compliance, student appearance, styles in written and verbal communication and practitioners' perceptions about the willingness of <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students to practice and support Anglo norms. These findings are congruent with theories that discuss {{relationships between}} student achievement, student culture and practitioners' attitudes and expectations.

40|$|Through {{analysis}} of written texts produced by {{school districts and}} high schools with predominantly <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> populations, beliefs about <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students that mediate attitudes and expectations can be exposed. In this work, I conduct comparative critical discourse analyses (CDA) of school district and high school mission statements from a total of 35 schools and 20 {{school districts in the}} Southwestern United States and Chicago, Illinois. The sites were selected because of their large to predominantly <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students populations. Of the 35 school mission statements I researched, 19 were from predominantly <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> high schools and 16 were from predominantly White high schools. Of the 20 school district mission statements I collected, 11 were from largely to predominantly <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> school districts and 9 were from largely to predominantly White school districts. Analyses conducted in this study of the mission statements utilizing several `tools' of CDA revealed ideologies, or ideological discursive formations (IDFs), of low expectations and negative attitudes for <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students when compared to White students. These IDFs materialize by way of frames and signs that are (re) created in the district and school mission statements. The IDFs serve to mediate the discourses that are utilized to describe <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students and the districts and schools they attend. These discourses serve to mediate beliefs about <b>Mexican</b> <b>American</b> students that in turn reinforce the IDFs already in place.
