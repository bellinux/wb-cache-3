25|$|TARC {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} 225 accessible buses, including numerous hybrids. Starting in 2004, TARC purchased hybrids, and by 2008 started purchasing clean diesel buses for a cleaner, greener fleet. By late Winter 2013, TARC added 16 more clean diesels. Then, by mid-Summer 2013, 11 hybrids were added, bringing TARC's hybrid total to 32. By Fall 2013, TARC added 21 clean diesel commuter buses, then as of Fall 2014 TARC added 12 more clean diesels; {{some of them are}} WiFi-enabled and have comfortable seating. TARC has recently put 12 additional updated buses on the road with 13 more due to arrive by late 2016. This brings their clean diesel total to 82 when the other 13 arrive. There will be 96. All-electric buses have been circulating downtown Louisville since early 2015, and eight <b>more</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> hitting the road on one local route serving the Iroquois neighborhood, and Iroquois Park. These buses will not be fare-free, will have a 42-passenger capacity, and will share the 8th Street charging station with one of the trolley routes. according to The Courier-Journal. There are also two charging stations in downtown Louisville, one at 3rd and York, the other at 8th and Market. These buses will have a 30-passenger seating capacity, and be able to operate for up to two hours on a single charge. These buses, like the old trolleys, will be fare-free.|$|E

From 1998 to 2011, donations amounted to €75.5million (17 {{percent of the total}} of €450million spent on demining during that period). Most donations were from foreign contributors, including NGOs and foreign governments (among them Japan, Germany, Monaco, Luxembourg and the United States). The European Union was also a significant contributor during that period, providing €20.7million. , the Croatian Mine Action Centre has been allocated approximately 400million kuna ( [...] 53million euros) a year for demining. An estimated further €500million (or <b>more)</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> needed to remove all remaining land mines from Croatia by 2019, the deadline for land-mine clearance set by the Ottawa Treaty.

2500|$|When Kolmogorov {{became aware}} of Solomonoff's work, he {{acknowledged}} Solomonoff's priority. For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence, while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution. The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity.

2500|$|Depending on how {{quantities}} supplied {{and demanded}} vary with price (the [...] "elasticities" [...] {{of supply and}} demand), a tax can be absorbed by the seller (in the form of lower pre-tax prices), or by the buyer (in {{the form of higher}} post-tax prices). If the elasticity of supply is low, more of the tax will be paid by the supplier. If the elasticity of demand is low, <b>more</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> paid by the customer; and, contrariwise for the cases where those elasticities are high. If the seller is a competitive firm, the tax burden is distributed over the factors of production depending on the elasticities thereof; this includes workers (in the form of lower wages), capital investors (in the form of loss to shareholders), landowners (in the form of lower rents), entrepreneurs (in the form of lower wages of superintendence) and customers (in the form of higher prices).|$|E
2500|$|During the Napoleonic Wars Coggeshall was {{required}} to raise a company of men for the defence of the country. This they did, although the Coggeshall Volunteers famously consisted of 20 officers and only 3 privates. One resident of the town, the schoolmaster Thomas Harris, was so amused by the situation he was inspired to write a short, satirical play entitled [...] "The C*******ll Volunteer Corps". In the play he lampooned the surfeit of officers ("As the Corps at present consists mostly of officers no <b>more</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> admitted; but should any neighbouring Corps be in want of a few it may be accommodated {{at the rate of}} one officer for one private, and in every dozen so exchanged an officer will be thrown in extra. God save the King."), the quality of the troops and the courage of their commanders (in the event that the nearby town of Colchester was invaded the corps would move to defend Braintree, and if Braintree were to be attacked they would defend Colchester, etc.) The play was so popular it reached four editions. Unfortunately, despite Harris' insistence that it was not so, many of the town's citizens believed that they were being personally caricatured and, taking offence, withdrew their children from his school.|$|E
