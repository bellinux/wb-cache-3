They couldn't {{have been influenced by}} those rather unpleasant sanitary considerations which so profoundly agitated the mind of 'Graveyard Walker.' Sanitation was still in a very rudimentary state in the year five thousand B.C.; and the ingenious Celt, who is still given to 'waking' his neighbours, when they die of small-pox, with a sublime indifference to the chances of infection, must have had some other and more powerful reason for adopting the comparatively unnatural system of cremation in preference to that of simple burial. The change, I believe, was due to a further development of religious ideas {{on the part of the}} Celtic tribesmen above that of the primitive stone-age cannibals.|$|E

It is not, however, with L'Etoile {{that we have to}} do, but with the truth. The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated: but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have obviously intended, and failed to convey. It was the design of the journalist to say that, at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight. And herein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain. It is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position, and under such circumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now, the assassination might have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to, at any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> You will understand that I suggest nothing here as probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion.

In {{an effort to}} reduce textile waste ending up in landfills, this research addresses how consumers currently dispose of unwanted apparel. Understanding attitudes and perceptions associated with <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> textiles may provide insight on how to raise awareness regarding other options available. This study intends to provide insight into the disposal process by linking all stages of apparel consumption, acquisition, inventory and disposal. Utilizing a qualitative approach, men between the ages of 30 - 45 were interviewed. Observations were also utilized at a Goodwill donation site as well as a consignment store. Ten semi-structured interviews were arranged to take place at the participant's home, with most occurring in their bedrooms next to their closets. Prior to the interview, they were asked to select their ten newest acquisitions, and ten that had not been worn in at least two years. Results of this study focused on prompts regarding apparel disposal, identifying influences for selection <b>of</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal,</b> and the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> used for six months after the interview. This study contributes to our understanding <b>of</b> current apparel <b>disposal</b> patterns and builds on previous disposal research.

This, along with the cost of burials, has sparked problems related to notions of death and the hereafter in Zimbabwe.

However, this option is not very popular with the Shona people, who prefer to observe the conventional burial practices enshrined in their traditional culture. Whilst they are open to new, modern ideas, they are resistant to the notion of cremation, which is regarded as alien and “un-African”. They would rather exhaust all resources to have a traditional funeral. This article explores burial practices among the Shona people of Zimbabwe and their resistance to cremation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{emergence}} of ‘controlled tipping’ as the dominant method of municipal waste disposal in Britain between 1920 and 1960. The triumph of controlled tipping, despite the availability of alternative disposal technologies, needs to be understood {{in the context of}} the contested meanings of ‘waste’ and ‘wasteland’, which helped to determine attitudes and approaches to disposal. Following the conclusion of the First World War there was an urgent requirement for a cheap means of disposing of increasing amounts of urban municipal waste. The obvious choice was tipping.

Public cleansing professionals therefore had to recuperate tipping as a medically and environmentally benign <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> that was reconcilable with the needs of sanitary science and landscape preservation. Controlled tipping, with its combined claims to scientific progress and the revalorization of refuse, enabled dumping to be successfully re-produced as the dominant mode of municipal refuse disposal in Britain.

The model is developed based on single dumping <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> In the present paper, radioactive carbon (14 C) is considered as it delivered the maximum concentration in ground water. To consider variability in the model parameters, a probabilistic methodology is adopted. One of the efficient probabilistic methods, collocation based stochastic response surface methodology (CSRSM) is used. In this method, the complex analytical equations are approximated by a higher order polynomial (using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)). Groundwater velocity, thickness of unsaturated zone, dispersivity and distribution coefficient are considered as random variables. Third order polynomial gave the best fit for the model and an R 2 of 0. 99 is obtained for a third order polynomial. Reliability analysis was carried out and the probability of failure of annual radiation dose of 14 C (radioactive carbon) radionuclide exceeding the permissible limits was estimated for different scenarios.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{symbolism}} of the hatta't offering in the priestly literature of the Pentateuch, especially Leviticus. It starts by discussing the relationship between the occasions for bringing hatta't and its basic function, with special reference to J. Milgram's thesis that the hatta't purifies only sancta and not persons. The examination of the relevant texts shows that his view is one-sided. The hatta't deals with both hatta't (sin) and uncleanness; when sancta are purified, so is the offerer (chapters 1 - 2). A deeper dimension of 'purification' is set out in Lev 17 : 11 (chapter 4) and is manifested in contagion of the hatta't, viz. setting substitutionary death over against death caused by sin and uncleanness (chapter 5). Exegesis of Lev 10 : 16 - 20 (chapters 2 - 3), a crux interpretum, forms the basis of inquiry into the various types of hatta't ritual, opening up the possibility that behind the variety of atonement ceremonies in Leviticus there is a coherent system. The episode in that section shows the inadequacy of the eighth-day service in the face of Nadab and Abihu's sin and adumbrates the ritual in Lev 16 (chapter 3). Then from Lev 10 : 17 and other texts it is inferred that the concept of kipper includes 'purification' and 'bearing guilt' (chapter 4). It is argued that the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> blood manipulation in the hatta't depend {{on the nature of the}} occasion, whereas the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the hatta't-flesh hinge on whether the agent of atonement is also its beneficiary (chapter 5). These conclusions provide a rationale for the Azazel-goat ritual (Lev 16). By purifying sancta Aaron bears guilt. Then that guilt is removed from the sanctuary by the Azazel goat when Aaron confesses the sins of all the Israelites over it and sends it away to Azazel (chapter 6) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of tangihanga (indigenous funerary practices) unique to the lived experience of the Māori of Aotearoa New Zealand, drawing on fieldwork undertaken amongst Māori, by a Māori. The introduction and influence of modern practices, ideologies, and articles of significance are considered, {{in the context of}} the ongoing traditions of tangihanga, a unique and critical collective occasion. This research navigates a tribally distinct journey by way of familial experiences of death in the Māori world. In particular, this work discusses and elucidates the select materials, objects and taonga (artefacts) observable during our funerary processes, as they engage the rubric of death, burial and initial mourning. Part I: speaks to theoretical and methodological aspects pertinent to the scope of the interdisciplinary work undertaken, and intellectually framed, by the disciplines of Anthropology and Tikanga Māori Cultural Studies. This includes participant observation fieldwork; death, ritual, liminality and oral traditions; the marae context; western and indigenous worldviews and epistemologies; as well as compositional mechanisms and tensions. Part II: addresses some logistics of tangihanga, and introduces key ethnohistoric and ethnographic reflexions, which lead into select participant interviews that act to inform the work. These provide the anthropological other voice, and explore realities and concepts which are at the same time distinct from, yet similar to, my own. Part III: relates five brief tangihanga narratives which present genealogically-inflected ethnographies of death, and facilitate discussions pertaining to the core focus of the thesis. Thereafter the substantive chapter material deliberates upon processes and experiences of the arrival of death in the Māori world, as we return to the marae and eventually embrace the final moments of closing the lid of the casket in preparation for interment. With time, we can see different, innovative ideas and practices being introduced as each new generation, with their respective priorities, subsequently metamorphose the complex rubric of tangihanga. For example, transnational Māori must find new ways to cope with tūpāpaku on foreign shores, and they can also be seen to introduce non-traditional elements when returning tūpāpaku home to Aotearoa. Concern regarding the dietary health of many Māori means we are more aware of the need to reduce fat, salt and sugar intakes, so on many marae meat is becoming leaner, whilst vegetarian and gluten free options are being increasingly considered. Also, premium wall space is diminishing as growing numbers of images arrive with the passing of kin members, so the likes of digital photo albums are being introduced; reflecting increasing new technologies on marae that also includes mobile phones, iPads, laptop computers and so forth. Change seems inevitable and change, in many forms, will continue to encroach on our cultural sensibilities and abodes. As older generations perpetuate age-old traditions, and younger generations acculturate new priorities, change is no longer on the horizon of our marae, but has arrived to affect tangihanga and marae practices. This said, the Māori remain pragmatic and resilient to the winds of change, and this study shows our ability to adapt, as and where need be, whilst also foreboding future generations be as adaptable and ready to change; at the same time as maintaining core cultural traditions and practices. In its most basic form this thesis shows that whilst it matters what clothes we dress our tūpāpaku in, the taonga displayed, the form of burial vessel chosen, <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> and so forth, the rubric of tangihanga nonetheless prioritises the interests of Maori as a collective, communally sharing the complex logistics and burdens of death, as we celebrate a life lived, and lost, collectively. This research will primarily consider the use of tangible materials, objects, and artefacts observable in contemporary tangihanga experiences and question how modernising or secular ideologies have impacted funerary practices for 21 st century Māori. Throughout the course of this research I also intend to look into: •	What taonga, materials, and objects are observable at tangihanga and why? •	Are these items deemed ritually symbolic, and if so how and why? •	What is the familial and cultural relevance and significance of such items? •	What (if any) values and ideologies do these items express, transpose and/or communicate? •	What garments and or taonga are permitted (or not) to adorn the tūpāpaku? Why or why not? •	Are all types of photographs and/or images permitted to be displayed, if so where, are there restrictions, and if so then what and why? •	Does the immediate physical environment make any difference to the use of materials, objects and artefacts in funerary practices, and if so how and why? Twenty-first century Māori continue to hold fast to age-old traditions, at the same time as being flexible and adapting with changing times. This body of work considers aspects of our earlier funerary traditions, and discusses current traditions, before concluding with postulations regarding potential new practices. As Māori and Pākehā of Aotearoa NZ there is much we have yet to learn from each other, and still much more we might share with our other global contemporaries.

It simulates tracer return profiles and estimates properties of the flow channels, which are consequently used for predicting the production borehole cooling. Numerous examples are available worldwide on the successful application of tracer tests in geothermal management, many involving the application of this interpretation technique. Tracer tests are also used for general subsurface hydrological studies in geothermal systems and for flow rate measurements in two-phase geothermal pipelines.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the conference was to review the status of our {{capability}} to predict the environmental effects <b>of</b> the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> digested sewage sludge in the ocean {{off the coast of}} Southern California. At present, the ocean <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sewage sludge is prohibited by State and Federal regulations. Ocean <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sludge, however, is a complex of many alternative combinations of what, where and how; and the environmental consequences of all such combinations have not yet been determined. There is, in fact, some evidence that at least one environmentally sound <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> sludge <b>disposal</b> in the ocean off the Southern California coast may exist. This is the trapping of sludge in the sediments of deep, nearshore ocean basins. such as the Santa Monica Basin. Details of this method are given in Section 3. 3. p. 12. It is the philosophy of the Environmental Quality Laboratory to study and evaluate policy alternatives but not to be an advocate of one alternative or another. Some of the policies studied may be contrary to existing laws or regulations, but it is believed that there is a better chance for improvement in the laws or regulations if alternatives currently outside them are also studied. The conference was sponsored by the Environmental Quality Laboratory in the belief that sufficient information is now available to begin making reasonable estimates of the environmental consequences of existing or alternative ocean disposal methods in order to compare them to land-based disposal methods. The purpose of this report is not to publish the actual proceedings of the conference. but rather to act as a communications aid. It is intended to publicize the issues that were raised at the conference, to give the names and addresses of people who are involved in these issues, and to present abstracts and literature citations.

40|$|Background: India is {{the highest}} Tuberculosis (TB) burden country as per WHO {{statistics}} for 2010. As thesource of infection is an open (sputum positive) case of pulmonary tuberculosis spreading by airborne particles, patients must have adequate knowledge regarding <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> spread, hazards <b>of</b> indiscriminate sputum <b>disposal</b> etc. Objectives: 1) To assess Knowledge of TB patients about spread of TB and hazards <b>of</b> indiscriminate sputum <b>disposal</b> 2) To assess Practice <b>of</b> sputum <b>disposal</b> followed by TB patients 3) To correlate various factors with knowledge and practice <b>of</b> sputum <b>disposal.</b> Methodology: A Cross sectional study was carried out among patients in TB clinics using a field-tested questionnaire among 100 TB patients attending two Municipal Corporation run TB clinics over the period of three months. Results: Only 28 % patients knew about <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> spread of Pulmonary TB. Practice <b>of</b> sputum <b>disposal</b> {{was not associated with}} gender and educational level. Care taken while coughing was the only practice which was significantly associated with level of education (p= 0. 0069). Those who had better knowledge of TB spread had better practice <b>of</b> sputum <b>disposal</b> (p= 0. 0012). Knowledge about spread of TB and care taken while coughing was significantly associated (p= 0. 0003). Knowledge about hazards of indiscriminate spitting and care taken while coughing was significantly associated (p= 0. 0001). Conclusions: Awareness of patients regarding spread of TB, proper sputum disposal need to be improved. The patients should be explained the necessity of complete treatment. With vigorous & repeated counselling and guidance, knowledge and practice <b>of</b> sputum <b>disposal</b> can be improved even in patients with lower education leve...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This research examines the volume of waste generated by sawmill industries vis-à-vis the management method adopted by sawmills and the prevailing diseases in the study areas and proffer appropriate solutions {{that is expected to}} improve the residential environment and make it more aesthetic and therefore improve the health of the people. The study made use of both primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected through the administration of structured questionnaire which was administered on household-heads within 1 -kilometer radius of the selected sawmill industries. The second, which was administered on the sawmill operators, examined the waste management practices and safety health measures adopted by the saw millers. The third set of questionnaire was administered on Town Planning Authorities, covering the location of the sawmill industries. Random systematic sampling method was employed to select the residents within the two study areas. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data processing. Analysis of data was carried out using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings of this research clearly reveal the locations of sawmill industries in the study areas, the volume of waste generated by each sawmill industry including the various <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> waste <b>disposal</b> practices adopted. It also reveals the various ways by which sawmill wastes can be put into use and went further to expose the various environmental and health problems pose by the operation of sawmill industries. Finally, relevan...|$|R
