40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{findings}} in public good provision experiments via the voluntary contribution mechanism is that subjects contribute {{a considerable amount of}} their initial holdings to the provision of a public good even when no contribution is the dominant strategy [see Ledyard’s survey article (1995) ]. This seemingly non-rational behavior has been interpreted as resulting from confusion, kindness or fairness. For example, Andreoni (1995) developed a method to distinguish between confusion and kindness, and concluded that a relatively large part of positive contributions is interpreted as kindness. On the other hand, there are three fundamental criticisms of voluntary contribution mechanism experiments. First, most experiments to date have used a linear utility function where the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> of a public good out of one unit of contribution of a private good is less than one. Therefore, no contribution is the best strategy. Since the solution is a corner solution, the experimental results were biased in favor of contribution. In order to answer this criticism, Saijo and Nakamura (1995) conducted experiments where the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> of a public good is greater than one (high <b>marginal</b> <b>return).</b> That is, all contribution is the dominant strategy. They compared the results to experiments where the marginal benefit of a public good is less than one (low <b>marginal</b> <b>return)</b> and found that the deviation from the dominant strategy in the case of high <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> is larger than {{that in the case of}} low <b>marginal</b> <b>return.</b> They also found subjects who did not contribute cared about their relative ranking as well as monetary reward. In the case of high <b>marginal</b> <b>return,</b> if they cared about relative ranking among subjects, they would contribute nothing out of their initial holdings, but if they cared about the monetary reward, they would contribute everything. They termed this ambivalence the spite dilemma...|$|R
40|$|The seminal {{articles}} by Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) {{have led to}} the misconception that the optimal investment strategy of an all equity firm is to set the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> on investment equal to the rate of return required by shareholders.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conversion}} of the potential energy of dammed water into hydropower depends on both reservoir storage and release, which are the major difficulties in hydropower reservoir operation. This study evaluates the marginal utility principle, which determines the optimal carry-over storage between periods, for long-term hydropower scheduling. Increasing marginal cost and decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> are two important characteristics that determine the marginal utility principle in water supply. However, the notion of decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> is inapplicable in hydropower scheduling. Instead, the carry-over storage from one period has an increasing marginal contribution to the power generation in the next period. Although carry-over storage incurs an increasing marginal cost to the power generation in the current period, the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> {{is higher than the}} marginal cost. The <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> from the carry-over storage further increases in the multi-period case. These findings suggest saving as much carry-over storage as possible, which is bounded by the operational constraints of storage capacity, environmental flow, and installed capacity in actual hydropower scheduling. The marginal utility principle is evaluated for a case study of the Three Gorges Reservoir, and the effects of the constraints are discussed. Results confirm the theoretical findings and show that the <b>marginal</b> <b>return</b> from carry-over storage is larger than the marginal cost. The operational constraints help determine the optimal carry-over storage...|$|R

2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal physical product of labor. More importantly for the discussion here, the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the cost of borrowing funds) is supposed to equal the marginal physical product of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a factor of production will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) will lead to more of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing <b>marginal</b> <b>returns</b> implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming profit maximization.|$|E
