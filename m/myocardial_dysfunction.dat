25|$|Acute lung injury (ALI), {{also called}} non-cardiogenic {{pulmonary}} edema, {{is characterized by}} the abrupt onset of significant hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus. In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, microvascular thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and lung fibrosis. This fibrosing alveolitis may become apparent as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive microvascular thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, <b>myocardial</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and systemic hypotension.|$|E

Expression of calcium handling proteins was measured by western blot analysis. Carvedilol treatment in the OVX animals: prevented weight gain and slight hypertrophy, restored the reduced positive inotropic responses to Ca 2 + and isoproterenol, prevented the reduction in SERCA 2 a expression, abolished the increase in superoxide anion production, normalized the increase in p 22 phox expression, and decreased serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity.

50|$|While {{the heart}} can {{function}} without {{help from the}} nervous system, it is highly innervated with autonomic nerves, regulating the heart beat according to demand in a fast manner, prior to hormonal release. The autonomic innervations of the myocardium in DCM are altered and contribute to <b>myocardial</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Unlike the brain, the peripheral nervous system does not benefit from a barrier protecting it from the circulating levels of glucose.

Therefore, the diabetic heart shows clear denervation as the pathology progresses. This denervation correlates with echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction and results in a decline of survival in patients with diabetes from 85% to 44%.

50|$|For TIC due to atrial fibrillation, rate control, rhythm control, and RF {{catheter}} ablation can {{be effective}} to control the tachyarrhythmia and improve left ventricular systolic function.

In patients with TIC due to other types of SVT, RF catheter ablation is recommended as a first-line treatment. In patients with TIC due to VT or PVCs, both antiarrhythmics and RF catheter ablation can be used. However, the options for antiarrhythmic agents are limited because certain agents can be proarrhythmic in the setting of <b>myocardial</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in TIC.

40|$|The spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rat (SHR) is {{an animal}} model of genetic hypertension which develops heart failure with aging, similar to man. The consistent pattern {{of a long}} period of stable hypertrophy followed by a transition to failure provides a useful model to study mechanisms of heart failure with aging and test treatments at differing phases of the disease process. The transition from compensated hypertrophy to failure is accompanied by changes in cardiac function which are associated with altered active and passive mechanical properties of myocardial tissue; these events define the physiologic basis for cardiac decompensation. In examining the mechanism for <b>myocardial</b> tissue <b>dysfunction,</b> studies have demonstrated a central role for neurohormonal activation, and specifically the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Pharmacologic attenuation of this system at differing points {{in the course of the}} process suggests that prevention but not reversal of <b>myocardial</b> tissue <b>dysfunction</b> is possible. The roles of the extracellular matrix, apoptosis, intracellular calcium, beta-adrenergic stimulation, microtubules, and oxygen supply-demand relationships in ultimately mediating <b>myocardial</b> tissue <b>dysfunction</b> are reviewed.

We have examined the effects of intense exercise training on the cardiac function of diabetic rats, especially focusing on the Langendorff β-adrenergic responsiveness and on the β-adrenoceptors protein expression. Methods Control or Streptozotocin induced-diabetic male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to sedentary or trained groups. The training program consisted of 8 weeks running on a treadmill (10 ° incline, up to 25 m/min, 60 min/day) and was considered to be intense for diabetic rats. Results This intense exercise training amplified the in vivo diabetes-induced bradycardia. It had no effect on Langendorff basal cardiac contraction and relaxation performances in control and diabetic rats. In diabetic rats, it accentuated the Langendorff reduced responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation. It did not blunt the diabetes-induced decrease of β 1 -adrenoceptors protein expression, displayed a significant decrease in the β 2 -adrenoceptors protein expression and normalized the β 3 -adrenoceptors protein expression. Conclusions Intense exercise training accentuated the decrease in the myocardial responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation induced by diabetes. This defect stems principally from the β 2 -adrenoceptors protein expression reduction. Thus, these results demonstrate that intense exercise training induces specific effects on the β-adrenergic system in diabetes. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective, The aim of {{this study}} was to present bundle branch recentry as the {{mechanism}} of sustained ventricular tachycardia in the absence of <b>myocardial</b> or valvular <b>dysfunction.</b> Background. Previous reports have documented the relation between structural heart disease and bundle branch reentrant ventricular tachycardia. <b>Myocardial</b> or valvular <b>dysfunction</b> has thus far been recognised as the only anatomic substrate for the development of this tachycardia. Methods. Three patients with a wide QRS complex tachycardia underwent noninvasive and invasive cardiac evaluation and electrophysiologic studies to identify the substrate and mechanism of tachycardia. Catheter ablation of the right bundle branch using radiofrequency current was performed in each patient. Results. The patients were ail men (aged 54, 34 and 72 years) who presented with presyncope, palpitation and cardiac arrest, respectively. Electrocardiography during sinus rhythm revealed nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay in all three patients. Cardiac evaluation revealed no evidence of <b>myocardial</b> or valvular <b>dysfunction</b> in any patient. The baseline HV interval was prolonged in each patient (90, 100 and 75 ms, respectively). Programmed right ventricular stimulation initiated bundle branch reentrant tachycardia with typical left (three patients) and right (one patient) bundle branch block pattern. Catheter ablation of the right bundle branch using radiofrequency current abolished bundle branch reentry in all three patients. After 26 -, 13 - and 8 -month follow-up periods, complete right bundle branch block persisted, and all three patients remained asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic drugs. Conclusions. Sustained bundle branch reentry can be a clinical arrhythmia in patients with no identifiable <b>myocardial</b> or valvular <b>dysfunction</b> except for isolated conduction abnormalities in the His-Purkinje system.
