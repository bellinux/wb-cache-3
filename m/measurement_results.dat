25|$|The {{invention}} of the first personal sampling pump (1958) {{made it possible to}} simultaneously measure the concentrations of air pollutions outside the respirator mask, {{and at the same time}} - pollution of inhaled air (under a facepiece). Comparison of these <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> show the effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment. But until the 1970s experts mistakenly believed that the protective properties of the respirator under laboratory and in the production conditions are not significantly different. Measuring the effectiveness of respirators under production conditions were not performed; and limits of areas of safe use for different types of respirators were established on the basis of laboratory tests only.|$|E
25|$|The hidden {{variables}} theory fails, however, when {{we consider}} measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes (for example, along any of three axes that make angles of 120 degrees). If {{a large number of}} pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy Bell's inequality. A number of experiments have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, all experiments have loophole problems. When measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving relativistic reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> remain correlated.|$|E

The <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> showed that exposure to air pollution on employees exceeds the permissible value, and that the supply of clean air into the hood reduces adverse effects. Also, measurements have shown {{that there may be}} excessive exposure to workers during breaks (when the respirator may be withdrawn); and discovered the fault of some respirators. Authors recommended: to organize the correct application of RPD, to reduce the concentration of dust in the air, and apply the abrasive material with a lower silica content.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{fundamental}} and widely accepted assumption that a <b>measurement</b> <b>result</b> exists universally, and in particular, it exists for every observer, independently of whether the observer makes the measurement or knows the result. In this paper, we will argue that, based on an analysis of protective measurements, this assumption is rejected by the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and worlds, if they indeed exist according to the interpretation, can only exist relative to systems which are decoherent {{with respect to the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>result...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of {{the uncertainty of the}} <b>result</b> of a <b>measurement</b> performed by a DSP-based instrument is usually a complex and difficult task. The sources of uncertainty are the instrument input stage and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), so that each input sample to the instrument can be considered a <b>measurement</b> <b>result</b> with its associated uncertainty. The uncertainty on the final <b>measurement</b> <b>result</b> is obtained as the combination of the uncertainty values of each sample, according to the measurement algorithm implemented on the digital signal processing (DSP) system. This paper proposes an innovative approach, based on the representation of the <b>measurement</b> <b>result</b> and its associated uncertainty in terms of random-fuzzy variables, that, after having suitably characterized the metrological performance of the input stage and analog-to-digital converter, provides an online estimation of the measurement uncertainty.

2500|$|Numbers {{are very}} often {{obtained}} {{as the result}} of a measurement. As measurements are generally afflicted with some measurement error with a known upper bound, the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with [...] digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolut measurement error is bounded from above by 10-n. In practice, <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same real number, the numeral 0.080 is to suggest a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also significant figures).|$|E
2500|$|... (2004) The {{textbook}} {{states that}} the expected degreee of protection is a such quantity, that the respirator will provide for a certain proportion of the workers, and with a certain probability. However, experts {{did not have enough}} results of PF measurements for the same worker repeatedly. Consequently, the expected effectiveness started (in practice) equal to the lower 95% confidence limit of the set values of <b>measurement</b> <b>results.</b> Later, in several studies, PF measurements were repeated to for the same worker, and specialists conducted statistical analysis. Nikas and Neyghauz tried to determine - then the expected PF will reliably protect not less than 95% of workers in more than 95% of cases of RPE usage. They took into account the volatility of PF of the individual worker and volatility of the average (mean) PF for the different workers. It turned out that then the expected PF (Assigned PF) = 10 efficiency respirators will be insufficient, and they are advised to reduce the Assigned PF to 5 for negative pressure half mask.|$|E
