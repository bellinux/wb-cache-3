5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 <b>megabyte</b> hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Minimum system {{requirements}} on x86 systems include a 25 MHz 80386 processor, at least 12 <b>megabytes</b> of memory, 75 <b>megabytes</b> of hard drive space, and a VGA graphics card. RISC systems require 16 <b>megabytes</b> of memory, 92 <b>megabytes</b> of hard drive space, and a CD-ROM drive. The Advanced Server edition requires an 80386 processor with 16 <b>megabytes</b> {{of memory and}} 90 <b>megabytes</b> of hard drive space. On RISC systems, 110 <b>megabytes</b> of hard drive space is needed.|$|R
50|$|Any app that {{is ready}} for {{updating}} can be updated faster and more efficiently due to this new system. If, for example, a game that is 300 <b>megabytes</b> is updated with a new racetrack that adds an additional two <b>megabytes</b> to the application's size, only two <b>megabytes</b> will be downloaded instead of 302 <b>megabytes.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible {{based on}} the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25MHz and had a socket for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 {{megabytes}} of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards (a Wang invention that became an industry standard). It had a 1.44 <b>megabyte</b> floppy disk drive, an internal 80 <b>megabyte</b> hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems.|$|E
50|$|The next {{versions}} of Palm used Palm OS 3.1. These included Palm IIIx with 4 <b>Megabytes</b> of memory, Palm IIIe without flash memory or hardware expansion slot (and available for lower price), Palm V with 2 <b>Megabytes</b> of memory, and, Palm Vx with 8 <b>Megabytes</b> of memory.|$|R

25|$|IBM was chiefly {{responsible}} for the introduction of APL to the marketplace. APL was first available in 1967 for the IBM 1130 as APL\1130. It would run {{in as little as}} 8k 16-bit words of memory, and used a dedicated 1 <b>megabyte</b> hard disk.|$|E
25|$|The second {{release of}} Microsoft Windows, version 2.0, {{came out on}} 9 December 1987, and used the real-mode memory model, which {{confined}} it {{to a maximum of}} 1 <b>megabyte</b> of memory. In such a configuration, it could run under another multitasking system like DESQview, which used the 286 Protected Mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{hardware}} industry measures {{system memory}} (RAM) using the binary meaning while {{magnetic disk storage}} uses the SI definition. However, many exceptions exist. Labeling of diskettes uses the <b>megabyte</b> to denote 1024×1000 bytes. In the optical disks market, Compact Disks use MB to mean 10242 bytes while DVDs use GB to mean 10003 bytes.|$|E

25|$|Amazon {{withdrew the}} Kindle DX from sale in October 2012, but in September 2013 was made {{available}} {{again for a}} few months. Using 3G data is free when accessing the Kindle Store and Wikipedia. Downloading personal documents via 3G data costs about $1 per <b>megabyte.</b> Its battery life is about one week with 3G on and two weeks with 3G off. Text-to-Speech and MP3 playback are supported.|$|E
25|$|Although Windows 9x {{features}} memory protection, it {{does not}} protect the first <b>megabyte</b> of memory from userland applications. This area of memory contains code critical to {{the functioning of the}} operating system, and by writing into this area of memory an application can crash or freeze the operating system. This was a source of instability as faulty applications could accidentally write into this region and with that halt the operating system.|$|E
25|$|The Intel 80286 had a 24-bit {{address bus}} {{and was able}} to address up to 16MB of RAM, {{compared}} to the 1MB addressability of its predecessor. However, memory cost and the initial rarity of software using the memory above 1MB meant that 80286 computers were rarely shipped with more than one <b>megabyte</b> of RAM. Additionally, there was a performance penalty involved in accessing extended memory from real mode (in which DOS, the dominant PC operating system until the mid-1990s, ran), as noted below.|$|E
5000|$|Universal Serial Bus (USB) {{scanners}} {{can transfer}} data quickly. The early USB 1.1 standard could transfer data at 1.5 <b>megabytes</b> per second (slower than SCSI), but the later USB 2.0/3.0 standards can transfer {{at more than}} 20/60 <b>megabytes</b> per second in practice.|$|R
50|$|Disk {{images were}} {{originally}} (in the late 1960s) used for backup and disk cloning of mainframe disk media, the early ones were {{as small as}} 5 <b>megabytes</b> and as large as 330 <b>megabytes,</b> and the copy medium was magnetic tape, which ran as large as 200 <b>megabytes</b> per reel. Disk images became much more popular when floppy disk media became popular, where replication or storage of an exact structure was necessary and efficient, {{especially in the case}} of copy protected floppy disks.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} first {{announced}} in late 1995, and planned for release in late 1996. The arcade {{version of the}} system was released in September 1997, featuring a custom 64-bit RISC processor, 4 <b>megabytes</b> of program memory, 64 <b>megabytes</b> of 3D and texture memory, and 128 <b>megabytes</b> of memory for 2D characters and backgrounds. The first title released for the system was Road's Edge, with Samurai Shodown 64 and Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition following soon after. None were particularly well received.|$|R
25|$|OpenPort is a {{broadband}} satellite {{voice and}} data communications system for maritime vessels. The system {{is used for}} crew calling and e-mail services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets, government and navy vessels, fishing fleets and personal yachts. Iridium’s Global Service Program provides shipboard technical support to Iridium OpenPort customers. OpenPort voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones, while data services are billed by the <b>megabyte</b> of data transferred (not by the connection time of the session).|$|E
25|$|Apple {{released}} the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, {{for a price}} of US$2,600. It offered one <b>megabyte</b> of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes {{by the use of}} socketed RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800kB capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history. In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet {{attacked}} Windows systems {{using an}} unprecedented four zero-day attacks (plus the CPLINK vulnerability and a vulnerability {{used by the}} Conficker worm). It is initially spread using infected removable drives such as USB flash drives, which contain Windows shortcut files to initiate executable code. The worm then uses other exploits and techniques such as peer-to-peer RPC to infect and update other computers inside private networks that are not directly connected to the Internet. The number of zero-day exploits used is unusual, as they are highly valued and malware creators do not typically make use of (and thus simultaneously make visible) four different zero-day exploits in the same worm. Amongst these exploits were remote code execution on a computer with Printer Sharing enabled, and the LNK/PIF vulnerability, in which file execution is accomplished when an icon is viewed in Windows Explorer; negating the need for user interaction. Stuxnet is unusually large at half a <b>megabyte</b> in size, and written in several different programming languages (including C and C++) which is also irregular for malware. The Windows component of the malware is promiscuous in that it spreads relatively quickly and indiscriminately.|$|E
50|$|The maximum data {{capacity}} of a 2400 ft reel, blocked at 32,767 bytes and recorded at 6250 BPI was 170 <b>megabytes.</b> Typically, much smaller block sizes, such as 4K (4,096 bytes) were used, {{in which case the}} storage {{capacity of}} the tape was reduced by 33%, to 113 <b>megabytes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Volume backup time: Approximately 17-18 {{minutes per}} 20 <b>megabytes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The DataVault was Thinking Machines' {{mass storage}} system. It stored five {{gigabytes}} of data, expandable to ten gigabytes with transfer rates of 40 <b>megabytes</b> per second. Eight DataVaults could be operated in parallel for a combined {{data transfer rate}} of 320 <b>megabytes</b> per second for up to 80 gigabytes of data.|$|R
500|$|An a-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} a listing of available forecast aid projections for a storm's history. The real-time guidance system uses {{a subset of the}} track and intensity information contained in these files to create the real-time guidance plots. The a-deck name {{comes from the fact that}} the filenames start with an [...] "a". Normally, all the model projections are included for the entire lifetime of the storm, so these files can increase to around 1 <b>megabyte</b> in size.|$|E
500|$|The cartridge's {{circuit board}} layout is unique {{compared}} to most Famicom games, using a single two <b>megabyte</b> PRG (program) ROM chips. A RAM chip {{is used instead}} of a ROM for the character graphics data, similar to the [...] "UNROM" [...] method used in some Nintendo games. As a result, the data is strewn across the PRG ROM in various banks. The cartridge features one 8-kilobyte battery-backed RAM chip, used for the game's single save slot. Many of the game's graphics are borrowed from other games, mostly other Final Fantasy titles and including Super NES graphics converted to four-color palettes used by the Famicom's hardware. Much of the game's music is borrowed from other games as well, in many cases shortened significantly to a few repeating notes.|$|E
500|$|While chairman, Jobs visited {{university}} {{departments and}} faculty members to sell Macintosh. Jobs met Paul Berg, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon held in Silicon Valley to honor François Mitterrand, then President of France. Berg was frustrated by the expense of teaching students about recombinant DNA from textbooks instead of in wet laboratories, used for the testing and analysis of chemicals, drugs, and other materials or biological matter. Wet labs were prohibitively expensive for lower-level courses and were too complex to be simulated on personal computers of the time. Berg suggested to Jobs to use his influence at Apple to create a [...] "3M computer" [...] workstation for higher education, featuring more than one <b>megabyte</b> of random-access memory (RAM), a megapixel display and megaFLOP performance, hence the name [...] "3M".|$|E
