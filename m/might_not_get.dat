25|$|As {{part of a}} multi-pronged {{approach}} to a rescue, a Chinook helicopter of No. 27 Squadron RAF was mobilised from Abu Naji to Majar al-Kabir with a quick reaction force onboard. The helicopter lifted off at 11:05am and returned to Abu Naji around 11:30am after coming under sustained fire and having at least seven casualties aboard, who were wounded by the insurgent fire. The helicopters' route into the town meant it having to fly over the rooftops to try and locate Bravo Company who were holed {{up in one of}} the houses. Whilst it flew in low, it made itself a target for small arms fire and RPGs, with no less than six RPGs being fired at the helicopter. As the damage to the helicopter was severe and casualties were mounting, the pilot, Wing Commander Guy Van den Berg, decided that safest option was to return to base. The Sergeant in charge of the QRF asked that the helicopter land away from the immediate danger and allow the non-wounded on board to disembark. Van den Berg replied that if the Chinook landed, it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> off the ground again.|$|E

500|$|A {{week before}} the final, Liverpool played Portsmouth in the 2005–06 Premier League – it was their last match before the final, and they won 3–1. The win was Liverpool's ninth {{straight}} in the competition and meant they finished the season in third place. One area of concern was the fitness of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who injured his ankle in the match and was a doubt for the final. They were also without striker Robbie Fowler, who was cup-tied after playing for Manchester City earlier in the competition. Captain Steven Gerrard {{was determined not to}} let complacency affect Liverpool; [...] "We have beaten fantastic sides like Manchester United and Chelsea to get to the final, but it is always on your mind that after going on such a successful run you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> over that last hurdle." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why.

500|$|Another {{political}} {{matter that}} did not help was the mutual distrust between the various services. At the time that GOR.339 was being defined, the Royal Navy {{was in the midst}} of its NA.39 project, which would eventually become the Blackburn Buccaneer. This was a low-altitude subsonic attack aircraft, designed for over-water as opposed to overland use. The savings involved in both forces using a common aircraft would be considerable, and Blackburn offered the RAF a version of the NA.39 to fit some of the GOR.339 requirements. The Chief of Defence Staff, and former First Sea Lord, Lord Mountbatten was a loyal proponent of the Buccaneer, later claiming that five of the type could be purchased for the same price as one TSR-2. However, the RAF rebuffed the proposal, stating that it was unsuitable due to poor takeoff performance and the avionics not being capable of the desired role. As one RAF official put it, [...] "If we show the slightest interest in NA.39 we <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the GOR.339 aircraft." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel, {{along with}} Kurt, {{plans to attend}} a {{performing}} arts school in New York City after graduation. School counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggests they consider The New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), a highly desirable school. The two attend an Ohio [...] "mixer" [...] for potential applicants, {{only to discover that}} their competition is very much like them, and quite talented. Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical, since she believes herself to be a shoo-in for the lead role, Maria, and she needs the experience for her NYADA application. However, Mercedes also auditions for Maria, and the directors, unable to decide {{between the two of them}} even after head-to-head callbacks, decide to double-cast the role, giving Rachel and Mercedes each a week of the two-week run. Mercedes, believing she did better in the callbacks, refuses to accept the double-casting and withdraws from the show, leaving Rachel to be Maria. She and Finn decide to have sex in the episode [...] "The First Time". In the episode [...] "Mash Off", Rachel abruptly withdraws from the race for senior class president in favor of Kurt after she realizes he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> into NYADA with her if he doesn't win. She goes even further in the next episode, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", when she stuffs an election ballot box in Kurt's favor to keep him from losing. He loses anyway, and she confesses: she is suspended from school for a week and forbidden to compete in Sectionals with New Directions, though the glee club wins without her. At the end of the episode [...] "Yes/No", Finn asks her to marry him, and after hesitating for several days, she accepts. Their parents find out in [...] "Heart", and hope to discourage the pair, but their plans backfire and the wedding date is moved up to May. Even that date seems too distant, so Rachel and Finn later decide to marry after Regionals in [...] "On My Way".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Morison handed in {{a written}} {{transfer}} request amid speculation about a move to newly promoted Premier League side Norwich City. Millwall subsequently rejected the transfer request. A day later, Morison revealed [...] "Norwich have made a couple of bids that have been turned down so I've done what I've done. I want to play in the Premier League, I <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> another opportunity". On 2 June 2011, Millwall accepted an offer from Norwich City for Morison after the two clubs agreed a fee for the player, it was the fourth bid Norwich had made for Morison. He signed for the club on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 6 June. Morison made his Norwich City debut against Wigan Athletic during the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, playing 75 minutes of the match in a 1–1 draw. He was crucial in Norwich's equalising goal, beating Adrián López Rodríguez on the right wing and providing a cross that was ultimately turned in by Wes Hoolahan. He scored his first goal for the club in Norwich's first home win of the season, a 2–1 victory against Sunderland on 26 September. The goal came shortly after half-time, with Morison heading in Marc Tierney's cross to give Norwich a two-goal lead. Morison scored his second goal for Norwich in a 3–3 draw against Blackburn Rovers on 29 October, with the goal being described as a [...] "stunning strike" [...] {{from the edge of the}} area. A week later, he scored a header from an acute angle in Norwich's 3–2 away defeat against Aston Villa. Morison's fourth goal of the campaign came in a 2–1 home defeat to Arsenal on 19 November, scoring the opening goal of the game after he stole the ball from Per Mertesacker before calmly beating Wojciech Szczęsny in the Arsenal goal. He scored his fourth goal in five Premier League appearances on 3 December, beating Gaël Clichy at the back post to powerfully head the ball past Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal. Morison's goal was a minor consolation in a 5–1 defeat at the City of Manchester Stadium. Morison was also on target for the Canaries in the club's 4–2 home win over Newcastle United on 10 December, scoring Norwich's third goal when he powerfully headed in Andrew Crofts' cross from 12-yards out. He scored in Norwich's first three games of 2012 despite featuring as a substitute in two of the matches, scoring once in the FA Cup in a 4–1 victory over Burnley, as well as netting late goals in 2–1 away victories against Queens Park Rangers and West Bromwich Albion respectively. After his goal at West Brom, Morison did not find the scoresheet for another three months [...] – eventually scoring his tenth goal of the campaign in a 3–3 draw away to Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on 5 May 2012. Morison's late strike from a tight angle drew Norwich level after they had trailed 3–2 with five minutes remaining. During his first season at the club, he scored ten goals in 37 appearances.|$|E

2500|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, {{announced}} that he had with regret accepted the resignations of Bishops Burnham and Newton. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales gave assurance of a warm welcome for those who wished to be part of an ordinariate. In a pastoral letter concerning his resignation as Bishop of Richborough, Newton stressed that he had done so not for [...] "negative reasons about problems in the Church of England but for positive reasons in response to our Lord's prayer the night before he died, [...] 'they may all be one'." [...] Ruth Gledhill, religious affairs correspondent of The Times, said that the announcement could prompt [...] "hundreds, possibly thousands" [...] of lay ministers to follow the bishops' example.

2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E
