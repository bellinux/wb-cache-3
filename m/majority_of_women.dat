5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in {{the west}} have their ears pierced with a piercing gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns {{not be used for}} any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were still wearing highly {{structured}} undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady {{the challenges of}} feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of}} the miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E

25|$|After Corday murdered Marat, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> distanced {{themselves}} from her {{because they believed}} that {{what she had done}} would spark a reaction against the now developing feminist movement, which was already facing criticism. Also, many of these women were attached to Marat in that they were supporters of his revolutionary efforts and sympathized with him as citizens of France.|$|E

25|$|General {{statistics}} {{indicate that}} 70–80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm. The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris and anus, and therefore intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation {{is less likely}} to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation, however, is rare among women.|$|E
25|$|The {{average age}} of women for {{marriage}} increased from 16.9 years in 1951 to 22.5 years in 2005. A <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> are married to their close relatives, i.e., first and second cousins. Only 37 percent of married women {{are not related to}} their spouses before marriage. A study published in 2000 recorded that the divorce rate in Pakistan was extremely low due to the social stigma attached to it.|$|E
25|$|To {{capitalize}} on the enlisted women's experience, commission status was open to them beginning in July 1943. To be eligible, the applicant had to have completed six months of service, be recommended by her commanding officer, and be selected by a board {{of male and female}} officers. After October 1943, the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> officers came from the ranks; only civilian women with specialized skills or exceptional leadership qualities were accepted for officer training.|$|E

25|$|Determining {{the correct}} bra size {{is the process}} {{manufacturers}} engage in to design and manufacture bras that correctly fit a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> and for individual women, the process of identifying a correctly fitting bra. Bra sizes usually consist {{of one or more}} letters indicating the breast cup size and a number, indicating a band size around the woman's torso. Bra cup sizes were invented in 1932 and band sizes became popular in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The {{marketing}} of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> they interacted with, {{and related to}} them as would masters to slaves. Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS {{cases were}} reported; 38 deaths {{resulted}} from the disease.

The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E
