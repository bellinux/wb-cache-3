5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February, German {{troops from}} the 4th Panzer Army counterattacked the Southwestern Front troops {{exploiting}} the breakthrough {{to the south of}} Kharkov, encircling many and forcing the remainder to retreat towards the Donets, beginning the Third Battle of Kharkov. The 3rd Tank Army was ordered to relieve the encircled troops, and the 15th Tank Corps changed direction, advancing towards Krasnograd. During the last days of February, the corps fought in a fierce <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> with the LSSAH and 320th Infantry Division. Operating alongside the 111th Rifle Division, the 15th captured Novaya Vodolaga and on 26February resumed its advance south, leaving the 195th Brigade to hold Novaya Vodolaga.|$|E

Heavy fighting continued {{in the area for}} three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The Americans initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On August 10, the Marines picked up the advance. However, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was withdrawn from the force on August 12 to be redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter. Task Force Kean continued forward, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E

25|$|The {{size and}} sophistication of an ambush varied from hasty <b>meeting</b> <b>engagements,</b> to full scale, {{carefully}} planned, regimental sized ambushes that included forces sufficient to encircle {{the enemy in}} the kill zone. In instances where smaller units didn't have enough troops to stage a complete five-element ambush they would set {{up one of the}} preferred ambush types and avoided close assaulting the enemy.|$|R
50|$|Such {{encounters}} normally occur {{by chance}} in small unit operations, typically when two moving forces collide unexpectedly. Engagements involving larger units may occur when intelligence, surveillance, or reconnaissance operations have been ineffective. <b>Meeting</b> <b>engagements</b> can also occur when opposing forces {{are aware of}} the general presence but not the exact location of each other and both decide to attack immediately.|$|R
25|$|The first Austrian column {{missed the}} French altogether, while Davout's cavalry held off the second column. The third column crashed head-on {{into one of}} Davout's {{infantry}} divisions in a <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement.</b> Generals of both armies led their troops with courage and skill as the troops fought over two ridges. French reinforcements finally pushed the Austrians off the southern ridge {{late in the afternoon}} and Charles ordered a retreat that night. This opened a clear path for Davout to join {{the main body of the}} French army on 20 April.|$|E
25|$|The small battle had an inordinately large {{impact on}} the Vicksburg Campaign. Union interdiction of the {{railroad}} interrupted Pemberton's attempt to further consolidate his forces and prevented him from linking up with his commanding officer, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. As a result, Pemberton was limited to three options: abandon Vicksburg, withdraw into the city and accept a siege, or fight a <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> against a superior force. Facing conflicting orders from his superiors and open insurrection from his subordinates, Pemberton would be forced into the latter choice on May 16, 1863, at the Battle of Champion Hill.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Gettysburg was {{the largest}} of the war. Starting as a chance <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> on July 1, the Confederates were {{initially}} successful in driving Union cavalry and two infantry corps from their defensive positions, through the town, and onto Cemetery Hill. On July 2, with most of both armies now present, Lee launched fierce assaults on both flanks of the Union defensive line, which were repulsed with heavy losses on both sides. On July 3, Lee focused his attention on the Union center. The defeat of his massive infantry assault, Pickett's Charge, caused Lee to order a retreat that began the evening of July 4.|$|E

25|$|Marcognet led his {{division}} at the Battle of the Mincio River on 8 February 1814. The Franco-Italian army advanced and blundered into Count Heinrich von Bellegarde's Austrian army, resulting in a confused <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement.</b> Eugène and Grenier advanced across the Mincio River {{on the right and}} center, pushing back the Austrians in front of them. The divisions of Rouyer and Quesnel led the attack with cavalry on both flanks, supported by Marcognet and Teodoro Lechi's Italian Guard. Meanwhile, Jean-Antoine Verdier's troops were barely holding out against greatly superior Austrian forces on the left flank. As Eugène directed Rouyer and Quesnel to the left to help Verdier, he brought Marcognet into the first line. In the end, the French advance was halted by a mass of Austrians and both sides pulled back. The French suffered 3,000 killed and wounded plus 500 captured, while inflicting losses of 2,800 killed and wounded and 1,200 captured on the Austrians.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Gettysburg {{is often}} {{considered}} the war's turning point. Meade defeated Lee in a three-day battle fought by 160,000 soldiers, with 51,000 casualties. It {{started as a}} <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> {{on the morning of}} July 1, when brigades from Henry Heth's division clashed with Buford's cavalry, and then John F. Reynolds's I Corps. As the Union XI Corps arrived, they and the I Corps were smashed by Ewell's and Hill's corps arriving from the north and forced back through the town, taking up defensive positions on high ground south of town. On July 2, Lee launched a massive pair of assaults against the left and right flanks of Meade's army. Fierce battles raged at Little Round Top, Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, East Cemetery Hill, and Culp's Hill. Meade was able to shift his defenders along interior lines, and they repulsed the Confederate advances. On July 3, Lee launched Pickett's Charge against the Union center, and almost three divisions were slaughtered. By this time, Stuart had returned, and he fought an inconclusive cavalry duel to the east of the main battlefield, attempting to drive into the Union rear area. The two armies stayed in position on July 4 (the same day the Battle of Vicksburg ended in a stunning Union victory), and then Lee ordered a retreat back across the Potomac to Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The Donbass Offensive succeeded, and {{the advance}} of the 8th Army {{continued}} in the Rostov-Novocherkassk Operation from 3 to 10 January 1920. The 33rd attacked from the Diakovo area towards Rostov and conducted a <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> with elements of the White Consolidated Cavalry Corps {{in the area of}} Generalsky Most, then participated in the capture of Rostov on 7 January. Between 17 January and 6 February, the division fought in the Don-Manych Offensive, fighting in the area of Starocherkasskaya, Aksayskaya, Manychskaya, and Zlodeiskaya. The division then fought in the Tikhoretsk Operation from 14 February to 2 March, during which a White counterattack briefly recaptured Rostov, which was retaken by the 8th Army on 23 February. In March, the division became part of the 9th Army. Lewandowski was promoted to command the 9th Army, and division commissar Oscar Stigga took command. From 3 to 27 March, the division fought in the Kuban-Novorossiysk Offensive, during which it advanced towards Timagievskaya, Medvedovskaya, and Abinsk. The 33rd fought in the capture of Novorossiysk, which resulted in the evacuation of the remnants of the Don Army and the Volunteer Army. During March and April, the division participated in mopping-up operations against remaining scattered White troops in the Maykop area, and the Stanitsas of Kamennomostnaya and Andryukovskaya, among others. During April and May, the division was part of the 10th Army. The division then became part of the 9th Kuban Army for the remainder of May.|$|E

50|$|The {{division}} {{remained on}} the western front after the Nordwind offensive, fighting American forces around Trier and Koblenz on the Moselle River in March. By Easter 1945 it numbered about 2,000 soldiers, including stragglers from other units. It still had six howitzers and an assault gun. The division refused to give up, and moved east to re-establish contact with other German units. However, as it moved, it drew the attention of the US Army by cutting American lines of communication. In early April 1945 {{over the course of several}} days the U.S. 71st Division fought a series of <b>meeting</b> <b>engagements</b> with the 6th SS Division Nord. As a result, the division was destroyed; its personnel scattered or captured.|$|R

In May 1966 the newly raised 5 and 6 RAR arrived in theatre {{as a part of}} the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) in Phuoc Tuy Province, establishing a base at Nui Dat. After two months of constant patrolling by both battalions, 6 RAR was engaged in the action that would become a defining part of the regiment's war in Vietnam; the Battle of Long Tan. Fought on 18 August 1966, 108 men from D Company, 6 RAR fought a ferocious <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> with the Viet Cong 275th Regiment, possibly reinforced by at least one North Vietnamese battalion, and D445 Battalion (between 1,500 and 2,500 personnel). After fighting for two and a half hours, D Company was surrounded on three sides. However, with the assistance of strong artillery support they were able to hold their position until the timely arrival of a relief force of infantry and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) finally forced the Viet Cong to break. In the words of the official historian, Ian McNeill, [...] "D Company had achieved a stunning victory".|$|E

2500|$|The loss of General Reynolds was keenly {{felt by the}} army. He was {{loved by}} his men and {{respected}} by his peers. There are no recorded instances of negative comments made by his contemporaries. Historian Shelby Foote wrote that many considered him [...] "not only the highest ranking [...] but also the best general in the army." [...] His death had a more immediate effect that day, however. By ratifying Buford's defensive plan and engaging his I Corps infantry, Reynolds essentially selected the location for the Battle of Gettysburg for Meade, turning a chance <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement</b> into a massive pitched battle, committing the Army of the Potomac to fight on that ground with forces that were initially numerically inferior to the Confederates that were concentrating there. In the command confusion that followed Reynolds' death, the two Union corps that reached the field were overwhelmed and forced to retreat {{through the streets of}} Gettysburg to the high ground south of town, where they were rallied by his old friend, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock.|$|E
500|$|There is {{speculation}} {{by historians}} and biographers {{about how many}} battles Wellington actually participated in during his career. Military historian, Ian Fletcher, identifies twenty-four major battles and sieges involving the British Army between 1808 and 1815 with Wellington in command of seventeen. Military historian, Mark Adkin, comments that [...] "Wellington had fought in some twenty-four battles and sieges prior to Waterloo". Although this is easily contested, the precise number of battles may never be known. It can be established from records, dispatches and reports {{dating back to the}} events that he was present in at least fifty separate military actions, including an assortment of <b>meeting</b> <b>engagements,</b> pitched battles, sieges, skirmishes and minor engagements, throughout his career. He also ordered countless other remote engagements mostly whilst serving in the Napoleonic Wars, during which Britain {{played a major role in}} securing Europe against French occupation, between 1805 and 1815.|$|R
2500|$|The Race to the Sea {{took place}} from about [...] 1914, after the Battle of the Frontiers (7 August–13 September) and the German advance into France, {{which had been}} stopped at the First Battle of the Marne [...] and was {{followed}} by the First Battle of the Aisne [...] a Franco-British counter-offensive. The term described reciprocal attempts by the Franco-British and German armies, to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army through Picardy, Artois and Flanders, rather than an attempt to advance northwards to the sea. Troops were moved from the French-German border by both sides, to the western flank to prevent opposing outflanking moves and then to counter-outflank the opponent. At the battles of Picardy and Albert in late September, the French Second and German 6th armies fought <b>meeting</b> <b>engagements</b> from the Oise north to the Somme but neither was able to envelop the northern flank of the opponent.|$|R
50|$|On 20 May 1916, Jacquet's gunner was Louis Robin. The Belgian duo fought <b>meeting</b> <b>engagements</b> with German floatplanes both {{morning and}} evening. In the evening battle, they took on half a {{formation}} of ten enemy planes, and sent one down for Jacquet's second confirmed win. There followed {{a string of}} unconfirmed claims, on 26 and 27 May and on 22 June. On 23 June, the Belgian Farman F.40 with the ghoulish insignia of a skull painted on the nose scored again, destroying a Fokker. Over the next month, the two Belgians rampaged, claiming two more wins that went unconfirmed, dropping flechettes on a German observation balloon, and strafing the Germans at Ghistelles. On the afternoon and evening of 30 July, Jacquet and Robin clashed {{with a series of}} Germans, being credited with an LVG destroyed. Their probable victim was Oberleutnant Franz Walz, who was downed with severe wounds that day.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{skirmish}} {{that followed}} between Gage's soldiers and the French, the French commander, Beaujeu, {{was killed by}} the first volley of musket fire by the grenadiers. Although some 100 French Canadians fled back to the fort and {{the noise of the}} cannon held the Indians off, Beaujeu's death did not {{have a negative effect on}} French morale; Dumas rallied the rest of the French and their Indian allies. The battle, known as the Battle of the Monongahela, or the Battle of the Wilderness, or just Braddock's Defeat, was officially begun. Braddock's force was approximately 1,400 men. The British faced a French and Indian force estimated to number between 300 and 900. The battle, frequently described as an ambush, was actually a <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement,</b> where two forces clash at an unexpected time and place. The quick and effective response of the French and Indians [...] despite the early loss of their commander [...] led many of Braddock's men to believe they had been ambushed. However, French documents reveal that the French and Indian force was too late to prepare an ambush, and had been just as surprised as the British.|$|E
2500|$|While Vietnamese sources {{maintain}} an ambush was planned at Long Tan, whether they also intended attacking Nui Dat remains uncertain. The fact a large Viet Cong force {{had not been}} identified in the area before midday on 18 August suggests no such force was there, and consequently {{it could not have}} been occupying an ambush position awaiting the arrival of the reaction force from Nui Dat. Despite this, it seems likely the 5th Division had planned an ambush but were ill-prepared {{due to a lack of}} co-ordination between the morning of 17 August and the selection and occupation of the intended site. As a result, they appear to have been unready when D Company entered the plantation and were likely somewhere on its eastern edge instead. The Viet Cong were probably still conducting their reconnaissance and establishing the ambush in the vicinity of where the rubber met the jungle when the battle occurred, while the Australians may have upset their plan by moving faster than the ARVN and US troops they had previously fought. What followed then appears to have been an encounter battle as the two advancing forces clashed on open ground in a <b>meeting</b> <b>engagement.</b> An alternative explanation is that D Company approached from an unexpected direction, physically dislocating the ambush. Indeed, Thu stated [...] "...we didn't know how many... had in Nui Dat. We tried to draw them out... We thought they would go one way but... went the wrong way and came behind us." [...] In July 2006, David Sabben—platoon commander 12 Platoon—and Bob Buick—platoon sergeant 11 Platoon—visited the battlefield for a television story on 60 Minutes, where they met Nguyen Minh Ninh, former vice-commander D445 Battalion. Minh told them: [...] "You won. But we won also. Tactically and militarily you won—but politically, we won. In this battle you acted out of our control—you [...] from our trap." [...] According to journalist Cameron Stewart it was the first time a senior North Vietnamese officer had admitted being defeated at Long Tan.|$|E
