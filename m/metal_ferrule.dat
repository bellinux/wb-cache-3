2500|$|Lock-blade knives {{have been}} dated to the 15th century. [...] In Spain, one early lock-blade design was the Andalusian clasp knife popularly {{referred}} to as the navaja. [...] Opinel knives use a twist lock, consisting of a <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> or barrel ring that is rotated to lock the blade either open or closed. [...] In the late 20th century lock-blade pocket knives were popularized and marketed on a wider scale. Companies such as Buck Knives, Camillus, Case, and Gerber, created a wide range of products with locks of various types. The most popular form, the lockback knife, was popularized by Buck Knives in the 1960s, so much that the eponymous term [...] "buck knife" [...] was used to refer to lockback knives that were not manufactured by Buck.|$|E
50|$|Most handles have {{a silver}} sleeve and {{lacquered}} braided fiber rings that sit on top. Nobility hilts {{were made of}} ivory, carabao horn, or kamagong (Philippine ebony). Other barong swords have less elaborate hilts and are smaller in size. Common motifs include the cockatoo and naga (dragon). The long <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> is most often made of silver, though copper, brass and swaasa is also used. Barongs used in World War II may also have aluminium ferrules. The ferrule tends to be around 8 cm (3 inches) in length. Often the ferrule will have lacquered braided natural fiber rings to aid in grip. Sometimes these fiber rings were {{on top of the}} ferrule, but often what would appear to be a solid <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> would in fact be a number of metal bands that alternate between the fiber bands.|$|E
50|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church {{and some}} of the Oriental Orthodox Churches an ecclesiastical walking stick is used by bishops, archimandrites and hegumens (abbots) when walking outside. It is usually made of dark wood and is straight, rather than having a curved handle. The walking stick used by bishops and archimandrites is {{normally}} adorned with a silver grip at the top and a <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> at the tip. The walking stick used by a hegumen or hegumenia (abbess) is normally of plain wood, unadorned.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>ferrules</b> {{may be of}} aluminum, nickel, copper, or {{nickel-plated}} steel. Quill ferrules {{are also}} found: these give a different [...] "feel" [...] to the brush, and are staple of French-style aquarel wash brushes.|$|R
50|$|The smelter {{includes}} an induction furnace for {{the manufacture of}} ingots and <b>metal</b> <b>ferrules.</b> The <b>metals</b> are melted in the furnace at 1600 °C. Impurities are removed manually, then the molten metal is poured into a ladle and is then cast into ingots or centrifuged in a tube.|$|R
50|$|Control panels had a {{rectangular}} array of holes called hubs which were organized into groups. Wires with <b>metal</b> <b>ferrules</b> {{at each end}} {{were placed in the}} hubs to make connections. The output from some card column positions might connected to a tabulating machine's counter, for example. A shop would typically have separate control panels for each task a machine was used for.|$|R
50|$|Regulation Canadian hakapiks {{consist of}} a <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> that weighs at least 340 g (12 oz) with a {{slightly}} bent spike not more than 14 cm (5.5 in) in length {{on one side of}} the ferrule and a blunt projection not more than 1.3 cm (0.5 in) in length on the opposite side of the ferrule and that is attached to a wooden handle that measures not less than 105 cm (3.4 ft) and not more than 153 cm (5 ft) in length and not less than 3 cm and not more than 5.1 cm (2 in) in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Many {{other methods}} {{can be used}} to attach hoses or tubing, such as {{compression}} fittings (where a nylon or soft <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> is compressed onto the hose by the tightening of the fitting), push-fit fittings (where the hose is inserted inside of a compression sleeve, designed such that force against the hose causes the sleeve to tighten), swage fittings (where a stiff collar is compressed onto the hose), clamp fittings (where two blocks are tightened onto the sides of the hose, often found on garden hoses), crimp banding (similar to worm gear banding but a crimp is used instead of a screw/thread), and a multitude of others. However, these devices are not typically referred to as hose clamps.|$|E

50|$|The fourth type {{of system}} employs string-through body anchoring. The strings pass over the bridge saddles, then through holes through {{the top of the}} guitar body to the back. The strings are {{typically}} anchored in place {{at the back of the}} guitar by <b>metal</b> <b>ferrules.</b> Many believe this design improves a guitar's sustain and timbre. A few examples of string-through body guitars are the Fender Telecaster Thinline, the Fender Telecaster Deluxe, the B.C. Rich IT Warlock and Mockingbird, and the Schecter Omen 6 and 7 series.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{generally}} accepted {{to refer to}} a shaft of hardwood from 6 to 9 ft long, sometimes with a <b>metal</b> tip, <b>ferrule,</b> or spike at one or both ends.The term [...] "short staff" [...] compares this to the [...] "long staff" [...] based on the pike with a length in excess of 11 to 12 ft.|$|R
50|$|The bow {{consists}} of a stick with a ribbon of horsehair strung between the tip and frog (or nut, or heel) at opposite ends. At the frog end, a screw adjuster tightens or loosens the hair. The frog may be decorated with two eyes made of shell, with or without surrounding metal rings. A flat slide usually made of ebony and shell covers the mortise where the hair is held by its wedge. A <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> holds the hair-spreading wedge and the shell slide in place. Just forward of the frog, a leather grip or thumb cushion protects the stick and provides grip for the player's hand. Forward of the leather, a winding serves a similar purpose, as well as affecting {{the balance of the}} bow. The winding may be wire, silk, or whalebone (now imitated by alternating strips of yellow and black plastic.) Some student bows (particularly the ones made of solid fiberglass) substitute a plastic sleeve for grip and winding.|$|E
5000|$|The lead of {{the pencil}} {{is a mix of}} finely ground {{graphite}} and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and {{the amount of time spent}} on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a [...] "slat," [...] and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted. Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a <b>metal</b> <b>ferrule</b> to be secured onto the wood. A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.|$|E

25|$|Rods for {{travelers}} {{were made with}} nickel-silver <b>metal</b> joints, or <b>ferrules,</b> that could be inserted into one another forming the rod. Some of them were made {{to be used as}} a walking cane until needed for sport. Since the 1980s, with the advent of flexible, yet stiff graphite ferrules, travel rod technology has greatly advanced, and multi-piece travel rods that can be transported in a suitcase or backpack constitute a large share of the market.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted to evaluate the degree of band broadening in very high pressure LC due to column connections. Different column manufacturers use slightly different designs for their column fittings. If the same column connections are repeatedly used to attach columns of different origins, different void volumes form between capillary tubes and column inlets. An Agilent Ultra Low Dispersion Kit (tubing id 75 μm) was installed on an Agilent Infinity 1290 ultra HPLC and used to connect successively an Agilent, a Phenomenex, and a Waters column. A series of uracil (unretained) samples were injected and eluted at {{a wide range of}} flow rates with a water/acetonitrile mixture as eluent. In order to determine the variance contribution from column connections as accurately as possible a nonretained probe compound was selected because the variance contribution from the column is the smallest for analytes, which have very low k values. Yet, this effect still has an impact on the resolution for moderately retained compounds (k > 2) for narrow-bore columns packed with fine particles, since variance contributions are additive for linear chromatographic systems. Each injection was replicated five times under the same experimental conditions. Then NanoViper column connections (tubing id 75 μm) were used and the same injections were made. This system was designed to minimize connection void volumes for any column. Band variances were calculated as the second central moment of elution peaks and used to assess the degree of band broadening due to the column connections. Band broadening may increase from 3. 8 to 53. 9 % when conventional <b>metal</b> <b>ferrules</b> were used to join columns to connection sites. The results show that the variance contribution from improper connections can generate as much as 60. 5 % of the total variance observed. This demonstrates that column connections can play a larger role than the column packing with respect to band dispersion. <br /...|$|R
