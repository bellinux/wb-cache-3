We use the unique {{features of the}} margin trading system in India {{to test the hypothesis}} that there is a causal relationship between traders’ leverage constraints (i. e., their ability to borrow to invest in risky assets) and a stock’s market liquidity. In India, the list of stocks eligible for margin trading is revised every month, creating a series of quasi-experiments that provide traders of newly eligible and ineligible stocks with shocks to the availability of leverage. We employ a regression discontinuity design that exploits the threshold rules that determine a stock’s margin trading eligibility. When we compare the liquidity of eligible and ineligible stocks that lie close to the eligibility threshold, we find that liquidity is higher when stocks become eligible for margin trading and that it decreases with ineligibility. Using available data on <b>margin</b> <b>financing</b> activity at the individual stock level, we try to uncover the mechanisms driving this main finding. We find evidence consistent with the idea that the liquidity enhancement that we observe stems from margin traders’ contrarian strategies...|$|E

Applying data for asset values, we examine the substitution between collateral and interest margins. Consistent with the theories of Bester (1985), Besanko and Thakor (1987) and the empirical evidence of Cressy (1996 b), we find that a trade-off between collateral and interest margins exists. Our main result indicates that follow-up finance is more expensive for loans but not for overdrafts. We suggest that a relatively fixed asset base (Land and Buildings), as seen in higher security to loan values, raises the price and risk of successive financial increments.

40|$|Atmospheric {{extinction}} causes significant {{radiation losses}} between the heliostat {{field and the}} receiver in a solar tower plants. These losses vary with site and time. State of the art is that in ray-tracing and plant optimization tools, atmospheric extinction is included by choosing between few constant standard atmospheric conditions. Even though some tools allow the consideration of site and time dependent extinction data, such data sets are nearly never available. This paper summarizes and compares the most common model equations implemented in several ray-tracing tools. There are already several methods developed and published to measure extinction on-site. An overview of the existing methods is also given here. Ray-tracing simulations of one exemplary tower plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) are presented to estimate the plant yield deviations between simulations using standard model equations instead of extinction time series. For PSA, the effect of atmospheric extinction accounts for losses between 1. 6 and 7 %. This range is caused by considering overload dumping or not. Applying standard clear or hazy model equations instead of extinction time series lead to an underestimation of the annual plant yield at PSA. The discussion {{of the effect of}} extinction in Tower plants has to include overload dumping. Situations in which overload dumping occurs are mostly connected to high radiation levels and low atmospheric extinction. Therefore it can be recommended that project developers should consider site and time dependent extinction data especially on hazy sites. A reduced uncertainty of the plant yield prediction can significantly reduce costs due to smaller risk <b>margins</b> for <b>financing</b> and EPCs. The generation of extinction data for several locations in form of representative yearly time series or geographical maps should be further elaborated...|$|R
