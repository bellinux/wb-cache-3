25|$|The mosque {{features}} a minaret, an unusual feature in Javanese <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> The minaret {{is located on}} the southwest corner of the mosque. It is an 11 meter tower of white-washed brick, consists of three floors and topped with a clay roof tiles topped with a terracotta mustaka. The minaret shows Portuguese influence. There is a similarity between this minaret and the minaret of the ruined Masjid Pecinan Tinggi in Old Banten.|$|E
25|$|Historical Islamic kingdoms {{that existed}} in Bengal {{employed}} several clever technologies in numerous areas such as architecture, agriculture, civil engineering, water management, etc. The creation of canals and resoirvoirs was a common practice for the sultanate. New methods of irrigation were pioneered by the Sufis. Bengali <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> featured terracotta, stone, wood and bamboo, with curved roofs, corner towers and multiple domes. During the Bengal Sultanate, a distinct regional style flourished which featured no minarets, but had richly designed mihrabs and minbars as niches.|$|E
25|$|Encompasses both {{secular and}} {{religious}} styles, the design and style made by Muslims and their construction of buildings and structures in Islamic culture included the architectural types: the Mosque, the Tomb, the Palace and the Fort. Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic art is architecture, particularly that of the mosque. Through Islamic architecture, effects of varying cultures within Islamic civilization can be illustrated. Generally, the use of Islamic geometric patterns and foliage based arabesques were striking. There was also the use of decorative calligraphy instead of pictures which were haram (forbidden) in <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> Note that in secular architecture, human and animal representation was indeed present.|$|E

25|$|The Great Mosque of Kairouan {{in present-day}} Tunisia was {{reportedly}} the first mosque built in northwest Africa, with {{its present form}} (dating from the 9th century) serving {{as a model for}} other Islamic places of worship in the Maghreb. It was the first to incorporate a square minaret (as opposed to the more common circular minaret) and includes naves akin to a basilica. Those features can also be found in Andalusian mosques, including the Grand Mosque of Cordoba, as they tended to reflect the architecture of the Moors instead of their Visigoth predecessors. Still, some elements of Visigothic architecture, like horseshoe arches, were infused into the <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> of Spain and the Maghreb.|$|E
25|$|The site {{is unique}} for its {{architectural}} style which combines both Zoroastrian and Islamic motifs. The building's facade {{is covered in}} intricately decorated brick work, which features circular patterns reminiscent of the sun - a common image in Zoroastrian art from the region at that time which {{is reminiscent of the}} Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, who is typically represented by fire and light. The building's shape is cuboid, and reminiscent of the Ka'aba in Makkah, while the domed roof is a typical feature of <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> The syncretic style of the shrine is reflective of the 9th-10th centuries - a time when the region still had large populations of Zoroastrians who had begun to convert to Islam around that time.|$|E
25|$|Muslim palaces {{included}} domical halls {{as early}} as the eighth century, well before domes became standard elements of <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> The early eighth century palace of Khirbat al-Minya included a domed gateway. The palace of Qasr Mshatta and a ninth century palace at Samarra included domed throne rooms. A domed structure covered a shallow pool in the main courtyard of the mid eighth century palace of Khirbat al-Mafjar. Similar examples at mosques, such as the domed fountains at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun (destroyed in 987 and replaced with a different structure), at Maarrat al-Numan, in Nishapur, Tripoli, and at the Mosque of Damascus seem to be related to this element of palace architecture, although they were later used as part of ritual ablution.|$|E

25|$|Southeast Asia {{was slow}} to adopt Middle Eastern {{architectural}} styles. Islam entered Indonesia in the 15th-century via Java island, during which period the dominant religion in Southeast Asia included a variety of pagan groups. Introduction of Islam was peaceful. Existing architectural features in Indonesia such as the candi bentar gate, paduraksa (normally marks entrance to the most sacred precincts), and the sacred pyramidal roof was used for Islamic architecture. For centuries, Indonesian mosques lacked domes or minarets, both considered a Middle Eastern origin. Indonesian original mosques feature multi-layered pyramidal roofs and no minaret. Prayer are called by striking a prayer's drum known as beduk. The minaret of the Menara Kudus Mosque is {{a great example of}} Indonesian architecture. Indonesian <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> also features strong influence from the Middle Eastern architecture styles.|$|E
25|$|The Jamali Kamali mosque, {{positioned}} in an enclosed garden area, built first {{during the years}} 1528-29, has a southern entry. It is built in red sandstone with marble embellishments. It is {{claimed to be a}} forerunner in the design of Mughal <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> in India. The prayer hall, fronted by a large courtyard, has five arches with the central arch only having a dome. The size of arches increases towards the central arch, which is the largest of the five arches embellished with beautiful ornamentation. The spandrels of the arch are decorated with medallions and ornamentation. Fluted pilasters exquisitely decorate the central arch. The prayer wall on the west has niches with mihrab. The niches and walls are decorated with a few Koranic inscriptions. A porch around the mosque provides access to the two storied mosque and the four corners are adorned by octagonal towers. The rear end of the mosque has been provided with oriel windows, apart from a small window on the central arch.|$|E
25|$|Early Muslim explorers and missionaries {{arrived in}} Bengal {{late in the}} first {{millennium}} CE. The Islamic conquest of Bengal began with the 1204 invasion by Bakhtiar Khilji; after annexing Bengal to the Delhi Sultanate, Khilji waged a military campaign in Tibet. Bengal was ruled by the Delhi Sultanate for a century by governors from the Khilji, Mamluk, Balban and Tughluq dynasties. During the 14th century, an independent Bengal Sultanate was established by rebel governors. The sultanate's ruling houses included the Ilyas Shahi, Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, Hussain Shahi, Suri and Karrani dynasties, and the era saw the introduction of a distinct <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> and the tangka currency. The Arakan region was brought under Bengali hegemony. The Bengal Sultanate was visited by explorers Ibn Battuta, Admiral Zheng He and Niccolo De Conti. During the late 16th century, the Baro-Bhuyan (a confederation of Muslim and Hindu aristocrats) ruled eastern Bengal; its leader was the Mansad-e-Ala, a title held by Isa Khan and his son Musa Khan. The Khan dynasty are considered local heroes for resisting North Indian invasions with their river navies.|$|E
25|$|The Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, in a {{relatively}} unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab Bedouin's tent, with its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets.

50|$|The <b>mosque's</b> <b>architecture</b> is a {{blend of}} Moorish and Mughal influences.

25|$|Much of the Muslim {{architecture}} of Al-Andalus was lost as mosques {{were replaced by}} churches after the twelfth century, {{but the use of}} domes in surviving Mozarabic churches from the tenth century, such as the paneled dome at Santo Tomás de las Ollas and the lobed domes at the Monastery of San Miguel de Escalada, likely reflects their use in contemporary <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture.</b> The Great Mosque of Córdoba, begun in 785 under the last of the Umayyad caliphs, was enlarged by Al-Hakam II between 961 and 976 to include four domes and a remodeled mihrab. The central dome, in front of the mihrab area, transitions from a square bay with decorative squinches to eight overlapping and intersecting arches that surround and support a scalloped dome. These crossed-arch domes are the first known examples of the type and, although their possible origins in Persia or elsewhere in the east remains a matter of debate, their complexity suggests that earlier examples must have existed. The nine bays of the Mosque of Cristo de la Luz, built about 50 years later, contain a virtual catalog of crossed-arch dome variations. After the 10th century, examples can also be found in Armenia and Persia.|$|E
500|$|Excavations {{commenced}} at Gedi in 1948 {{under the}} supervision of James Kirkman, lasting until 1958 with intermittent excavations occurring in the 1960s to the 1980s. Kirkman excavated the buildings at the city's core, including the palace, and several of the mosques and houses, as well as, cleared and repaired the walls. The Great Mosque was excavated in 1954 and the palace was excavated in 1963. Following his excavation of the Great Mosque, Kirkman's report [...] "The Arab City of Gedi, The Great <b>Mosque,</b> <b>Architecture</b> and Finds" [...] was published, followed by a series of monographs and papers.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the center}} of the mosque complex is the main mosque. The main mosque {{consists}} of a main prayer hall, surrounded by three [...] "porch" [...] (serambi) to the north, east, and south. The layout of the main prayer hall is square-shaped, roughly 11.30 x 11.50 meter. The roof is built in a typical Javanese <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> with three-tiers, supported by four main posts (saka guru) and topped with a terracota mustaka (roof top decoration). The main prayer hall's interior is constructed of white-washed brick. Two doors provide entrance to the north and south of the hall. The mihrab is located {{to the west of the}} main prayer hall and contains motifs of false columns and plant-like arabesque on top, reminiscent of the kala makara motif of classical candi architecture. The serambi of Kasunyatan Mosque is enclosed with wall, which is unusual for Javanese <b>mosque</b> <b>architecture</b> which usually has its serambi wall-less like a porch. The northern serambi kept a bedug and an inscription which marked the year the Kasunyatan Mosque received its heritage status in 1932 by Soeria Nata Atmaja. The eastern serambi contains 18 tombs, including the tomb of Ratu Asiyah and Syekh Abdul Syukur Putra. The southern serambi contains 5 tombs.|$|E
50|$|Overall, the <b>mosque's</b> <b>architecture</b> {{combines}} a traditional Chinese architectural form with Islamic functionality. For example, whereas traditional Chinese buildings align along a north-south axis {{in accordance with}} feng shui, the mosque is directed west towards Mecca, while still conforming to the axes of the imperial city. Furthermore, calligraphy in both Chinese and Arabic writing appears throughout the complex, sometimes exhibiting a fusion of styles called Sini, referring to Arabic text written in Chinese-influenced script. Some scholars also speculate that the three-story, octagonal pagoda in the third courtyard, called the Shengxinlou or “Examining the Heart Tower,” originally served as the mosque's minaret, used for the call to prayer.|$|R
