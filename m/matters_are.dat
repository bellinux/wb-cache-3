50|$|The {{history of}} the concept of <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{history of the}} {{fundamental}} length scales used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> atoms, or that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hadrons, or that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.|$|R

5000|$|In physics, exotic <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>matter</b> {{that somehow}} {{deviates}} from normal matter and has [...] "exotic" [...] properties. A more broad definition of exotic <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> {{any kind of}} non-baryonic matter—that is not made of baryons, the subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons, of which ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> composed. Exotic mass has been considered a colloquial term for matters such as dark matter, negative mass, or complex mass.|$|R

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), {{thanks to}} his new-found friend Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson), overhears the Duras sisters {{planning}} to rendezvous with the Bajoran to give him materials {{that could be used}} to build a bomb. The crew allow him to take a runabout and to arrest him after the transaction. Kira finds herself confused about her own past with the Bajoran resistance and where her current loyalties stand, and offers to go with Tahna in the runabout. Commander Sisko and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) wait in a second runabout nearby while Tahna and Kira complete the transaction. When the second runabout appears, Tahna realizes he has been set up; <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> further complicated by the arrival of the Cardassian warship.|$|E
5|$|Lobbying {{is common}} in Annapolis; {{there are more than}} 700 lobbyists {{registered}} with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E
5|$|Reserved <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> {{subjects}} that {{are outside the}} legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament. The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers). These include broadcasting policy, civil service, common markets for UK goods and services, constitution, electricity, coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, defence and national security, drug policy, employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, most aspects of transport safety and regulation, National Lottery, protection of borders, most aspects of social security and stability of UK's fiscal, economic and monetary system.|$|E

5|$|The X-Files series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode Mulder and Scully are called to Milford Falls, New Hampshire to {{investigate}} {{the death of a}} teenager who seems to have died during an occult ritual of some sort. As a result of their arrival in town a few of the local high school's faculty, who had self-stylized as devil-worshipers when they were teens but long ago stopped worshiping the devil, decide they should take steps to conceal their past activities. <b>Matters</b> <b>are</b> further complicated when the devil seems to have decided to personally interfere.|$|E
5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} devolved <b>matters</b> <b>are</b> {{all subjects}} {{which are not}} explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters. All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, economic development, education, environment, food standards, consumer advocacy, health, abortion, home affairs, Scots law, courts, legal profession, police and fire services, prisons, control of air guns, local government, sport and the arts, transport, road signs, speed limits, rail franchising, training, tourism, research and statistics, social work and various welfare and housing related benefits. In terms of tax powers, the Scottish Parliament has full control over income tax rates and thresholds on all non-savings and non-dividend income liable for tax by taxpayers resident in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament also has full control over Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax.|$|E
50|$|Strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{particular}} form of quark matter, usually {{thought of as a}} liquid of up, down, and strange quarks. It is contrasted with nuclear <b>matter,</b> which <b>is</b> a liquid of neutrons and protons (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark <b>matter,</b> which <b>is</b> a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> expected to be color superconducting. Strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers (quark stars).|$|R

50|$|As seen in {{the above}} discussion, many early {{definitions}} of what can <b>be</b> called ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>were</b> based upon its structure or building blocks. On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> everything that is composed of quarks and leptons, or ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons. The connection between these formulations follows.|$|R
5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. <b>Matters</b> <b>are</b> complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E
