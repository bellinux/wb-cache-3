40|$|Insect {{pest control}} {{programs}} incorporating the sterile insect technique (SIT) {{rely on the}} mass production and release <b>of</b> sterilized <b>insects</b> to reduce the wild-type population through infertile matings. Most effective programs release only males to avoid any crop damage caused by female fruit flies or transmission of disease by female mosquitoes. Therefore, the females have to be eliminated, preferably in an early developmental stage, during mass rearing. Different systems and techniques have been created for the sex separation <b>of</b> a few <b>insect</b> species. One <b>of</b> these is the transgenic sex-specific fluorescent protein <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>insects</b> with automated fluorescent-based sorting of the individuals to achieve sex separation.

40|$|Immunomarking systems used {{to track}} {{large-scale}} movement patterns <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> are {{highly dependent on}} {{the efficiency of the}} enzyme linked imunosorbent assay (ELISA) reaction and logistical factors (e. g. concentration of marker applied, ability of the marker to wet the insect cuticle, and trapping methods). This paper examines ways to increase ELISA efficiency and mediate logistical factors, and provides information on a new immunomarking protein based on wheat gluten. The present studies on improving efficiency of the ELISA reactions showed that specially treated microplate surfaces were needed for soymilk and gluten assays, but not for egg albumin and casein assays. Sample dilution was investigated and was found to improve the signal/noise (S/N) ratio for the albumin and casein assays, but S/N ratios for the gluten and soymilk assays were less sensitive. However, for all assays, marked specimens were still detectable even with dilutions down to 6 % of the original sample, which would allow more tests to be run on the same initial sample volume. For the logistical factors, these studies showed that <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> an <b>insect</b> by having it walk across a dried residue could be virtually eliminated for the casein and soymilk assays when the concentration applied was reduced to < 4 %, but residues o...|$|R

40|$|Dyes and dusts {{have been}} used to mark insects {{internally}} and externally for decades, the majority of examples coming from laboratory-reared pest species used in mark-release-recapture studies. Using dyes or dusts to <b>mark</b> populations <b>of</b> pests and beneficial insects simultaneously in the field has received less attention. We evaluated a water-soluble fluorescent dye and a resin-based fluorescent pigment sprayed on crops to mark beneficial and pest insects, and monitored the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>insects.</b> Our results show that resin-based dyes provide an effective mark on several species <b>of</b> <b>insects</b> among several orders. The resin-based dye is also relatively inexpensive, non-toxic, UV-stable and water resistant, unlike a water-soluble dye. Using the resin-based dye in a broccoli production system, we were able to monitor simultaneously the movement of field populations of the parasitoids, Diadegma semiclausum (Helleacuten) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and Apanteles ippeus (Nixon) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and the adult stage of the host, diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.)

40|$|The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} maize pests in the Americas and particularly in South America. With the adoption of genetically modified plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins for lepidopterous pest control, there is a need for establishing strategies to delay the development <b>of</b> <b>insect</b> resistance (e. g. refuge areas). Thus, information on target insects' dispersal is essential to improve pest management techniques. The objective of this work was to evaluate the dispersal capacity of S. frugiperda adults using mark-release-recapture techniques. Insects were marked using red oil-soluble dye in the larval artificial diet. Marked adults were released twice in each growing season (dry and wet) in southeastern Brazil in 2006 and 2007. Recapture <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>insects</b> was performed using light and pheromone traps. Males are more attracted to light traps than females and the recapture rate was higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. The most adequate model to explain the relationship between flight distance and number <b>of</b> recaptured <b>insects</b> is y = a(2) / (1 + (2 a(1. 8) + bx)) ((2. 6)), where y is the distance and x is the number captured.

40|$|Experiments {{based on}} the method of mark-recapture {{can be used for}} {{estimation}} of the abundance of natural populations, for monitoring dispersion of groups or individual specimens within a population using group or individual marking. Semiaquatic bugs (Heteroptera: Gerromorpha) were marked and recaptured many times in the field during research, individual marking was much less used since <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> small <b>insects</b> is difficult. The aim of this work is to develop a method <b>of</b> individual <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> semiaquatic bugs so that it would meet conditions such as durability, legibility and non affecting health <b>of</b> the <b>marked</b> specimen. Semiaquatic bugs of Aquarius paludum, Gerris lacustris, Limnoporus rufoscutellatus (Gerridae) and Velia caprai (Veliidae) species were selected as experimental organisms. Partial aims of this thesis were to try using this method to describe the abundance of the monitored population and to monitor dispersion of the selected species, both at lotic (V. caprai) and lentic habitats (water striders, family Gerridae). A new method <b>of</b> individual <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> semiaquatic bugs was developed on the basis of modifications of the commonly used methods. After a series of tests and in-field research, this method proved to be suitable as it met the essential conditions for <b>marking</b> <b>insects.</b> The abundance <b>of</b> the monitored population was estimated and dispersion of the selected species (V. caprai) in running water was described by using this method. The partial aims of this thesis were met, too. It was confirmed that individuals of the V. caprai species move between the monitored areas along the water course. This inclination to move is greater than tendency to remain in the place of release. The gained data also show conclusively higher rate of movement of V. caprai specimens in the upstream direction, compared to the downstream. The tendency of V. caprai to travel larger distance upstream than downstream, is significant too. No statistically relevant difference in either direction of the water course (up or down) in the surpassed altitude difference was confirmed. The differences in the monitored phenomena between the sexes and generations were compared as well. The differences, however, were not significant. A movement of the adults of the water cricket Velia caprai thus can be characterized as an upstream migration, common in <b>insects</b> <b>of</b> lotic habtitats. A part of the study taking place in still waters showed, that G. lacustris specimens move {{on the surface of the}} pond, but not to a larger degree than they remain in place. On the other hand, A. paludum specimens were proved to move away from the place of release rather than remaining in that place. These also overcome greater distance than G. lacustris specimens...|$|R
