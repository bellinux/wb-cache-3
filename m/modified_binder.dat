50|$|PFC {{mixtures}} must {{be placed}} {{on top of a}} pavement that is structurally sound and relatively impermeable. A surface treatment (under seal) or level-up layer may be needed prior to placing the PFC. When used on low speed roadways, PFC mixtures can clog up more quickly thus negating the beneficial drainage characteristics. PFC mixtures tend to freeze faster and thaw slower (similar to a bridge) compared to conventional mixtures. PFC mixtures are not as resistant to high shearing forces therefore, they should be avoided on pavements where there are hard turning motions combined with braking such as short radius exit ramps, turnouts, etc.Generally speaking, it is not good to place any type of hot mix in cool or cold weather. PFC mixtures can be particularly difficult to place in cool weather because they are placed in thin lifts and they contain a high amount of polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder.</b> They also do not lend themselves well to applications that require a significant amount of hand work.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages: SMA {{mixtures}} {{typically have}} a higher initial cost compared to other mixtures. SMA mixtures contain more asphalt (6% minimum) compared to conventional mixtures. The asphalt used in SMA mixtures contains a high amount of polymers (or asphalt rubber as an option). In addition to the polymers, SMA mixtures {{require the use of}} fibers (not required with asphalt rubber), mineral filler and may require the use of lime. All of these additives not only add to the initial cost but they often require that the producer make modifications to their typical HMA production processes. SMA mixtures may also require higher quality aggregates than conventional mixtures. SMA mixtures usually require a significant compactive effort; however, they also produce a pavement layer with a higher density compared to conventional mixtures. Generally speaking, it is not good to place any type of hot mix in cool or cold weather. SMA mixtures can be particularly difficult to place in cool weather because they are placed in thin lifts and they contain a high amount of polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder.</b> They also do not lend themselves well to applications that require a significant amount of hand work.|$|E
40|$|The Superpave binder {{specifications}} are performance-based {{criteria for}} binder selection {{for use in}} hot-mix asphalt mixtures.

The first phase of the research focuses on determining mixing and compaction temperatures for hot-mix asphalt mixtures. <b>Modified</b> <b>binders</b> are shear rate and temperature dependent and the conventional methods of determining mixing and compaction temperatures can yield extreme results. The Zero Shear Viscosity theory is used as an alternative method to determine hot-mix asphalt mixing and compaction temperatures.

50|$|The primary {{difference}} in placing SMA, compared to DGA is in compaction procedures. Multi-tyred rollers {{are not used}} due to the possible working of binder-rich material {{to the surface of}} the asphalt and consequent flushing and pick-up. Trafficking of the newly placed asphalt while still warm may have the same effect and it is generally preferable for surfaces to cool below about 40°C before opening to traffic. The preferred method of compaction is to use heavy, non-vibrating, steel-wheeled rollers. If these are not available, vibrating rollers may be used but vibrationshould be kept to a minimum to avoid fracture of coarse aggregate particles, or drawing of binder {{to the surface of the}} mix. The use of polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> may decrease mix workability and necessitate increased compactive effort to achieve high standards of compacted density. Achieving high standards of compacted density and low field air voids has been identified as an important factor in the performance of all SMA work. SMA is normally placed with a minimum layer thickness of 2.5 to 3 times the nominal maximum aggregate particle size. Greater layer thicknesses assist in achieving appropriate standards of compacted density.|$|E

Steel reinforce concrete and flexible bitumen with polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> are among the materials that normally used in runway construction. Both of these materials have its own unique characteristics in term of effectiveness, maintenance record, and life span. Therefore, this study is aim to determine the effectiveness and life span of steel reinforce concrete and flexible bitumen with polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> in runway construction. The study was conducted at KLIA as it is the main airport in Malaysia and thousands of aircraft passes through the two main runways every year. KLIA uses flexible bitumen with polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> as the {{structure of}} the runway. The effectiveness and life span of the runway at KLIA are important in order {{to make sure that the}} operation at the airport become smooth and no interference will occur. Two engineers at the KLIA engineering department were the respondents that answering the close-ended questionnaire designed for this study. The questionnaire consists of certain elements on how steel reinforce concrete and flexible bitumen with polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> runway structure react on term of the materials behavior, maintenance frequency, cost and time consumes to build and maintaining the runway, and the life span of the runway. At the end of this study, the result concludes that the effectiveness and life span of both materials are bias towards the flexible bitumen with polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> rather that steel reinforce concrete because of its characteristics that is better and suit the runway construction and specification of KLIA. Hence, various types of runway structure materials and opinion from other engineer from different airport are recommended as it can evaluate more on the runway construction technology and may become beneficial for future reference in runway construction...|$|E

40|$|Stripping {{is one of}} {{the common}} type of {{pavement}} failure found in asphaltic pavements.

The objective of this research is to evaluate and compare the stripping performance of unmodified and rubber-polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> mixes with and without anti-stripping additives in Superpave mix design (AASHTO TP 4) procedure. The study investigates four different dense graded Superpave HMA mixes. The first mixture was a control specimen that contained no hydrated lime and unmodified binder. The second mixture contained hydrated lime with unmodified binder. The third mixture contained no hydrated lime but with rubber-polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> and the fourth mixture contained hydrated lime with rubber-polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder.</b> The hydrated lime was used as anti-stripping additive.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the mechanical performance of the polymer modified mastic asphalt with 4 % montan wax (Asphaltan A) additive. The impact of wax modification on binder, binder/filler mixtures and mastic asphalt was investigated in the laboratory. Wax <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conventional tests (softening point, penetration, elastic recovery, breaking point, viscosity and storage stability). The bending beam rheometer (BBR) was used for determining low temperature creep compliance and the tensile stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) for determining low temperature fracture. The fatigue cracking behavior of mastic asphalt was investigated using Superpave Indirect Tensile Test (IDT). Based on HMA Fracture Mechanics the influence of wax on the asphalt mixture resistance to fatigue and brittle cracking has been evaluated. The addition of wax to the polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> resulted in a viscosity reduction at higher temperatures, indicating a possible lower production and laying temperature as compared to asphalt without wax additive. DMA and BBR results showed some increase in stiffness and a more elastic response of the wax <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> at medium and low temperatures.

40|$|The {{multiple}} stress {{creep recovery}} (MSCR) test {{was developed in}} the USA to evaluate the high-temperature permanent deformation resistance of bitumens. It is credited as representing world best practice for high-temperature shear response of binders for asphalt production. However, some researchers have questioned the suitability of the current test protocol for characterisation of highly <b>modified</b> <b>binders.</b> Five highly polymer-modified elastomeric and plastomeric Australian grades of binder and one conventional binder were tested by MSCR at various temperatures (64 – 76 °C) and the results compared with laboratory asphalt mixture properties indicative of asphalt field performance. The results indicated the current MSCR protocols are not suited to highly <b>modified</b> <b>binders</b> and that an increased level of applied stress and longer recovery periods between stress cycles should be considered for improved characterisation. Furthermore, the MSCR creep compliance, intended to be indicative of asphalt permanent deformation, was found to be poorly correlated with asphalt mixture wheel track rutting and repeated shear flow test results. This lack of agreement between bitumen and asphalt mixture test results may reflect the limitations of the current MSCR protocol for highly <b>modified</b> <b>binders.</b> However, further investigation is required to understand the impact of base bitumens imported into Australia and other contributing factors. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} research was to establish the WMA mixture using nanoclay <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> according to Superpave mix design method. It started by modiSring the PG 64 - 28 asphalt binder with different percentages of Nanoclay A, Nanoclay B and Chemical warm asphalt additives. After modification, the modified binders were categorised as Nanoclay A <b>Modified</b> <b>Binder</b> (NCMB A), Nanoclay B <b>Modified</b> <b>Binder</b> (NCMB B) and Chemical Warm Asphalt <b>Modified</b> <b>Binder</b> (CWAA). The rheological characteristics of binders were evaluated using the SuperpaveTM rotational viscosity, dynamic shear rheometer, and bending beam rheometer test. The results indicated that NCMB B and CWAA significantly reduced mixing and compaction temperature. However, only NCMB B shows a significant incpse in rutting and fatigue resistance when compared to the virgin binder. In addition, the chemical bonding had changed in the tested binder after long term aging which suggest that the addition of modifier could delay the aging process. A total of 260 specimens were prepared to evaluate and compare the engineering properties of hot mix asphalt (HMA) and WMA mixtures using NCMB B and CWAA. Based on statistical analysis, it was observed that WMA mixtures produced at 30 °C lower than conventional HMA for both modifiers showed a significant emissions reduction and have no significant difference on performance in term of rutting, fatigue, moisture susceptibility and resilient modulus (MR). Studies on correlation and regression analysis between various rheological modified asphalt binder and engineering properties of WMA mixtures containing NCMB B and CWAA were also conducted.

Evaluation {{of the results of the}} laboratory study on shear response of the overlay mixes reported herein included the effects of mix temperatures, air-void content, aging, mixing and compaction conditions, aggregate gradation, and shear stress level. Shear testing was performed to assess expected rutting performance at high temperatures. Mixes with five binders were tested, namely AR 4000, asphalt rubber, and three <b>modified</b> <b>binders</b> termed MB 4 (meeting the Caltrans MB 4 specification [2003]), MB 15 (meeting the MB 4 specification and containing 15 percent recycled tire rubber, referred to as MAC 15), and MAC 15 TR (Southern California GreenBook specification, containing 15 percent recycled tire rubber, referred to as MAC 15). A full factorial considering all the variables required a total of 2, 880 tests. This was reduced to 186 tests to accommodate time and fund constraints. Based on the shear test results for the mixes used in the overlay experiment, mix rankings for Cycles to 5 Percent Permanent Shear Strain, Permanent Shear Strain at 5, 000 Cycles, and Resilient Shear Modulus (G*) were: • Permanent Shear Strain at 5, 000 Cycles (best performance to worst) : AR 4000 -D; MAC 15 -G; RAC-G; MB 4 -G; MB 15 -G. • Cycles to 5 Percent Permanent Shear Strain (best performance to worst) : AR 4000 -D; MAC 15 -G; RAC-G; MB 4 -G; MB 15 -G. • Resilient Shear Modulus (G*) (stiffest to least stiff) : AR 4000 -D; RAC-G; MAC 15 -G; MB 4 -G; MB 15 -G The results show that the rankings of different mixes for expected rutting performance are the same for the two permanent deformation parameters calculated from Repeated Simple Shear Test (RSST) results: Permanent Shear Strain at 5, 000 Cycles and Cycles to 5 Percent Permanent Shear Strain.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{field trials}} with polymer modified asphalts (Novophalt and Styrelf). The <b>modified</b> <b>binders</b> {{were used in}} wearing surface course, binder course and base course and compared with non modified asphalt. Field evaluation included visual survey, roughness measurements and deflection measurements. Preliminary results of these field trials indicated that no significant improvements in pavement performance were obtained. The one year evaluation (after test track construction) under heavy traffic movements did not show significant rut development for either polymer modified or non modified bituminous sections. However, it is planned to annually investigate and report the extent of improvement in pavement performance which might occur in the future when using these polymer <b>modified</b> asphalt <b>binders.</b> ASTM, Committee D- 4 on Road & Paving Material...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} merits of {{application}} of bio-binder to enhance rheological properties of asphalt binder {{in the presence of}} wet processed recycled asphalt shingles (RAS). It will further examine the performance and workability of asphalt designed with and without a specified percentage of a bio-binder produced from swine manure and RAS. Bio-binder was introduced to liquid asphalt binder modified with four different percentages of RAS; the high and low temperature properties of each RAS <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> were then investigated. The study results showed that the addition of bio-binder led to a reduction of viscosity in the RAS <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> to be closer to that of the virgin binder (without presence of RAS). In addition, {{it was found that the}} ductility and fracture energy of the RAS modified asphalt binder was improved significantly when bio-binder was introduced. Overall, the results show that the bio-binder improved the low temperature characteristics of RAS modified asphalt binder; the observed improvement can be attributed to the rejuvenating effect of bio-binder while also improving the blending between the RAS particles and the virgin binder...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the blending parameters of coconut shell powder (CSP) modified asphalt binder and to evaluate the rheological properties of CSP modified asphalt binder. CSP of 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 % by weight of asphalt have been incorporated into an unaged 80 / 100 asphalt mix in order to improve its performance. The influence of the additives on the physical and rheological properties was evaluated with penetration test, softening point, storage stability, dynamic shear rheometer test (DSR), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The aging of asphalt binders was simulated in a laboratory by using Rotational Thin Film Oven (RTFO). The results showed that the addition of CSP into virgin binder was decreasing the penetration value and increasing the softening point temperature compared to the original binder. On the rheological effect, for unaged <b>modified</b> <b>binder,</b> higher CSP resulted higher G*/sin δ especially at lower temperature compared to the unaged control binder. Besides, for the aged <b>modified</b> <b>binder,</b> stiffness was lower than the control aged binder for all temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Alkali metal cations {{are bound}} weakly in the {{structure}} of alkali activated materials. This fact causes the formation of undesirable efflorescence in humid environment. In this work, the effect of fluoride additives, which reduce significantly the efflorescence, was investigated. The chemical mechanism of selected additive in the <b>modified</b> <b>binder</b> was studied based on XRD, SEM-EDX and ICP-OES analysis. Also the effect of added fluorides on the mechanical properties of final product was monitored...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, sodium {{bentonite}} (BT) and organically modified sodium bentonite (OBT) {{are used}} to reinforce and <b>modify</b> asphalt <b>binder.</b> The microstructures of the reinforced asphalt binders are investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Two models for the microstructure of the BT and OBT modified asphalts are suggested considering the colloidal structure of the base asphalt binder. The physical properties of the <b>modified</b> asphalt <b>binders</b> were studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{detailed}} Vialit Adhesion tests were performed at various temperatures {{on a number}} of binders to assess the suitability of the test for evaluating the low temperature performance of the binders. It is shown that the current limits specified in the Asphalt Academy Technical Guideline document (TG 1, 2001), are generally not achievable using the specified test. As the adhesion failure generally occurs between the test plate and the binder film, the surface of the plate was modified to improve aggregate retention. The tests show that aggregate retention is also improved if the chippings are precoated, whilst there is also a definite difference in adhesion between conventional and <b>modified</b> <b>binders.</b> Recommendations are made for possible future research that could be performed to verify the findings of this study. 1. BACKGROUND The first South African <b>modified</b> <b>binders</b> guideline was published by Sabita (Manual 15, 1994) in May 1994. The low temperature test results obtained at 5 ºC when using the Vialit adhesion test method (see figure 1), specified in this guideline, often resulted in controversy and confusion. The main mode of adhesion failure experienced was between the steel plate and the binder fil...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLong-lasting asphalt {{pavements}} as {{a concept}} arose in the late XX century. According to assumptions {{it is possible to}} achieve durability even for 50 years. The key to achieve so long-lived is appropriate choice of an asphalt binder, except for the relevant properties of asphalt mixtures. A few years ago a new family of highly <b>modified</b> <b>binders</b> was created which was characterized by reversed-phase of polymer-bitumen mixture, and it is now a perfect example of a binder which fulfil the pavement longevity assumptions concept. Based on a new, special polymer which was developed by polymer industry, a new family of <b>binders</b> – Highly <b>Modified</b> Asphalts (HiMA), has been developed – ‘hard’ (EN 25 / 55 - 80, PG 94 - 22), ‘middle’ (EN 45 / 80 - 80, PG 82 - 28) and ‘soft’ (EN 65 / 105 - 80, PG 76 - 28). All binders were tested according to very wide test program. Results confirmed superior performance of tested binders and their very positive influence on asphalt. The paper presents tests results and analysis of polymer <b>modified</b> <b>binders,</b> HiMA type. The research has been done based on the European standards and according to the Superpave (PG grade system) ...|$|R
