Tests have been performed on ropes stressed according to U. I. A. A. standards, simulating a locked-end fall-factor 2. In these conditions, a notch applied suddenly and to a sufficient depth, causes the rope to break instantly. The tests, however, show that if the notch is applied slowly the rope gradually cut down to the last fibre, and that the phenomenon does not occur if the notch is present before the application of the force even if it is applied dynamically. Special tools used in the experimental tests are described and the results of both experimental tests and numerical model analysis are provided. 1. Description of the phenomenon, conditions for its occurrence A <b>mountaineering</b> <b>rope,</b> stressed up to 1 / 2 - 1 / 3 of its breaking force, snaps when a cutting blade notches it slightly but suddenly. The stresses involved are lower than the force of 12 kN, that is the maximum value taken into consideration in the U. I. A. A. standard, in the case of first fall-factor...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLeader fall is {{the main}} concern in {{climbing}} activities and the appropriate answer to {{the problem is the}} ropeAn accurate numerical simulation of the consequences of a fall on the “safety chain” (assembly of rope, fixed points, karabiners, cords and other climbing gears) is essential for understanding the events and conceiving safety methods. It also reduces the times and costs involved in experimental assessments. In this context a sound knowledge of the rope properties is essential. The analytical model of the rope behaviour during stretching should be slim enough to reduce computing time, but still be able to describe the rope behaviour in each segment of the “safety chain”. The present paper proposes a model to describe the rope behaviour when stretched, representing the force as a function of strain and strain rate. Model parameters have been calibrated on experimental data measured from a specific <b>mountaineering</b> commercial <b>rope.</b> The same procedure can be applied for different <b>mountaineering</b> <b>ropes</b> present on the market...|$|R

5000|$|A Prusik [...] (...) is a {{friction}} hitch or knot used {{to attach}} a loop of cord around a rope, applied in climbing, canyoneering, <b>mountaineering,</b> caving, <b>rope</b> rescue, and by arborists. The term Prusik is a name for both the loops of cord and the hitch, and the verb is [...] "to prusik". [...] More casually, the term is used for any friction hitch or device that can grab a rope. The word is often misspelled as Prussik, Prussick or Prussic, {{as it is a}} homophone with the term prussic acid.|$|R
50|$|The Prusik hitch {{is named}} after its {{putative}} inventor, Austrian mountaineer Karl Prusik. It was shown in a 1931 Austrian <b>mountaineering</b> manual for <b>rope</b> ascending. It was used on several mountaineering routes of the era to ascend the final summit, where a rope could be thrown {{over the top and}} anchored so that climbers could attain the summit by prusiking up {{the other side of the}} rope.|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{dilemma in}} adventure programming is eliminating unreasonable risks to participants without also reducing levels of excitement, challenge, and stress. Most accidents {{are caused by}} a combination of unsafe conditions, unsafe acts, and error judgments. The best and only way to minimize critical human error in adventure programs is through conscientious planning and action, including rigorous training, intense supervision, constant practice, and systematic maintenance of equipment. Many accidents are sequential in nature and are caused by some simple, overlooked mistrAce or perception made early on that increased the overall level of risk. A description is given of three phases of injury countermeasures that, even when accidents cannot be prevented, may reduce the frequenc, nd severity of injuries caused by those accidents. Injury co 4 termeasures are listed for ski mountaineering, white-water boating, rock climbing or <b>mountaineering,</b> and <b>rope</b> courses.

5000|$|In <b>mountaineering,</b> a fixed <b>rope</b> or {{fixed line}} is the {{practice}} of fixing in place bolted ropes to assist climbers and walkers in exposed mountain locations. They are used widely on American and European climbing routes, where they may be called via ferrata routes, but are not used in [...] "Alpine style" [...] mountaineering. Many guided expeditions {{to any of the}} eight-thousanders normally set up fixed rope on steep or icy sections of the route. For example, on the Hillary Step of Mount Everest, fixed rope was used to reduce the bottleneck of climbers that typically results from climbing this technical section just below the summit.|$|R
40|$|We are {{witnessing}} an unprecedented {{interest in and}} engagement with extreme sport activities. Extreme sports are unique in that they involve physical prowess {{as well as a}} particular attitude towards the world and self. We have little understanding of the experience of participants who engage in extreme activities such as BASE jumping, big wave surfing, extreme skiing, waterfall kayaking, extreme <b>mountaineering,</b> and solo <b>rope</b> free climbing. The current study explicates the experience of people who engage in extreme sports utilising a phenomenological approach. The study draws upon interviews with 15 extreme sports participants across three continents. Three aspects of the extreme sports experience are explicated: inadequacy of words, extreme sports as vigorous experience, and participants’ experience of transcendence. The findings provide a valuable insight the experience of the participants. Furthermore, the findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} range of human volition and experience...|$|R
40|$|Participation {{in extreme}} sports is {{continuing}} to grow, yet there is still little understanding of participant motivations in such sports. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report on one aspect of motivation in extreme sports, the search for freedom. The study utilized a hermeneutic phenomenological methodology. Fifteen international extreme sport participants who participated in sports such as BASE jumping, big wave surfing, extreme <b>mountaineering,</b> extreme skiing, <b>rope</b> free climbing and waterfall kayaking were interviewed about their experience of participating in an extreme sport. Results reveal six elements of freedom: freedom from constraints, freedom as movement, freedom as letting go of the need for control, freedom as the release of fear, freedom as being at one, and finally freedom as choice and responsibility. The findings reveal that motivations in extreme sport do not simply mirror traditional images of risk taking and adrenaline and that motivations in extreme sports also include an exploration of the ways in which humans seek fundamental human values...|$|R
