40|$|Optical {{components}} made of {{fused silica}} are in great demand {{due to the}} material’s exceptional properties: a broad transmission range from 185 nm to 2. 5 μm, low coefficient of thermal expansion, low thermal conductivity and high radiation resistance. For the production of complex optical components in medium and large quantities, the technology of precision glass moulding is particularly suitable. Here, a glass blank is heated up to the moulding temperature and moulded into the desired shape by means of two <b>moulding</b> <b>tools</b> without any subsequent work. The production of the complex <b>moulding</b> <b>tools</b> is still costly in terms of labor and time but {{the efficiency of the}} process increases with the number of optical components made by using a pair of <b>moulding</b> <b>tools.</b> Hence, the wear of the <b>moulding</b> <b>tools</b> determines the efficiency of the process. In this paper, an experimental study and FE simulation are presented in order to investigate the wear of the glassy carbon <b>moulding</b> <b>tools</b> in <b>moulding</b> of fused silica. For the FE simulation, the viscoelasticity of fused silica and the friction coefficient between fused silica and glassy carbon were determined.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} producing a structure made of curable material by means of moulding. In a first step of the method, a <b>moulding</b> <b>tool</b> (310) is arranged above a surface (330) such that in a region (340) between the <b>moulding</b> <b>tool</b> and the surface, the curable material (320) adjoins the surface and a moulding surface (312) of the <b>moulding</b> <b>tool</b> facing the surface, and such that additional curable material (321) can continue to flow into the region. In a second step, the curable material is irradiated in a locally varying manner in the region such that the curable material cures at different speeds in a laterally varying manner, and shrinkages during curing of the curable material are compensated for by the additional curable material. In a third step of the method, constant pressure {{is applied to the}} additional curable material.

40|$|When {{manufacturing}} <b>mould</b> <b>tools</b> {{to produce}} high quality components, additional operations such as grinding, honing and lapping are often required. These additional operations produce an appropriate finish for moulding {{the high quality}} component. Surface finishes generated from the machining stages often have cusps and rises that are detrimental to the product finish which has a direct relation to the finish of the tool. The surface finish can be produced {{in a number of}} ways and be influenced by external sources [1] as seen in research previously. If the surface finish of the <b>mould</b> <b>tool</b> could be generated without the need for additional operations then a time and cost saving could be achieved. 2. Why? For several years now the country has seen a decline in the manufacture and production of plastic parts due to the lack of UK companies being competitive. The lack of competitive edge in the SME sector has lead to the smaller companies looking at reducing time to produce full production <b>mould</b> <b>tools,</b> therefore allowing them to become competitive on a global scale. Several institutions around the globe have identified these issues and have looked at alternatives such as material change [2] or the development of rapid components. These however have not been readily accepted by industr...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Additive {{manufacture}} (AM) such as {{selective laser}} melting (SLM) provides significant geometric design freedom in comparison with traditional manufacturing methods. Such freedom enables the construction of injection <b>moulding</b> <b>tools</b> with conformal cooling channels that optimize heat transfer while incorporating efficient internal lattice structures that can ground loads and provide thermal insulation. Despite the opportunities enabled by AM, there remain a number of design and processing uncertainties associated with the application of SLM to injection <b>mould</b> <b>tool</b> manufacture, in particular from H 13 /DIN 1. 2344 steel as commonly used in injection moulds. This paper aims to address several associated uncertainties. Design/methodology/approach A number of physical and numerical experimental studies are conducted to quantify SLM-manufactured H 13 material properties, part manufacturability and part characteristics. Findings Findings are presented which quantify the effect of SLM processing parameters on the density of H 13 steel components; the manufacturability of standard and self-supporting conformal cooling channels, as well as structural lattices in H 13; the surface roughness of SLM-manufactured cooling channels; the effect of cooling channel layout on the associated stress concentration factor and cooling uniformity; and the structural and thermal insulating properties {{of a number of}} structural lattices. Originality/value The contributions of this work with regards to SLM manufacture of H 13 of injection <b>mould</b> <b>tooling</b> can be applied in the design of conformal cooling channels and lattice structures for increased thermal performance...|$|R

40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with compression moulding {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted Compression Moulding (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional compression moulding cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic <b>mould</b> <b>tools</b> were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash compression <b>mould</b> <b>tool</b> design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug compression <b>mould</b> <b>tool</b> with a vertical shear edge. This created a fixed volume <b>mould</b> <b>tool,</b> which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|R

At the base of the archipelago sits the country of Trinidad and Tobago, the industrial hub of the Caribbean with an economy fueled by the oil and gas industries. With this Trinidad has the capability to support yacht construction, and both yacht and ship repair. With the current low in the global economy and with yachts being sold to Caribbean customers from the United States cheaply, it was undertaken to design a comfortable weekender powerboat for the local market to be produced in Trinidad. The design intent is that of a fast comfortable motor cruiser with the ability to host 4 guests in separate double cabins for a long weekend cruise throughout the Caribbean. The vessel style is to be {{similar to that of the}} Down East style lobster boats from Maine, USA. The vessel is to be easily constructed using simple production methods appropriate to the labor skill and industrial resources available at hand in the country. A comparison between different production technologies is undertaken in this study and the pros and cons of each weighed up aiding in the final decision. Material choice was governed as much by the structural requirements of the vessel as it was by the proposed production method and the working environment.
