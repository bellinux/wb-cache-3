50|$|Brassicaceae contain glucosinolates {{as well as}} myrosinases {{inside their}} cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases hydrolises the glucosinolates, leading to the {{synthesis}} of isothiocyanates, which are compounds toxic to most animals, fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorbtion of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter <b>mechanisme</b> involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles. Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may {{be as high as}} 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. Bittercress (Barbarea vulgaris) also produces triterpenoid saponins. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family Pieridae. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic nitriles. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, which is used as a wide spectrum biological plant protection against caterpillars. Parasitoid wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.|$|E

40|$|A middleware-based {{approach}} to format-insensitive raster data management in Open Source GISs Geographic Information Systems (GISs) allow to retrieve, store, manage, analyze, organize, edit and share, data and related metadata which are spatially referenced to the Earth. In {{the last years}} the geospatial data {{community as well as}} the amount and type of available geospatial information have been increasingly growing. Contextually a few issues have emerged, here below we summarise some of them, A great variety of data formats exists and new formats are being added Stored data may be very huge in size (Gigabytes,Terabytes) therefore its management may be expensive in terms of resources Performant data management requires several optimized <b>mechanismes</b> (they will be discussed in the preliminar chapters of this thesis) In such a dynamic field, finding a valid tool which is able to cope with all involved issues is a difficult task. Several tools to handle geospatial information exist, however, some are able to manage a single specific format, while some others are more powerful yet very expensive. This is a real limitation {{in the context of a}} vast Open Source GIS community. The aim of this thesis is to provide a contribution to the Open Source GIS community with the development of an extensible framework which provides raster data management capabilities for a wide set of formats, where with the term "Raster Data" we refer to a type of data dealing with real world phenomena which vary continuously over space and time. The framework has been implemented in Java as an extension to SUN's Java Image I/O architecture by leveraging on the powerful Geographic Data Abstraction Layer library (a C/C++ Library). Data access and management capabilities offered by this framework, can be therefore employed through SUN's Java Advanced Imaging library in order to perform optimized raster data management. It is also worth to point out that the GeoTools library, which is a powerful java middleware for the manipulation of geospatial vector raster data, will deeply leverage on the presented as supplementary data access layer. Moreover, GeoServer, an open source JEE platform for the management of geospatial information built upon GeoTools, will exploit this new data access capabilities in order to widen its range of supported formats. </P...|$|R

40|$|The host {{epithelium}} has permanent {{contact with}} the environment and a multitude of diverse microorganisms, resulting in a network of the host's defense mechanisms. Pathogens use various strategies to invade epithelial barriers, to hijack eukaryotic host function to their own benefit and use the epithelium as a reservoir for dissemination throughout the host. Alteration of the host cell apoptosis, promotion of cell proliferation or conversely, inhibition of cell growth and modulation of the cell differentiation by blocking of cell cycle progression are some of them. The mechanisms all of the stratagems employed by the pathogens are not fully elucidated, but they {{can contribute to the}} virulence of those microorganisms. However, the latest investigation of the interaction between host epithelium and microorganisms suggest that the epithelium is not a simple mechanical barrier: epithelial cells recognize microorganisms and initiate appropriate signaling which contribute to the endocytosis of microorganisms. It appears that capture of microorganisms by the epithelial cells is selective and that the different endocytic mechanisms may be enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines. The specificity of the recognition is illustrated by the various studies, showing that the epithelial cells distinguish the different morphotypes of the microorganisms. Using the model of the infection of respiratory epithelium by opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, we have shown that the airway epithelial cells identify the most invasive fungal form that may be beneficial for the host defense. Moreover, host epithelium exposed to the microorganisms, express various cytokines and different protective substances, such as antimicrobial peptides, with direct microbicidal or chemotactic activities, which might contribute to the regulation of host adaptive immunity against microbial invasion. Autocrine <b>mechanismes</b> of antimicrobial peptides expression was shown with the epithelial cells exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus. Further study of the regulation of antimicrobial peptides expression might provide the new approaches that may enhance its expression for potential therapeutic use. Nevertheless, despite permanent exposure to a considerable amount of the microorganisms present in the environment, epithelium possesses the enormous capacity to keep its integrity, suggesting that some microbial strategies link to the mechanisms, which control the structural integrity of the tissue. Recent evidence supports the role of microbial factors in the maintenance of the integrity of the epithelial tissue: it was shown that Staphylococcus aureus as well as other microbial products induce epithelial repair, survival and growth and that such compensatory epithelial responses are mediated by autonomous non-inflammatory pathway. Therefore the outcome of the interaction between the host epithelium and microorganisms depends on multiple features...|$|R
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain aids compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market <b>mechanismes</b> is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market <b>mechanismes</b> mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|R

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of wakaf land by the authority body is considered ijtihadiyah matter in fiqh. It {{is based on}} the concept of maslahah 'ammah and istibdal. Rulings relating to wakaf istibdal has not been addressed specifically by Muslim scholars in their literature. Whereas, the practise of waqaf istibdal has long been implemented in Malaysia by the authirised body for the sake of economic development. Hence a study is necessary to examine such practise and the specific rulings relating to it. This study, therefore attempts to see the istibdal as <b>mechanisme</b> to sustain the perpetuity of wakaf land acquired by the state authority. A case study has been conducted at Majlis Agama Islam and Adat Istiadat Melayu Terengganu (MAIDAM). Several principles and istibdal methods applicable in Islamic law have been suggested in this study. It is believed that {{they would be able to}} mould towards a dynamic and comprehensive sustainable fiqh wakaf consistent with the current development in this country...|$|E

Based on these problems, this study aimed to describe the mechanisms of language acquisition in children aged 1 year and the mechanisms of language acquisition in children aged 5 years. The method used in this research is a method of descriptions by using a qualitative approach. The samples in this study were children aged one year from Sidoharjo Pringsewu and children five years of age who come from Panjerejo Gading Rejo. Language acquisition data taken through the interview process, observation, and record narration in a straightforward manner. The results showed that in children aged one year, was able to say a few words, though the words are spoken and the child is not yet clear exactly what is being taught in imitating their parents. Daffa (five year olds) at his age already have good language skills. Sentences that conveyed is understood by others.

40|$|Abstract Background Knowledge of the {{cytokine}} response at {{infection with}} Brachyspira hyodysenteriae can help understanding disease <b>mechanisme</b> involved during swine dysentery. Since this knowledge is still limited {{the aim of}} the present study was to induce dysentery experimentally in pigs and to monitor the development of important immunoregulatory cytokines in blood collected at various stages of the disease. Methods Ten conventional pigs (~ 23 kg) were orally inoculated with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae B 204 T. Eight animals developed muco-haemorrhagic diarrhoea with impaired general body condition. Blood was sampled before inoculation and repeatedly during acute dysentery and recovery periods and cytokine levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, Il- 10, TNF-α and IFN-γ were measured by ELISA. Results IL- 1 β was increased at the beginning of the dysentery period and coincided with the appearance of Serum amyloid A and clinical signs of disease. TNF-α increased in all animals after inoculation, with a peak during dysentery, and IL- 6 was found in 3 animals during dysentery and in the 2 animals that did not develop clinical signs of disease. IL- 10 was found in all sick animals during the recovery period. IFN-γ was not detected on any occasion. Conclusion B. hyodysenteriae inoculation induced production of systemic levels of IL- 1 β during the dysentery period and increased levels of IL- 10 coincided with recovery from dysentery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for {{gene dosage}} effect for β-glucuronidase (GUSB) and phosphoserine {{phosphatase}} (PSP), whose genes are mapped on chromosone 7, was searched {{in a group}} of 13 patients with myeloproliferative disorders and acquired monosomy 7. The monosomy 7 was the sole anomaly in nine patients and was associated with other chromosome changes in four. A group of 19 patients with similar diseases but with normal karyotype or with anomalies not involving chromosone 7 served as control. β-galactosidase and arylsulphatase A, whose genes are not on chromosome 7, were tested as control enzymes. We obtained evidence for a gene dosage effect for GUSB, but not for PSP. When all cases with monosomy 7 were compared with controls, no dosage effect was observed for PSP, but when this group was split into two, according to the presence of anomalies additional to the monosomy 7, the values of activity in the group with additional anomalies were significantly lower than in the controls. Thus, in the case of PSP, the loss of one allele is not followed immediately by reduction in activity, and this could be due to the specific importance of PSP in nucleic acid metabolism. We postulate that some regulatory <b>mechanisme</b> are able to keep normal levels of PSP even in the presence of only one allele, and that they are overwhelmed only when additional chromosome changes are present. These changes tend to involve chromosomes carrying genes for enzymes involved in a metabolic pathway closely related to PSP functions, and only then is a gene dosage effect for PSP detectable...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{prototype}} of a solenoid is designed, built, and tested. The solenoid {{will be used as}} kicking device in the turtle robots of the TechUnited Robocup team [5]. Earlier studies have investigated a solenoid as shooting <b>mechanisme.</b> In one study the solenoid is investigated as most suitable kicking device [1]. The other study designed and optimized a solenoid [2]. In this study {{a prototype}} solenoid is designed and tested. First, the design is tested in a computer program called FEMM. The main output of the program is the force on the plunger at several positions. Based on this information, the end speed of the plunger and the ball are calculated. To compare the real solenoid behavior with the simulation, some different tests are done. The first test is a force measuring setup in which the real force is measured at several plunger positions. Out of force the motor constant can be determined. With the motor constant, the final speed of the plunger can be calculated. The second test are some shots at different currents. During this test the current and the traveling time of the plunger are measured. With the plunger movement and traveling time, the final speed can be calculated. Finally, the calculations from the tests are compared to the output of the simulation. It becomes clear there is be a good correspondence between the simulation and experimental results. Based on the outcome of this study, recommendations are given for the actual implementation of the solenoid in the robot. ...|$|E
