25|$|Influenced by 70s and 80s heavy metal, {{traditional}} doom metal bands <b>more</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>use</b> higher guitar tunings, and do {{not play}} as slow as many other doom bands. Traditional doom bands typically play slow to mid-tempo songs with a thick and heavy sound with the Electric Bass following the melody line, and sometimes employ the usage of Keyboards although assuming a secondary role on traditional doom metal songs. Vocals are usually clean with the occasional growl or scream. The lyrics in traditional doom usually are eerie and dark like other doom metal divisions. Some bands who play traditional doom metal are Orodruin, Reverend Bizarre, Witchcraft, Saint Vitus and Count Raven.|$|E

Until recently, this was termed [...] "non-compliance", which was sometimes regarded as meaning that not following the directions for treatment was due to irrational behavior or willful ignoring of instructions. Today, health care professionals <b>more</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>use</b> the term [...] "adherence" [...] to a regimen rather than [...] "compliance", because this term is thought to reflect better the diverse reasons for patients not following treatment directions in part or in full. Additionally, the term adherence includes {{the ability of the}} patient to take medications as prescribed by their physician with regards to the correct drug, dose, route, timing, and frequency. It is noted that compliance may only refer to passively following orders.|$|E
