50|$|A large {{system of}} {{interconnected}} docks may sometimes require individual docks to be drained for maintenance. If {{the connections between}} docks are made to a standard size, these may be closed off by caissons. As this need is rare, only a few <b>mobile</b> <b>caissons</b> are needed to support an entire dock system.

25|$|Between 1983 and 1990, BeauDril's mobile {{drilling}} units drilled a {{total of}} nineteen exploratory wells in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea {{with the support of}} Ikaluk and other icebreaking vessels: nine with the <b>Mobile</b> Arctic <b>Caisson</b> Molikpaq and ten with the Conical Drilling Unit Kulluk. Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expections for the Beaufort Sea were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources. Molikpaq was mothballed after completing the last well in 1990. However, Kulluk was used to drill {{a total of}} four wells in 1992 and 1993 for ARCO Alaska on the American part of the Beaufort Sea before being cold-stacked at Tuktoyaktuk.|$|R
40|$|Artificial sand islands were {{constructed}} in the Canadian Beaufort Sea for use as hydrocarbon exploration platforms in the 1970 s and 1980 s. For some of these islands, extensive Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data are available for characterising the hydraulically placed sand {{during and after the}} construction process. Tarsiut P- 45 was the first island using the 'Molikpaq' concept, which consisted of a <b>mobile</b> arctic <b>caisson</b> system to provide the temporary structure for the exploitation. Two main sand fills {{were constructed}}: (a) a sandfill berm on which the caisson system was founded; and (b) the body of the island structure (island core). This paper presents an investigation of the variability of the sand in the berm in terms of the vertical and horizontal scales of fluctuation. This geo-statistical investigation is carried out using CPT data from the berm before and after the founding of the caisson system, and sets the basis for a preliminary discussion on the potential soil variability changes caused by the installation and infilling of the caisson structure when placed on the berm...|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1970s, oil {{companies}} began {{drilling in the}} Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In order to overcome the relatively short operating window of drillships during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands, Gulf Canada Resources began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a <b>Mobile</b> Arctic <b>Caisson</b> (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to [...] in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between [...] while afloat. These units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour ice management and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for BeauDril, Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} characteristics, instrumentation and measured ice loads on the caisson structures that were used for exploratory drilling in the Canadian Beaufort Sea in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Details are presented on the Tarsiut Caisson, the Single-Steel Drilling Caisson (SSDC), the Caisson-Retained Island (CRI), and the <b>Mobile</b> Arctic <b>Caisson</b> (MAC) Molikpaq. The global loads on the structures are presented as a Line Load (Global Load per unit width of the structure) and the Global Pressure (Line Load per unit ice thickness). Over 170 loading events are documented. There is excellent agreement amongst the measured loads {{on all of the}} structures if factors such as ice rubble and ice thickness are considered. Global loads are shown to be a function of the ice macrostructure (level first-year sea ice, multi-year ice, first-year ridges, hummock fields, isolated floes) and failure mode of the ice (bending, creep, mixed mode, crushing). The analysis shows that there is a general increase in the Line Load with increasing ice thickness. Empirical equations are presented to predict the global load in terms of the ice thickness and structure width for different ice failure modes. The most significant result of the analysis shows that the maximum Global Pressure measured for all types of ice loading events never exceeded 2 MN/m 2, with the vast majority less than 1. 5 MN/m 2.

40|$|The Beaufort Sea {{is located}} north of Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Alaska, {{and west of}} Banks Island. The centre and {{northern}} part of this sea is frozen solid all year round, and the sea is exposed to considerable ice scour. Petroleum exploration in the ice packed Beaufort Sea in the 1960 â€™s led companies to develop offshore structures that would withstand extreme ice loading. In 1984 Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. deployed a <b>mobile</b> arctic <b>caisson</b> into the Beaufort Sea called the Molikpaq. The Molikpaq was installed on an artificially constructed berm, where it completed exploratory drilling during four subsequent winters. At {{the time that the}} Molikpaq was designed, ice loading on structures was a little known matter. To alleviate this knowledge gap, hundreds of sensors were installed on the Molikpaq to observe and attempt to predict behaviour due to loading. In 1986 the Molikpaq platform was brought to within minutes of failure due to cyclic loading. In this particular event the ice loading occurred at such a frequency that vibration occurred, causing liquefaction of the inner sand core. The sensor readings and detailed observations of this event and the various other loading encounters on the Molikpaq have provided a considerable amount of information for future projects. This paper compiles information on the design and installation of the Molikpaq in the Beaufort Sea. This drilling structure had various successes in regards to resisting ice loading, but eventually came near failure due to the unfamiliar characteristics of cyclic loading. This event will be explored, noting the lessons learned, and how this has affected and will continue to affect other offshore structures deployed in ice-filled waters. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how material uncertainty influences {{the short term}} settlements and stresses of foundations. Expressing the uncertainty of material strength in terms of elastic modulus, the foundation and layered-soil-medium interaction is analyzed. Two soil models are examined: (i) an elastic, single phase, layered soil medium with undrained material properties and (ii) a piecewise linear elastic, single phase, layered soil medium approximating the nonlinear behaviour of soil. For the piecewise linear approximation, two shear-strain-dependent soil modulus relationships are included to differentiate between clays and sands. [...] Utilizing a two-dimensional plane strain triangular element, a stochastic finite element solution is formulated. The procedure incorporates the elastic modulus variation by considering a linear two term Taylor series expansion of the equilibrium equations. [...] To limit the extent of errors induced by the omission of second order terms, the coefficient of variation (C. O. V.) for elastic modulus {{is assumed to be}} less than 30 %. To model the degree of interdependence between finite elements, a decaying exponential correlation distance function in terms of the scalar distance between elements is used. Based on the definition of covariance combined with the linear two-term expansion for elastic modulus, the covariance of nodal displacements and the variance of element stresses are derived. [...] To model the stochastic finite element procedure, a FORTRAN computer code is developed for both linear and piecewise linear material elasticity. The displacements and stresses obtained from the plane strain analysis are considered as the mean values. Using the covariance of displacements and variance of stresses computed for selected nodes and elements, the resulting coefficients of variation are determined for actual displacements, relative displacements and stresses. A parametric analysis is carried out to establish the sensitivity of the stochastic finite element procedure to correlation distance, modulus C. O. V. and soil models. This type of analysis is defined as an upper bound due to its maximizing the material uncertainty. Also the random variation of material properties and its influence on displacements and stresses are examined by including a procedure to randomly vary the modulus C. O. V. from zero to maximum. [...] Two ocean structure cases are examined to verify the stochastic finite element formulation, viz., (i) the Ekofisk Tank and (ii) the <b>Mobile</b> Arctic <b>Caisson</b> (M. A. C.). The Ekofisk Tank is examined for gravitational loads and guasistatic wave loads representative of an actual storm. Gravitational forces and design ice forces are applied to the M. A. C. structure. In both cases, numerical results compare very well with those published in literature for the prototype structures, differing by less than 10 % for most conditions. [...] The main conclusions from the parametric study of the stochastic finite element procedure for soil-structure interaction are: [...] (i) The effect of elastic modulus uncertainty is more pronounced in the uncertainty of stresses than the displacements.
