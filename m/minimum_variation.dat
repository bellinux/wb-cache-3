Often when serrated flow is not seen, dynamic strain aging {{is marked by a}} lower strain rate sensitivity. That becomes negative in the Portevin-Le Chatelier regime. Dynamic strain aging also causes a plateau in the strength, a peak in flow stress [...] a peak in work hardening, a peak in the Hall-Petch constant, and <b>minimum</b> <b>variation</b> of ductility with temperature.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{low-cost}} concept for the controlled RF plane wave exposure for in vivo experiments is presented.

30|$|Results for {{the solo}} tracks show a {{considerable}} improvement in IPS scores when CAM {{is used in}} the spectral estimation stage. Furthermore, a clear inverse relationship can be observed between both TPS and APS scores, and IPS scores of the solo tracks: those algorithm versions that result in an increase of IPS for the solo, also result in a decrease in both TPS and APS scores. Similarly, those algorithm versions that bring an increase in TPS and APS for the solo, result in lower IPS scores. OPS for the solo are relatively constant for all algorithm version, and only <b>minimum</b> <b>variations</b> are observed. This is clearly {{due to the fact that}} for all the algorithm modifications presented, a benefit in a particular perceptual measure comes at the cost of a decrease in another perceptual score(s). The inclusion of a noise spectrum results in more homogeneous scores for the solo signals, with less differences between the different perceptual scores.|$|R
30|$|A natural {{interpretation}} of this evidence is that because state minimum wages {{tend to be more}} similar to those in nearby states than in states farther away, when the identifying variation is restricted to same-division or cross-border states, much of the identifying information from federal <b>minimum</b> wage <b>variation</b> is eliminated. Instead, identification comes more from state variation that is unrelated to federal variation, which {{is more likely to be}} associated with positive endogeneity bias that comes from policymakers tending to raise the minimum wage when the labor market is stronger. Baskaya and Rubinstein present some indirect evidence consistent with this, finding that in states where the minimum wage is generally above the federal minimum wage, the minimum wage moves pro-cyclically with about a one-year lag with respect to the unemployment rate, whereas <b>minimum</b> wage <b>variation</b> in states where the federal minimum wages binds is not correlated with the lagged unemployment rate. Of course we are more concerned about endogeneity with respect to low-skill labor markets per se.|$|R
