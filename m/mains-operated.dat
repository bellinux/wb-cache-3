When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year.

2500|$|BS 1363 is a British Standard which {{specifies}} {{the common}} single-phase AC power {{plugs and sockets}} {{that are used in}} the United Kingdom. Distinctive characteristics of the system are shutters on the [...] and neutral socket holes, and a fuse in the plug. It has been adopted in many former British overseas territories. [...] BS1363 was introduced in 1947 as one of the new standards for electrical wiring in the United Kingdom used for post-war reconstruction. This plug corresponds to TypeG in the IEC table. [...] BS1363 replaced the BS 546 plug and socket (which are still found in old installations or in special applications such as remotely switched lighting). [...] Other exceptions to the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets include equipment requiring more than 13A, low-power portable equipment (such as shavers and toothbrushes) and <b>mains-operated</b> clocks.|$|E
50|$|Various initiatives, {{such as the}} EU Common External Power Supply {{have been}} {{announced}} to standardize the interface to the charger, and to promote energy efficiency of <b>mains-operated</b> chargers. A star rating system is promoted by some manufacturers, where the most efficient chargers consume less than 0.03 watts and obtain a five-star rating.|$|E
50|$|Bang & Olufsen invented and {{patented}} {{the so-called}} Dolby HX PRO (Headroom eXtension) principle for combining bias control with the Dolby system for better high-frequency response in cassette recorders. Tandberg invented the cross-field recording system for tape recorders where a separate {{head with the}} bias was used. Adding bias to the recorded signal in the one head had tended to limit the system's high-frequency response, due to interaction between bias and signal. The cross-field system produced less interference from the bias signal. This allowed extended high-frequency performance compared to mixing the two signals in the recording head, but mechanical tolerances for cross-field are tight. The system required frequent readjustment and was largely abandoned. Japanese manufacturer Akai, however, persisted with cross-field bias and successfully marketed portable and <b>mains-operated</b> machines featuring the cross-field system.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is a design of a control and {{signalling}} unit for sport meetings controlled by a microcontroller. The unit should display the time, the state of the match, eventually another data important for a course of the match. It should be fitted by an audible alarm {{of the end of the}} match. A touch control panel with a liquid crystal display serves as input of control data. The unit operates in a countdown mode, it is possible anytime to start or to stop the time by pressing the button. The equipment is <b>mains-operated</b> and backed up by an external battery. In the case of a power failure, it is switched over to the battery. A representation of the time, the state of the match and other data is done by LED displays. The unit allows a connection to PC...|$|E
40|$|The four {{blood glucose}} {{monitors}} {{available in the}} United Kingdom were compared by asking the opinions of 24 patients who used each monitor for two weeks, by correlating their blood glucose results with those obtained in the laboratory, and by having the monitors examined by an electronics engineer. Of the battery-operated monitors, patients preferred the Hypocount (15) to the Glucochek (9). The <b>mains-operated</b> units were less popular, with little to choose between Eyetone and Reflomat. Under field conditions the blood glucose results obtained with the Glucochek correlated poorly with the standard reference method. In contrast the Hypocount, Eyetone, and Reflomat machines produced good correlations. Poor results with the Glucochek were mainly due to faulty timing systems. The patients' preference for the Hypocount was supported by tests of performance under laboratory conditions and by the electronics engineer's report...|$|E
40|$|Most <b>mains-operated</b> {{equipment}} {{in use today}} {{is connected to the}} supply via plugs and sockets. These are generally acceptable in benign environments but can be unsafe or have limited life in the presence of moisture. In explosive atmospheres and in under-sea applications special connectors must be used. This paper describes a technique, the Contactless Energy Transfer System (CETS), by which electrical energy may be transmitted, without electrical connection or physical contact, through non-magnetic media of low conductivity. CETS, which has been used to transfer up to 5 kW across a 10 mm gap, employs high-frequency magnetic coupling and enables plug-in power connections to be made in wet or hazardous environmental conditions without the risk of electric shock, short-circuiting or sparking. Energy may be transmitted without the necessity for accurately manufactured "plug and socket" mechanisms and may be transmitted from source to load even when there is relative motion. Load-source voltage matching may be made inherent to the system...|$|E
40|$|DE 102009012786 A 1 UPAB: 20101014 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} applying base-high frequency (HF) -alternating current (AC) voltage to {{a metallic}} conductive carrier (14) at locations (20, 21). A tapped voltage is tapped at a {{surface of the}} carrier at locations (24, 25), which lie between the former locations. A frequency of the base-HF-AC voltage is selected such that an impedance of the carrier is increased using skin effects and/or self induction in an area for reducing current through a driver unit (15) e. g. HF-AC generator, and the carrier and for producing power for operating a load (14). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for supplying energy to a load. USE - Method for supplying energy to a load such as a sensor e. g. proximity sensor, and an actuator (all claimed), which is used for process automation in an industry and for building automation. Can {{also be used for}} automotive, structure monitoring, micromanipulator and microrobot applications. ADVANTAGE - The method permits change of positions of the load on the metallic conductive carrier in simple manner, supplies energy to multiple loads using a single <b>mains-operated</b> unit with high performance, and allows the load to be durably operated. The method avoids occurrence of short-circuits at the carrier...|$|E
