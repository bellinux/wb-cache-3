500|$|The {{fighting}} on the Allied right now paused as both sides sought to regroup. Girard's division had suffered considerably in its battle with Zayas, and Colborne's actions, although ultimately disastrous, had caused significant French casualties. [...] Girard now regarded his division as a spent force and brought up Gazan's 2nd Division to take its place. Advancing in column, Gazan's battalions had to struggle through the remnants of Girard's retiring units. As a result, many of the 1st Division's survivors were swept up and incorporated into Gazan's column, which grew by accretion into a dense mass of 8,000 men, losing much of its cohesion in the process. The ensuing disruption and delay gave the Allies time to re-form their own lines. [...] Beresford deployed Hoghton's brigade behind Zayas's lines and Abercrombie's {{to the rear of}} Ballesteros, then moved them forward to relieve the Spaniards. Joseph Moyle Sherer, an officer serving under Abercrombie, recounts how a young Spanish officer rode up and [...] "begged <b>me...</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to the English that his countrymen were ordered to retire [...] were not flying." ...|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{was next}} {{scheduled}} {{to play against}} Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen. [...] "Spassky predicted a tight struggle: 'Larsen is a little stronger in spirit. Before the match, Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience:It {{is hard to say}} how their match will end, {{but it is clear that}} such an easy victory as in Vancouver [...] will not be given to Fischer. I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for , all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible. Fischer beat Larsen by the score of 6–0. Robert Byrne writes: [...] "To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity–almost a freak, a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again. But now I am at a loss for anything whatever to say... So, it is out of the question for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how Bobby, how anyone, could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen". Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's [...] "incredible" [...] 12–0 score in the two matches. Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the [...] "highest single-match performance rating ever".|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Giuliani {{had already}} {{stepped down as}} CEO and {{chairman}} of Giuliani Partners in June 2007, although this action was not disclosed publicly. On December 4, 2007, {{in the wake of}} the latest attention to the firm's client base, Giuliani Partners announced the stepping down, with Giuliani defending his work there, saying, [...] "Everything I did at Giuliani Partners was totally legal, totally ethical. There's nothing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> about. We acted honorably, decently." [...] Giuliani maintained his equity interest in the firm.|$|E

2500|$|... “I {{will have}} {{you know that the}} initial days of our {{traditional}} masquerades [...] which have just passed [...] have left painful impressions in my mind. [...] Allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain.</b> In every way, the carnival has been a joyful celebration of the soul of the people, an exhibition of good artistic taste, a competition of original ideas, a contest in which thought and action have always vied in giving objective form to the perfect conception of Beauty and towards the noble intent of the dignification of society; Paris, Rome, Venice, Madrid and Havana itself offer in their carnestolendas lessons on how complaisant liberty ought to be used in those periods of fantasy in order to educate the wishes and aspirations of the citizen. But here, in our city, in one of those scientifically inexplicable regressions towards a dark past, certain elements of our commonwealth seem committed [...] under the pretext of carnaval [...] to the repugnant task of checking human progress and causing harm to Civilization with their excesses.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{helped with}} {{providing}} information, including Asa Gray on American plants. Darwin wrote to Gray on 20 July 1857 saying that after 19 {{years of work}} {{on the question of}} whether species [...] "have descended from other species, like varieties from one species" [...] and [...] "that species arise like our domestic varieties with much extinction", he had [...] "come to the heteredox conclusion that there are no such things as independently created species – that species are only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make you despise me. – I do not much underrate the many huge difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> too much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false." [...] An intrigued Gray admitted to his own notion that there was some law or power inherent in plants making varieties appear, and asked if Darwin was finding this law. Realising that Gray had not grasped what he was suggesting, Darwin sent him a letter on 5 September outlining the difficulties involved. He enclosed a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas on natural selection and divergence, copied out by the schoolmaster to make it more legible.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E

30|$|Do {{you usually}} think about breathing? Are you {{conscious}} or aware of taking air {{in and out}} of your lungs? Many students of meditation and yoga appreciate the primacy of breathing and of specific breathing practices such as pranayama. Thus, when I teach respiratory physiology to either my physiology students or to students of contemplative practice I sometimes begin by asking them if they had been aware of their breathing prior to my posing the question. The answer is always 'no' and this opens the door for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the underlying science of why this is so.|$|R
