25|$|Eyewitnesses (including a <b>Mr</b> <b>Russell)</b> {{state that}} at 3:05pm the Avro Tudor was {{approaching}} runway 28 of Llandow aerodrome at an abnormally low altitude with the undercarriage down. The pilot attempted {{to correct the}} descent by increasing {{the power of the}} engines and brought the plane up. The aircraft rose steeply to 100m (300ft) attaining a nose-up attitude of 35 degrees to the vertical, and then the aircraft stalled.|$|E
25|$|As {{everything}} {{had been done to}} help the passengers, and when nothing else could be done to save them, <b>Mr</b> <b>Russell</b> and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend <b>Mr</b> <b>Russell,</b> who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that <b>Mr</b> <b>Russell,</b> as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E

Hastings did not represent <b>Mrs</b> <b>Russell</b> in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|R

In October 1921 Mrs Russell gave birth to a son, Geoffrey Russell, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Russell</b> immediately filed for divorce and to have the child declared a bastard.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} having been robbed and kidnapped, Mr. Ivy E. Russell {{continued}} to operate the Bank of Avilla for at least twelve more years. [...] A great crime wave of robberies and violence swept across the Midwest in 1932.

[...] Though this is local legend, {{it is safe to}} assume that many other Depression-era hoodlums passed though town as well. The bank always remained open during normal hours, with Ivy E.

2500|$|At {{a typical}} moment of penury, Charlotte {{was offered the}} leading male role of Punch (of Punch & Judy fame) in a new puppet theatre {{proposed}} by a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Russell,</b> due to her recognised abilities as both a comic performer and a proven manipulator of difficult stringed marionettes. The short season was an artistic and financial success for Charlotte, but {{before it could be}} repeated the theatre's founder was arrested for debts and confined to Newgate Prison, where he died after having lost his fortune and his mind. Charlotte attempted to buy her friend's puppets from Russell's landlord, who had claimed them, but she could not meet his asking price and the little company likewise passed out of existence. An unproduced script Russell had written was also kept by the dead man's creditors as collateral, thus preventing Charlotte from staging it as she had promised its author. [...] The script was thereafter lost as well.|$|E
2500|$|At {{first the}} ship ran aground on the reef {{at the mouth}} of the bay, now called the Pollack Holes, but as the tide was very high, the wind drove the ship further into the bay and {{eventually}} onto the rocks less than [...] from Sykes House. As the ship foundered so close to the shore, Mr Richard Russell, the owner of Sykes House, and his servant Henry Likely rushed down to the rocks to help. When the captain saw the lights of these two men, and saw that the rocks were passable, he ordered the third mast to be cut down and to be used as a gangway for the passengers and crew to escape to the rocks. <b>Mr</b> <b>Russell</b> was soon joined by three members of the Clare Coast Guard, and they began to assist the passengers from the rocks and onto the land below Sykes House. All the time the tide was rising and after about 100 people had been landed on the rock, it became impossible to assist more.|$|E
