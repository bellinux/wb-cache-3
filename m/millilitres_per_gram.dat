40|$|Purpose Age-related {{decline in}} {{cognitive}} speed {{has been associated}} with prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptor availability, but the contribution of presynaptic dopamine and noradrenaline innervation to age-related changes in cognition is unknown. Methods In a group of 16 healthy participants aged 22 – 61 years, we used PET and the radioligand FDOPA to measure catecholamine synthesis capacity (K in app; <b>millilitres</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> per minute) and the digit symbol substitution test to measure cognitive speed, a component of fluid IQ. Results Cognitive speed was associated with the magnitude of K in app in the prefrontal cortex (p[*]<[*] 0. 0005). Both cognitive speed (p[*]=[*] 0. 003) and FDOPA K in app (p[*]<[*] 0. 0005) declined with age, both in a standard voxel-wise analysis and in a volume-of-interest analysis with partial volume correction, and the correlation between cognitive speed and K in app remained significant beyond the effects of age (p[*]=[*] 0. 047). MR-based segmentation revealed that these age-related declines were not attributable to age-related alterations in grey matter density. Conclusion Our findings indicate that age-related changes in the capacity of the prefrontal cortex to synthesize catecholamines, irrespective of cortical atrophy, may underlie age-related decline in cognitive speed...|$|E

40|$|The seed {{moisture}} level marking {{the onset of}} imbibitional injury (breakpoint) was determined for two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cvs `Tendercrop' (TC) and `Kinghorn Wax' (KW). At 20 °C the breakpoints were 0. 15 gram H 2 O/gram dry weight (<b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram)</b> for TC and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW. When seeds were imbibed at 5 °C, the breakpoints were 0. 19 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (TC) and 0. 16 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (KW). Below the breakpoint germination changed 4. 6 %/ 0. 01 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for all treatments. Imbibition rates were maximal at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> after 20 minutes imbibition. Rates of electrolyte leakage were correlated with the imbibition rate maximum at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> but were unaffected by the maximum at 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> The transition from tightly bound to semibound water occurred at 0. 09 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW and TC, respectively. T 1 values increased exponentially as seed moisture decreased from 0. 47 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> to 0. 05 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> 13 C-NMR sugar signals increased at {{moisture level}}s above 0. 14 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and plateaued at approximately 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> seed moisture. These {{results suggest that the}} breakpoint moisture level for imbibitional damage is a function of temperature while the injury process is similar at both 5 and 20 °C. Imbibition and leakage rate maxima reflect transitions in the states of seed water. NMR data support the application of the Water Replacement Hypothesis to seeds. Thus, imbibitional injury may be related to specific, temperature dependent moisture levels that are determined by water binding characteristics in the seed tissue...|$|R

50|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} (CBF) is {{the blood supply}} to the brain in a given period of time. In an adult, CBF is {{typically}} 750 <b>millilitres</b> <b>per</b> minute or 15% of the cardiac output. This equates to an average perfusion of 50 to 54 <b>millilitres</b> of blood <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams</b> of brain tissue per minute. CBF is tightly regulated to meet the brain's metabolic demands. Too much blood (a condition known as hyperemia) can raise intracranial pressure (ICP), which can compress and damage delicate brain tissue. Too little blood flow (ischemia) results if {{blood flow to the}} brain is below 18 to 20 ml per 100 g per minute, and tissue death occurs if flow dips below 8 to 10 ml per 100 g per minute. In brain tissue, a biochemical cascade known as the ischemic cascade is triggered when the tissue becomes ischemic, potentially resulting in damage to and the death of brain cells. Medical professionals must take steps to maintain proper CBF in patients who have conditions like shock, stroke, cerebral edema, and traumatic brain injury.|$|R
