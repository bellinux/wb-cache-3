Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E
500|$|The 2008 {{launch of}} {{clothing}} line [...] "FAKE" [...] (Fleury's Artistic Kustom Enterprises) {{led him to}} approach the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League {{in the hope of}} convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys. The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt. He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a single in a pinch-hit appearance against the Yuma Scorpions. He started the second game at left field and struck out twice before he was replaced. [...] "I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> things I've done, the things I've accomplished. This was just another one of those days," [...] Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers.|$|E

500|$|George {{preferred}} {{to stay at}} home pursuing his hobbies of stamp collecting and game shooting, and lived a life that later biographers would consider dull because of its conventionality. He was not an intellectual: on returning from one evening at the opera he wrote, [...] "Went to Covent Garden and saw Fidelio and damned dull it was." [...] Nonetheless, he was earnestly devoted to Britain and its Commonwealth. He explained, [...] "it has always been my dream to identify <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> great idea of Empire." [...] He appeared hard-working and became widely admired by the people of Britain and the Empire, as well as [...] "the Establishment". In the words of historian David Cannadine, George V and Queen Mary were an [...] "inseparably devoted couple" [...] who upheld [...] "character" [...] and [...] "family values". George established a standard of conduct for British royalty that reflected the values and virtues of the upper middle-class rather than upper-class lifestyles or vices. He was by temperament a traditionalist who never fully appreciated or approved the revolutionary changes under way in British society. Nevertheless, he invariably wielded his influence as a force of neutrality and moderation, seeing his role as mediator rather than final decision maker.|$|E
500|$|Baldur's Gate II {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim upon its release, and Metacritic lists {{it as the}} sixth highest-scoring PC game on the site [...] GameSpot said that, while {{it is a very}} long game, its fine points are what make it so great, and said the game was in a class by itself. IGN also called the game incomparable and peerless. GameSpot later called the game [...] "a towering achievement in the history of role-playing games." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer felt though the game was worthy being called the best game of the year and as good as games such as Fallout, , and Betrayal at Krondor, [...] "I won't trap <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 'best RPG ever' phrase." [...] He also felt the game's story was somewhere between Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale in terms of depth. Eurogamer lavished much praise upon the game, and noted that [...] "the story and quests are captivating, the gameplay tried and tested, and the overall feel is professional and entertaining." [...] In a 2007 Gamasutra article on the [...] "Platinum and Modern Ages" [...] of computer role-playing games (CRPGs), Matt Barton noted contemporary reviewers' universal praise for the game, and said, [...] "I consider it the finest CRPG ever designed." [...] According to GameSpy, [...] "this is easily one of the finest CRPGs ever made and an experience that no RPG fan should miss".|$|E

2500|$|Irwin {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2000 that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds, but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: [...] "A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought it would be great to win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer then and I thought it would be wonderful to give him a victory.

[...] Frankfurter, however, insisted that the passage was necessary since he claimed he was [...] "literally flooded with letters" [...] following the Court's decision in Gobitis that said he should be more sensitive to the protection of minorities due to his Jewish heritage. [...] Frankfurter's dissent continued, [...] "Were my purely personal attitudes relevant I should wholeheartedly associate <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> generally libertarian views in the Court's opinion. ...

2500|$|In a {{departure}} from their previous four studio albums, Yes recorded Going for the One with new engineering personnel. Since 1970, they had worked with audio engineer and producer Eddy Offord, who also mixed the band's live sound in concert. After their Relayer tour, however, Offord thought the band's style had become [...] "a bit stale", and thought {{a break from the}} band to pursue other projects was needed. Offord was replaced by recording engineer John Timperley, who was assisted by David Richards. In a first for the band, the album was produced entirely by Yes. It is also the first engineering job for Yes's future sound mixer Nigel Luby, who [...] "did little more than watch and acquaint <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> equipment." [...] Squire recalled numerous heated arguments over the use of echo on the album, as some members liked it and others did not.|$|E

Co-written by Paulini in New York, she explained that [...] "the song is about letting go of negativity, doubt and fear – breathing in and exhaling positivity and purpose." [...] "By My Side" [...] was released as the second and final single from Come Alive on 15 May 2015. Co-written in Sydney by Paulini and producer Adam Reily, [...] "By My Side" [...] was dedicated to Paulini's older sister Litia who battled and overcame breast cancer. Paulini stated that the song is lyrically [...] "about my journey {{over the past few}} years and coming into my skin after a struggle to find my voice, my artistry and above all, loving <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of loved ones by my side."

2500|$|During this period, Dancigers {{was busy}} {{producing}} films for the actor/director Fernando Soler, {{one of the}} most durable of Mexican film personalities, having been referred to as the [...] "national paterfamilias". [...] Although Soler typically preferred to direct his own films, for their latest collaboration, El Gran Calavera, based on a play by Adolfo Torrado, he decided that doing both jobs would be too much trouble, so he asked Dancigers to find someone who could be trusted to handle the technical aspects of the directorial duties. [...] Buñuel welcomed the opportunity, stating that: [...] "I amused <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> montage, the constructions, the angles... All of that interested me because I was still an apprentice in so-called 'normal' cinema." [...] As a result of his work on this film, he developed a technique for making films cheaply and quickly by limiting them to 125 shots. El Gran Calavera was completed in 16 days at a cost of 400,000 pesos (approximately $46,000 US at 1948 exchange rates). [...] The picture has been described as [...] "a hilarious screwball send-up of the Mexican nouveau riche... a wild roller coaster of mistaken identity, sham marriages and misfired suicides", and it was a big hit at the box office in Mexico. [...] In 2013, the picture was re-made by Mexican director Gary Alazraki under the title The Noble Family. [...] In 1949, Buñuel renounced his Spanish citizenship to become a naturalized Mexican.|$|E
