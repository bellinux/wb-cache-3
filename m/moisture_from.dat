40|$|In this study, the {{principle}} of moisture transport in porous materials was {{used to analyze the}} rate of <b>moisture</b> removal <b>from</b> food items during the solar drying process. A cabinet solar dryer was designed, fabricated, and tested to evaluate <b>moisture</b> flux <b>from</b> samples of food items. The dryer exhibited sufficient ability to dry the samples reasonably to a safe moisture level. The results obtained show that at lower liquid concentrations the moisture flux increases with increase in the concentration, while the moisture flux was constant at liquid concentrations above 70 kg m– 3 for shelled corn and above 150 kg m– 3 for yam chips. The drying temperature and the intensity of solar radiation were the main factors that influenced the rate of <b>moisture</b> removal <b>from</b> the food items.
