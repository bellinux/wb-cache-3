40|$|This paper {{examines}} if self-arranged marriages (or love marriages) {{have replaced}} parent-arranged marriages {{as the dominant}} form of marriage in India. In particular, I examine if women of recent cohorts (born around 1980) {{are less likely to}} report arranged marriages than women of older cohorts (born around 1956). I also examine if educated women are less likely to report arranged marriages than their less educated counterparts. Results from multinomial regression analysis suggest that women of recent cohorts are more likely to report a parent arranged <b>marriages</b> <b>with</b> their consent. Education is associated with greater autonomy in partner choice decision but it is most strongly associated <b>with</b> parent arranged <b>marriages</b> <b>with</b> consent. I conclude that in a context where a dating culture is not normative, parent arranged <b>marriages</b> <b>with</b> consent may {{be the best way to}} accommodate individual choice while retaining some of the traditional parental control over spouse choice...|$|R
