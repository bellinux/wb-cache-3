50|$|Empiric {{therapy or}} {{empirical}} therapy is therapy {{based on experience}} and, more specifically, therapy begun {{on the basis of}} a clinical educated guess in the absence of complete or perfect information. Thus it is applied before the confirmation of a definitive diagnosis or in the absence of complete understanding of mechanism, whether the biological mechanism of pathogenesis or the therapeutic mechanism of action. The name shares the same stem with empirical evidence, involving an idea of practical experience. Empiric therapy is most often used when antibiotics are given to a person before the specific bacterium causing an infection is known. Fighting an infection sooner rather than later is important to minimize <b>morbidity,</b> <b>risk,</b> and complications, so there is value in getting started with good information rather than waiting around for better information. Examples of this include antibiotics given for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and suspected bacterial meningitis in newborns aged 0 to 6 months. Empiric antibiotic therapy thus may be thought of as taking the initiative against an anticipated and likely cause of infectious disease.|$|E
50|$|Some people {{disagree}} with aid {{when looking at}} where the development aid money from NGO's and other funding is going. Funding tends {{to be used in}} a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, <b>morbidity,</b> <b>risk</b> of mortality, and the feasibility of control. Through this ranking system, the disease that cause the most mortality and are most easily treated are given the funding. The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions of which they came from. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: National {{guidance}} {{states that}} all patients having emergency surgery {{should have a}} mortality risk assessment calculated on admission so that the ‘high risk’ patient can receive the appropriate seniority and level of care. We aimed to assess if peri-operative risk scoring tools could accurately calculate mortality and <b>morbidity</b> <b>risk.</b> Methods: Mortality risk scores for 86 consecutive emergency laparotomies, were calculated using pre-operative (ASA, Lee index) and post-operative (POSSUM, P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM) risk calculation tools. <b>Morbidity</b> <b>risk</b> scores were calculated using the POSSUM predicted morbidity and compared against actual morbidity according to the Clavien–Dindo classification. Results: The actual mortality was 10. 5 %. The average predicted risk scores for all laparotomies were: ASA 26. 5 %, Lee Index 2. 5 %, POSSUM 29. 5 %, P-POSSUM 18. 5 %, CR-POSSUM 10. 5 %. Complications occurred following 67 laparotomies (78 %). The majority (51 %) of complications were classified as Clavien–Dindo grade 2 – 3 (non-life-threatening). Patients having a POSSUM <b>morbidity</b> <b>risk</b> of greater than 50 % developed significantly more life-threatening complications (CD 4 – 5) compared with those who predicted {{less than or equal}} to 50 % <b>morbidity</b> <b>risk</b> (P =  0. 01). Discussion: Pre-operative risk stratification remains a challenge because the Lee Index under-predicts and ASA over-predicts mortality risk. Post-operative risk scoring using the CR-POSSUM is more accurate and we suggest can be used to identify patients who require intensive care post-operatively. Conclusions: In the absence of accurate risk scoring tools that can be used on admission to hospital it is not possible to reliably audit the achievement of national standards of care for the ‘high-risk’ patient...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the parameters that {{can influence the}} outcome of severe closed craniocerebral injury. Craniocerebral injuries involve two phas-es: the phase of primary injury, which includes primary cerebral le-sions made {{under the influence of}} factors that have a direct or indirect impact on the cranium, and the phase that represents secondary inju-ries, which are the result of the impact of pathophysiological mecha-nisms (hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypotension). These mechanisms are initiated by a trauma as well as some specific characteristics of the organism (e. g., age, comorbid conditions, and previous injuries). The aim {{of the study was to}} establish factors that significantly influence the outcome after severe closed craniocerebral injury. A total of 182 pa-tients that were treated at the Clinical Center in Kragujevac from 2001 to 2005 were included. The most important prognostic factors for the treatment outcome were: age, oxygen saturation, the Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) and level of injury of the cerebral tissue diagnosed by a CT. <b>Morbidity</b> <b>risk</b> raised by 2. 6 % when only the age parameter increased by one year. When evaluating a 1 % increase in oxygen satu-ration, the <b>morbidity</b> <b>risk</b> rate fell for 10. 7 % of the patients if other pa-rameters remained stable. According to the aforementioned criteria, a 159. 3 % increase in <b>morbidity</b> <b>risk</b> rate was observed between mild and severe brain injury when other parameters did not change.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the value of}} reducing foodborne risk. Research on the valuation of health risk {{has been dominated by}} the study of mortality risk.
