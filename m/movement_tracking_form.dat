Inside-in systems are defined as those which employ sensor(s) and source(s) that are both on the body (e. g. a glove with piezo-resistive flex sensors). The sensors generally have small form-factors and are therefore especially suitable for tracking small body parts. Whilst these systems allow for c...|$|R

40|$|Automatic <b>tracking</b> {{of facial}} <b>movement</b> is {{potentially}} {{important as a}} non-invasive source of physiological data in Affective Computing applications. Facial <b>movement</b> <b>tracking</b> software is becoming commercially available and affordable. This paper explores the association between facial and physiological responses to computer-based events, and the viability of facial <b>movement</b> <b>tracking</b> in detecting and distinguishing qualitative differences in users' facial movements under normal conditions of computer use. Fifteen participants took a web-based quiz. The quiz contained two relatively ordinary HCI events as stimuli: an alert intended to evoke surprise, and questions with high affective content intended to evoke amusement. From previous findings, the alert {{was expected to be}} the stronger of the two stimuli. Participants' physiological arousal was recorded and their faces videoed. The videos for the periods around each event were analysed by commercially available facial <b>movement</b> <b>tracking</b> software. Human judges considered participants' faces to have responded to both stimuli, but more to the stronger of the two stimuli. Facial response did not always concur with physiological arousal. The tracker detected reactions to the stronger stimulus but had mixed success with the weaker stimulus. The tracker also generated different data profiles for two different facial expressions. These findings support the supposition that users' facial expressions can and do respond to ordinary computer-based events, and indicate that facial <b>movement</b> <b>tracking</b> is becoming a viable technique, and is available to non-computer vision specialist...|$|R

40|$|During the {{rehabilitation}} {{process of the}} post-stroke patients is conducted, their movements need to be localized and learned so that incorrect movement can be instantly modified or tuned. Therefore, <b>tracking</b> these <b>movement</b> becomes vital and necessary for the rehabilitative course. In the technologies of human <b>movement</b> <b>tracking,</b> the position prediction of human movement is very important. In this paper, we first analyze {{the configuration of the}} human movement system and choice of sensors. Then, The Kalman filter algorithm and its modified algorithm are proposed and to be used to predict the position of human movement. In the end,on the basis of analyzing the performance of the method, {{it is clear that the}} method described can be used to the system of human <b>movement</b> <b>tracking...</b>|$|R

The part of this work is program in Matlab, which using the method of infrared detection follow the position of eye pupil and transfer this movements to the movements on the computer screen. Using this program it was tested several volunteers and the results of detection were transferred to the visual form. As part of this program it was created template for assessment of accuracy of used method. At the end of work are discussed achieved results...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to find out whether {{subjective}} image quality evaluations can be quantified by eye <b>movement</b> <b>tracking.</b> We want to map objective or physically measurable image quality to subjective evaluations and eye movement data. Results show that eye movement parameters consistently change according to the instructions given to the user, and according to physical image quality. These results indicate that eye <b>movement</b> <b>tracking</b> could be used to differentiate image quality evaluation strategies that the users have. Results also show that eye movements would help mapping between technological and subjective image quality. We also propose to extend the widely used image quality process model, the Image Quality Circle. We suggest adding the objective measurements of a viewer (e. g. eye tracking) in parallel with customer perceptions as an option to gather information of customer perceptions of image quality...|$|R
