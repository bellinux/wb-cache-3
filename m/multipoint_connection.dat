The HM-PIN having a universal network interface integrates a variety of information services: telecommunications, newspapers, magazines, TV broadcasts and the growing collection of information servers. This network fundamentally o#ers three items: (1) bi-directional real-time channels with 10 -Mbit/s-class or higher bit rate, (2) <b>multipoint</b> <b>connections</b> including multicasting /broadcasting, (3) high accessibility to information. These items are derived from {{the constraints of the}} conventional telephone networks and the Internet. By applying photonic technologies, the HM-PIN can be implemented as follows: The local network (the service platform) of the HM-PIN can be achieved by using a wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) broadcastand -select (B&S) architecture that o#ers broadband <b>multipoint</b> <b>connections</b> (one-to-many, many-to-many) based on an inherent full-mesh topology.

Thus, to achieve satisfactory performance, the optical carriers must have the correct spacing, their individual wavelengths must be precisely controlled and the subcarrier frequencies carefully selected to minimize OBI.

40|$|Abstract—p-Cycles {{have been}} {{proposed}} for preprovisioned protection in optical mesh networks. Although the protection cir-cuits are preconfigured, the detection of failures and the rerouting of traffic can be a time consuming operation. Another survivable mode of operation is the protection mode, in which a signal is transmitted to the destination on two link disjoint circuits, hence recovery from failures is expeditious. However, this requires {{a large number of}} protection circuits. In this paper, we introduce a new concept in protection: protection, in which a p-Cycle, sim-ilar to FIPP p-cycles, can be used to protect a number of bidirec-tional connections, which are mutually link disjoint, and also link disjoint from all links of the p-Cycle. However, data units from dif-ferent circuits are combined using network coding, which can be implemented in a number of technologies, such as Next Generation SONET (NGS), MPLS/GMPLS, or IP-over-WDM. The maximum outage time under this protection scheme can be limited to no more than the p-Cycle propagation delay. It is also shown how to imple-ment a hybrid and protection scheme, in which on-cycle links are protected using protection, while straddling links, or paths, are protected using protection. Extensions of this technique to protect <b>multipoint</b> <b>connections</b> are also introduced. A performance study based on optimal formulations of the and the hybrid scheme is introduced. Although speed of re-covery is comparable to that of protection, numerical results for small networks indicate that is about 30 % more effi-cient than protection, in terms of the amount of protection resources, especially as the network graph density increases.
