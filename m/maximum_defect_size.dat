In this work {{a large number}} of fracture surfaces from fatigue specimens of Inconel- 718 have been studied with the main purpose to identify and learn more of initiation mechanisms acting in this specific alloy. Initiation sites have been identified, measured by size and investigated using SEM in an attempt to determine the cause of crack initiation.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the effect of casting defects on the high cycle fatigue properties, rotary bending fatigue tests were carried out on a cast {{aluminum}} alloy, JIS AC 4 CH, with two different levels of defect size.

The predicted values of fatigue limits for specimens with the different defect sizes were not in good agreement with the experimental values. In addition, the effects of the roller burnishing process on surface conditions and fatigue properties were also investigated.

40|$|When {{pushed to}} the limits of their {{detection}} capability, NDE systems do not produce consistent hit/miss indications. Their capability of detecting small defects is therefore expressed in terms of POD. An adequate NDE system is required to ensure the structural integrity. In conventional signal response analysis, the POD is expressed {{as a function of the}} <b>defect</b> <b>size,</b> and its adequacy for the inspection task is tested against the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> which will not undermine the structural integrity. Analyses of modern structures show that other parameters, beside the <b>defect</b> <b>size,</b> can both significantly influence the POD and determine the severity of the defect for the structure. Within the multi-parameter reliability analysis, the POD is expressed as a function of those influencing parameters. When determining the adequacy of the NDE system, the capability of detecting a defect has to be expressed and tested against the critical value of exactly that parameter that determines defects severity for the structure.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{wheel is}} a critical safety component in the vehicle and, for such a reason, it has also to meet strict requirements about technological properties. This component is produced by {{low pressure die casting}} technique and the casting defects related to the process have to be properly considered having a high effect in decreasing both static and dynamic resistance of the component. Effectively, casting defects like porosities influence the fatigue crack initiation and strongly affect the fatigue life too. One of the most common problem in the real component is the mismatch between the experimental data and literature. In fact, many scientific researches were carried out on small samples produced in a controlled condition and therefore it is difficult to direct transfer the laboratory results to a real cast component with a well-defined shape and different thicknesses. In the present study, an aluminum alloy A 356 -T 6 wheel was analyzed in order to correlate the fatigue performance taking in to account the casting defects. The fatigue limit of the component was studied by rotating bending fatigue tests executed on the whole wheels. Microfractographic analyses on the broken wheels were carried out on the fracture surfaces using a Scanning Electron Microscope in order to identify the crack initiation zone: it was recognized that the crack always started from shrinkage porosities. The statistical population of these defects was therefore investigated on samples taken from the wheel in crack nucleation positions of the spoke and the <b>maximum</b> expected <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> on the component was estimated by the statistics of extreme values.

40|$|Advanced {{characterization}} {{methods have been}} used to analyze the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cells in a model stack. The primarily experimental work included contacting studies, sealing of a model stack, thermal and re-oxidation cycling. Also an attempt was made to correlate cell fracture in the stack with pore sizes determined from computer tomography. The contacting studies were carried out using pressure sensitive foils. The load to achieve full contact on anode and cathode side of the cell was assessed and applied in the subsequent model stack test. The stack experiment permitted a detailed analysis of stack compaction during sealing. During steady state operation thermal and re-oxidation cycling the changes in open cell voltage and acoustic emissions were monitored. Significant softening of the sealant material was observed at low temperatures. Heating in the thermal cycling loop of the stack appeared to be less critical than the cooling. Re-oxidation cycling led to significant damage if a critical re-oxidation time was exceeded. Microstructural studies permitted further insight into the re-oxidation mechanism. Finally, the <b>maximum</b> <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> in the cell was determined by computer tomography. A limit of maximum anode stress was estimated and the result correlated this with the failure strength observed during the model stack testing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAfter the {{introduction}} of catheter intervention for atrial septal defect (ASD) in the pediatric population, therapeutic advantages of this less invasive procedure were focused on adult through geriatric populations. The most valuable clinical benefits of this procedure are the significant improvement of symptoms and daily activities, which result from the closure of left to right shunt without thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. These benefits contribute {{to increase the number}} of adult patients of this condition who have hesitated over surgical closure. In terms of technical point of view for catheter closure of ASD, the difficulties still exist in some morphological features of defect, or hemodynamic features in the adult population. Morphological features of difficult ASD closure are (1) large (≥ 30 mm) ASD, (2) wide rim deficiency, and (3) multiple defects. Hemodynamic features of difficult ASD are (1) severe pulmonary hypertension, (2) ventricular dysfunction, and (3) restrictive left ventricular compliance (diastolic dysfunction) after ASD closure. To complete the catheter ASD closure under these difficult conditions, various procedural techniques have been introduced. These are new imaging modalities such as real-time three-dimensional imaging, new technical modifications, and new concepts for hemodynamic evaluation. Especially, real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography can provide the high quality imaging for anatomical evaluation including <b>maximum</b> <b>defect</b> <b>size,</b> surrounding rim morphology, and the relationship between device and septal rim. In adult patients, optimal management for their comorbidities is an important issue, which includes cardiac function, atrial arrhythmias, respiratory function, and renal function. Management of atrial arrhythmias is a key issue for the long-term outcome in adult patients. Because the interventional procedures are not complication-free techniques, the establishment of a surgical back-up system is essential for the safe achievement of the procedure. Finally, the establishment of a team approach including pediatric and adult cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and anesthesiologists is the most important factor for a good therapeutic outcome...|$|E

The spontaneous changes in rest-redistribution thallium <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> were prospectively studied over six months in 52  patients with chronic Q wave myocardial infarction.  DESIGN—Changes in rest thallium <b>defect</b> <b>size,</b> thallium uptake in the infarct area, and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction were compared to the quantitative coronary angiogram data. Two groups of patients were considered: patients with a percentage of stenosis below 100 % (group 1, n =  31); and patients with an occluded artery (group 2, n = 21).  RESULTS—In the overall population, the mean (SD) <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> decreased from 28. 2  (17. 2) % to 24. 9  (19. 3) % of the whole myocardium (p =  0. 01), while, in this area, the thallium uptake increased from 62. 9  (13. 7) % to 66. 9  (15. 6) % (p <  0. 001). At the time of inclusion, the <b>defect</b> <b>size,</b> thallium uptake, and ejection fraction were similar in both groups. In group 1  patients only, the reduction in <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> correlated with the improvement in ejection fraction (r = 0. 41, p =  0. 02) and {{was related to the}} percentage of coronary artery stenosis.

When a good reproducibility {{was defined as}} an ICC of ≥ 0.75, this was achieved between the collimators and between no filtering and filtering with a high (200  MBq) injection dose, indicating that collimator choice {{and the use of}} post-reconstruction filtering do not significantly affect measurement reproducibility in this dose setting. With a low (25  MBq) injection dose, the good reproducibility was observed between the collimators when a heavy (2.5 -mm kernel size) smoothing was applied. However, such a heavy smoothing would cause a significant underestimation of <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> as compared to no filtering setting particularly with STD as illustrated in Figures  11 and 12. More importantly, the filtering-related reproducibility was poor for STD irrespective of filter kernel size (Figure  11), indicating that the <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> measured using STD may not be reproducible in such a low-dose setting. By contrast, the filtering-related reproducibility was much better for HS as illustrated in Figure  12.

This study examined the association of potentially modifiable characteristics, including treatment delay, with KC <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> after Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). A stratified random sample of patients treated for KC with MMS were selected for telephone interview. Two hundred and nineteen interviews were completed (refusal rate 24 %). Regression models were {{used to examine the}} predictors to <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> and delay. Anatomic site, age, histology, and gender predicted <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> (R 2 = 0. 39) and were used as control variables. Self-reported delay between initial physician examination and MMS predicted <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> (p= 0. 0004), with greater than 1 y delay being associated with a doubling of <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2. 0; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 3 – 3. 1). Delays of this duration were associated with initial examination by a primary provider (unadjusted OR 3. 9; 95 % CI 1. 7 – 8. 8), misdiagnosis (unadjusted OR 6. 8; 95 % CI 2. 5 – 18. 7), being treated without biopsy (unadjusted OR 23. 3; 95 % CI 6. 5 – 83. 7), and multiple surgical removals (unadjusted OR 6. 2; 95 % CI 2. 5 – 15. 5). All but provider specialty were independent predictors of delay. Attention to processes of care delivery for KC may have a greater impact on morbidity than efforts are earlier detection by the public...|$|R
30|$|For {{simulated}} anterior defects, {{the stress}} perfusion vector component on the y-axis (anterior-inferior direction) increased {{in proportion to}} the <b>defect</b> <b>size.</b> For the simulated lateral defects, the stress perfusion vector component on the x-axis (septal-lateral direction) decreased {{in proportion to the}} <b>defect</b> <b>size.</b> When comparing normal and abnormal patients, there was a statistically significant difference for the stress perfusion vector on the x-axis for apical and lateral defects; on the y-axis for apical, inferior, and lateral defects; and on the z-axis (basal-apical direction) for apical, anterior, and lateral defects. A significant difference was shown for the difference vector magnitude (stress/rest) between normal and ischemic patients (p[*]=[*] 0.001) but not for patients with infarction. The correlation between the <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> and stress vector magnitude was also found to be significant (p[*]<[*] 0.001).|$|R
40|$|Popcorning in {{electronic}} packages {{is driven by}} evaporated steam generated within defect during solder reflow process. Generated steam is confined in sealed defect volume creating a blister. Steam escapes when the blister is popped. The condition for popping is governed by the steam pressure and defect fracture resistance, the critical strain energy released rate, The quantity of steam generated within the defect {{is a function of}} the reflow condition as well as <b>defect</b> <b>size.</b> Analysis revealed that steam pressure is inversely proportional to <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> at fixed renew conditions. The resulting critical <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> is an exponential function of steam generation and critical strain energy released rate. Given a pre-existing defect, a small changes in steam generation can pop the defect. Low steam generation and strong interface which are water resistance will enhance popcorn resistance...|$|R
40|$|Al 2195 -T 8 plate {{specimens}} containing Friction Stir Welds (FSW), {{provided by}} Lockheed Martin, were inspected using directional conductivity measurements with the MWM sensor. Sensitivity to lack-of-penetration (LOP) <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> has been demonstrated. The feature {{used to determine}} <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> was the normalized longitudinal component of the MWM conductivity measurements. This directional conductivity component was insensitive {{to the presence of}} a discrete crack. This permitted correlation of MWM conductivity measurements with the LOP <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> as changes in conductivity were apparently associated with metallurgical features within the first 0. 020 in. of the LOP defect zone. Transverse directional conductivity measurements also provided an indication of the presence of discrete cracks. Continued efforts are focussed on inspection of a larger set of welded panels and further refinement of LOP characterization tools...|$|R
3000|$|Adhesion {{problems}} sometimes {{occur during}} {{the production of}} laminated wood products. To minimize such quality problems, {{there is a need}} for a nondestructive test that can provide continuous control of the process and the product. This study presents results from measurements performed to evaluate the potential of pulse thermography as a method to detect glue deficiency in laminated wood. <b>Defect</b> depth, <b>defect</b> <b>size,</b> and degree of glue deficiency have been varied. The surface layer was made of merbau (Intsia bijuga) and the substrate of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris). The results showed that pulse thermography is a promising tool for detecting glue deficiency underneath the thin laminated wood surface layers, mainly because of the short inspection time. Lack of glue with a minimum thermal <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> of 3 was detectable (thermal <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> is defined as the quotient of <b>defect</b> <b>size</b> and <b>defect</b> depth). The penetration depth was 1.0 [*]mm and the highest contrast, 0.62 °C, was achieved for one of the largest defects (24 [*]mm) below the thinnest (0.5 [*]mm) surface layer after 1 second. Starved glue joints showed about half the contrast compared to areas with total lack of glue.|$|R
