50|$|Between 1995 and 2004, {{the group}} enjoyed its most {{successful}} years to date. During this period, {{the highest and}} most difficult towers were achieved: descarregats (completely and successfully dismantled) the torre de nou amb folre i <b>manilles,</b> pilar de set amb folre, pilar de vuit amb folre i <b>manilles</b> (the first one in the 20th century), quatre de vuit amb l’agulla (the first one in the 20th century), quatre de nou amb folre i l’agulla (the first one in human tower history), cinc de nou amb folre, and tres and quatre de nou amb folre built simultaneously (the first - and only - time in human tower history). There were other successes, too. As for towers that were “only” carregats (reached the top but collapsed afterwards): the torre de vuit (the first one in the 20th century); quatre de nou, and the tres de deu amb folre i <b>manilles</b> (the first one in human towers history). The group also won the Tarragona Human Towers Competition in 1996, 1998, 2002, 2004 and 2006. In 2005 Castellers de Vilafranca achieved the torre de nou amb folre, which is considered the most difficult tower ever done by any group to date.|$|E

Three other teams depend on this core: the canalla team (responsible for the kids that crown the towers), the pinyes, folres and <b>manilles</b> team (responsible for the first, second and third bases), and the medical team. Each of them is also responsible for logistics, technical information and physical training, respectively.|$|E
