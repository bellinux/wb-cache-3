40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of Bank of Canada {{communications}} and media reporting on them on Canadian (short- and <b>medium-term)</b> <b>bond</b> and stock market returns using a GARCH model. Communications are rather uniformly distributed over the sample period (1998 - 2006); however, media coverage is particularly high during phases of increased uncertainty about the future course and timing of Canadian monetary policy. Official communications exert a larger influence on the bond market, whereas media coverage is more relevant for the stock market. In general, media filtering does not play a prominent role...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} evidence of cross-asset contagion among REIT, money, stock, bond, and currency {{markets in the}} US from 2006 to 2012, which covers the subprime and European sovereign debt crisis. We apply the Granger causality test and a vector auto-regression to examine the change of causality structure. Our results show that contagion exists from <b>medium-term</b> <b>bond</b> markets to equity markets; REIT, money markets and short-term bond markets show little evidence of cross-asset contagion with other markets; and the currency market shows high co-movement and contagion with equity markets. Our findings provide more rewarding asset reallocating strategies for the investors who invest in both bond and equity markets before a crisis to consider reallocating their portfolio into REIT and money markets to benefit from diversification during a crisis period...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative performance of bond interest income and stock dividend income. It {{has long been}} the recommendation of financial planners that bond income is the most appropriate investment income during retirement years. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove that in fact dividend income from stocks contains substantial growth properties that make it a more attractive income investment vehicle during retirement years. Past research has examined dividend yields in depth and comparisons of these yields to bond yields have also received some attention. However, little research has been done on the growth opportunities of dividend dollars over extended periods of time. To fill this void in the literature, this {{study examines}} a high-dividend yielding portfolio comprised of Canadian stocks over the years of 1980 - 1999. Its performance is then compared to long-term and <b>medium-term</b> <b>bond</b> portfolios, as well as to an aggregate (TSE 300) dividend portfolio. An additional comparison is made to a portfolio of banking stocks, as well as a buy-and-hold strategy. The period of 1957 - 1999 is also examined, however, only for the aggregate-dividend and bond portfolios. To aid in the evaluation sampling with replacement, a form of bootstrapping method, is performed. Using independent random draws from the population of returns an analysis of various holding periods is made for the dividend and bond portfolios. The results obtained from this thesis strongly favour dividend income over bond income. Examining investment horizons of 5, 10, and 20 years, yields the conclusion that due to comparatively significant growth properties, dividend income is comparatively more attractive than bond income, especially as the holding period is extended. Further, in many cases the variability in income obtained from the dividend portfolio is much lower in comparison to the bond portfolios. In this respect the findings here support the general consensus in the literature that dividends follow a smooth, consistent pattern. As an added bonus, the high-dividend portfolio also demonstrates substantial capital gain opportunities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{macroeconomic}} variables on the volatility of Treasury bond returns. By using principal components analysis, we extract the “real ” and “monetary ” macro factors from the real activities and monetary variables, respectively. We find that these macro factors {{have a significant impact}} on the volatility of Treasury bond returns. In particular, we find that the real activities affect the return volatility across all maturities, while the monetary variables are significantly related to the volatility of short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> only. The implication of these findings is that the policy makers can employ monetary policy to stabilize the fluctuation of short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds,</b> but need to take the real activities into account when stabilizing the fluctuation of long-term bonds...|$|R
40|$|Amid {{increasing}} regulation, {{structural changes}} {{of the market and}} Quantitative Easing as well as extremely low yields, concerns about the market liquidity of the Eurozone sovereign debt markets have been raised. We aim to quantify illiquidity risks, especially such related to liquidity dry-ups, and illiquidity spillover across maturities by examining the reaction to illiquidity shocks at high frequencies in two ways: a) the regular response to shocks using a variance decomposition and, b) the response to shocks in the extremes by detecting illiquidity shocks and modeling those as ultivariate Hawkes processes. We find that: a) market liquidity is more fragile and less predictable when an asset is very illiquid and, b) the response to shocks in the extremes is structurally different from the regular response. In 2015 long-term bonds are less liquid and the <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> are liquid, although we observe that in the extremes the <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> are increasingly driven by illiquidity spillover from the long-term titles...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{reprojection}} {{to develop}} a benchmark to assess ECB monetary policy since January 1999, the start of EMU. We first estimate an essentially affine term structure model for the German SWAP yield curve between 1987 : 04 - 1998 : 12. The German monetary policy is then reprojected onto the EMU period (1999 : 01 - 2001 : 08). We find that the German real interest rate in place during the EMU period is significantly lower {{than it would have}} been in case the Bundesbank were still in charge of monetary policy. We also show the effect of EMU on the German SWAP yield curve. Short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> seem to have been more affected than long-term bonds.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the international {{flow of funds}} associated with calm and volatile global equity markets. During calm periods, portfolio investment by real money and leveraged investors in advanced countries flows into emerging markets. When central banks in the receiving countries resist exchange rate appreciation and buy dollars against domestic currency, they end up investing in <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> in reserve currencies. In the process they fund themselves (or "sterilize" the expansion of local bank reserves) by issuing safe assets in domestic currency to domestic investors. Thus, calm periods, marked by leveraged investing in emerging markets, lead to an asymmetric asset swap (risky emerging market assets against safe reserve currency assets) and leveraging up by emerging market central banks. In declining and volatile global equity markets, these flows reverse, and, contrary to some claims, emerging market central banks draw down reserves substantially. In effect emerging market central banks then release safe assets from their reserves, supplying safe havens to global investors...|$|R
50|$|The {{financing}} {{structure of the}} public deficits had changed since the mid-1980s due to two factors. First, the easing of the PSBR and the government's determination to reduce the foreign debt/GDP ratio led to a sharp reduction in borrowing abroad.

40|$|Markets for debt {{securities}} {{exist in a}} comprehensive way in no Asian economy other than Japan, even though short or <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> have been issued in almost all and Asian borrowers are established (though not prolific) international issuers. The markets provide {{no more than a}} simple borrowing medium for governments, banks and some companies, while investor activity is closely correlated with banking sector credit creation. Above all, the region¡¦s unfinished markets provide no guard against crisis or contagion, nor act as a balance to banking systems that are susceptible to distortion and event risk. Insufficient effort has been made to encourage activity by institutional investors. This paper is concerned with markets for tradable {{debt securities}}; and with the value and appropriateness of structured finance techniques to expand general usage of Asia¡¦s debt markets. The paper examines the condition of the domestic and offshore debt capital markets for Asia-Pacific risk. It traces common patterns of development among the established and nascent public debt securities markets in the region, and looks at the dynamics that will affect these markets in the medium term. Last, it seeks to identify whether Asian markets can be made to accommodate continuous issuing and trading activity typical of advanced economies, and to consider the associated advantages and considerations. ...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{markets for}} debt {{securities}} exist comprehensively in no East Asian economy other than Japan, even though short or <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued in most and Asian borrowers are established (though generally not prolific) international issuers. Today¡¦s markets provide a borrowing medium (not always effectively) for Asian governments, {{financial institutions and}} some companies, but investor activity is closely correlated with bank credit creation. Above all, the region¡¦s markets provide no real guard against crisis or contagion, nor act as a balance to banking systems susceptible to distortion and event risk. Asia¡¦s economies may not suffer general capital shortages but poor resource allocation is pervasive and would be greatly improved by efficient national and regional financial markets. Seven years after its most profound financial crisis, Asia risks new contagion from any similar, unforeseen loss of confidence. Active debt capital markets would help limit such risks. The world¡¦s foremost bond markets developed {{as a result of}} intense national needs, and while economic growth will inevitably lead to greater bond issuance and trading this will be insufficient for the region¡¦s wider requirements without official sponsorship of active cooperative market reform. This paper contains three linked policy proposals: a matrix of steps to remove legal, fiscal, regulatory or systemic obstacles or omissions that hinder market usage; measures to encourage the development of a unified regional offshore market for local and major currency risk; and the concept of a regional body to promote the creation of asset-backed securities on a scale not previously contemplated and greatly expand activity in Asia¡¦s debt markets. ...|$|R
40|$|REAL BOND RATES {{increased}} {{sharply in}} the early 1980 s and have remained high since. Even today, {{in the midst of}} a world recession and low U. S. and Japanese short real rates, long real rates throughouthe world remain unusually high. Pessimists trace the high rates to a decrease in the supply of capital. They point to the long string of fiscal deficits and to the decline in household saving and warn of the disappearance of thrift. Optimists trace the high rates to an increase in the demand for capital and point to the high profit opportunities unleashed by the conservative revolutions of the 1980 s. These factors have surely played a role. But there is more at work, for consider the following fact: while expected real rates on bonds have indeed been high for more than a decade, expected real rates of return on stocks appear, if anything, to have declined slightly. This suggests that the focus should not only be on the increase in bond rates, but also on the simultaneous increase in bond rates and decrease in equity rates: on the decrease in the equity premium. This is the focus of this paper. In the first section, I construct expected real rates on short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>bonds</b> for a number of OECD countries from 1978 on, using commercial forecasts of inflation available at the time. I stop short of constructing expected real rates of return on stocks, but by looking at the underlying components, I argue that the 1980 s were indeed associated with a sharp decrease in the equity premium.

40|$|In {{this study}} we use the monthly excess holding period yields (EHPY), and their {{volatility}} for five government bond indices markets, {{in order to test}} the popular expectations theory of the term structure and to assess whether there are patterns in risk premia, which are common across these markets. For this reason, a GARCH-M model is used. The empirical results derived indicate that in most cases the Expectation Hypothesis is rejected and short <b>medium-term</b> government <b>bond</b> yields display serial correlation and co movement in the majority of the countries. Additionally, the term premia at the long end of the maturity structure are time varying in the USA, the UK and Canada. The risk factor is statistically significant as an explanatory variable for risk premia, only for 7 years maturity bonds in the USA and the UK. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} financial crisis on the integration of bond markets in the European Union (EU). The initial indicator is the average yield of <b>medium-term</b> government <b>bonds</b> in individual EU countries. Consequently, the 2005 – 2011 time period has been divided into two periods - before the financial crisis and during the financial crisis, and after the financial crisis. Furthermore, we have used the one-factor analysis of variance ANOVA and then compared the mean values in the indicated periods. In order for ANOVA to be carried out, first the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances of survey data have to be tested. Here we apply Shapiro-Wilk test for testing the normality and Bartlett's test for testing the homogeneity of variances. The result of the procedure is a statement that the integration of bond markets in the EU has been deepened, despite the financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the proxy, volatility-restriction (VR) and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches to implementing structural corporate bond pricing models, and documents that ML estimation {{is the best}} among the three implementation methods. Empirical studies using either the proxy approach or the VR method conclude that barrier-independent models significantly underestimate corporate bond yields. Although barrier-dependent models tend to overestimate the yield on average, they generate a sizable degree of underestimation. The present paper shows that the proxy approach is an upwardly biased estimator of the corporate assets and makes the empirical framework work systematically against structural models of corporate bond pricing. The VR approach may generate inconsistent corporate bond prices or may fail to give a positive corporate bond price for some structural models. When the Merton, LS, BD and LT models are implemented with ML estimation, we find substantial improvement in their performances. Our empirical analysis shows that the LT model is very accurate for predicting short-term bond yields, whereas the LS and BD models are good predictors for <b>medium-term</b> and long-term <b>bonds.</b> The Merton model however significantly overestimates short-term bond yields and underestimates long-term bond yields. Unlike empirical studies in the past, the Merton model implemented with ML estimation does not consistently underestimate corporate bond yields. ...|$|R
