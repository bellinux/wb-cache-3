50|$|A Magnetic Drilling Machine is a {{portable}} drilling machine with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> (either electromagnetic or permanent magnet). It uses standard twist drill bits, and some {{can also be}} used with annular cutters, milling cutters and other rotary cuttters.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>base</b> is {{a magnetic}} fixture {{based on a}} magnet that can effectively be turned [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] at will; they are often used in optics and metalworking, e.g., to hold a dial indicator.|$|E
50|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to bring material to the СNС machine it is time to use <b>Magnetic</b> (<b>Base)</b> Drilling Machine. With <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Base</b> it can be properly fixed on the metal. This base allows to make holes in horizontal position and even on ceiling. Usually for this machines is better to use cutters because they can drill much faster with less speed. Cutters sizes varies from 12 mm up to 200mm DIA and from 30 to 200mm DOC(depth of cut). This machines are widely used in construction, fabrication, marine and oil & gas industries. In oil and gas industry usually used pneumatic magnetic drilling machines to avoid sparks and special tube magnetic drilling machines that could be fixed on pipes of different sizes, even inside.|$|E

50|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> can {{therefore}} be attached {{in a variety of}} positions to any attractive surface, allowing the base to be positioned in the best orientation for the part to be tested. Combine this with the flexibility of movement allowed by the arms gives the operator a large range of options in positioning the dial indicator.|$|E
5000|$|Earnshaw's theorem {{does not}} allow for a static {{configuration}} of permanent magnets to stably levitate another permanent magnet or materials that are paramagnetic or ferromagnetic against gravity. This theorem does not apply to devices consisting of a properly configured <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> and corresponding magnetic top, however, because the non-static nature of the spinning top acts as a gyroscope to prevent its toroidal magnetic field from fully aligning itself {{in the same direction as}} that of the supporting opposing field of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> (i.e.: via the top flipping). This gyroscopic property combined with the top's precession allows it to respond dynamically to the direction of the local toroidally shaped field of its base magnet and remain levitating about a central point in space above the base where the forces acting on the top (gravitational, magnetic, and gyroscopic) are in equilibrium thereby allowing the top to rest in an energy minimum well. (see: magnetic levitation) ...|$|E

50|$|To make {{a hole in}} tube or pipe easily an annular cutter {{should be}} used with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> {{drilling}} machine and a tube/pipe clamping device. The tube clamping device is a metallic device which is clamped on the tube with an adjustable chain.

50|$|The toy top is {{essentially}} a permanent magnetic ring and corresponding <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> plate with a ring or alternate geometric configuration. Functional parameters, such as the top rotation rate or top weighting, are stringent. Employing principles of the magnetic field and gyroscopic stabilization, the Levitron top induces levitation {{through a series of}} interactive steps. The levitated top's stabilizing rotation undergoes natural, gradual slowing, so that the levitation phenomenon fails within four minutes unless external power is supplied to sustain rotation.|$|E

The kits were selected based on the method of extraction: Column-based, lysis only, solid-phase reverse binding, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>based</b> extraction. Kits were compared on the basis of resulting nucleic acid concentration, yield, protein and chemical contamination, and maximum amplifiable fragment length. The results {{of this study indicate that}} each type of kit has distinct advantages and a careful consideration should be given to ultimate experimental requirements prior to purchasing the kit...|$|R
40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the photoluminescence (PL) generated from the gold nanoshells of the dielectric-metal core-shell resonators (DMCSR) that support multipolar electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>based</b> cavity plasmon resonances. Significantly enhanced and modulated PL spectrum is observed. By comparing the experimental results with analytical Mie calculations, {{we are able to}} demonstrate that the observed reshaping effects are due to the excitations of those narrow-band cavity plasmon resonances. We also present that the variation on the dielectric core size allows for tuning the cavity plasmon resonance wavelengths and thus the peak positions of the PL spectrum...|$|R
40|$|A new method, <b>based</b> on a <b>magnetic</b> capture <b>based</b> DNA {{extraction}} {{followed by}} qPCR, {{was developed for}} the detection of the zoonotic parasite Echinococcus multilocularis in definitive hosts. Latent class analysis was used to compare this new method with the currently used phenol-chloroform DNA extraction followed by single tube nested PCR. In total, 60 red foxes and coyotes from three different locations were tested with both molecular methods and the sedimentation and counting technique (SCT) or intestinal scraping technique (IST). Though based on a limited number of samples, it could be established that the <b>magnetic</b> capture <b>based</b> DNA extraction followed by qPCR showed similar sensitivity and specificity as the currently used phenol-chloroform DNA extraction followed by single tube nested PCR. All methods have a high specificity as shown by Bayesian latent class analysis. Both molecular assays have higher sensitivities than the combined SCT and IST, though the uncertainties in sensitivity estimates were wide for all assays tested. The <b>magnetic</b> capture <b>based</b> DNA extraction followed by qPCR has the advantage of not requiring hazardous chemicals like the phenol-chloroform DNA extraction followed by single tube nested PCR. This supports the replacement of the phenol-chloroform DNA extraction followed by single tube nested PCR by the <b>magnetic</b> capture <b>based</b> DNA extraction followed by qPCR for molecular detection of E. multilocularis in definitive hosts...|$|R
5000|$|Though {{people use}} annular cutters on {{conventional}} drilling machines like radial drilling machines or pillar drilling machine, {{it is not}} recommended because these machines have very high RPM which creates high tool breakage risk for annular cutters as they are hollow unlike solid twist drills. It is always recommended to use an annular cutter or core drill with a magnetic core drilling machine (also called as magnetic drill, <b>magnetic</b> <b>base</b> drilling machine, etc.) as these machines are slower. A magnetic drilling machine is ideally made for using annular cutters.Different Shanks of Annular cutters: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of a Tri-Sonic pickup is unique. The coil is not held in a rigid shape on a bobbin, as in most guitar pickups, but engineered into an oval shape and fitted around the magnets, joined end-to-end by their magnetic attraction, and placed onto the flat metal specially engineered <b>magnetic</b> <b>base.</b> A cover is attached which fits over magnetic flanges running {{either side of the}} base. There are six holes in the pickup cover, through which can be seen a piece of black plastic which is glued to the inside. These are simply for appearance, not being any kind of pole piece.|$|E
50|$|To levitate the top, {{a plastic}} plate {{is placed on}} top of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>base,</b> and the top is spun on the plate at between 25-50 {{rotations}} per second (1500-3000 rpm). If too slow, the top falls over and slides off sideways; if too fast it does not orient itself to follow magnetic flux as it moves, and slides off. Since {{it can be difficult to}} spin the top fast enough by hand, Creative Gifts makes a battery-powered, hand held device to spin the top with an electric motor. Next, the plate is lifted by hand until, if conditions are right, the top rises above it to an equilibrium point. The top must also be weighted with washers of various sizes supplied in the kit. If too heavy it will not rise above the plate; if too light it flies off.|$|E
