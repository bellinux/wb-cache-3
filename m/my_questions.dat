2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not gone the way I had hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
60|$|Our {{interview}} {{was a long}} one. All <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> were answered fully and frankly.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>questions</b> led to nothing. The French boy knew no {{more about}} the stolen {{envelope}} than I did.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked a}} little startled at <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> but said nothing.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. You {{must answer}} {{accordingly}} to <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Don’t turn them away.|$|R
5000|$|But <b>my</b> <b>question</b> {{seemed to}} throw them both into a rage enormous." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST. Yes, I am. (Pointedly.) George, watch whether Crichton begins any of {{his answers}} to <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> with 'The fact is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cosmopolites always do. Now answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> What {{were you}} up to?' and Dare {{as he spoke}} played with the pistol again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can, at least, answer one of <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> more directly: Is this wind {{sufficiently}} favourable to {{pass the}} dangerous shoals of the Hatteras?" ...|$|E
5000|$|What is {{the answer}} to <b>my</b> <b>question</b> (என் கேள்விக்கு என்ன பதில்).(En Kelviku Enna Badhil) ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me as though in reproach at the levity of <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|The doctor did {{not answer}} <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Instead, he looked reproachfully at Alexander Abraham.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Brooks {{has been}} {{answering}} some of <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> {{about the poor}} people," [...] Sybil answered, [...] "and {{it is not an}} amusing subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my man," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> The truth mind, else--" [...] {{he touched the}} butt of a pistol significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That depends," [...] said I, sternly, [...] "upon {{whether you}} answer <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> without telling me a lie, {{as you did}} Captain Croker just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>question</b> {{brought her}} down {{suddenly}} from heaven to earth. [...] "Oh!" [...] she said reproachfully, [...] "I had his voice {{still in my}} ears--and now I have lost it! 'Who is he?'" [...] she added, after a moment; repeating <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> [...] "Nobody knows. Tell me--what is he like. Is he beautiful? He must be beautiful, with that voice!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Paracha: Your honor, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is {{that your}} {{executive}} order is applicable around the earth? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} curiously {{and kept his}} eyes fixed on me while he {{answered}} <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Please answer <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> Miss Smithers, and do {{not comment}} on them. How did you come, then, to submit {{yourself}} to such a disagreeable operation?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{could not}} be true, because up to then he had {{understood}} it perfectly; at least, he answered <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> exactly as if he did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Signore; {{have the}} {{goodness}} to answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> I called the felucca ze Ving-and-Ving; and I called myself le Capitaine Smeet; {{is it not}} true?" ...|$|E
60|$|If he did {{not answer}} <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> it at least seemed to suggest {{something}} to him.|$|R
5000|$|... § Mr. SAKLATVALA Will the Noble Lord {{allow me}} to dispel his {{dramatic}} performance? Does the Noble Lord understand <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> which does not put any blame or comment or criticism on the Judge at all? <b>My</b> <b>question</b> is that the Judge, who gave a right decision upon the case presented {{to him by the}} Government prosecutor, afterwards, by his judgment, said it was a wrong presentation.|$|R
60|$|A {{door opened}} softly behind me. Naomi herself {{appeared}} on the threshold; Naomi herself answered <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} her, and {{she closed}} the door behind her. She was dressed in a magnificent costume, her hair sparkling with diamonds, and I looked <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Be so good as {{to answer}} <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> simply, {{and do not}} make {{unnecessary}} remarks, sir. Was the drogue attached when the boat came up? Yes or no?" ...|$|E
60|$|I next {{proceed to}} colour, as {{specified}} in the third of <b>my</b> <b>questions,</b> and annex a selection from the returns classified on the same principle as in the preceding paragraph.|$|E
60|$|Benjamin started. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> was {{certainly}} a strange one, after what he had just said to me.|$|R
60|$|Marble {{looked at}} me in astonishment, though he clearly had glimpses of the object of <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|Old Ebbits {{looked at}} me in childlike wonder, while Zilla sneered openly at the absurdity of <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{not what}} I asked you," [...] shouted the consul, growing brave quite fast; [...] "answer <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> as I put them, or I'll {{find a way}} to make you." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{began to}} talk {{ourselves}} into a realisation of what our divergent futures might be. I came back {{on the evening of}} that day with <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> answered by a solicitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop one minute, if you please. <b>My</b> <b>questions</b> are these--Have you {{put an end}} to that acquaintance? And are {{you ready}} to give a promise that it shall never be resumed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Relieved, so far, I {{naturally}} {{asked what}} had happened. Penrose betrayed a marked embarrassment in answering <b>my</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
30|$|This is {{an answer}} to <b>my</b> <b>question</b> “What on earth is calling heng?” to a witch in Buffalo village.|$|R
60|$|I {{had feared}} that <b>my</b> <b>question</b> might irritate him. To my relief, {{he seemed to}} be {{diverted}} by it.|$|R
