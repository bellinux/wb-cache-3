30|$|Undoubtedly, <b>microenterprises</b> play a {{critical}} role in the development of the economy. Comprising a dominant share in the industry, <b>microenterprises</b> help to alleviate poverty and unemployment. However, the growth of <b>microenterprises</b> remains a global challenge. A number of scholars have attributed the growth of <b>microenterprises</b> to accessibility of finance; however, microfinancing is equally significant in the initiative of owners to expand. This study aims to examine how microfinancing mediates the effect of access to finance on the growth of <b>microenterprises.</b> A survey result from a dataset of 582 <b>microenterprises</b> from the Philippines was used for correlation, regression, and mediation analyses. The results suggest that the impact of access to finance on the growth of <b>microenterprises</b> is heightened when microfinancing is maximized. However, the owners’ preferences toward internal financing limit the ability to expand. Thus, the issue of stagnation is a result of the owners' isolation to external financing. The results highlight the need for a more holistic approach to enterprise growth than merely facilitating access to finance. The study recommends aspects such as literacy and competitiveness as factors other than access to capital as enablers of growth. The results may challenge policymakers to enhance the existing policy frameworks further and provide more skills-enhanced income opportunities. Further, an experimental research using an intervention may help discover how to overcome stagnancy of micro and small firms.|$|R

50|$|A {{micro-enterprise}} (or <b>microenterprise)</b> {{is generally}} {{defined as a}} small business employing nine people or fewer, and having a balance sheet or turnover less than a certain amount (e.g. 2,000,000 euros or PhP 3,000,000). The terms <b>microenterprise</b> and microbusiness have the same meaning, though traditionally when referring to a small business financed by microcredit the term <b>microenterprise</b> is often used. Similarly, when referring to a small, usually legal business that is not financed by microcredit, the term microbusiness (or micro-business) is often used. Internationally, most microenterprises are family businesses employing one or two persons. Most <b>microenterprise</b> owners are primarily interested in earning a living to support themselves and their families. They only grow the business when something in their lives changes {{and they need to}} generate a larger income. According to information found on the Census.gov website, microenterprises make up 95% of the 28 million US companies tracked by the census.|$|E

30|$|National {{development}} {{ignoring the}} contribution of <b>microenterprises</b> {{may not be possible}} as the majority of the enterprises of any country belong to this group. Therefore, identifying the factors that contribute to the performance of the <b>microenterprises</b> is an essential call in the academic arena of micro, small and medium enterprises. This study, thus, seeks the answer for the potential factors that contribute to the successes of the <b>microenterprises</b> in Malaysia. It is exposed that the age of the entrepreneurs, education, business training, demand for the product/service, availability of physical space for business expansion in the city area, availability of financing and sufficiency of secured amount of finance pose positive impacts on the growth whereas competition and the age of the enterprises negatively affect overall performance of the <b>microenterprises.</b> As the enterprises grow older their performance or the growth decreases; meaning that young firms perform better than older firms. Usually, competition is assumed to have positive impacts on the growth of the firms; however, in this study the sign for the coefficient of the competition is negative implying that the competition reduces the growth of <b>microenterprises</b> in Malaysia. This might be because of the reason that the most of the <b>microenterprises</b> are in their young stage to bear the competition. Education and training are found to be very important factors for the success of <b>microenterprises</b> in Malaysia. If the entrepreneurs are properly educated and are well trained off the performance of their enterprises must be higher. Market demands for the products/services are crucially important for the enterprises to grow. If the demand increases the growth of the enterprises will be higher. Access to sources of funds and sufficiency of the secured funds has positive impacts on the performances of the <b>microenterprises.</b> The results of this study provide insights to the policymakers and practitioners to create a congenial atmosphere for the <b>microenterprises</b> to grow. Factors such as education, training, fair competition, easy financing and sufficient supply of funds will boost the progress of <b>microenterprises.</b> More focuses should be placed for the young firms as they have the higher potential to grow and contribute to the national economic development.|$|R
