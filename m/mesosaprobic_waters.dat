40|$|The {{research}} of Trichoptera community was performed within {{the territory of}} the city of Niš on 10 localities. These localities have different physical and chemical characteristics ranging from hot springs to cold karst streams. Some of them are with a measurable human influence (in the city of Niš), while others are practically without it (Dušničko vrelo). A total number of 16 genera Trichoptera within 11 families were noted. Number of identified species was 20. It was determined that the highest species diversity is in localities with the least human influence. During this study, the presence of the species that has the status of a strictly protected species in Republic of Serbia was recorded. The largest number of localities belongs to β – <b>mesosaprobic</b> <b>waters.</b> It has been found that group Trichoptera is suitable for independent application in bioindicator purposes...|$|E
40|$|Usually stenobiotic {{species are}} used as hydrobiological {{indicators}} {{of the degree of}} pollution in natural waters. Cladocera are eurybiotic organisms, therefore their role as specific indicators of the water quality is considered to be insignificant. However, considering new methods Cladocera at present are more and more often used as indicators of oligo- and <b>mesosaprobic</b> <b>waters</b> {{as well as of the}} presence of considerable amounts of easily degradable organic matter. Work over many years on the biology of Polyphemus pediculus, this striking representative of the order Cladocera, convinced the author of the possibility of using this species not only as an indicator of water purity but also for the estimation of the degree of water pollution as well as of water characteristics such as colour, turbidity, oxgen content and chemical composition. P. pediculus is one of the most common and abundant species of planktonic crustaceans in shallow waters of reservoirs, rivers, lakes, ponds and temporary water bodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{engineers}} of {{the modern}} University City are constructing a graceful bridge, named PONTE OSWALDO CRUZ, that crosses {{a portion of the}} Guanabara Bay (Fig. 1). The work at west pillar stopped for 3 years (The concret structure in Est. 1). As it will be seen from n. º 1 — 5 of the fig. 1, Est. I, the base of the structure will have five underground boxes of reinforcement, but, to-day they are just like as five uncovered water ponds, until at present: May 1963. (Est. I — fig. 3, n. º 3 — pond n. º 3; A. — old level of the water; B. — actual level of the water; c. — green water; E. — mass of bloom of blue algae Microcystis aeruginosa). Soon after SW portion, as 5 cells in series, of the pillar abutments, and also the NE portion nearly opposite in the Tibau Mount will be filled up with earth, a new way will link Rio City and the University City. We see to day Est. I, fig. 1 — the grasses on the half arenous beach of the Tibau Point. These natural Cyperaceae and Gramineae will be desappear because of so a new road, now under construction, when completed will be 33 feet above the mean sea level, as high as the pillar, covering exactly as that place. Although rainfall was the chief source of water for these ponds, the first water (before meterorological precipitations of whatever first rain it might fall) was a common tap water mixed with Portland Cement, which exuded gradually through the pores of the concret during its hardenning process. Some data of its first cement water composition are on the chemical table, and in Tab. n. º 4 and "Resultado n. º 1 ". The rain — receiving surface of each pond were about 15 by 16 feet, that is, 240 square feet; when they were full of water, their depth was of 2 feet 3 ", having each pond about 4, 000 gallons. Climatic conditions are obviously similar of those of the Rio de Janeiro City: records of temperature, of precipitation and evaporation are seen on the graphics, figs. 2, 3, 4. Our conceptions of 4 phases is merely to satisfy an easy explanation thus the first phase that of exudation of concrete. We consider the 2 nd. phase formation of bacterian and cyanophycean thin pellicel. 3 rd. phase - dilution by rains, and fertilisation by birds; the 4 th phase - plankton flora and fauna established. The biological material arrived with the air, the rains, and also with contaminations by dusts; with big portion of sand, of earth, and leaves of trees resulted of the SW wind actions in the storming days (See - Est. I, fig. 3, G. - the mangrove trees of the Pinheiro Island). Many birds set down and rest upon the pillar structure, its faeces which are good fertilizers fall into the ponds. Some birds were commonly pigeons, black ravens, swallows, sparrows and other sea mews, moor hens, and a few sea birds of comparatively rare occurence. We get only some examples of tropical dust contaminated helioplankton, of which incipient observations were been done sparcely. See the systematic list of the species of plankters. Phytoplankters - Cyanophyta algae as a basic part for food of zooplankters, represented chiefly by rotiferse, water-fleas Moinodaphnia and other Crustacea: Ostracoda Copepoda and Insecta: Chironomidae and Culicidae larvae. The polysaprobic of septic irruptions have not been done only by heating in summer, and, a good reason of that, for example: when the fifth pond was in polysaprobic phase as the same time an alike septic phase do not happened into the 3 rd. pond, therefore, both were in the same conditions of temperature, but with unlike contaminations. Among the most important aquatic organisms used as indicatiors of pollution - and microorganisms of real importance in the field of sanitary science, by authorities of renown, for instance: PALMER, PRESCOTT, INGRAM, LIEBMANN, we choose following microalgae: a) The cosmopolite algae Scenedesmus quadricuada, a common indicator in mesosaprobio waters, which lives between pH 7, 0 and it is assimilative of NO[3 subscripted] and NH[4 subscripted]. b) Species of the genus Chlamydomonas; it is even possible that all the species of theses genus inhabit strong-mesosaprobic to polysaprobic waters when in massive blooms. c) Several species of Euglenaceae in fast growing number, at the same time of the protozoa Amoebidae, Vorticellidae and simultaneous with deposition of the decaying cells of the blue algae Anacystis cyanea (= Microcystis) when the consumed oxygen by organic matter resulted in 40 mg. L. But, we found, among various Euglenacea the cosmopolite species (Euglena viridis, a well known polysaprobic indicatior of which presence occur in septic zone. d) Analcystis cyanea (= M. aeruginosa) as we observed was in blooms increasing to the order of billions of cells per litter, its maximum in the summer. Temperatures 73 ºF to 82 ºF but even 90 ºF, the pH higher than 8. When these blue algae was joined to the rotifer Brachionus calyflorus the waters gets a milky appearance, but greenished one. In fact, that cosmopolite algae is used as a mesosaprobic indicator. Into the water of the ponds its predominance finished when the septic polysaprobic conditions began. e) Ankistrodesmus falcatus was present in the 5 th pond from 26 the. April untill the 26 th July, and when N. NH[4 subscripted] gets 1. 28 mg. L. and when chlorinity stayed from 0. 034 to 0. 061 mg. L. It never was found at N. NH[4 subscripted] higher than 1 mg. L. The green algae A. falcatus, an indicatior of pollution, lives in moderate <b>mesosaprobic</b> <b>waters.</b> f) As everyone knows, the rotifer eggs may be widely dispersed by wind. The rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli in our observation seemed like a green colored bag, overcharged by green cells and detritus, specially into its spacious stomach, which ends blindly (the intestine, cloaca, being absent). The stock of Asplanchna in the ponds, during the construction of the bridge "PONTE OSWALDO CRUZ" inhabits alkaline waters, pH 8, 0 a 8, 3, and when we observed we noted its dissolved oxygen from 3. 5 to 4 mg. L. In these ponds Asplanchna lived in 0, 2 P. PO[4 subscripted]. (Remember the hydobiological observations foreign to braslian waters refer only from 0. 06 to 0, 010 mg. L. P. PO[4 subscripted]; and they refer resistance to 0. 8 N. NH[4 subscripted]). By our data, that rotiger resist commonly to 1. 2 until 1. 8 mg. L. N. NH[4 subscripted]; here in our ponds and, when NO[2 subscripted] appears Asplanchna desappears. It may be that Asplanchna were devoured by nitrite resistant animals of by Culicidae or other mosquitoes devoured by Due to these facts the number and the distribution of Asplanchna varies considerabley; see - plates of plankton successions. g) Brachionus one of the commonest members of class Rotatoria was frquently found in abundance into the ponds, and we notice an important biological change produce by the rotifer Brachonus colyciflorus: the occurence of its Brachionus clayciflorus forms pallas, is rare in Brazil, as we know about this. h) When we found the water flea MOinodaphnia we do not record simultanous presence of the blue algae Agmenellun (= Merismopedia) ...|$|E
