25|$|The Labour-led {{government}} under Helen Clark from 1999 to 2008 pursued a programme of public broadcasting reforms. New Zealand's wide-ranging adoption of neoliberal {{policies in the}} mid-1980s and 1990s had large sections of the state sector privatised. As a state owned enterprise, TVNZ enjoyed enormous commercial success (sustaining two-thirds of the overall audience share) and paid the Crown substantial dividends (over $250million between 1989 and 1999). However, the commercial success had been achieved through an unabashed pursuit of ratings through populist and tabloid content, and prior to the 1999 election the National-led government was evidently positioning TVNZ for privatisation Labour-led administrations since 1999 explicitly recognised the <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> of a wholly commercial broadcasting sector (e.g. saturation-level advertising, low levels of local content, heavy reliance on cheap imports and a disregard for quality genres and in-depth news and current affairs) and re-emphasised television's cultural and democratic functions in their policy thinking.|$|E
25|$|While {{popular with}} the electorate, Trudeau's promised minor reforms {{had little effect on}} the growing rate of inflation, and he {{struggled}} with conflicting advice on the crisis. In September 1975 the popular Finance Minister John Turner resigned over a perceived lack of support in countervailing measures. In October 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister Donald Macdonald introduced wage and price controls by passing the Anti-Inflation Act. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted a Supreme Court reference that only upheld the legislation as an emergency requiring Federal intervention under the British North America Act. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with CTV, Trudeau discussed the economy, citing <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly neoliberal business leaders.|$|E

[...] "The derivation of these results in general form {{has been one of the}} major achievements of postwar economic theory", wrote Guesnerie.

A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment.

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, {{as well as}} better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must {{bear the burden of}} financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed [...] "living wills" [...] which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.|$|E

40|$|From <b>Market</b> <b>Failure</b> Paradigm to an Institutional Theory of Environmental Governance - This {{manuscript}} {{examines how}} an institutional theory of environmental governance might {{be based on}} a re-interpretation and re-working of the arguments of the <b>market</b> <b>failure</b> paradigm and its main criticisms. The manuscript first examines in detail the arguments of the <b>market</b> <b>failure</b> paradigm regarding externalities and public goods, as well as their criticisms. The paper then suggests an institutional re-interpretation and revision of the key arguments of the <b>market</b> <b>failure</b> paradigm. The institutional theory of environmental governance acknowledges the interdependence of economic actors and the resulting fundamental role of conflicts as the rationale for environmental governance and its institutions. As environmental conflicts are primarily a matter of distribution rather than of efficiency, it becomes important to understand the likely consequences of institutional alternatives in the specific socio-economic and physical setting of the environmental conflicts, {{and the degree to which}} these consequences match with the pertinent social or economic goals.

2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of models of {{imperfect}} and asymmetric information, the traditional neoclassical economics literature had assumed that markets are efficient except for some limited and well defined <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> More recent work by Stiglitz and others reversed that presumption, to assert {{that it is only}} under exceptional circumstances that markets are efficient. Stiglitz has shown (together with Bruce Greenwald) that [...] "whenever markets are incomplete and/or information is imperfect (which are true in virtually all economies), even competitive market allocation is not constrained Pareto efficient". In other words, they addressed [...] "the problem of determining when tax interventions are Pareto-improving. [...] The approach indicates that such tax interventions almost always exist and that equilibria in situations of imperfect information are rarely constrained Pareto optima."

40|$|One {{can expect}} economists and {{philosophers}} {{to have very}} different reactions to this question. Economists are preoccupied with <b>market</b> <b>failure</b> as inefficiency, that is, the <b>failure</b> of <b>markets</b> to produce Pareto optimal outcomes, but they typically are not sensitive to the distributive impact of <b>market</b> <b>failure.</b> Political philosophers, on the other hand, {{tend to have a}} well-defined position on questions of distributive justice that arise as a result of market activity, yet they still often treat “the market ” as a black box and therefore lack a clear conception of, among others things, <b>market</b> <b>failure.</b> This complementary focus of the two disciplines suggests that they have a lot to learn from each other.

2500|$|In economics, {{a market}} economy is {{sometimes}} said to be self-organizing.

Friedrich Hayek coined the term catallaxy to describe a [...] "self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation", {{in regards to the}} spontaneous order of the free market economy. Neo-classical economists hold that imposing central planning usually makes the self-organized economic system less efficient. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, economists consider that <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> are so significant that self-organization produces bad results and that the state should direct production and pricing. Most economists adopt an intermediate position and recommend a mixture of market economy and command economy characteristics (sometimes called a mixed economy).

2500|$|Alexander Rüstow, a German economist, first {{proposed}} the German variant of economic social liberalism. In 1932, {{speaking at the}} Social Policy Association he applied the label [...] "neoliberalism" [...] {{to this kind of}} social liberalism, although that term now carries a meaning different from the one proposed by Rüstow. Rüstow wanted an alternative to socialism and to the classical liberal economics developed in the German Empire. In 1938, Rüstow met with a variety of economic thinkers—including the likes of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek and William Roepke—to determine how liberalism could be renewed. Rüstow advocated a strong state to enforce free markets and state intervention to correct <b>market</b> <b>failures.</b> However, Mises argued that monopolies and cartels operated because of state intervention and protectionism and claimed that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. He viewed Rüstow's proposals as negating market freedom and saw them as similar to socialism.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{competitive}} markets, as {{understood in}} formal economic theory, rely on much {{larger numbers of}} both buyers and sellers.

As an argument against such a logic {{there is a second}} view that suggests that the source of <b>market</b> <b>failures</b> is inside the market system itself, therefore the removal of other interfering systems would not result in markets with a structure of perfect competition. As an analogy, such an argument may suggest that capitalists don't want to enhance the structure of markets, just like a coach of a football team would influence the referees or would break the rules if he could while he is pursuing his target of winning the game. Thus according to this view, capitalists are not enhancing the balance of their team versus the team of consumer-workers, so the market system needs a [...] "referee" [...] from outside that balances the game.
