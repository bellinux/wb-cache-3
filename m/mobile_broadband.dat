30|$|Recently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} yet challenging demand on <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications for high-speed trains. In this article, cognitive Doppler spread compensation algorithms are proposed for high-speed rail <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications, which {{make use of the}} dedicated radio environment map (REM) for railway to compensate the time-varying Doppler spread. The dedicated REM for high-speed rail {{can be viewed as a}} spatial-temporal database consisting of the radio channel parameters along a given railway. The performance of the proposed Doppler spread compensation algorithms are evaluated with a typical OFDM-based <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> system. Simulation results show that the link-level performance of high-speed rail <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications can be improved significantly due to the REM-enabled radio channel condition awareness and the cognitive Doppler spread compensation algorithms. The REM-based cognitive radio approach presents a new paradigm for systems design of high-speed rail <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications.|$|R

30|$|The rest of {{this article}} is {{organized}} as follows. In the following section, we first review the key challenges encountered by the high-speed rail <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications, and then bring forward the system architecture of the proposed cognitive <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communication systems. In Section “REM-based cognitive Doppler spread compensation algorithms”, two types of REM-based Doppler spread compensation algorithms are presented. The ICI due to Doppler spread is modeled for OFDM-based <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications, which is instrumental for the development of cognitive Doppler spread compensation algorithms and link-level performance analysis. In Section “Link-level simulations of high-speed rail <b>broadband</b> <b>mobile</b> communications”, the simulated performances of the proposed algorithms are discussed. Finally, we summarize this article in the last section.|$|R

25|$|Everything Everywhere {{announced}} on 22 August 2012 {{that it would}} introduce a third brand {{as part of a}} future 4G launch to sit alongside Orange and T-Mobile, and that Everything Everywhere would continue as the company's legal name. Further speculation commenced on 7 September 2012 when the company announced details of a press conference on the morning of 11 September 2012, the earliest date set by Ofcom to launch 4G services. It was also noted that this date was only 24 hours earlier than the expected launch of the latest generation of iPhone (the iPhone 5), thereby arousing suspicion that the new iPhone would support 4G and that Everything Everywhere would launch its service on this widely anticipated handset. Other commentators suggested that the HTC One XL would be the first handset to launch utilising Everything Everywhere's 4G network. The handsets that the company initially launched on EE are the iPhone 5 (iOS), HTC One XL (Android), Samsung Galaxy S III (Android), Samsung Galaxy NoteII (Android), Huawei Ascend P1 (Android), Nokia Lumia 920 (Windows Phone), Nokia Lumia 820 (Windows Phone).
