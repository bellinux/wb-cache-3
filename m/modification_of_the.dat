5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E

It shall not feature any weaving, similar to the Bosiljevo2 interchange of the A1 and A6 motorways.|$|E

5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} can {{be added}} by a simple <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{investment}} in the project by the bank, the developers successfully sought <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original planning approval by the Perth City Council to allow {{the use of the}} Palace Hotel as a bank, rather than remaining as a public hotel. With this permission, construction of the development by Multiplex proceeded, and floor space was leased rapidly; by October 1985 only four floors of the building remained for lease and it was expected to be fully let before completion.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{funding for}} the {{development}} of Escape from Woomera came from the Australian government's arts funding organisation, the Australia Council for the Arts.

While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding. The playable demo, which was built as a <b>modification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video game Half-Life, was made available for download on the game's website.|$|E
