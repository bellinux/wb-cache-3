5|$|Following a {{government}} decree on 20October Oerip became subordinate {{to both the}} acting <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> Soeljoadikoesoemo and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces Soeprijadi. However, neither man showed up to assume his duties. Soeprijadi, a PETA soldier who had led an uprising against Japanese forces in Blitar in February 1945, was thought dead. While Soeljohadikosomo's position remained unfilled, the guerrilla leader Moestopo declared himself <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defence.</b> As such, Oerip had little oversight and felt pressured to quickly establish a stable command structure. On 2November, he appointed leaders for military operations {{in various parts of}} the country: Didi Kartasasmita for western Java, Soeratman for central Java, Mohammad for eastern Java, and Soehardjo Hardjowardojo for Sumatra; each of these sub-commanders was given the rank of major general. Oerip also began appropriating weapons to different TKR commands. He took confiscated Japanese weapons from well-equipped forces and distributed them as needed. However, the results were less successful than he had hoped. PETA had been organised locally during the Japanese occupation, and as such its members were unable to accept a centralised leadership.|$|E
