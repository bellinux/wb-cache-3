5000|$|Jo Boaler {{began her}} career as a {{secondary}} mathematics teacher in urban London secondary schools, including Haverstock School, Camden. After her early career in secondary mathematics education, Boaler received a Master's degree in Mathematics Education from King's College London with distinction in 1991. She completed her PhD in mathematics education at the same university and won the award for best PhD in education from the British Educational Research Association in 1997. In 1998, Jo Boaler became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics Education at Stanford University in the Graduate School of Education. She gained tenure in 2001 and became a full professor there in 2006. From 2000 to 2004, Boaler served {{as the president of the}} International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education. In January 2007, she was awarded the Marie Curie Foundation Chair of Excellence [...] at Sussex University. After three years in this post, in 2010 she returned to Stanford and resumed her position as Professor of Mathematics Education. In 2013, Boaler taught the first <b>Massive</b> <b>Online</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Course</b> (MOOC) on mathematics education, called “How to Learn Math”. Its purpose was to educate teachers and parents about a new way of teaching math in order to help students overcome their fear of math while improving their academic performance. Over 40,000 teachers and parents participated, with about 25,000 completing the full 2-to-16-hour course. [...] At the end of course, 95% of survey respondents indicated that they would modify their ways of teaching math. Boaler also provides consultation to other Silicon Valley digital educational institutions, such as Novo-ed, Inner Tube Games, and Udacity. In addition, she teaches workshops on teaching for a growth mindset, drawing upon the work of Carol Dweck, author and developer of the theory of growth mindset.|$|E

But they suffer from low completion rates. This paper identifies disorganization as a factor behind failure to complete a MOOC. Students who enroll one day late are 17 percentage points less likely to earn a certificate than students who enroll exactly on time. This reflects selection, but it does seem to be related to demographic characteristics, motivation to complete the course, or ability. This suggests that building in even more structure in the MOOC could be a factor in improving performance...|$|R

On one hand, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model infers topics from content given in a college course syllabus. On the other hand, topics are also extracted from a <b>massive</b> <b>online</b> <b>open</b> <b>course</b> (MOOC) syllabus. These two sets of topics and grading information are matched using a content based recommendation system so as to recommend relevant online courses to students.
