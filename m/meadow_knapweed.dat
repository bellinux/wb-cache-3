50|$|A {{colourful}} {{variety of}} flowers {{may be seen}} throughout spring and summer. These include cuckoo flower, marsh-marigold, great burnet, meadowsweet, common <b>knapweed,</b> <b>meadow</b> vetchling, marsh ragwort, meadow buttercup, sorrel, ragged-robin, reed canary-grass, sweet vernal-grass and meadow brome. The wet conditions encourage many sedges including brown sedge, oval sedge, yellow sedge and carnation sedge. The slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) grows in this meadow which is rare in Gloucestershire.|$|R
50|$|The site is an {{alluvial}} meadow {{next to the}} River Ray in the Vale of Aylesbury. It has clay soil and is liable to flooding. A regime of a hay cut followed by cattle grazing, {{without the use of}} artificial fertilisers, has resulted in a diverse grassland habitat now rare in England. Herbs include <b>meadow</b> buttercup, lesser <b>knapweed</b> and devil's bit scabious. Ditches and the riverbank provide a permanently wet habitat, encouraging wading birds such as snipe and curlew. Invertebrates include damselflies.|$|R
40|$|<b>Meadow</b> <b>Knapweed</b> (Centaurea jacea x nigra) is a {{perennial}} plant that grows from a woody root crown. It is a fully fertile hybrid of Brown Knapweed (C. jacea) and Black Knapweed (C. nigra), and individuals can closely resemble either parent or may combine the characteristics randomly. The upright stems range from 20 to 40 inches tall, branching near the middle. Leaves grow to 6 {{inches long and}} 1 inches wide, edges are highly variable, ranging from smooth and entire to having lobes or teeth. Flowers are rose-purple, rising from round heads {{about the size of}} a nickel. Distinctive bracts surround the flower base, papery and rounded or dark and fringed, usually with both characteristics. In Thurston County, flowering can begin as early as May, with peaks in June and July. Flowering can continue into fall, especially on plants that have been mowed or damaged.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Centaurea solstitialis L. (yellow starthistle) and C. × moncktonii Britt. (<b>meadow</b> <b>knapweed)</b> {{are members}} of the genus Centaurea in the Asteraceae family. Both species have become serious {{management}} concerns as invasive species in North America, often displacing native vegetation and costing land managers millions of dollars to eradicate. Seven plants were found in southwestern Oregon that appear to be hybrids between C. solstitialis and C. × moncktonii. These plants were identified as hybrids based on bract shape, flower color, and the presence of the putative parent species at the same sites. Hybridization between these two species may present potential management problems, such as the hybrids developing into a viable species or gene flow between the parent species. <b>Meadow</b> <b>knapweed</b> originated through hybridization and colonized a larger range than either of its parent species. If hybrids produce viable pollen or fertile seed, backcrossing with one of the parent species could transfer alleles from one parent species to the other. Hybrids have the potential to transgress parent species for some traits and show increased fitness relative to the parent species. The putative C. solstitialis × C. moncktonii hybrids were identified based primarily on intermediate morphological traits. To test the hypothesis that these species can produce hybrids, controlled crosses between yellow starthistle and <b>meadow</b> <b>knapweed</b> were attempted. These crosses produced thirty hybrids that fit the morphological description used by Roché and Susanna (2010) to identify plants as C. solstitialis × C. moncktonii hybrids. The hybrids generated from the controlled crosses germinated from seeds that came from yellow starthistle plants. Genome size, measured using flow cytometry, and four quantifiable morphological characters were measured on the putative hybrids, hybrids generated through controlled crossing, and the parent species. When the group means were compared, {{there was no significant difference}} between the putative hybrids and the hybrids generated through controlled crossing for any of the characters. Both putative and artificial hybrids were backcrossed with the parent species to determine the likelihood of backcrossing. Backcrossing did occur, with the hybrids serving as both maternal parent and pollen parent at very low rates (< 1 %). Management of the hybrid should focus on prevention of pollination in order to prevent introgression between the parent species...|$|E
40|$|The knapweeds {{comprise}} a diverse complex {{of species that}} predominantly infest rangelands in the western United States and Canada. This manual considers the biological control of six species of knapweeds: 1) spotted knapweed, 2) diffuse knapweed, 3) squarrose knapweed, 4) <b>meadow</b> <b>knapweed,</b> 5) black knapweed, and 6) brown knapweed. Spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe, {{is perhaps the most}} widespread species, followed in abundance by diffuse knapweed, C. diffusa. A third species, squarrose knapweed, C. virgata var. squarrosa, has a more limited distribution in the West. Three less widespread species, meadow (C. pratensis), brown (C. jacea) and black knapweed (C. nigra), are host to some of the same biocontrol agents and thus are included. Another well known species is Russian knapweed, Acroptilon repens (formerly known as C. repens). While a serious rangeland weed itself, Russian knapweed is not considered in this manual because it is sufficiently different from the other knapweeds to be considered separately and it has a unique complex of biocontrol agents...|$|E
50|$|The meadows {{support a}} show of {{thousands}} (estimated at 45,000) of green-winged orchid in May, a colony of some size {{in this part of}} Gloucestershire. Also flowering in the late spring are common twayblade, adder's-tongue, cowslip, bluebell, and pignut. Taller grass and flowers develop over the summer and produce a haycrop at that time. Recordings include quaking-grass, common <b>knapweed,</b> <b>meadow</b> vetchling, downy oat-grass, field scabious, meadow buttercup, yellow-rattle, oxeye daisy, common bird's-foot trefoil, goat's-beard, fairy flax and Devil's-bit scabious. Meadow saffron flowers following the hay cut.|$|R
