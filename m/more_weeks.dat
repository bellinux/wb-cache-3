5|$|Ewbank {{maintained}} through {{training camp}} that second-year Mike Taliaferro was the number-one quarterback and disappointed a sellout crowd at Houston's Rice Stadium by keeping Namath {{on the bench}} at the Jets' season opener. Ewbank felt that Namath might not be ready for several <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> but Werblin intervened. Namath saw his first regular season action in the AFL the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs (the former Dallas Texans), and he was starting quarterback the following week against the Buffalo Bills. Namath's performance was inconsistent as he gained pro experience, but he was named AFL Rookie of the Year. The Jets finished the season 5–8–1 again. Beginning in 1966, the Jets began to improve on the field behind Namath, who led them to a 6–6–2 record. That season, the NFL and AFL announced a merger, which would be effective in 1970. A championship game (it {{came to be known}} as the Super Bowl), played between the two league champions, would follow each season until the merger took place.|$|E
5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b> Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E

5|$|The regiment, {{along with}} the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division, {{remained}} in and around Trieste for several weeks to counter the presence of the partisans, who had laid claim to the city. It was not until mid-June that the partisans withdrew from the city. It would be several <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before it was determined by the New Zealand government that the division would not be required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations. However, the longest serving men of the regiment had been steadily returning to New Zealand on furlough since early 1944, and most were not required to come back to active service. By the end of August, the last elements of the regiment had withdrawn from Trieste to wintering positions near Florence. In mid-September, it was decided to send the latest reinforcement drafts, then assembling in New Zealand, to Japan to serve as an occupation force (Jayforce) and that the men of 20th Armoured Regiment would not be required. This accelerated the demobilisation process and accordingly the regiment was officially disbanded on 2 December 1945.|$|E
