40|$|This {{paper has}} {{investigated}} {{the way the}} dissertation writing component of MA TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) programmes in Iran {{has changed over the}} past decade in relation to globalization. The data, collected from 40 questionnaires completed by Iranian academic staff teaching these programmes, suggest that while change in the content and curriculum has been minimal, some major shifts are observed in the functions <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> serve. The most fundamental change reported is that dissertations are now seen in this local context as an opportunity to respond to the global trend of publish or perish. The analysis of the data demonstrates a complex picture of how global trends, national higher education policies and regulations and the local initiatives interact with one another to turn <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> into a source of research publications...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} a methodology for finding metaphors in corpora. The procedure {{is based on}} the wish that, without a prior list of metaphors, the computer would provide a number of possible metaphor candidates. The methodology works by selecting an initial pool of word types in the corpus, finding shared collocates between pairs of those words and then computing a semantic distance measure for those word pairs which have a requisite number of mutual collocates. Cases which satisfy these criteria were then concordanced and interpreted. This methodology was applied to a corpus of <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> in Applied Linguistics, completed in Brazil. The paper highlights the importance of the use of metaphors by novice Applied Linguistic researchers...|$|R
2500|$|The {{identity}} of the architect as Thomas Parlby, the uncle of Lady Anne Pole and business partner of her father the self made magnate James Templer, was first discovered by Maureen Turner in her 1999 <b>MA</b> <b>dissertation.</b> The identity had eluded both Pevsner and Bridie, the principal historian of [...] the two buildings. Pevsner had written [...] "One {{would like to know}} the architect of this handsome late Palladian composition of 1787". Whilst at Antony House in Cornwall researching the Pole family Turner inspected closely the roll of paper held in the right hand of Sir John Pole the builder in his portrait, and discovered thereon drawn a partial plan of the new house with the following words written beneath: [...] "Plan of Shute House built by Sir John William De la Pole Bt. July 1787, T. Parlby Esqr. Archt." [...] Thomas Parlby (1727–1802) was of humble origins, the son of John Parlby of Chatham, Kent [...] or possibly from Gravesend. He was for all of his adult life one of a trio of business partners with John Line and James Templer (1722–1782), in the business of constructing dockyards, generally under government contract.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the rhetorical stru cture of {{introductory}} sections in Brazilian and German <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> {{from the field of}} linguistics. The analysis is based on the CARS (“Create a Research Space”) model proposed by  Swales (1990) for examining introductions in English research papers. We also resort to Hutz (1997), who applies Swales’ CARS model and compares English and German research papers from the discipline of psychology, and compare Brazilian with German text production (case study). The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether Brazilian and German MA dissertations  follow the same schematic patterns. Do the differences hold across the two cultures and differe nt disciplines? To what extend can we talk about a ‘universal academic discourse’, as Widdowson (1979) claims?</p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} English abstracts of <b>MA</b> and PhD <b>dissertations</b> published in Turkish language and identifying translation errors and problems concerning academic style and discourse. In this study, a random selection of <b>MA</b> and PhD <b>dissertation</b> abstracts {{both from the}} dissertations of Turkish speaking researchers and English-speaking researchers were used. The corpus consists of 90 abstracts of <b>MA</b> and PhD <b>dissertations.</b> The abstracts of these dissertations were analyzed in terms of problems stemming from translation issues and academic discourse and style. The findings indicated that Turkish-speaking researchers rely on their translation skills while writing their abstracts in English.

40|$|The {{neglect of}} {{acknowledgements}} in the EAP literature is perhaps surprising given their {{importance in the}} scholarly communication process. While unrelated to the important academic goals of establishing claims and reputations, {{the significance of this}} optional genre is confirmed by its widespread use and the role it plays in the academic practice of reciprocal gift giving. Acknowledgements are almost universal in dissertation writing where they provide writers with a unique rhetorical opportunity not only to convey their genuine gratitude for the intellectual and personal assistance they have received in completing their research, but also to promote a competent scholarly identity by displaying their immersion in scholarly networks, their active disciplinary membership, and their observance of the valued academic ideals of modesty, gratitude and appropriate self-effacement. This paper discusses the importance of this genre and examines the generic structure of the acknowledgements accompanying 240 PhD and <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> written by non-native speakers of English in a variety of disciplines at five Hong Kong universities. © 2003 The American University.

40|$|Noun phrase (NP) {{centered}} {{structures are}} distinctive syntactic devices in academic discourse. The commonly employed subordination-based complexity measures cannot adequately capture {{the development of}} syntactic complexity of noun phrases expected of advanced student academic writing (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011). Following the call for more {{research in this area}} (e. g. Lu, 2011, p. 57), the current study compared noun phrase complexity in two corpora: one is a corpus of <b>MA</b> <b>dissertations</b> written by Chinese EFL students and the other comprises published research articles in applied linguistics journals. The study examined overall noun phrase complexity using an automatic syntactic complexity analyzer and specifically identified features of one aspect of NP complexity: NP postmodification. The quantitative results were further contextualized in a textual analysis of excerpts from the two corpora for demonstrating the significance of NP complexity to the establishment of discourse coherence. Results of the analyses showed significant underdevelopment of NP postmodification complexity in student writing relative to published texts, meanwhile explicating the circumstances under which the difference is meaningful. Implications of the findings for the teaching of EFL academic writing were also discussed. Department of Englis...|$|R

40|$|A {{quick glance}} at the multi-authored and diverse table of {{contents}} of Irish Studies in Brazil might initially disconcert the prospective reader as to the rationale behind {{the inclusion of the}} thirty miscellaneous contributions that make up the collection. A careful perusal, though, will reveal that the book charts the fruitful cultural dialogue established by the University of São Paulo (USP), and other Brazilian universi-ties, with Irish Studies in the widest sense of the term. The articles cover Ireland’s cultural heritage as well as the long list of living writers and academic scholars from Ireland and abroad that have visited Brazil and lectured on the subject over the last twenty-five years. Originally emanating from the centre of the Postgraduate Programme of Estudios Lingüísticos e Literários em Inglês at USP set up in 1980, interest and research in Irish Studies have developed exponentially, as testified to by the establishment of the Associação Brasileira de Estudos Irlandeses (ABEI) in 1988, the publication of the ABEI Journal – The Brazilian Journal of Irish Studies since 1999, the organisation of the 2002 conference of the International Association for the Study of Irish Literatures (IASIL) and a solid corpus of academic research including books on George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Sean O’Casey, Sean O’Faolain and John Banville.
