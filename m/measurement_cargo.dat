40|$|Efficient and {{accurate}} protein localization {{is essential to}} cells and requires protein-targeting machineries to both effectively capture the cargo in the cytosol and productively unload the cargo at the membrane. To understand how these challenges are met, we followed the interaction of translating ribosomes during their targeting by the signal recognition particle (SRP) using a site-specific fluorescent probe in the nascent protein. We show that initial recruitment of SRP receptor (SR) selectively enhances the affinity of SRP for correct cargos, thus committing SRP-dependent substrates to the pathway. Real-time <b>measurement</b> of <b>cargo</b> transfer from the targeting to translocation machinery revealed multiple factors that drive this event, including GTPase rearrangement in the SRP–SR complex, stepwise displacement of SRP from the ribosome and signal sequence by SecYEG, and elongation of the nascent polypeptide. Our results elucidate how active and sequential regulation of the SRP–cargo interaction drives efficient and faithful protein targeting...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNumerous endocytic {{accessory}} proteins (EAPs) mediate {{assembly and}} maturation of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) into cargo-containing vesicles. Analysis of EAP function through bulk <b>measurement</b> of <b>cargo</b> uptake has been hampered due to potential redundancy among EAPs and, as we show here, the plasticity and resilience of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Instead, EAP function is best studied by uncovering {{the correlation between}} variations in EAP association to individual CCPs and the resulting variations in maturation. However, most EAPs bind to CCPs in low numbers, making the measurement of EAP association via fused fluorescent reporters highly susceptible to detection errors. Here, we present a framework for unbiased measurement of EAP recruitment to CCPs and their direct effects on CCP dynamics. We identify dynamin and the EAP-binding α-adaptin appendage domain of the AP 2 adaptor as switches in a regulated, multistep maturation process and provide direct evidence for a molecular checkpoint in CME...|$|R
40|$|The UNCTAD Code {{of conduct}} for Liner Conferences entered into force in 1983. The Code 2 ̆ 7 s cargo {{allocation}} scheme or 2 ̆ 740 - 40 - 20 rule 2 ̆ 7 aims to provide shipping lines {{of developing countries}} with a fair change {{to compete for the}} carriage of their seabourne trade. However, the Code has not been effective in meeting its stated objectives for a variety of reasons. Amongst the administrative difficulties are (i) the complications introduced by the EEC 2 ̆ 7 s Brussels Package, (ii) the definition of national lines, (iii) the unit of <b>measurement</b> for <b>cargo</b> allocation purposes, and (iv) the monitoring of cargo movements. The tremendous growth in non-conference container traffic {{over the last two decades}} has undermined the conference liner trade and therefore the importance of the Code 2 ̆ 7 s cargo sharing arrangement. It is thus, for all practical purposes, a dead letter...|$|R
50|$|The NYPOE {{was by far}} {{the largest}} of the Army Ports of Embarkation and at the close of 1944, aside from the {{embarkation}} camps, controlled piers with berths for 100 oceangoing vessels, 4,895,000 square feet of transit shed space, 5,500,000 square feet of warehouse space and 13,000,000 square feet of open storage and working space. By August 1945 3,172,778 passengers and 37,799,955 <b>measurement</b> tons of <b>cargo</b> had passed through NYPOE with 5,893,199 tons of cargo having passed through its Philadelphia cargo sub-port. With the total for all ports being 7,293,354 passengers and 126,787,875 tons of cargo this put the NYPOE at 44% of all troops and 34% of all cargo passing through Army Ports of Embarkation.|$|R
40|$|Ocean {{pollution}} by oil {{has received}} worldwide attention {{in recent years}} as a result of concern for environmental damage caused by major oil tanker casualties. Although public attention has focused on tanker accidents, in actuality, the bulk of oil entering the ocean from tankers results from normal tanker operations. Public awareness has initiated international regulations affecting tanker technology and operations, and has influenced pending international maritime law. The development of technology related to oil tankers must, as a result, occur within the context of industry requirements and pertinent international regimes. ^ This dissertation investigates the developmental sequence for tanker technology through the conceptual design of an acoustic cargo load level gauging system for oil tankers. ^ A Sonar Oil Thickness Sensor (SOTS) device designed to measure the thickness of oil spilled onto the sea was investigated for adaptation to an oil tanker <b>cargo</b> <b>measurement</b> system. The SOTS-T (oil tanker configuration) utilizes the SOTS operational features of microprocessor control and time gated sampling window, to locate and measure oil/air and water/oil interfaces in cargo tanks {{and a variety of other}} oil tanker measurement situations. ^ The SOTS-T was configured to comply with the developmental constraints of tanker infrastructures, operations, and the international regulations of IMCO. The implications of pending international law to tanker technology, as contained in UNCLOS III and international liability organizations, were investigated. ^ The SOTS-T was determined to be feasible for: cargo load level gauging within custody transfer accuracy, operation within a 2 ̆ 2 closed ullage 2 ̆ 2 environment, and pollution control monitoring required by IMCO. The SOTS-T configuration was integrated into a <b>cargo</b> <b>measurement</b> system, incorporating all of the required measurement functions. ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedOne of the Fast Combat Support Ship's (AOE) functions is {{the delivery of}} dry, freeze, and chill provisions to afloat combat units. The present ship characteristics do not provide for handling and stowage of palletized provision cargo. Significant savings in material handling time and cost can be realized from handling cargo in palletized units. A comparison is made between the present handling procedure on AOEs 1 and 2 and five alternative systems. Three of the alternatives will {{be shown to be}} infeasible because of the dimensions and physical constraints of the AOE hull. Comparison measures of effectiveness include total elapsed loading time, loading cost per <b>measurement</b> ton of <b>cargo</b> and qualitative considerations. In conclusion, recommendations for modification of the AOEs 1 and 2 to permit palletized handling of provisions cargo are prioritized. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|In World War II the NYPOE, {{now under}} the new Transportation Corps, was the largest of eight Port of Embarkation commands, the second largest being the San Francisco Port of Embarkation and the second largest on the East Coast being Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation. Originally it had the army {{facilities}} in Charleston, South Carolina as a sub-port until it was elevated to the Charleston Port of Embarkation as a separate command. The cargo sub-port at Philadelphia remained {{under the command of}} NYPOE throughout the war. By {{the end of the war}} 3,172,778 passengers, counting 475 embarked at the Philadelphia cargo port, and 37,799,955 <b>measurement</b> tons of <b>cargo</b> had passed through the New York port itself with 5,893,199 tons of cargo having passed through its cargo sub-port at Philadelphia—about 44% of all troops and 34% of all cargo passing through army ports of embarkation.|$|R
40|$|Enabling {{technologies}} that transfer micron-sized objects into mammalian cells {{are needed to}} advance key applications in cell engineering. High-throughput delivery of organelles, modified intracellular pathogens, enzymes, proteins, {{and other types of}} cargo is required to obtain reliable data in settings of cellular heterogeneity. Delivered objects must also avoid entrapment in cell vacuoles or endosomes to retain functionality. Here, we report a massively parallel photothermal microfluidic platform for high-throughput delivery of large cargo directly into the cytosol of mammalian cells. Micron-sized cargo is reproducibly delivered in up to 100, 000 cells on the platform in a minute, with parameters for cargo delivery tunable for each cell and cargo type. The delivery platform is a compact silicon chip on which hundreds of thousands of micron-sized cavitation bubbles expand and collapse within nanoseconds in response to pulsed laser excitation. Cavitation bubbles are formed by rapid heat transfer from nearby metallic nanostructures via a photothermal process enhanced by the lightning-rod effect. High speed, localized fluid flows near cavitation bubbles puncture contacting cell membranes with precision, resulting in micron-sized transient membrane pores. Applied pressure provides an active driving force to speed slow diffusing large cargo through these transient pores before membrane repair and resealing. We have reproducibly delivered large cargo including micron-sized bacteria, enzymes, antibodies, and functional nanoparticles into a variety of cell lines, including three different types of primary cells, with high efficiency and high cell viability. Our experiments involving delivery of functional enzymes, antibodies and vacuole escape-incompetent bacteria prove that cargo is delivered directly into the cell cytosol on this platform, bypassing endocytosis. Massively parallel and nearly simultaneous delivery of cargo into cells under the same physiological conditions enables reliable statistical <b>measurements</b> of <b>cargo</b> interactions with cells over time. To demonstrate its utility, we used this platform to explore the intracellular lifestyle of Francisella novicida and discovered that the iglC gene is unexpectedly required for intracellular replication even after vacuolar escape into the cell cytosol. Our photothermal platform approach, termed BLAST (Biophotonic Laser Assisted Surgery Tool), provides a reliable mechanism for high-throughput engineering of cells with micron-sized natural and man-made materials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMolecular motor {{proteins}} use {{the energy}} released from ATP hydrolysis to generate force and haul cargoes along cytoskeletal filaments. Thus, measuring the force motors generate amounts to directly probing their function. We report on optical trapping methodology {{capable of making}} precise in vivo stall-force <b>measurements</b> of individual <b>cargoes</b> hauled by molecular motors in their native environment. Despite routine measurement of motor forces in vitro, performing and calibrating such measurements in vivo has been challenging. We describe the methodology recently developed to overcome these difficulties, and used to measure stall forces of both kinesin- 1 and cytoplasmic dynein-driven lipid droplets in Drosophila embryos. Critically, by measuring the cargo dynamics in the optical trap, we find that there is memory: {{it is more likely}} for a cargo to resume motion in the same direction—rather than reverse direction—after the motors transporting it detach from the microtubule under the force of the optical trap. This suggests that only motors of one polarity are active on the cargo at any instant in time and is not consistent with the tug-of-war models of bidirectional transport where both polarity motors can bind the microtubules at all times. We further use the optical trap to measure in vivo the detachment rates from microtubules of kinesin- 1 and dynein-driven lipid droplets. Unlike what is commonly assumed, we find that dynein’s but not kinesin’s detachment time in vivo increases with opposing load. This suggests that dynein’s interaction with microtubules behaves like a catch bond...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} temporal {{variations in}} the latitudinal distribution of annual mean atmospheric potential oxygen (APO=O 2 + 1. 1 ×CO 2), a useful tracer for studying ocean biogeochemical processes. To compute APO, we used atmospheric CO 2 and O 2 concentrations from flask samples and in-situ <b>measurements</b> onboard commercial <b>cargo</b> ships sailing between Japan and Australia/New Zealand. Most of the observed latitudinal distributions of the annual mean APO for the years 2002 – 2012 showed equatorial bulges, indicating tropical APO outgassing fluxes. However, the equatorial bulge was noticeably absent during the 2009 / 2010 El Niño period, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The temporal variation in the 25 – 0 °S latitudinal APO gradient correlated significantly with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO); the equatorward APO gradients decreased (increased) during the El Niño (La Niña) period with a variability of about ± 0. 1 per meg/degree. Simulated APO based on an atmospheric transport model driven by climatological/constant flux fields and reanalysis meteorological data reproduced the overall characteristic of the observed temporal variation in the APO gradients well, suggesting that the atmospheric transport contributed substantially to the observed interannual variation in the global APO distributions. However, the model simulation underestimated the variability in the APO gradients by about 25 %, compared to the observations. These discrepancies suggest a possibility {{of the existence of}} additional APO flux variability in the tropical Pacific, enhancing the ENSO-related variability in the observed APO gradients...|$|R
