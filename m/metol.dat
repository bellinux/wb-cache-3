50|$|<b>Metol</b> is {{difficult}} to dissolve in solutions of high salt content and instructions for mixing developer formulae therefore almost always list <b>metol</b> first. It is important to dissolve chemicals in {{the order in which}} they are listed. Some photographers add a pinch of sodium sulfite before dissolving the <b>metol</b> to prevent oxidation, but large amounts of sulfite in solution will make it very slow for <b>metol</b> to dissolve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metol</b> is an {{excellent}} developing agent for most continuous tone developer applications, {{and it has been}} widely used in published developer formulas as well as commercial products. However, it is difficult to produce highly concentrated developer solutions using <b>Metol,</b> and therefore most <b>Metol</b> developers are supplied in dry chemical mix. A developer containing both <b>Metol</b> and hydroquinone is called an MQ developer. This combination of agents provide greater developer activity since the rate of development by both agents together is greater than the sum of rates of developments by each agent used alone (superadditivity). This combination is very versatile; by varying the quantities of <b>Metol,</b> hydroquinone, restrainer, and adjusting the pH, the entire range of continuous tone developers can be made. Therefore, <b>Metol</b> replaced most other developing agents except for hydroquinone, Phenidone (which is more recent than <b>Metol),</b> and derivatives of Phenidone. Notable formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer.|$|E
5000|$|Glycin {{is related}} to 4-aminophenol and <b>Metol.</b> Compared to <b>Metol,</b> glycin has a {{carboxyl}} group attached to the methyl group of the <b>Metol.</b> This weakens the reduction potential of the compound, and the two developers have markedly different character. Glycin is slower-acting, but much longer-lasting in solution. Glycin is rarely used as a developing agent today, primarily because it is expensive and manufactured for specialty applications only. In its dry form, it also has limited shelf life compared to <b>Metol</b> and Phenidone.|$|E

5000|$|Hydroquinone is superadditive with <b>metol,</b> {{meaning that}} it acts to [...] "recharge" [...] the <b>metol</b> {{after it has been}} {{oxidised}} in the process of reducing silver in the emulsion. Sulfite in a developer not only acts to prevent aerial oxidation of the developing agents in solution, it also facilitates the regeneration of <b>metol</b> by hydroquinone (reducing compensation and adjacency effects) and in high enough concentrations acts as a silver halide solvent. The original lithographic developer contained formaldehyde (often added as paraformaldehyde powder) in a low sulfite/bisulfite solution.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Bogisch, {{working for}} a {{chemical}} company owned by Julius Hauff, discovered in 1891 that methylated p-aminophenol has more vigorous developing action than p-aminophenol. Hauff introduced this compound as a developing agent. The exact composition of Bogisch and Hauff's early <b>Metol</b> is unknown, but it was most likely methylated at the ortho position of the benzene ring (p-amino-o-methylphenol), {{rather than at the}} amino group. Some time later, <b>Metol</b> came to mean the N-methylated variety, and the o-methylated variety fell out of use. Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation (AGFA) sold this compound under the trade name <b>Metol,</b> which became by far the most common name, followed by Eastman Kodak's trade name Elon.|$|E
5000|$|... {{developing}} agents. Popular developing {{agents are}} <b>metol</b> (monomethyl-p-aminophenol hemisulfate), phenidone (1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone), dimezone (4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpyrazolidin-3-one), and hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol).|$|E
50|$|Also {{included}} are the aromatic nitro-, amino-, and pyridilium-deratives: nitrobenzene, dinitrobenzene, trinitrotoluene, paramethylaminophenol sulfate (<b>Metol),</b> dinitro-ortho-cresol, aniline, trinitrophenylmethylnitramine (tetryl), hexanitrodiphenylamine (aurantia), phenylenediamines, and paraquat.|$|E
50|$|Kassabian's {{clinical}} work {{included the}} acquisition of fluoroscopic images. This work predated the routine use of X-ray plates to take static images, and it required Kassabian to be routinely exposed to high doses of radiation. The doctor first noted reddened areas of skin on his hands in 1900. At first {{he felt that the}} issue might be related to the use of <b>metol</b> in developing X-rays, but he realized that the problem persisted even when he handled <b>metol</b> with rubber gloves.|$|E
50|$|Photographic {{developer}} solutions {{may contain}} {{more than one}} developing agents, such as <b>Metol</b> and hydroquinone, or Phenidone and hydroquinone. This is because they work together to a synergistic effect, called superadditive development.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{has been}} in use for this purpose for over 100 years, and often by amateur photographers, there is a {{substantial}} body of evidence regarding the health problems that contact with <b>Metol</b> can cause. These are principally local dermatitis of the hands and forearms. There is also some evidence of sensitization dermatitis, in which repeated exposure triggers of a chronic condition that is resistant to medication. The use of <b>Metol</b> in highly caustic solutions and the presence of other materials in darkrooms that have been implicated in dermatitis - such as hexavalent chromium salts - may exacerbate some health impacts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Metol</b> is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula HOC6H4NH2(CH3)HSO4. It is the hydrogen sulfate (HSO4−) salt of the protonated derivative of N-methylaminophenol. This colourless salt {{is a popular}} photographic developer used in black & white photography.|$|E
50|$|Examples of Agent 1 include: Phenidone, Dimezone S, <b>Metol,</b> p-aminophenol, glycin, Eikonogen. These {{agents have}} {{nitrogen}} atoms that give strong affinity to silver halide (argentophilic) {{as well as}} hydrophobic end, effectively acting as a surfactant between the developer solution and silver halide crystals.|$|E
50|$|Phenidone (1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that is primarily {{used as a}} photographic developer. It has five to ten times the developing power as <b>Metol.</b> It also has low toxicity and, unlike some other developers, does not cause dermatitis upon skin contact.|$|E
50|$|Hydroquinone has {{a variety}} of uses principally {{associated}} with its action as a reducing agent that is soluble in water. It is a major component in most black and white photographic developers for film and paper where, with the compound <b>metol,</b> it reduces silver halides to elemental silver.|$|E
50|$|Hydroquinone {{is used as}} {{a topical}} {{application}} in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin. It does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as <b>metol</b> does. This is a prescription only ingredient in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directives 76/768/EEC:1976.|$|E
50|$|Most {{developers}} {{also contain}} {{small amounts of}} potassium bromide to modify and restrain {{the action of the}} developer:218-219 to suppress chemical fogging. Developers for high contrast work have higher concentrations of hydroquinone and lower concentrations of <b>metol</b> and tend to use strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide to push the pH up to around pH 11 to 12.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Aminophenol may be {{obtained}} by the amide hydrolysis of paracetamol. 4-Aminophenol prepared this way, and related to the commercially available <b>Metol,</b> {{has been used as}} a developer in photography by hobbyists. This reaction is also used to determine paracetamol in urine samples: After hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid, 4-aminophenol reacts in ammonia solution with a phenol derivate, e.g. salicylic acid, to form an indophenol dye under oxidization by air.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>metol</b> is {{relatively}} toxic {{and can cause}} skin sensitisation, modern commercial developers often use phenidone or dimezone S (4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone) instead. Hydroquinone can also be toxic to the human operator as well as environment; some modern developers replace it with ascorbic acid, or vitamin C. This, however, suffers from poor stability. Ascorbate developers may {{have the advantage of}} being compensating and sharpness-enhancing, as oxidation by-products formed during development are acidic, meaning they retard development in and adjacent to areas of high activity. This also explains why ascorbate developers have poor keeping properties, as oxidised ascorbate is both ineffective as a developing agent and lowers the pH of the solution, making the remaining developing agents less active. Recently, claims for practical methods to improve the stability of ascorbate developers have been made by several experimenters.|$|E
50|$|Though {{a popular}} {{photographic}} developing {{agent in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries, pyrogallol largely fell out of favor around the 1920s, although it was still used by a few notable photographers including Edward Weston. In those days it {{had a reputation for}} erratic and unreliable behavior, due possibly to its propensity for oxidation. It experienced a revival starting in the 1980s due largely to the efforts of experimenters Gordon Hutchings and John Wimberley. Hutchings spent over a decade working on pyrogallol formulas, eventually producing one he named PMK (for its main ingredients, pyrogallol, <b>Metol,</b> and Kodalk name of Kodak). This formulation resolved the consistency issues, and Hutchings found that an interaction between the greenish stain given to film by pyro developers and the color sensitivity of modern variable-contrast photographic papers gave the effect of an extreme compensating developer. From 1969 to 1977, Wimberley experimented with the Pyrogallol developing agent. He published his formula for WD2D in 1977 in Petersons Photographic.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{chemical}} adjacency {{effects in}} black and white photography can be obtained using certain <b>Metol</b> and Phenidone developers. Four different effects are described: 1) development inhibition by iodide ion 2) development inhibition by bromide ion 3) exhaustion of <b>Metol</b> 4) development inhibition by oxidized Phenidone Edge effects produced by <b>Metol</b> exhaustion and by Phenidone development are enhanced by moderate increases in pH. They are reduced by: the addition of hydroquinone, high levels of sodium sulfite, and high fog levels. Developers designed to increase adjacency effects also increase granularity. The trade-off betv/een acutance and granularity is approximately linear for the film-developer combinations studied, {{with the exception of a}} Phenidone only developer, which resulted in excessive granularity. With low-speed films like KODAK Panatomic-X, the sharpness increase observed in photographic prints may be beneficial in spite of increased graininess. However, with higher speed films such as KODAK Plus-X and KODAK Tri-X, the increased grain overwhelms the gain in sharpness, making the trade-off unfavorable...|$|E
