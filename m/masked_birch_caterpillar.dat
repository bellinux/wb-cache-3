40|$|Many {{seasonal}} breeders {{adjust the}} timing of reproduction in response to year-to-year variations in supplementary environmental cues, amongst which ambient temperature {{is thought to be}} most influential. However, it is possible that for species such as the great tit (Parus major L.), phenological cues from sprouting vegetation and the consequent abundance of invertebrate prey, although dependent on temperature, may provide supplementary environmental cues per se. This hypothesis was investigated in breeding pairs of great tits kept in outdoor aviaries. In spring, experimental pairs were provided with access to leafing <b>birch</b> branches and <b>caterpillars</b> as a visual food cue, while control pairs were provided with non-leafing branches. Observations were made on the onset of laying and on concentrations of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) at regular intervals to monitor changes in reproductive function. The onset of egg laying was not advanced by the presence of leafing branches and caterpillars. LH concentrations increased {{during the course of the}} study, but phenological cues did not affect plasma LH levels in females and males. Early spring vegetation, such as the leafing of birch branches, and the appearance of caterpillar prey do not appear to play a significant role in fine-tuning the onset of egg laying in great tits. ...|$|R
40|$|Two centuries-old mask traditions {{native to}} Austria and Bavaria enjoy ongoing {{popularity}} {{due to a}} creative mingling {{of old and new}} elements (heavy metal music and fireworks alongside hand-carved wooden <b>masks</b> and <b>birch</b> rod switches). The Krampus is the menacing companion of St. Nikolaus, who visits children on December 5 and 6, although nowadays groups of Krampusse may appear alone. The Perchten, who are associated with the magical female folk-figure Perchta, appear on January 5 and the week before. While the Perchten and Krampusse represent distinct traditions, their history has intersected at various points, and their contemporary manifestations share many elements, including a movement towards a “modern” aesthetic and the employment of such resources as tourist publicity and the internet to promote their appearances, educate the public, and network with each other. While the house visit was formerly the primary setting for these masked figures (or mummers), today it is the public parade. These parades, while rooted in and resembling conventional display-custom performances marked by a static division between performer and spectator, actually consist of a kind of fluid, interactive ritual theater in which the partially improvised, partially scripted performances of masked figures and the responses of spectators shape one another. Contemporary manifestations of Perchten and Krampus traditions will be explored in light of the ongoing cultural dialogue between performers and non-performers who seek to define and interpret the tradition, and the interplay of academic and popular discourses surrounding invented tradition, Folklorismus (folklorism) and Rücklauf (feedback), and the nature of authenticity. Questions of cultural heritage “ownership” surface in the debates over form and meaning, while {{in the hands of the}} Perchten and Krampusse themselves, tradition emerges as an active process and collaborative artwork rather than a fixed commodity with boundaries which can be defined and navigated by outside observers. ...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{climate change}} in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic is causing {{vegetation}} change across large areas of tundra. Shrubs and trees are undergoing range expansions {{as part of an}} over-all trend of ‘greening’ of the tundra. This is of importance because northern peatlands contain around half of total soil carbon (C) and there is a potential for productive vegetation to interact with this C in a number of ways: (1) Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) in symbiosis with trees and shrubs could potentially stimulate decomposition through extracellular enzyme production whilst extracting nitrogen (N) for their hosts; (2) deep snow, trapped by tall vegetation insulates the soil, resulting in higher winter-time microbial activity and has potential to influence growing season microbial activity; (3) the biochemistry of litter and decomposition environment associated with more productive vegetation could result in accelerated mass loss of litter and stimulate decomposition of older soil C. This thesis investigates how productive sub-arctic plant species in Northern Sweden interact with soil C by using ‘space-for-time’ transitions from forests (Betula pubescens), through intermediate shrub vegetation (Betula, Salix), to tundra heath (Empetrum nigrum). This was to test how ECM fungi, winter snow accumulation, defoliation events and litter input influence C cycling. C stocks, respiration rates and ECM growth rates were measured across these ecotones. It was found that birch forests and shrub stands had significantly lower soil C storage and higher respiration rates than adjacent heaths. This is contrary to the predictions of earth system models. Higher ECM growth rates at plots with low C storage and high cycling rates implied that they had {{an important role in the}} stimulation of C decomposition. To test whether snow cover in forests over winter had an important effect on C cycling, soils were transplanted between forest and heath (different snow cover), and respiration rates were measured over summer. It was found that deep snow cover over winter increases microbial activity in summer due to a warmer, more stable winter environment; this is hypothesised to be due to the environmental selection of a more active assemblage of decomposing microbes. A defoliation event of part of the <b>birch</b> forest by <b>caterpillars</b> allowed for a natural ‘experiment’. Trees with different degrees of defoliation were compared in their influence over soil C cycling processes. Defoliated plots shifted to slower-cycling states through a shift in the ECM community. This further implied that ECM fungi have an important role to play in rapid cycling of C in forests. A decomposition experiment using the litter of significant plant species in forest, shrub and heath communities was carried out by transplanting them between these key environments. This work showed that rapid decomposition of litter in the forest is driven by an interaction between carbohydrate-rich litter input and an effective decomposer community. This work addresses the relationship between vegetation productivity and C storage in the soil. This theme runs through every experiment as they test specific interactions between different plant groups and the soil. The results from this thesis suggest that increasing productivity and shrub expansion in the Arctic will stimulate decomposition of soil C via a number of pathways. Plant-soil interactions are clearly of importance in determining the fate of C in ecosystems and will play a key part in the balance of C in the future...|$|R
