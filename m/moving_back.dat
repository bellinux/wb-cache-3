Despite this, Varon continues to make regular visits to the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the valley floor, gradually <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> up the slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the valley floor.|$|E

The second episode had lower ratings for the first time, with 4.99m, seeing it beaten by an episode of New Tricks on BBC One.|$|E
5|$|Von Lettow-Vorbeck did {{not stay}} at Ngomano for long and soon marched his force south to attack more Portuguese positions, leaving only one company at Ngomano as a rearguard {{in case the}} British decided to follow him into Portuguese East Africa. His force won several more {{victories}} while seizing even more supplies and ammunition before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> into German East Africa in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short period}} of abandonment, Park Hall was {{purchased}} from the council by Mike Harris with a view to redevelopment and The New Saints <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to the ground. The New Saints started to use Park Hall as their regular home ground again in 2007 and the ground was further improved so that it was able to host matches in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. It has since been used to host youth international fixtures for both England and Wales while also hosting Non-League football for community teams in Oswestry.|$|E

After a successful season at Brighton he transferred to Norwich City in 2010, before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to the South Coast club in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In March 1922, Prokofiev {{moved with}} his mother {{to the town of}} Ettal in the Bavarian Alps, where for over a year he {{concentrated}} on an opera project, The Fiery Angel, based on the novel by Valery Bryusov. His later music had acquired a following in Russia, and he received invitations to return there, but decided to stay in Europe. In 1923, Prokofiev married the Spanish singer Carolina Codina (1897–1989, stage name Lina Llubera) before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to Paris.|$|E
5|$|More of a {{traditional}} rivalry due to {{the large amount of}} Kiwi internationals Melbourne has fielded in their history. Matches between the two clubs are normally close and low scoring, with the overall head to head (as of 2016) slightly in Melbourne's favour (37 clashes, Storm 19-Warriors 16 & 2 draws). These two sides played an annual ANZAC Day clash each year between 2009–2014. For 2015 it was played earlier in April before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to ANZAC Day for 2016.|$|E

5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca). Katherine had known Susan before moving away under mysterious circumstances. Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no recollection of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane. Later, in a cryptic conversation, Adam asks Katherine if {{they made a mistake}} in <b>moving</b> <b>back,</b> and Katherine reminds him {{that they did not have}} a choice.|$|E
5|$|Vålerenga {{has stated}} {{that they want to}} {{relocate}} and have conducted plans to build a new stadium at Valle Hovin, where the club currently have their administration and training facilities. Plans exist for stadiums for 22,000 spectators, which would be expandable to 32,000. Part of the rationale for their own stadium is that Vålerenga traditionally is the east side team, while Ullevaal is located {{in the heart of the}} west side. As an alternative, Vålerenga has considered <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to Bislett, at least as a temporary solution.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on October 14, 2016. Before that, Warner Bros. had scheduled it for January 29, 2016, later moving it to October 7, 2016, before <b>moving</b> it <b>back</b> another week.|$|R
50|$|Using good {{protective}} {{measures such as}} attaching a rigid backing to a painting on canvas provides several protections. It reduces the effects of rapid changes in relative humidity around the painting, provides some protection from pressure or direct contact against the canvas back, and protects from vibrations caused by handling or <b>moving.</b> <b>Backing</b> boards also serve to protect from dust and dirt, cracks and deformations from handling, and insect activity. Some {{of the most commonly}} used types of backing boards include foam core, heritage board, matboard, cardboard/millboard, coroplast, corrugated plastic sheets, acrylic sheeting, mylar, and fabric.|$|R
5000|$|The single-wing {{formation}} {{depended on}} a center who was skilled both at blocking and at tossing {{the ball from}} between his legs to the receiving back. The center had to direct the ball to any of several <b>moving</b> <b>backs,</b> with extreme accuracy, as the play started. Single-wing plays would not work efficiently if the back had to wait on the snap because quick defensive penetration would overrun the play. The center was taught to direct the ball to give the tailback or fullback receiver a running start in the direction that the play was designed to go.|$|R
5|$|While in Canada, Pollard {{opened a}} {{beverage}} {{store and a}} restaurant. He became sports director of CKLG radio station in Vancouver. After <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to Pennsylvania, Pollard was a color commentator on broadcasts of Eagles games for WIP radio and worked with Charlie Swift, the play-by-play man, from 1969 to 1976. The former anchored a postgame Eagles program for WCAU-TV and occasionally commented for CBS television. His voice and knowledge of sports was praised by Eagles publicist Jim Gallagher.|$|E
5|$|Born in New York City, {{he spent}} much of his early {{childhood}} in Bogotá, Colombia before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to the United States at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in comic strips, particularly Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon. He took art classes at Burne Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School, there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel, who introduced him to the work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his science-fiction/heroic fantasy art for EC Comics in the 1950s, on titles including Weird Science and Weird Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{she got a}} small role in {{the film}} Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, but {{considered}} <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to Canada as most of her auditions failed. She was then cast in a supporting role as Juna on the HBO television series The Comeback, with Lisa Kudrow in the main role. Kudrow played a former sitcom star who tried to restart her career. Åkerman's appearance on the show garnered media attention and resulted in her being offered more roles. A year later, she guest starred on an episode of Love Monkey and two episodes of Entourage. Before the Entourage episodes aired, she landed {{a role in the}} 2007 comedy film The Brothers Solomon. The film was a box office bomb and received largely critical reviews.|$|E

5|$|In August {{the brigade}} formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the brigade took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which {{were part of a}} larger {{deception}} force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor. They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west. The regiment was heavily involved in the deception, carrying out offensive patrolling, constructing dummy camps, and <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> and forwards behind the lines to give the impression of a much larger force than was actually present.|$|E
5|$|Late on November6, Ida re-emerged over water, {{entering}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Upon <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> over water, the storm quickly began to redevelop, with convection increasing around {{the center of}} circulation. Early on November7, Ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north. Very warm sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification; however, wind shear over the area quickly increased, resulting in modest strengthening. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward {{in response to a}} strong trough over Mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the Southeast United States to Hispaniola. As Ida neared the Yucatán Channel, an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane. By the morning of November8, the storm had attained Category2 status with winds of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E
5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She was afraid of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E
