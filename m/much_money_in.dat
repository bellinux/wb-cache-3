25|$|Instruments made {{mostly from}} plastic, {{including}} the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, {{emerged in the}} 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce {{is different from that}} of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{they have}} written exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind.

Where are the sciences of the Chaladaeans, the Syrians and the Babylonians, and the scholarly products and results that were theirs? Where are the sciences of the Copts, their predecessors? The sciences of only one nation, the Greeks, have come down to us, because they were translated through Al-Ma'mun's efforts.

25|$|By {{the time}} the hotel's {{demolition}} started, Raskob had secured all of the investors {{that he needed to}} fund the construction of the building. The plan was to start construction later that year, but on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange started a steep and sudden crash, sparking what would become the decade-long Great Depression. Even so, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point. Neither Raskob nor Smith lost <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the crash: Raskob because he had stopped his speculation about the stock market the previous year, Smith because he had never invested a great amount of money in the market. However, most of their investors did lose money, and as a result, in December of that year, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company loaned Empire State Inc. some $27.5 million so the group could start construction. Even though the stock market crash obviated the need for any new office space, Raskob and Smith proceeded to start construction anyway, since canceling the project would cause investors to incur great losses.|$|E

But the topical question was, as he asks in chapter 3 of Verbum Sapienti, would £6m be enough to drive a nation's trade, especially if the King wanted to raise additional funds for the war with Holland? ...|$|E
2500|$|While PBA bowlers {{regularly}} {{appeared on}} Jackpot Bowling, Elias led {{an effort to}} give the PBA a permanent home on television.

2500|$|How {{is money}} an abstraction? Money gives the {{illusion}} {{that it has a}} direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so <b>much</b> <b>money.</b> <b>In</b> reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making {{the world a better place}} for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that [...] "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right." [...] But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery.|$|E
