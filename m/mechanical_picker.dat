2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees).

Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of modern textile machinery {{such as the}} spinning jenny, power loom, and cotton gin brought in more profits, and cotton towns, “more benign than the British” came to be established in the country. Following the end of slavery in the southern states the boll weevil, a pest from Mexico, began to spread across the United States, affecting yields drastically as it moved east. The fashion cloth of the blue jeans furthered boom of cotton for three decades. Adoption of chemical pesticides to reduce diseases and thus increase yield of the crop further boosted production.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The <b>mechanical</b> cotton <b>picker</b> is {{a machine}} that automates cotton {{harvesting}} {{in a way that}} reduces harvest time and maximizes efficiency. To develop a <b>mechanical</b> cotton <b>picker</b> with the intent on replacing manual labor. The first pickers were only capable of harvesting one row of cotton at a time, but were still able to replace up to forty hand laborers The current cotton picker is a self-propelled machine that removes cotton lint and seed (seed-cotton) users rows of barbed spindles that rotate at high speed and remove the seed-cotton from the plant. The seed-cotton is then removed from the spindles by a counter-rotating doffer and is then blown up into the basket the plant at up to six rows at a time. The picker or spindle type machine was designed to pick the open cotton from the bolls using spindles, fingers, or prongs, without injuring the plant's foliage and unopened bolls. In this cotton picking by spindle type machine will resul in sshort fibre content,micronair and fibre length will indirectly looses the fibre strength quality as compare to hand picking machine. over come to these problem make a cotton picking machine by suction will made a pressure equal to the hand picking (100 gm) Keywords:-cotton fibre/cotton harvesting/cotton fibre properties/cotton fibre testing/pneumatic cotton picking machin...|$|R

500|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, well over 4,000 hop-pickers and some 23,000 {{visitors}} travelled in 56 [...] "Hopper specials"– extra services laid {{on during the}} late August – early October hop season; at the busiest period, up to six trains per day ran through to the branch from London. In 1912 there had been 26 specials each carrying as many as 350 people; they generally started at [...] and called at [...] or [...] The farmers agreed between themselves when the picking would begin, and informed the railway who then set about the planning of the special trains. A [...] "Hop Control Centre" [...] was set up at Paddock Wood to organise these services, ensuring that hoppers could alight at London Bridge and be taken directly to the nearest hop farm. Since the hopping season generally coincided {{with the end of}} the holiday season, most serviceable trains were already in use elsewhere, so spare rolling stock would be brought out of storage and pressed into service for just three weeks; sometimes carriages had to be borrowed from other parts of the country. The carriages tended to be old or in poor condition, since the hoppers had a reputation for drunkenness and violence. This traffic was however already in decline as rising living standards and paid holidays led to a decline in the hop-picker workforce, and many of those who remained chose to travel by car or van. By 1959 the Sunday service consisted of a single two-coach unit, with an evening working to London Bridge. As <b>mechanical</b> <b>pickers</b> gradually replaced the human workforce, hop-picking had become a memory by the time the branch closed in 1961.|$|R

40|$|Episodes of {{labor-saving}} {{technological change}} and rural urban migration have become universal patterns {{of economic development}} the world over. Donald Holley, in The Second Great Emancipation, sets out {{to tell the story}} of the last great episode of such change in the United States, when the cotton harvest was mechanized following World War II. The last major crop to make the transition from hand production, cotton was extraordinarily labor-intensive, especially the harvest. In 1945 millions of workers hand picked almost every boll of American cotton, but by 1970 farmers gathered their crop with John Deere and International Harvester <b>mechanical</b> cotton <b>pickers.</b> Folks, mainly blacks, who had for generations performed one of the most backbreaking forms of stoop labor, moved to northern and western cities. As Holley tells it, the First Great Emancipation occurred when President Lincoln freed the slaves and the Second Great Emancipation when the mechanical cotton harvester freed laborers from the drudgery of the cotton harvest, poverty, and Jim Crow discrimination, and southern producers from inefficient production methods and farm sizes. It is a really big and important story of profound technological and demographic changes with spillover effects into civil rights, racial economic equality, and politics. These events, for example, transformed race from a southern regional to a national issue. ...|$|R
40|$|A Digital virtual Disk (DVD) {{random access}} memory (RAM) Redundant Array of Inexpensive Libraries (RAIL) optical storage system has been {{developed}} and tested at NTT Integrated Information & Energy Systems Laboratories. The RAIL storage system incorporates multiple DVD libraries that consist of dual DVD-RAM drives. Each DVD library utilizes a single <b>mechanical</b> robot <b>picker</b> for media loading and unloading. The current capacity of the single sided and single layered DVD optical media used in that system is 2. 6 gigabytes. To increase the reliability of stored data {{and at the same}} time to eliminate the need for read after write verification, a process that can double the recording time, a RAID 4 algorithm has been implemented in the control unit of the RAIL storage system. Data sent by the host are transferred to a control unit, that stripes data over five data groups plus one parity unit. The striped and parity data are sent to individual libraries and written to DVD media. This system writes and retrieves storage data with a transfer rate of approximate 6 MB/sec, using write and read control methods that minimize data striping overhead. Other performance factors that affect the transfer rates are the striping size and the number of drives used in the RAIL system. Experimental results indicate that stripe sizes of 32 to 64 KB are sufficient to achieve high throughput. In addition, the transfer rates showed no further increase when the number of drives exceeded eight. This RAIL optical storage system which offers data redundancy can be used for networked multimedia applications...|$|R
