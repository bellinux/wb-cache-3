5|$|As had {{occurred}} with Bilheimer's previous film, A Closer Walk, Not <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>had</b> several preview screenings before its official release. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) hosted a preview screening at the Willard InterContinental Washington in September 2009 {{as part of}} a day-long symposium on human trafficking. A preview screening in Egypt, including the material shot in that country that was later removed, took place in December 2010 at the International Forum against Human Trafficking in Luxor.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{his mother}} {{died at the age}} of 43. The {{following}} year, Pacino's grandfather James Gerardi, also died. Pacino recalled it as [...] "the lowest point of my life"; he said, [...] "I was 22 and the two most influential people in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> gone, so that sent me into a tailspin." ...|$|E
500|$|Years {{later as}} {{an elderly man}} {{near the end of}} his life, Marques de Sousa would fondly recall his advancement: [...] "Never in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> I judged myself so great, nor {{experienced}} such ineffable rejoicing... as in the day I placed my fists into the cuffs of alferes. I walked through all the streets of the city, looking at myself, conceited, believing that everyone looking with admiration envied my luck, that all enamored ladies vied for my hand." [...] For the remainder of the conflict he was stationed in the defense of Montevideo. The conquest of the Banda Oriental was ended in July 1821, when Portugal declared it a province of Brazil with the name of Cisplatina.|$|E

500|$|In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin's Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 {{appearances}} {{in a brief}} stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara's First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker-manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside {{on his first day}} in charge to say [...] "I'll let you manage the reserves, so long as you keep your head down, do whatever I tell you, and I won't tell everybody you're a bad influence". Southall was shocked by Durban's words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation {{on the last day of}} the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer, and later said [...] "one of the worst episodes of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> drawn to a close".|$|E
500|$|... "We're from America" [...] is {{the most}} overtly {{political}} song on the album, referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics, such as pro-war and anti-abortion rhetoric. [...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic that I think will make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song I have ever heard. I thought that the album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, I sang '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E
500|$|The film had its {{official}} premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19, 2011. Melanne Verveer, United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, [...] "Each {{and every one}} of us is called to act. I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment." [...] Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>had</b> its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Music {{was one of}} {{the main}} comforts for Goodrem during the {{chemotherapy}} for Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer diagnosis. Songs kept going around in her head: harmonies, melodies, lyrics, many deeper and darker than those that were on her debut album, Innocent Eyes. Goodrem states [...] "It's a more grown up album", [...] "My music changed because <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> changed; the whole world around me had changed. My music had to reflect that". [...] "Extraordinary Day" [...] is about the day (8 July 2003) when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, [...] "The Last Night On Earth" [...] is a song about death and love, [...] "The Analyst" [...] tells the story of the hours of self-analysis she dealt with, [...] "Be Strong" [...] is an encouraging call for confidence and [...] "Mistaken Identity" [...] is Goodrem stating for the record where her head was at. She also stated [...] "There are a lot of lyrics I wouldn't have used on the first album".|$|E
2500|$|In affidavits, Fletcher {{wrote that}} she has almost no memory of her {{childhood}} up {{until the age of}} 14. [...] She explained that her writing started out just for her and was cathartic because she had been sexually abused as a child. “At first I would capture a particular feeling of dread and try to weave it into a scenario that explained the feeling", she wrote. [...] Fletcher described what she called her [...] "monsters":"I have always been afraid of monsters. The monsters in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> always been real; for too long they were always there with unlimited access to me, and I was helpless to do anything about it. In my stories, I have created new monsters. [...] rise above the horror of the real life monsters. Somehow, making these monsters so much worse makes me feel better, and makes my life seem more bearable. I may still be afraid of the monsters, but at least in the stories, they prey on someone else, not me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ismail {{was raised}} by his {{maternal}} grandmother due to his mother's various illnesses, and received his primary education at Sekolah Bukit Zaharah, although his education was interrupted by frequent trips to see distant relatives. Ismail's initial friends were predominantly Malay, but when he continued his education at the English College Johore Bahru, Ismail gravitated to non-Malays due to {{his interest in the}} opposite sex – Chinese girls often being given more freedom to mingle than their Malay counterparts in those days. Ismail later said: [...] "I am convinced that this early mingling with the other races during the most impressionable stage of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> {{a lot to do with}} my non-racial outlook." [...] Ismail forged close friendships with the daughters of Cheah Tiang Earn, a friend of his father's. Eileen and Joyce Chuah would later both marry into the influential Kuok family, which Ismail got to know through them. Ismail also befriended the children of Joseph Chako Puthucheary, who would later become important players in Malaysian and Singaporean politics. Try ...|$|E

2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have never in my life played a game of cards.
