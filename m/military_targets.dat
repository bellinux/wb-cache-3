5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> in London were to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|Because of Lebanon's weak central government, the PLO {{was able}} to operate {{virtually}} as an independent state. During {{this time in the}} 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks against civilians as well as <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> within Israel and outside of it.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Third Fleet {{and being}} re-designated Task Group 38.4, the force began {{operating}} off the Japanese Home Islands in July 1945. It began an intense airstrike campaign against <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> on Honshu and Hokkaido, striking Japanese airfields, merchant shipping, and ground targets. Radford commanded the force in this duty until V-J Day, {{the end of}} the war in the Pacific. Upon receipt of the orders to end hostilities, he signaled his ships that he was proud of their accomplishments.|$|E

5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{and during}} Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both civilian and <b>military</b> <b>targets.</b> He prepared Beirut's defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon {{with the rest}} of the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{campaign}} was heavily favored by U.S. commanders, because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi’s nascent industrial infrastructures. Furthermore, the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to be used against the primary war-making capabilities of North Vietnam, by striking at <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> that were previously denied to the fighter-bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Thus, in 1967 the United States also introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology, which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference. However, as American bombers moved closer to Hanoi and Hai Phong, they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters.|$|E
5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against <b>military</b> <b>targets,</b> such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering ground troops. From this point on bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> of all types supporting the North Korean ground troops, including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a bombing run.|$|E

5000|$|On 8 May, a {{spokesperson}} for the Saudi-led coalition declared the entire city of Sa'dah, with a population of around 50,000 people, was a <b>military</b> <b>target.</b> According to Human Rights Watch: [...] "This not only violated the laws-of-war prohibition against placing civilians at particular risk by treating a number of separate and distinct military objectives as a single <b>military</b> <b>target,</b> but possibly also the prohibition against making threats of violence whose purpose is to instil terror in the civilian population." ...|$|R
5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to Hanoi {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with North Vietnam, {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, senior security adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. In the shadow of those events, the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese <b>military</b> <b>targets.</b> However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, the Germans set {{up another}} ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as {{had been the}} {{original}} intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart {{late in the day}} on 18 August and shell <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> the next morning. As in May, UB-6 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, UB-6 was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, UB-6 and her group played no part in the action.|$|E
5|$|North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, {{starting}} the Korean War. In {{response to an}} urgent request from the Korean Military Advisory Group for more ammunition, MacArthur, on his own initiative, ordered the transport ship MSTS Sgt. George D Keathley, then in harbor in Yokohama, to be loaded with ammunition and to sail for Pusan. President Truman met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other advisors that day at Blair House and approved the actions already taken by MacArthur and Secretary of State Dean Acheson. At another meeting at Blair House held {{on the evening of}} 26 June, amid reports of a rapidly deteriorating situation in South Korea, Truman approved the use of air and naval forces against <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> south of the 38th parallel north.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1950 the Korean War {{began when}} the North Korean People's Army invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and {{equipped}} troops who easily overran the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. In response, the United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From there, the U.S. and UN suffered {{a steady stream of}} defeats that pushed them back to the Pusan Perimeter by August. At the same time, North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> and cities.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August, two VRS {{air force}} jets {{attacked}} {{a village in}} the Nova Gradiška area, {{just north of the}} Sava Riverthe international border in the area. The CAF bombed an ARSK command post, a storage facility and several tanks near Bosanski Petrovac. CAF jets also struck a column of Serb refugees near Bosanski Petrovac, killing nine people, including four children. On 8 August, the CAF performed its last combat sorties in the operation, striking tanks and armoured vehicles between Bosanski Novi and Prijedor, and two of its MiG-21s were damaged. The same day, UN military observers deployed at Croatian airfields claimed that the CAF attacked <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> and civilians in the Dvor area, where refugee columns were mixed with ARSK transporting heavy weapons and large quantities of ammunition. Overall, the CAF performed 67 close air support, three attack helicopter, seven reconnaissance, four combat air patrol and 111 transport helicopter sorties during Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|Peter Frankopan {{has argued}} that the First Crusade has been {{fundamentally}} distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also {{as a result of a}} state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope Urban II was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan goes further, showing that the Crusade's primary <b>military</b> <b>targets</b> in Asia Minor - Nicaea and Antioch - required large numbers of men with experience of siege warfare; precisely the sort recruited by Urban during his preaching in France in 1095-6.|$|E
50|$|The ANC's {{submission}} {{said that}} the bombing {{was in response to}} a South African cross-border raid into Lesotho in December 1982 which killed 42 ANC supporters and civilians, and the assassination of Ruth First, an ANC activist and wife of Joe Slovo, in Maputo, Mozambique. It claimed that 11 of the casualties were SAAF personnel and hence a <b>military</b> <b>target.</b> The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as administrative staff including telephonists and typists they could not accept that they were a legitimate <b>military</b> <b>target.</b>|$|R

5|$|The United States {{reinstated}} {{sanctions against}} Yugoslavia in March 1998 when the Kosovo War started. Shortly after the controversies at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 {{to deliver the}} final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, so the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested {{by one of the}} tightest votings (213-213) in the entire history of the House of Representatives. The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. general Wesley Clark. Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of <b>military</b> <b>targets.</b> As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999.|$|E

5|$|With {{the renewal}} of the revolt, {{efforts were made to}} unify rebel ranks and {{establish}} a hierarchical command structure. In late 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad summoned the village elders in Tulkarm's vicinity and requested that they each provide him with one armed man. He was generally successful and recruited a 50-man force. The last quarter of the year saw increased attacks against British <b>military</b> <b>targets,</b> buses carrying Jews, the Iraqi Petroleum Company pipeline in Palestine and telecommunication lines. At this stage, the revolt had developed into an organized effort across Palestine, with each area's fasa'il having a hierarchy of some sort. In the case of al-Hajj Muhammad's forces, there were four brigades, each led by a commander and designated funds. Al-Hajj Muhammad appointed Ahmad Massad as his deputy to whom the other commanders were subordinate. This military order contrasted with the early phase of the revolt where al-Hajj Muhammad had been the sole field commander.|$|E
