5|$|With over 3,000 members, Michigan State University's Greek Community {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the US. Started in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, and Alpha Phi sorority; the MSU Greek system now {{consists}} of 55 Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils: National Panhellenic Conference, North American Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council is made up of 9 organizations, 5 Fraternities and 4 Sororities, that were founded on Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU's). The Interfraternity Council and the Women's Panhellenic Council are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many philanthropy events and community fundraisers. For example, in April 2011 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $260,000 for the American Cancer Society, and $5,000 for each of these charities: Big Brothers Big Sisters, The Listening Ear and previous charities include: the Make-a-Wish Foundation (MSU Chapter), Share Laura's Hope, The <b>Mary</b> <b>Beth</b> Knox Scholarship, and the Special Olympics, in which fraternity and sorority members get to help each other participate.|$|E

5000|$|Kleiner Perkins CFO Susan Biglieri {{testified that}} <b>Mary</b> Meeker and <b>Beth</b> Seidenberg {{were the first}} two women in the firm's history to reach its highest rank of [...] "managing member". Pao's legal team argued that these {{promotions}} in 2011 and 2012 were made to save face {{in the wake of}} Pao's discrimination complaints. Biglieri also testified that the firm's anti-discrimination policy, though distributed internally, was not posted on the website until after Ellen Pao filed her lawsuit. The plaintiff also showed that an Equal Opportunity Employment policy had to be written in 2012 after COO Eric Keller failed to find one.|$|R

5000|$|Contrasting Pao's {{statement}} that she discussed gender bias with Aileen Lee and Trae Vassallo, the defendant named three female witnesses who {{stated that they}} never felt discriminated against: <b>Mary</b> Meeker, <b>Beth</b> Seidenberg and Juliet de Baubigny. Private human resources consultant Rhoma Young defended the attention to detail in KPCB's review process and Harvard Business School professor Paul Gompers spoke favorably of its commitment to diversity. Another professor testifying for Kleiner Perkins, David Lewin of UCLA, alleged that Pao's claim to $16 million was invalid because she could have secured a lucrative salary with a more thorough job search. When Mary Meeker testified, she described Pao as [...] "insecure" [...] and [...] "quiet" [...] and recalled being invited to a second Al Gore dinner. Beth Seidenberg compared venture capital to her background in the medical field {{and said she was}} optimistic that it would see an influx of female talent as well. Juliet de Baubigny testified more directly about Ellen Pao and condemned her habit of making complaints against coworkers. She also denied using the word [...] "sex addict" [...] to describe Ajit Nazre, something that the plaintiff cited as evidence that his hostility was common knowledge.|$|R

After the show, Frank explains to them that he and Beth are marrying. It becomes clear that the wedding is due to her pregnancy, but Frank professes his happiness anyway. With <b>Mary,</b> Charley and <b>Beth's</b> disapproving parents looking on, the happy couple exchanges vows, as a lovelorn Mary tries to swallow her feelings for Frank ("Not a Day Goes By" [...] (Reprise)).|$|R
50|$|Pembleton and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{question}} Sister Magdalena (Pamela Payton-Wright), {{who worked}} with Goodrich at the shelter. She claims one of the abusive boyfriends of a shelter victim recently threatened Goodrich. She also claims Goodrich never wore white gloves. Pembleton later tells Bayliss he is Catholic, but his faith has weakened over time. Gaffney believes the boyfriend is the likely killer, but Pembleton feels {{it was not a}} crime of passion, but of perversion, because the killer placed white gloves on the body. Gaffney calls Pembleton a racial slur, nearly leading to a fight until Russert intervenes. Meanwhile, Felton (Daniel Baldwin) is distraught because his wife <b>Beth</b> (<b>Mary</b> B. Ward) has thrown {{him out of the house}} and will not let him see their kids. Nevertheless, Felton admits to Howard he is having an affair with another woman. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Munch (Richard Belzer) are in negotiations to buy a bar, but the owner will not lower her price and they must seek a third partner. They unsuccessfully pursue Bolander (Ned Beatty), but Bayliss later agrees to invest in the bar.|$|R
