5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified <b>me.</b> <b>Standing</b> behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Studio City, California on Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center. It was filmed on April 10, 11, and 13, 2006. The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. When we got to the very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for <b>me,</b> <b>standing</b> there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, it was {{reported}} that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the official EastEnders website and in a feature ("Script Peek") where Phil is quoted as saying, [...] "I know exactly what makes her tick" [...] before adding [...] "I've wriggled off her hook so many times. She's already picturing <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> in the dock" [...] in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, [...] "Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a foot out of place all those years ago and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil." [...] Of her return she said, [...] "It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six."...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I’d just finished a year’s run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice – so it couldn’t have come at a better time." [...] She returned on 28 December 2009.|$|E

2500|$|In 1897, Ward {{enrolled}} in the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. [...] Ward received his M.D. from Penn in 1899. [...] While at Penn, {{he was a member}} of Psi Upsilon and the H.C. Wood Medical Society. [...] As he had done at Michigan, Ward followed in the footsteps of William [...] "Jerry" [...] McCauley. Both were Princeton football players who coached football at Michigan and received their medical degrees at Penn. [...] Ward later wrote, [...] "At Pennsylvania, too, 'Jerry' McCauley had been my forerunner, and he it was who took me around to see Dr. Joe upon the very day of my arrival in Philadelphia, and from that time until I left Philadelphia, in March, 1902, after a winter's special training with him, he was my friend and instructor; and if I ever make a name for myself in the domain of surgery it is his training that I have to thank for it. [...] Many a morning would find <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> beside his operating table instead of on the benches of the lecture room where I belonged, but I have never repented my choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “One {{morning as}} I {{came into the}} dining-tent I noticed that {{everybody}} but the Indians had been served with hot cakes. [...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with <b>me,</b> <b>Standing</b> Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they want at meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Salming {{was a fan}} {{favourite}} in Toronto. The peak of {{his popularity}} may have come during the 1976 Canada Cup which was held at Maple Leaf Gardens. When Team Sweden was playing against the Team USA, Salming received an extended standing ovation during player introductions. Salming later commented, [...] "I'll never forget our game in Toronto. The fans gave <b>me</b> a <b>standing</b> ovation during the introductions. I was representing my country and Canadian fans gave <b>me</b> a <b>standing</b> ovation. Sometimes hockey has no country." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That will do, young man. There {{is no need}} to keep <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> in {{this wild}} place. You are living somewhere in this neighbourhood, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} you, Mr. Chance, and am therefore {{unable to}} agree with you. I hope {{you are not going}} to keep <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> here much longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All are in safety," [...] she said. [...] "Run upstairs {{when you}} can. Where you see <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> at a door run in and lock {{it on the}} inside." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{vanished}} like rats {{into their}} holes at the shout, leaving <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> alone with him. The affair {{had come and}} gone so quickly that I scarce caught my breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Call it {{what you}} like. It's {{something}} that a man needs to draw a free breath. And look!--as you see <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> before you here I care for it no longer." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} eyes suddenly. I thought I heard a faint sigh. I {{tried to take}} a light tone again, and yet it seemed {{impossible}} {{to get off the}} ground which gave <b>me</b> my <b>standing</b> with her.|$|R

60|$|For {{an instant}} I felt her {{pressure}} on my hand, {{and then she}} had fled into the house, leaving <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> by the steps looking after her. Comyn's voice aroused me.|$|E
60|$|Presently I heard a step, and {{slightly}} turning, saw my wife close by me. She {{had passed the}} open door, and seeing <b>me</b> <b>standing</b> as if stricken into a statue, had entered.|$|E
