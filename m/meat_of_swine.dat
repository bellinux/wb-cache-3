Įgyvendinant šiuos reikalavimus reikia siekti, kad kiaulės būtų šeriamos subalansuotais visaverčiais racionais, parenkami ir taikomi tinkami veisimo metodai, atliekama nuosekli kryptinga selekcija produktyvumo ir produkcijos kokybės gerinimo kryptimi, sudaromos optimalios laikymo sąlygos. Kiaulių veisimo programos ilgą laiko tarpą buvo orientuotos į ekonomiškai svarbių produktyviųjų savybių, tokių kaip augimo sparta, mėsos kiekis skerdenose, gerinimą mažinant pašarų sąnaudas ir kitas išlaidas. Pastaruoju metu vis dažniau raginama atsižvelgti ir į nepageidaujamą itin griežtos vienpusiškos atrankos poveikį gyvūnų sveikatai ir produkcijos kokybei. Lietuvoje taip pat pradėta kreipti dėmesį ne tik į skerdenų, bet ir į mėsos kokybę. Darbo tikslas: nustatyti ir įvertinti skirtingų produktyvumo tipų kiaulių kompaktiškumo ir mėsingumo indeksų skirtumus. Darbo uždaviniai: 1. Atlikti skirtingų produktyvumo tipų kiaulių kūno matavimus. 2. Atlikti ilgiausiojo nugaros raumens ir nugaros lašinių storio matavimus. 3. Nustatyti kompaktiškumo bei mėsingumo indeksų sąsajas su kiaulių produktyvumu. Remiantis gautais tyrimų rezultatais, galima daryti sekančias išvadas: 1. Produktyvumo tipas turėjo įtakos kiaulių sudėjimui. Universalaus produktyvumo tipo kiaulės buvo 0, 16 proc. (P< 0, 05) ilgesnės bei 4, 18 proc. (P< 0, 05) didesnės krūtinės apimties nei mėsinio produktyvumo tipo kiaulės. Jų kompaktiškumo indeksas buvo 3, 94 proc. didesnis. 2. Nors mėsinio produktyvumo tipo kiaulės buvo trumpesnio liemens, jų mėsinės savybės buvo geresnės nei universalaus produktyvumo tipo kiaulių: jų skerdenos išeiga buvo 0, 92 proc. didesnė, skerdienos ir bekono puselės atitinkamai 1, 83 ir 4, 02 proc. ilgesnės, ilgiausiojo nugaros raumens skerspjūvio plotas 1, 71 proc.

Įvertinus kiaulių išsivystymo ir produktyvumo požymių koreliacinius ryšius, nustatytas vidutinio stiprumo ryšys tarp universalaus ir mėsinio produktyvumo tipo kiaulių kūno ilgio ir krūtinės apimties, atitinkamai 0, 589 (P< 0, 05) ir 0, 699 (P< 0, 05).

The main {{requirements}} for modern pig production farming: high productivity <b>of</b> <b>swine,</b> good fattening and meat characteristics. While implementing these requirements one should achieve that swine are fed a wholesome balanced diets, appropriate breeding methods are selected, successive targeted selection towards productivity and product quality {{is carried out}} and optimal storage conditions are provided. Aim of the work: to identify and evaluate {{the differences in the}} compactness and <b>meat</b> content index <b>of</b> different types of pig productivity. Tasks of the work: 1. Carry out pig body measurements of different types of productivity. 2. Perform the fat thickness measurements of the longest back muscle and back. 3. To identify the relations of the compact and meat content index with pig productivity. The work was carried out at the Lithuanian Veterinary Academy, Department of Animal Husbandry and at the State Swine Breeding Station, Jadvimpolio village, Baisogala adm. area, Radviliškis district. The research was carried out with the get of two different types of productivity <b>of</b> fattened <b>swine.</b> By the end of the control fattening, body measurements of the fattened get were carried out. In order to calculate the compactness index, the following was measured: body length in cm, chest volume in cm. The compactness index was calculated by the following formula: volume of the chest / body length x 100. In order to calculate the meat content index, the following was measured: back fat thickness in mm, the longest dorsal muscle thickness in mm. The meat content index was calculated by the following formula: thickness of fat / back muscle thickness x 100. Prior to the control slaughter, the lean <b>meat</b> content <b>of</b> the get <b>of</b> fattened <b>swine</b> was phenotypically evaluated (with Piglog ultrasonic device in the range of 105, 85 - 110 kg). The following was identified: back fat thicknesses at Fat 1 and Fat 2 points, mm, the longest dorsal muscle thicknesses mm, lean meat percentage. In order to evaluate the relations of the compactness and meat content index with the productivity <b>of</b> <b>swine,</b> after the completion of control feeding of the get and the control slaughter, the following indicators of fattening and met characteristics were evaluated: hot carcass weight in kg, carcass yield percentage, daily weight gain in g, feed consumption per 1 kg of weight gain, carcass and bacon halves length in cm, area of the longest dorsal muscle cm², ham weight in kg, fat thickness at 6 to 7 mm rib in mm, fat thickness behind the last rib in mm. Conclusions: 1. After the assessment of the universal indices <b>of</b> compactness and <b>meat</b> content if swine with different productivity it was fond that the compactness index was 3. 94 percent higher for the type <b>of</b> universal productivity <b>swine,</b> and the meat content index was 0, 78 percent higher for the type <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> productivity <b>swine.</b> 2. After measuring the body length and volume of the chest <b>of</b> the <b>meat</b> and universal type <b>of</b> <b>swine</b> it was determined that the body length during the universal productivity type <b>of</b> <b>swine</b> was 0. 16 percent higher (P < 0, 05), chest volume was 4. 18 percent higher (P < 0, 05) for the <b>meat</b> productivity type <b>of</b> <b>swine.</b> 3. After measuring the longest back muscle and back fat thickness it was found that in <b>meat</b> productivity type <b>of</b> <b>swine,</b> the longest dorsal muscle thickness was 1. 07 percent bigger (P < 0, 05) than the universal type <b>of</b> <b>swine,</b> and the back fat thicknesses in points Fat 1 Fat 2 respectively were 1. 62 percent (P< 0, 05) and 0. 69 percent (P < 0, 05) higher for the <b>meat</b> productivity type <b>of</b> <b>swine.</b> 4.
