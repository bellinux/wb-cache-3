50|$|That {{relation}} between money and prices is historically {{associated with the}} quantity theory of money. There is strong empirical evidence of a direct {{relation between}} <b>money-supply</b> <b>growth</b> and long-term price inflation, at least for rapid increases {{in the amount of}} money in the economy. For example, a country such as Zimbabwe which saw extremely rapid increases in its money supply also saw extremely rapid increases in prices (hyperinflation). This is one reason for the reliance on monetary policy as a means of controlling inflation.|$|E
50|$|Monetarist economists long {{contended that}} the <b>money-supply</b> <b>growth</b> could affect the macroeconomy. These {{included}} Milton Friedman who {{early in his career}} advocated that government budget deficits during recessions be financed in equal amount by money creation to help to stimulate aggregate demand for output. Later he advocated simply increasing the monetary supply at a low, constant rate, as the best way of maintaining low inflation and stable output growth. However, when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker tried this policy, starting in October 1979, it was found to be impractical, because of the highly unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables. Even Milton Friedman later acknowledged that direct money supply targeting was less successful than he had hoped.|$|E
40|$|In {{this new}} brief, President Dimitri B. Papadimitriou and Research Scholar Greg Hannsgen {{evaluate}} the current path of fiscal deficits in the United States {{in the context}} of government debt and further spending, economic recovery, and unemployment. They are adamant that there is no justification for the belief that cutting spending or raising taxes will reduce the federal deficit, let alone permit solid growth. The worst fears about recent stimulative policies and rapid <b>money-supply</b> <b>growth</b> are proving to be incorrect once again. In the authors' view, we must find the will to reinvigorate government and to maintain Keynesian macro stimulus in the face of ideological opposition and widespread mistrust of government...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a hybrid of the sticky-price and sticky-information models of price {{adjustment}} is able to deliver a hump-shaped ination re-sponse to monetary shocks without counterfactually implying, as in Mankiw and Reis (2002) or Altig et al. (2005), that individual 8 ̆ 5 rmsprices change each quarter (whether they respond or not to the shock). Under the assump-tion that 8 ̆ 5 rmsprice-setting decisions are strategically neutral, the ination response to a transitory shock to the <b>money-supply</b> <b>growth</b> rate is hump-shaped for the hybrid model, whereas it is monotonic for both the sticky-price and sticky-information models. If the shock is permanent, then this response is hump-shaped for the sticky-information and the hybrid models, whereas it is at for the sticky-price model...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulties}} of settling {{on a national}} policy for coping with inflation are compounded by a prolonged Battle of the Books among economists. Those who {{think of themselves as}} fiscalists (or Keynesians or New Economists) often underestimate the importance of changes in the rate of <b>money-supply</b> <b>growth.</b> And those who think of themselves as monetarists often overestimate the possibilities of using changes in the rate of moneysupply growth as an instrument for controlling inflation. Actually, monetary tightness pushes interest rates and unemployment up before it has any discernible effect on inflation. In this dialogue, economist Allan H. Meltzer presents a specific plan for using a combination of monetary and fiscal restraint to subdue inflation. Meltzer is Maurice Falk Professor of Economics and Social Science at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. While unmistakably a monetarist, he recognizes that the federal budget (fiscal policy) heavily influences the decisions of the Fed (monetary policy). The dialogue is a shortened version of a conversation between Professor Meltzer and two members of the FORTUNE editorial staff. Meltzer 2 ̆ 7 s words are printed in black, and those of the FORTUNE staffers in blu...|$|E
