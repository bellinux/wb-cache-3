40|$|This paper tests two {{hypotheses}} {{regarding the}} impact of the U. S. Multifiber Arrangement restrictions on developing countries' exports of textiles and clothing to the United States: that the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> is a binding constraint on exporters; and that the arrangement encourages the growth of smaller exporters by restricting exports from major sellers. Pooled data on eight small Asian exporters over the period 1975 - 84 is used. Results strongly support the hypothesis that the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> has been a binding constraint. Although the arrangement appears to have diverted demand toward these smaller sellers, this effect is counteracted by slow growth in their own restraints. Copyright 1990 by MIT Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Principal aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the impacts of both {{protectionism}} and liberalisation in international trade in textiles {{during the second half}} of 20 th century and the beginning of 21 st century. In the first chapter, there is explained the beginning of quantitative restrictions in trade in 1960 s as a consequence of Arrangement regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles. The second chapter deals with the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement,</b> its renewal and especially the role of the European Community in the MFA system. At the end, there is depicted the integration of the MFA Arrangement into the GATT system. In the third chapter, there is defined the process of integrating textile products through Agreement on Textiles and Clothing into the liberalized system under WTO rules. The fourth chapter deals with the current situation after the removal of quotas on textile imports and subsequent renewal of restrictions on imports of Chinese textiles till the beginning of December 2008. In the last chapter, there are introduces consequences of <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> and Agreement on Textiles and Clothing on chosen economies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the major {{findings}} of existing studies on the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement's</b> (MFA) effect, with emphasis on the effects to LDCs, and to suggest the directions for further studies that are needed for a better understanding of the MFA. The paper is composed of six sections. Following the introduction, section 2 examines the dominant features of textile and clothing (T&C) exports from the LDCs. In section 3, the essence of the MFA provisions and their actual development is briefly summarized. These two sections provide a background to the discussion in the later part of the paper. Section 4 surveys the effects of the MFA on importing countries. The effects of the MFA on exporting LDCs are discussed in section 5. Finally, in section 6, a summary and conclusions are given, as well as the directions for further studies which are needed on the subject.

40|$|The {{international}} garment {{trade was}} liberalized in 2005 following {{the termination of}} the MFA (<b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement)</b> and ever since then, price competition has intensified.

During the period concerned, frequent firm turnover led to an improvement of the industry’s productivity, and the study found that the average total-factor productivity (TFP) of new entrants was substantially higher than that of exiting firms. Furthermore, we observed that thanks to productivity growth, an improvement in workers’ welfare, including a rise in the relative wages of the low-skilled, was taking place.

Since the MFA quota removal did not affect all textile products at the same time, we are able to use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effects of the MFA. Using transaction-level data from the Chinese Customs Trade Statistics over the period 2000 - 2006, we find that the MFA removal reduced average export prices by about 25 %. This fall was mainly caused by a combination of the entry of new low-price exporters and new low-price products, rather than a fall in prices of existing firm-product combinations.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} opening of the US textile/apparel market for China {{at the end of the}} <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> in 2005 as a natural {{experiment}} to provide evidence for positive assortative matching of Mexican exporting firms and US importing firms by their capability. We identify three findings for liberalized products by comparing them to other textile/apparel products: (1) US importers switched their Mexican partners to those making greater preshock exports, whereas Mexican exporters switched their US partners to those making fewer preshock imports; (2) for firms who switched partners, trade volume of the old partners and the new partners are positively correlated; (3) small Mexican exporters stop exporting. We develop a model combining Becker-type matching of final producers and suppliers with the standard Melitz-type model to show that these findings are consistent with positive assortative matching but not with negative assortative matching or purely random matching. The model indicates that the findings are evidence for a new mechanism of gain from trade...|$|E
40|$|The Uruguay Round Negotiating Groups on countervailing and {{antidumping}} procedures {{share many}} common issues. This is not accidental, claims this paper, but mirrors the way import-competing firms {{have become the}} driving force of antidumping and countervailing procedures set up under the Tokyo Round. Countervailing actions are likely to be a poor instrument for limiting subsidies for economic reasons inherent in the profit maximizing behaviour of the complaining firms. However, to strengthen disciplines on countervailing measures would be meaningless without narrowing the currently pervasive definition of dumping and strengthening disciplines in antidumping procedures. This is related to the fact that US and EC firms have increasingly used antidumping procedures as a substitute for countervailing actions.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} both national and global welfare costs of bilateral quotas on textiles and apparel using an applied {{general equilibrium model}} which covers bilateral quotas on exports of textiles and apparel negotiated between three major developed importing countries (the US, Canada and the EEC) and 34 supplying developing countries under {{the provisions of the}} <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> applying in mid- 1980 s (MFA 111). Results using 1986 data clearly show {{that the vast majority of}} developing countries gain from MFA removal, with some gaining proportionately more than others. This suggests that despite foregone rent transfers, developing countries would receive gains by eliminating the MFA. In the central variant analysis, all developing countries gain by eliminating tariff and MFA restrictions because, contrary to popular belief, the developing countries (including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan) are relatively small compared to developed countries even in apparel production. Rather than losing share to other developing countries under an MFA elimination, higher Income developing countries (like other developing countries) gain market share at the expense of reduced developed country production. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two issues: (i) {{the extent}} of the restrictiveness/effectiveness of the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) with respect to the developing country suppliers of textile products during the 1980 s, and (ii) {{the extent to which these}} restrictions yield trade gains for the less established developing suppliers. After analyzing data, the author's made the following conclusions. Rather than ease up, the MFA became more restrictive. Proportionately more shipments were subject to quotas and volume generally grew less where quotas were binding. The unit value of shipments subject to binding quotas also increased substantially more than the unit value of unconstrained items. Developing countries that were new exporters of textile products also hoped to capture a larger share of the textile market as a result of quotas for other developing countries. However, the needy countries have benefited little from the MFA, and countries whose exports grow soon find themselves on the restricted list. Finally, domestic producers in the United States have benefited most from the MFA.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a simple general equilibrium trade model {{to estimate the}} effects of the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) on world trade in clothing, especially on exports from developing countries. The MFA greatly affects developing countries because the MFA restrictions are imposed discriminatively on the exports from developing countries. In 1988 Trela and Whalley estimated the welfare cost of the MFA to developing countries by using a rigorous general equilibrium framework. They showed that if the MFA were removed, the developing countries as a whole would gain by more than 3 billion dollars. In some sense the present paper is an extension of the Trela/Whalley paper, the main differences being : 1) the present paper incorporates in the model the additional realities like underutilization of quotas, 2) the emphasis of the present paper is placed on effects on trade and not on the effect of welfare, 3) the model developed in the present paper is much simpler than in the Trela Whalley one, and 4) product differentiation is more emphasized in the present paper.

The focus of this study is Pakistan’s status as a ‘single commodity’ country and the life after 2004 in a post- <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) era. This work intends to use the hindsight to argue that MFA, a cat’s cradle of bilateral textile import quotas, was a blessing in disguise for the value added textiles sector of Pakistan. And the difficulties beyond 2004, when all the quotas have gone, should not be underestimated in a bipolar (NAFTA and the EU) and deregulated world economy. The analysis is carried out in four parts. Part I highlights the economic significance of Pakistan’s textiles industry by briefly analysing its contribution to different sectors of her economy. Part II presents the past, present and future scenario of international trade in Textiles and Clothing (T&C). The present situation of Pakistan’s textiles industry along with its foreign exchange generating performance in the past is assessed in Part III.

40|$|The {{growth of}} China’s textile {{industry}} {{has been one of}} the dominant factors shaping world cotton and textile markets in recent years. Since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001, China’s textile and apparel (T&A) exports have grown by more than 40 percent and China’s cotton consumption has grown by 34 percent. By the end of 2003, China had nearly doubled its share of world T&A exports in less than a decade, to about 21 percent. T&A exports from China and other developing countries are constrained by quotas originally implemented by developed countries under the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA). Under the Uruguay Round’s Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), these quotas have been gradually phased-out since 1995, with complete removal scheduled for the end of 2004.

40|$|From {{the early}} stages of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain to the East Asian success story of the last forty years, the textile and {{clothing}} industry has played, and continues to play, a central role in the economic development process. Clothing exports are often the first step away from a division of labour in which poor countries export natural resources in exchange for industrial products from developed countries. Today, the share of clothing in the total exports of the poorest countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia is growing and accounts for more than 60 % of their total exports. For middle-income countries like Morocco, Tunisia, or Romania, clothing makes up around 30 % of their total exports. For the developed countries, the share is declining very fast and represents less than 3 % of exports from the USA, the EU, or Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The textile and clothing industry has also always been a very competitive industry due to low entry costs and to the intensive utilisation of low-skilled workers. In the last thirty years, the share of the developing countries jumped from 30 % of world trade to more than 60 %. This progress was made in spite of an exceptional trade regime called the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA), implemented for the first time in 1974, and renewed up to 1994. This system was based on quotas on imports by the USA, Canada and the European countries. A...|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} two major shifts in global trading and industrialisation patterns. The first is the rise of China (with the South East Asian region in tow) as the dominant force reshaping the competitive dynamics between developing and developed countries as well as within the developing world itself. The second is exemplified in the rapid rise of a clothing industry sector, with a concomitant impact on wage employment, in some sub-Saharan African countries (amongst which Madagascar has been prominent), {{as a direct result}} of the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) of 2000. However, the end of the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> and the massive impact of China on the global dispersion of clothing production have threatened to substantially disrupt these processes. Despite the plethora of warnings, there is very little empirical analysis of the real changes taking place as a result of the changed global environment. Based on international trade data and field research undertaken in Madagascar, this article aims to analyze the clothing industry's current dynamics in Madagascar, given the impact of AGOA and the end of apparel quotas.

40|$|International {{trade in}} {{textiles}} and clothing has been subject to strong protectionism for decades. Although the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing has set procedures to phase out the quota system, this paper questions how far the regime will actually be liberalized. It highlights the {{significant differences between the}} China-specific safeguard provisions in China’s WTO accession protocol and the general WTO Agreement on Safeguards. It also examines the recent case of a US safeguard application against China’s textile and clothing products and analyses the potential impact of this case on both countries and the global economy. The analysis suggests that prospects for China’s textile and clothing exports after WTO accession may not be as optimistic as is generally assumed. For decades, the world’s textile and clothing market has been subject to a special trade regime under the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA), a construct that is in conflict with the core principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), such as non-discrimination and transparency. For about 30 years, rich countries have so protected their domestic textile industries from cheaper imports originating in poorer nations. Not until January 1995 did the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) come into force, which attempted to reverse decades of protection in these sectors. The ATC sets out the framework and procedures to phase out the MFA and eliminate the entire quota system eventually by 2005. This should have a huge positive impact on developing countries, which have been restricted on exporting their textile products {{for an extended period of}} time.

40|$|The authors {{provide a}} simple {{introduction}} to {{the economics of the}} <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) and use available empirical evidence to examine its impact on exports of garments and textiles, focusing on India. Their review of the basic economics of the MFA shows the discriminatory character of the Arrangement. While exporting countries can gain from quota rents, much of this gain is likely to be offset by losses in exports to unrestricted markets, through waste resulting from domestic rent-seeking behavior, or shared with industrial country importers. Moreover, the restrictions curtail the ability of countries to generate sorely needed employment in the labor-intensive garment and textile sectors. Recent estimates for India of the export tax equivalents of the quotas suggest that they increased in 1999, {{after a couple of years}} around lower levels. The authors also examine the domestic policy distortions affecting the industry in India. While the abolition of quotas on international trade in textiles in 2005 will create opportunities for developing countries, it will also expose them to additional competition from other, formerly restrained exporters. The outcome for any country will depend on its policy response. Countries that use the opportunity to streamline their policies and improve their competitiveness are likely to increase their gains from quota abolition. Modeling results suggest that South Asia as a whole will gain from quota abolition, although different countries may experience different results. Unambiguously, however, the gains from domestic reform will increase after the abolition of the quota arrangement.

40|$|In the Uruguay Round negotiations, trade {{distorting}} agricultural {{policies were}} taken up substantively {{for the first}} time in any round of multi-lateral trade negotiations. Voluntary export restraints outside the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) were in fact eliminated. Developing countries became equal partners with developed countries. Their tariff cuts covered as large a share of imports as those of the developed countries and were deeper. Because developing country tariffs were higher to start with, their cuts will save importers more (perdollar of imports covered) than will cuts by developed countries. Tariff bindings for most developing countries, although often above applied rates, were extended to 90 percent or more of imports. Few countries agreed to give foreigners unlimited market access in services, or full national treatment in more than a few service activities. But developed countries agreed to some liberalization of cross-border provision for 70 percent of service activities (compared with 25 percent in developing countries). Less positively, although trade restrictions on agricultural products were converted to tariffs, border protection was reduced less on agricultural than on industrial products, and there was little agreement on reducing trade-affecting subsidies. The textiles and clothing agreement binds developed countries to eliminate all MFA-sanctioned restriction but allows them to largely put off doing so until 2005. Concessions to which developing countries agreed are due now. Reciprocal concessions of particular interest are due in the future (elimination of the MFA) or yet to be negotiated (liberalization of agricultural trade).

40|$|Since 2000, Lesotho {{along with}} Kenya, Madagascar and Swaziland, has seen year-toyear {{doubling}} of clothing {{exports to the}} United States under the AGOA program. These SSA countries have experienced tremendous growth in the clothing industry mainly because of AGOA duty-free benefits, but also due to advantageous exchange rates with the US dollar. However, on 31 December 2004, the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA), the quota system that restricted Chinese exports to developed countries ended, freeing China and other large producers from binding quotas. Dire predictions were made {{about the end of}} the clothing industry in SSA, which accounted for 3 % of global garment exports in 2004. The winners would be China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, where global garment production would concentrate. Indeed, eight factories in Lesotho have closed, leaving 5, 800 unemployed. Their closure has been attributed to a lack of orders as retailers source their garments elsewhere and to the appreciation of the Rand against the dollar. With layoffs at other factories, the total number of jobs lost is 10, 700.

40|$|Exports in the Middle Eastern {{countries}} should increase from $ 800 million to $ 900 million {{as a result}} of the tariff cuts agreed on in the Uruguay Round, according to the author. This represents an annual expansion of less than 1 percent. Projected gains are small because the erosion of tariff preferences that Middle Eastern countries received in OECD markets offset the positive effects of reduced most-favored-nation tariffs on nonpreference-receiving products. And petroleum, the main Middle Eastern export [...] which generally faces zero or low tariffs [...] is unaffected by the Uruguay Round reductions. Egypt's projected gains (about $ 20 million, or under 0. 5 percent of total exports) are concentrated largely in agricultural exports to the European Union and manufactures in the United States. Israel should experience net trade losses because of the erosion of its free trade preferences in the European Union and the United States. The Uruguay Round made major progress in removing nontariff barriers that Middle Eastern exports face, especially in agriculture, textiles, and clothing. But with the removal of the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement,</b> international trade in textiles and clothing will become much more competitive. Middle Eastern countries must adopt measures to cut costs and increase efficiency to remain viable exporters. As a result of what was achieved in the Uruguay Round, the average OECD nontariff barrier coverage ration for Middle Eastern exports should fall from a current 10 percent to between 1 and 2 percent. Net food importing countries could be adversely affected by the higher international food prices expected to result from the Uruguay Round agreement. There is a clear priority for net food importers to adopt reforms stimulating domestic production. Prospects for increased trade in the Middle East are constrained by the similar comparative advantages and export profiles of many Middle Eastern countries. The most favorable prospects for intraregional trade appear to be between countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey [...] net energy importers [...] and the rest of the region.

40|$|Emphasizing the {{importance}} of evaluating the Uruguay Round {{in the context of}} a changing world economy, the authors base their projections on a model that incorporates certain economic shifts: 1) that the center of economic gravity will shift toward the South and toward Asia (a shift that is already under way and shows no signs of abating), and 2) that the pattern of comparative advantage will continue to change, with the East Asian economies gaining comparative advantage in the production of physical and human-capital-intensive products. The authors argue that these changes in the global economy significantly affect their analysis of the Uruguay round reforms, for two reasons. First, with the global distribution of trade and production shifting toward Asia, the deeper Uruguay Round cuts inthat region become more important, giving rise to a 17 percent increase in the proportionate welfare gain after implementation of tariff cuts. Second, without the Round, almost all of the bilateral quotas associated with the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) would have become more binding and the resulting distortion would have been significantly greater. In this analysis, the global gain from MFA reform is 60 percent greater than it would have been without taking into account the effects of growth. Of course, procedures for implementation of the MFA reforms are more complex than they have conveyed for purposes of analysis. In practice, one must also consider the impact of accel quota growth under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. But even when the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing is implemented over the period for which projections were made, quota rents rise for many bilateral flows. This is a consequence both of shifts in comparative advantage toward the supplying countries and of simultaneous cuts in tariffs on textiles and clothing. The projections approach used here may be viewed as a logical extension of the growing econometric literature seeking to explain the determinants of economic growth through regression analysis. By offering a bridge between econometric evidence and computable general equilibrium modeling, the authors hope to combine the two approaches to help shed light on the interaction between trade reform and economic growth.

40|$|Some {{developing}} countries may experience important trade losses if tariffs are liberalized on a general most-favored-nation (MFN) basis. Sub-Saharan Africa {{appears to be}} especially vulnerable to this problem. African countries receive important Lome Convention preferences in the European Economic Community (EEC), under which duty-free treatment, or tariffs below MFN and generalized system of preferences (GSP) rates, are applied to their exports. Other OECD countries normally apply GSP duties, or even more advantageous"least developed"country preferences to African exports. The proposed Uruguay Round reductions in MFN tariffs will erode those tariff preference margins and cause some African exports to be displaced by other suppliers. The author documents the importance of African countries of existing OECD preference, particularly those of the EEC. More than 95 percent of all African-tariff-line products shipped to the EEC receive duty-free treatment, while other exporters of the same products face tariffs as much as 20 percentage points higher. Similar favorable terms of preferential access also exist in Japan and the United States, although the preference margins are smaller than in the EEC. Using a trade projection model developed by the World Bank and the UNCTAD, the author estimates that eliminating EEC, Japanese, and U. S. MFN tariffs would cause African export losses of about $ 4 billion (estimated present value). The countries {{that seem to be}} most vulnerable to these adverse trade effects are Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. What about the possibility that the losses African countries could experience from erosion of tariff preferences could be offset by the liberalization of nontariff measures? The author discounts this likelihood. In general, few important OECD nontariff measures are applied to African products [...] most African textile and clothing exports are even excluded from <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> restrictions. And those that are applied (such as eco-labeling or licensing requirements) do not restrict trade very much. The author's observations accent the need for action to offset the impact of Africa's loss of preferences {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round. What offsetting actions are possible and appropriate? Aggressive reform of the African countries'own trade regimes appears to be the most effective way to counter the effects of the erosion of OECD preferences.

40|$|For {{developing}} countries, the {{textiles and}} clothing industries have traditionally been an important gateway to industrialization and increased exports. With the expiration of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the quota system originally set up through the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> was phased out. This {{has important implications for}} the allocation of export-oriented production and is likely to affect in various ways a large number of developing countries that rely heavily on such exports. Drawing {{on a wide range of}} studies as well as on original research, this volume shows that transnational corporations (TNCs) are likely to play a critical role in determining the future global production structure in these industries. First, the sourcing strategies of a small number of very large retailing companies (based in the United States, Europe and Japan) place stringent requirements on the locations in which textiles and clothes will be produced. Second, the investment strategies of large transnational producers (mostly based in East Asia) will also affect the final outcome. Foreign affiliates of such developing-country TNCs already account for the bulk of exports from many developing economies. The growing role of TNC producers is still not well understood, and more research is needed on their strategies and the impact of their international investments. As TNCs become more important at the production stage, their bargaining power increases vis-à-vis retailers in developed economies. With the removal of quotas, sourcing and investment decisions are affected more by economic fundamentals. But low labour costs alone will not be sufficient to attract investment. There is likely to be more consolidation of production into larger factories in a smaller number of locations. China and India are likely to be in a particularly strong position in this new geography of production, but various factors may also work against too much consolidation. Proximity to markets continues to play an important role for some product categories, and some producers have signalled that they will retain several production bases in order not to become too dependent on a single source country. Moreover, various trade policy measures also influence sourcing and investment decisions. Data on foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in {{textiles and clothing}} manufacturing show that China, Bulgaria, the United States, Hungary, Brazil and India attracted the largest number of such projects in 2002 – 2004. The removal of quotas generally means intensified competition for FDI in textiles and clothing. To become or stay competitive as host locations, countries will need to develop their ability to move away from simple assembly to "full-package" production and eventually original brand manufacture. But replicating the success of East Asia will be difficult. Key policy areas in this regard include identification of specialized niches; skills training and technological upgrading; investment in information technology; improvement of infrastructure such as ports and export processing zones; and leveraging of existing tariff preferences in the global trading system. Moreover, investment promotion agencies may identify some of the major transnational producers as key addresses for future marketing activities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three self-contained {{studies on}} firm bahaviour {{during a period}} of trade liberalisation and export boom in China. In Chapter 1, we describe the general institutional background of the Chinese export boom from 2000 to 2007, look into the structure of this growth by examining the sources of the changes in export value, and give the outline of each core chapter. In Chapter 2, we use a new linked firm-product data to measure the domestic value-added and technology intensity of Chinese exports over the period 2000 - 2007. We re-evaluate the extent of value-added in China's exports, using a modification of a method proposed by Hummels et al. (2001) which takes into account the prevalence of processing firms. In addition, we provide new estimates of the skill- and technology-intensity of China's exports. Our estimates of value-added suggest that, in 2006, the domestic content of China's exports was below 50 %, much lower than previously estimated. We also show that Chinese exports have become increasingly skill- and technology-intensive, but this intensity is lower when the exports are evaluated by domestic value-added than by final value. Chapter 3 looks into the effect of the elimination of the <b>Multifibre</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA) quotas in 2005 on prices of products exported by Chinese firms to the U. S. Using transaction-level customs data from China over the period 2000 - 2006, we find that the MFA quota removal reduced average export prices by about 30 %, which is compatible with other findings in the literature. A distinguishing feature {{of this study is that}} our data allows us to examine the sources of the price reductions. Evidence also shows that more than half of the price drop was due to firm entry and that the MFA had a smaller effect on the pricing behaviour of state-owned firms. As an extension of Chapter 3, Chapter 4 presents evidence on how multi-product firms adjusted their product structure as triggered by the MFA quota elimination. We find that the removal of MFA quotas induced firms to abruptly expand their product scope by as much as one third, and meanwhile caused firms to reduce the share of their core product in export sales by nearly 10 percentage points as a result of a more diversified export product mix. While these effects are obvious for private and foreign-owned firms, they are very insignificant for state-owned firms, probably due to the fact that the latter were not constrained as much by the quotas because of their closer political connections to the quota allocation authorities. Our evidence also suggests that an increased weight was placed on the U. S. market relative to the Japanese market within exporting firms after the quotas were lifted, highlighting the trade barriers created by U. S. quotas. Chapter 5 summarises the main findings of the thesis and discusses our future research directions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
