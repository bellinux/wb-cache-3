Counting of target cells takes place in an easy-to-handle automated image cytometer. The whole method is dedicated to monitor HIV of both adults and children in resource-poor settings. Method Reagents, which contain CD 3 conjugated magnetic particles and CD 4 -PE and CD 8 -PerCP immunofluorescent labeling, are added to whole blood. After 15 minutes of reagents incubation the sample chamber is inserted into a <b>magnetic</b> <b>holder</b> (Magnest™). CD 3 +CD 4 + and CD 3 +CD 8 + populations are brought to an imaging surface. Excited by LEDs the emission of CD 4 and CD 8 immunofluorescent labeled cells is filtered respectively by PE and PerCP emission filters and captured by a CCD camera. The image consists of a dark background with high intensity events for PE and PerCP labeled cells. Cells are selected and counted based on intensity and size using dedicated image analysis software.

40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{is known}} for its low heat input {{compared}} to arc welding methods. This could enable laser welding of sheet metals with lighter fastening solutions and less time-consuming tack welding alternatives. A feasibility study was carried out to study four different corner joint types for 2 mm thick cold-rolled steel sheet by using filler-free laser welding. The aim of the research was to get more experimental knowledge about the laser welding of corner joints. Also possible benefits concerning faster manufacturing times and smaller costs by developing fastening applications for small batch laser welding was to be studied in practice. The 170 mm long joints were welded without air gap or pressing. All corner joint types proved to be weldable with a continuous wave Yb:YAG diode-pumped disk laser. It was also found during the experiment that laser welding enables the use of light and inexpensive fasteners such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>holders</b> instead of traditional clamps and fixturing. With some joint types, the insufficient fastening power of magnetic fasteners against distortions was compensated by making a spot-like laser tack weld {{at the end of the}} weld before welding the actual seam.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{fire and}} life safety {{analysis was performed}} on the Orfalea College of Business. The report covers the prescriptive analysis of the building and the performance-based design analysis. The prescriptive analysis includes assessment of the relevant codes for egress system, water-based suppression system, alarm and detection system, and structural fire protection. The egress analysis under the Life Safety Code 2015 found the building meets the requirements of occupant load to exceed exit capacity, number of exits and its location, travel distances. Four rooms on the second floor that have not met the common path of travel distances limits were discussed in detail in this report. In addition, two locations where exits signs should have been located were investigated in this report. The water-based suppression system was analyzed, and an automatic fire sprinkler system was designed according to NFPA 13. The fire alarm and detection system throughout the building was reviewed. The notification device in Room 300 does not meet required candela rating. The smoke management system analysis indicates door <b>magnetic</b> <b>holder</b> for the exit enclosure on the third floor does not work properly. The analysis of the structural fire protection demonstrates that the building is in accordance to the requirements of the IBC 2015 for Type I-B construction. A performance based analysis of the Orfalea College of Business was performed to evaluate a design fire scenario. The fire scenario was modeled using Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS), Pyrosim and Pathfinder. The tenability results of the simulation are compared to the established tenability criteria to determine the available safe egress time (ASET) for the scenario. Then, (ASET) is compared to the required safe egress time (RSET). The fire scenario evaluated an upholstered three seat sofa in a break room on the fourth floor. The required safe egress time (RSET) was calculated as 249 seconds and the available safe egress time (ASET) was determined to be 42 seconds when the visibility tenability criterion was exceeded. As part of the evaluation process, there are additional recommendations in the report including exit sings locations on the third floor, obstructions in the corridor on the fourth floor, smoke detection system and notification appliances coverage, and several other recommendations are discussed in more detail in the report...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Sandeep Kumar Vashist, Gregor Czilwik, Thomas van Oordt, Felix von Stetten, Roland Zengerle, E. Marion Schneider & John H. T. Luong ### Abstract A rapid {{one-step}} kinetics-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) procedure {{has been}} developed for highly-sensitive detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in less than 30 min. With minimal process steps, the procedure is highly simplified and cost-effective. The analysis only involves sequentially {{the formation of a}} sandwich immune complex on capture anti-CRP antibody (Ab) -bound Dynabeads, followed by two magnet-assisted washings and an enzymatic reaction. The developed immunoassay (IA) detected CRP in the dynamic range of 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1 with a limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0. 4 ng mL- 1 and 0. 7 ng mL- 1. Its analytical precision for analysis of CRP spiked in diluted human serum, whole blood, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples of patients was validated by conventional ELISA, unravelling its immense potential for in vitro diagnostics (IVD). ### Introduction As the gold standard for the detection of CRP in clinical diagnostics, ELISA exhibits high-throughput, excellent reproducibility, high precision and remarkable sensitivity. Last five decades have accumulated over 300, 000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA. In particular, the last decade has also witnessed considerable advances in diversified CRP assay formats (1 - 22), lateral flow (20), immunoturbidimetry (1, 11), surface plasmon resonance (14), piezoresistive cantilever-based IA (10), chemiluminescent IA (3), impedimetry (23), electrochemistry 17, reflectometric interference spectroscopy 19, microfluidics (7) and homogenous bead-based IA (24). In general, most of these assay formats are based on a complex procedure comprising of many process steps with a lengthy analysis time (25 - 28). Therefore, there is uttermost importance for the development of rapid and cost-effective IA procedures with high precision and minimal process steps to guide healthcare professionals to decide on the desired intervention at an early stage. CRP, a pentameric protein with a molecular weight of 118 kDa, is a member of a class of acute-phase reactants indicating activation of innate and adaptive immunity (13, 29, 30). It {{plays an important role in}} host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related microbial molecules. As an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions (31, 32), CRP is usually elevated in patients with neonatal sepsis (33 - 35), meningitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease and occult bacteremia. The significantly elevated serum CRP levels are associated with malignant diseases, bacterial infections and correlate with increased 30 -day mortality rates in hospitalized patients (36). The monomeric CRP binds to the surface of damaged cells and platelets, thereby activating the complement cascade that plays an important role in inflammation. The American Heart Association/Center for Disease Control has considered CRP as the best inflammatory marker for clinical diagnosis (37). The precise and rapid determination of human C-reactive protein (CRP) is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis (33 - 35, 38, 39), cardiovascular diseases (40 - 44), infectious/inflammatory conditions (31) and diabetes (45 - 47). The ability for repeated CRP measurements with high precision in an acute setting provides clinicians with the valuable information to assess disease diagnosis and circumvent any unnecessary administration of antibiotics. The normal CRP levels in human serum are usually below 10 µg mL- 1 30 but up to 350 - 400 µg mL- 1 in several disease states. The CRP levels in the ranges of 10 - 40 µg mL- 1, 40 - 200 µg mL- 1, and > 200 µg mL- 1 are the indicators of mild or chronic inflammation and viral infections; acute inflammation and bacterial infections; and severe bacterial infections and burns, respectively (30). The CRP levels beyond the cut-off point of 5 µg mL- 1 are indicative of neonatal sepsis, which is diagnosed based on the determination of two CRP concentration ranges normal (0. 2 - 480 µg mL- 1) and high sensitivity (0. 08 - 80 µg mL- 1) 30. The high sensitivity CRP assay is performed first, but the normal CRP assay is also performed if the CRP levels are > 80 µg mL- 1. The existing analytical techniques for the determination of CRP have limitations in terms of prolonged IA duration and lower analytical sensitivity, as reviewed recently by Algarra et al. (22). The clinical laboratory-based CRP assays, based on latex agglutination or nephelometry, and phosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine based immunoassays can detect CRP only in the detection range of µg mL- 1. On the other hand, the recently developed immunoassay formats, based on electrochemical techniques, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, chemiluminescence, total internal reflection and micromosiac immunoassays, have higher sensitivities in the range of ng mL- 1 to µg mL- 1. Similarly, the surface plasmon resonance based real-time and label-free immunoassay formats have sensitivity between ng mL- 1 to g mL- 1. Therefore, there is a critical need for a highly simplified, cost-effective, precise and highly sensitive IA format for the rapid detection of CRP. We have developed a rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure (48) (Figure 1) to detect CRP in human whole blood and serum in less than 30 min. It has critically reduced the IA duration by more than 12 -fold and the analysis cost by 2. 5 -fold in comparison to the conventional procedure. This novel ELISA format required also significantly reduced number of process steps and only two washing steps in comparison to the conventional counterpart (Table S 1). Moreover, the high analytical precision of the developed procedure implies its tremendous potential for rapid analyte detection in clinical and bioanalytical settings. ### Materials 1.

The developed ELISA is cost-effective and highly-simplified as attested by the minimal process steps and 2. 5 -fold reduced IA components in comparison to the conventional ELISA procedure (Tables S 1, S 2). It detects 0. 3 - 81. 0 ng mL- 1 of CRP with linearity in the range of 1 - 81 ng mL- 1 (Figure 2 A). LOD, analytical sensitivity and correlation coefficient (R 2) are determined to be 0. 4 ng mL- 1, 0. 7 ng mL- 1, and 0. 998, respectively (Table S 2). The intraday and interday variability determined from five assay repeats (in triplicate) in a single day and five consecutive days, respectively, are in the ranges of 0. 7 - 10. 8 and 1. 6 - 11. 2, respectively. The developed ELISA can detect the entire pathophysiological range of hsCRP from 3 - 80 µg mL- 1 in human whole blood and serum after appropriate dilution, as demonstrated by the detection of CRP spiked in diluted whole blood and plasma (Figure 2 A). It has high specificity for CRP, as demonstrated by the use of various experimental process controls (Figure 2 B) that shows no detectable interference with the immunological reagents. The optimum duration for the formation of the sandwich immune complex by the one-step kinetics-based procedure is 15 min, while the optimum number of magnet-assisted washings thereafter is only two (Figure S 1). The developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs have the same analytical precision for the detection of CRP in diluted whole blood and serum as the results are in agreement with each other (Table 2). The percentage recovery for the CRP-spiked diluted human whole blood is in the range of 93. 3 - 107. 0 and 94. 0 - 103. 3 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Similarly, the percentage recovery for CRP-spiked diluted human serum ranges from 103. 3 - 108. 0, compared to 93. 3 - 113. 0 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. The results obtained for the detection of CRP in the EDTA plasma samples of patients by the developed ELISA are also in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional ELISA (Table 3). The anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® can be stored for more than 4 months at 4 ºC without compromising the CRP detection response (Figure 2 C). The production variability for the preparation of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads®, using the same lots of Dynabeads® and anti-CRP capture Ab, is less than 3 percent (Figure 2 D). Moreover, the developed ELISA using SA-HRP/biotinylated anti-CRP Ab conjugate is similar to the variant of the developed ELISA procedure that employs the two-step binding of biotinylated anti-CRP Ab and SA-HRP (Figure S 2 A). The one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA solution (comprising anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® and biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab preconjugated to SA-HRP, stored at 4 ºC in BSA-preblocked MTPs) exhibited no noticeable decrease in its functional activity for up to 4 weeks (Figure S 2 B). Therefore, taking into account the attributes of the developed generic sandwich ELISA procedure, it can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. Moreover, it has immense potential for the development of novel and fully automated rapid IVD kits in combination with lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics, nanotechnology and smart system integration. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Schematic of the protocol** ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") One-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure for the rapid detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) (48).

50|$|Many {{buildings}} are built with fire-resistant doors to separate {{different parts of}} buildings and {{to allow people to}} be protected from fire and smoke. When using a cabin hook in such a situation, one should keep in mind that a fire-resistant door is an expensive and heavy item, and it only works as a fire door if it is always closed. To open the often heavy fire door easily, <b>magnetic</b> door <b>holders</b> are used that are released when the buildings electrical fire alarm system is activated by a fire. As cabin hooks must be activated manually, they are inappropriate for fire doors.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of power {{screwdrivers}} range from a simple 'stick'-type with batteries, a motor, and a tip holder all inline, to powerful [...] "pistol" [...] type VSR (variable-speed reversible) Cordless drills that also function as screwdrivers. This is particularly useful as drilling a pilot hole before driving a screw is a common operation. Special combination drill-driver bits and adapters let an operator rapidly alternate between the two. Variations include impact drivers, which provide two types of 'hammering' force for improved performance in certain situations, and [...] "right-angle" [...] drivers for use in tight spaces. Many options and enhancements, such as built-in bubble levels, high/low gear selection, <b>magnetic</b> screw <b>holders,</b> adjustable-torque clutches, keyless chucks, 'gyroscopic' control, etc., are available.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{technological}} problem-solving project-based learning {{for students in}} technology education teacher preparation course to apply their knowledge comprehensively and upgrade their skills efficiently in making things (monodsukwi). The main task is to develop an auxiliary implements for the fixation of wood piece stablely to help disabled students learn sawing operation by fully using their two hands. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>holders</b> were adopted in auxiliary implements as the side-stoppers and end-stopper, so that the wood piece can be easily and immediately fixed or released just by changing over switch to ON or OFF. The validity of the developed auxiliaryimplements was verified by putting it to trial for students in the Secondary Special Support School attached to Faculty of Education, Kumamoto University. Based on {{the responses to the}} questionnaire survey, the positive evaluation was obtained from their comments. "It is a very helpful tool for disabled students to overcome difficulties in wood sawing learning. " "Training by using such functional tool is especially an effective way to stimulate students improveing their literacy and mastering basic knowledge through active learning. " Doubtlessly to say, the usefulness of this tool can also be extended to the ordinary elementary school students and unskilled junior high school students. From the standpoint of finding high quality practical hands-on activities for technology education teacher preparation, this project was successful in collaboration with the school attached to our faculty. The development of the tool to meet the specific educational needs provided a student-centered learning through experiencing the whole monodsukwi processes of motivation, designning, making and evaluation. This approach is an authentic application for pre-service teachers to develop and improve theircapability in technological problem-solving...|$|R
40|$|The Spin {{resolved}} Photoelectron Emission Microscope SPEEM is a {{permanently installed}} {{set up at}} Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin HZB. Due to its specific contrast it is mainly used for magnetic imaging and micro spectroscopy with quantitative analysis. A crucial point in magnetic imaging is the application of magnetic fields. Many experiments require observation of magnetic responses or the preparation of a certain magnetic state during the measurement. We present a dedicated <b>magnetic</b> sample <b>holder</b> combining <b>magnetic</b> field during imaging with additional temperature control. This set up enables SPEEM to measure magnetization curves of individual Fe nanocubes 18 nm 3 in size. If additionally alternating magnetic fields are applied we can image the local magnetic AC susceptibility AC {{as a function of}} temperature. The latter is ideally suited to visualize local variations of the Curie temperature TC in nanoand microstructure...|$|R

In the units used in this paper, the estimates are valid when the parameter measuring {{the strength of the}} applied magnetic field is comparable with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. This completes a previous work by the authors analyzing the case when this strength was much higher.

50|$|Harmonica {{players who}} play the {{instrument}} while performing on another instrument {{with their hands}} (e.g., an acoustic guitar) often use an accessory called a neck rack or harmonica holder to position the instrument {{in front of their}} mouth. A harmonica holder clamps the harmonica between two metal brackets, which are attached to a curved loop of metal that rests on the shoulders. The original harmonica racks were made from wire or coat hangers. Models of harmonica racks vary widely by quality and ease of use, and it quite often takes experimenting with more than one model of harmonica rack to find one that feels suitable for each individual player. This device is used by folk musicians, one-man bands and singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Tom Harmon, Neil Young, Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen and blues singers Jimmy Reed and John Hammond Jr. The HarpArm is a <b>magnetic</b> harmonica <b>holder</b> that attaches to standard straight or boom microphone stands.|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for in situ embedding of tissue culture cells grown on glass. Borysko and Sapranauskas (1) first reported a technic for embedding whole colonies of cells for sectioning in a plane perpendicular to the glass surface. Howatson and Almeida (2), using a modification of Gay's method for smears (3), embedded cells by inverting gelatin capsules, filled with partially polymerized methacrylate, over selected areas of the slide, producing blocks which could be sectioned parallel {{to the surface of the}} glass. The procedures described by Nebel and Minick (4) and by Bloom (5) allow more accurate orientation of capsules over specific cells, but are limited by their equipment to embedding only one field of cells at a time. Nishiura and Rangan (6) recently described a stand constructed for embedding multiple sites with some degree of specificity, and Latta (7) developed a method allowing selection of completely random sites for embedding cultures grown in Petri dishes. Studies by electron microscopy on the effects of enucleation on the morphologic structure of cytoplasm required modification of these methods to permit more flexible independent positioning of small capsules for simultaneous embedding of a number of randomly distributed single enucleate fragments. As many as 15 to 20 fragments can be produced in one culture vessel (8, 9), but for orientation in sectioning only 1 or 2 should be embedded per capsule. The technic described in this report utilizes No. 4 gelatin capsules and a <b>magnetic</b> mounting <b>holder.</b> It allows rapid, accurate location and embedding of single cells or fragments in as many as eight capsules per culture...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} two processes with the Biomek FX robot to construct 454 titanium and Illumina libraries {{in order to}} meet the increasing library demands. All modifications in the library construction steps were made to enable the adaptation of the entire processes to work with the 96 -well plate format. The key modifications include the shearing of DNA with Covaris E 210 and the enzymatic reaction cleaning and fragment size selection with SPRI beads and <b>magnetic</b> plate <b>holders.</b> The construction of 96 Titanium libraries takes about 8 hours from sheared DNA to ssDNA recovery. The processing of 96 Illumina libraries takes less time than that of the Titanium library process. Although both processes still require manual transfer of plates from robot to other work stations such as thermocyclers, these robotic processes represent about 12 - to 24 -folds increase of library capacity comparing to the manual processes. To enable the sequencing of many libraries in parallel, we have also developed sets of molecular barcodes for both library types. The requirements for the 454 library barcodes include 10 bases, 40 - 60 percent GC, no consecutive same base, and no less than 3 bases difference between barcodes. We have used 96 of the resulted 270 barcodes to construct libraries and pool to test the ability of accurately assigning reads to the right samples. When allowing 1 base error occurred in the 10 base barcodes, we could assign 99. 6 percent of the total reads and 100 percent of them were uniquely assigned. As for the Illumina barcodes, the requirements include 4 bases, balanced GC, and at least 2 bases difference between barcodes. We have begun to assess the ability to assign reads after pooling different number of libraries. We will discuss the progress and the challenges of these scale-up processes...|$|R
