5000|$|In certain cases, superconducting magnets {{designed}} for very high currents require extensive bedding in, {{to enable the}} magnets to function at their full planned currents and fields. This is known as [...] "training" [...] the magnet, and involves a type of <b>material</b> <b>memory</b> <b>effect.</b> One situation this is required is {{in the case of}} particle colliders such as CERN's Large Hadron Collider. The magnets of the LHC were planned to run at 8 TeV (2×4 TeV) on its first run and 14 TeV (2×7 TeV) on its second run, but were initially operated at a lower energy of 3.5 TeV and 6.5 TeV per beam respectively. Because of initial crystallographic defects in the material, they will initially lose their superconducting ability ("quench") at a lower level than their design current. CERN states that this is due to electromagnetic forces causing tiny movements in the magnets, which in turn cause superconductivity to be lost when operating at the high precisions needed for their planned current. By repeatedly running the magnets at a lower current and then slightly increasing the current until they quench under control, the magnet will gradually both gain the required ability to withstand the higher currents of its design specification without quenches occurring, and have any such issues [...] "shaken" [...] out of them, until they are eventually able to operate reliably at their full planned current without experiencing quenches.|$|R
