5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E

The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns.

The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921.

5|$|Tides cause {{seawater}} {{to enter}} {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E
5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> object of interest to astronomers.

5|$|Cyclone Amara brought stormy {{conditions}} to Rodrigues in December2013. Amara {{was the first}} named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December14. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December16 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December18. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933mbar (hPa; 27.55inHg) on December21, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale utilized by Météo-France. Shortly after, wind shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in the area, are resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E

5|$|On a {{westerly}} course toward Taiwan {{and eastern}} China, Longwang underwent {{a period of}} rapid intensification from September27–28. At {{the end of this}} phase, the JMA assessed peak winds at 155km/h (100mph) while the JTWC rated it as a Category4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. On September29, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the typhoon the local name Maring as it entered their area of responsibility. The following day, Longwang underwent a structural change, transitioning from asymmetrical banding to symmetrical, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> annular tropical cyclone. During the transition, upper-level divergence and outflow significantly decreased, resulting in temporary weakening of the typhoon. Additionally, an increase in westerly wind shear caused the interior structure to become asymmetric, with a southwest to northeast tilt noted by dropsondes released by the Dropwinsonde Observations for Typhoon Surveillance project. Once the transition into an annular cyclone completed, Longwang re-intensified and attained its peak intensity on October1 while situated 400km (250mi) south of Okinawa. The JMA assessed winds at 175km/h (110mph) along with a barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). The JTWC estimated Longwang to have been slightly stronger, with one-minute sustained winds of 230km/h (145mph).|$|E
