It's not something I seek out for attention, and I've been trying very, very hard {{to get rid of it}} by placing myself in situations where it would be impossible. But, it's not going away; it's haunting me more and more as I get older. Now, the consequences of it are dire, at a time when it's causing me great pain in itself ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Hamilton was booed by the crowd. In the podium interview, conducted by Spanish TV presenter Noemi de Miguel, he shrugged off the reaction, saying: [...] "That's not <b>my</b> <b>problem,</b> it's theirs." [...] Both Hamilton and Verstappen expressed delight at their result, while Räikkönen {{said that it}} had not been an easy day for the team, stressing that Ferrari had not achieved what they could have, since he felt that he could have overtaken Verstappen towards the end. Hamilton's win was the 250th victory by a British driver in Formula One and his first at the Spielberg circuit.|$|E

That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters.

500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... <b>My</b> <b>problem</b> was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{success of}} the {{symbolic}} mathematical computation discipline is striking. The theoretical advances have been continuous and significant: Gröbner bases, the Risch integration algorithm, integer lattice basis reduction, hypergeometric summation algorithms, etc. From the {{beginning in the early}} 1960 s, it has been the tradition of our discipline to create software that makes our ideas readily available to scientists, engineers, and educators: SAC- 1, Reduce, Macsyma, etc. The commercial viability of our system products is proven by Maple and Mathematica. Today’s user communities of symbolic computation systems are diverse: educators, engineers, stock market analysts, etc. The mathematics and computer science in the design and implementation of our algorithms are sophisticated. The research challenges in symbolic computation {{at the close of the}} twentieth century are formidable. I state my favorite eight open problems in symbolic computation. They range from problems in symbolic/numeric computing, symbolic algorithm synthesis, to system component construction. I have worked on seven of <b>my</b> <b>problems</b> and borrowed one from George Collins. I present background to each of <b>my</b> <b>problems</b> and a clear-cut test that evaluates whether a proposed attack has solved one of <b>my</b> <b>problems.</b> An additional ninth open problem by Rob Corless and David Jeffrey on complex function semantics is given in an appendix...|$|R

2500|$|Entwistle's wry and {{sometimes}} dark sense of humour clashed at times with Pete Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who album except for Quadrophenia, he was frustrated at Townshend not {{allowing him to}} sing them himself. As he said, [...] "I got a couple [...] on per album but <b>my</b> <b>problem</b> was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them." [...] This was {{a large part of}} the reason that he became the first member of the band to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall (1971) which featured contributions from Keith Moon, Jerry Shirley, Vivian Stanshall, Neil Innes and the Who's roadie, Dave [...] "Cyrano" [...] Langston.|$|E
2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological. [...] "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that {{this is also a}} socially oriented state of mind that is socially produced and managed." [...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not <b>MY</b> <b>problem,</b> it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement, agreed {{by the new}} {{government}} following the 2010 general election aimed to give MPs a free vote [...] "to express its view" [...] on repealing the Hunting Act 2004 when parliamentary time allowed, possibly in 'early 2012'. The prime minister explained in January 2012 [...] "I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I {{think there should be}} a free vote in the House of Commons.

2500|$|The {{study of}} old {{instruments}} and historic performance practice {{has taught us}} a great deal, but the main point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored. This is proved {{by the fact that}} tempo is described as an independent phenomenon. It is claimed that one of Bach's gavottes must be played fast and another one slowly. But tempo is not independent! … I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also tried to do it with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of [...] "progressive" [...] efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. <b>My</b> <b>problem</b> is more with someone who tries to imitate the sound of that time… ...|$|E

2500|$|In his statements, Goetz {{described}} his past mugging, {{in which he}} was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City [...] "lawless" [...] and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a [...] "joke," [...] a [...] "sham," [...] and [...] "a disgrace". Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being [...] "beaten to a pulp" [...] as well as being robbed. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press. Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, [...] "My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible." [...] Later in the tape, Goetz said, [...] "If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. <b>My</b> <b>problem</b> was I ran out of bullets." [...] He added, [...] "I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys' [...] eyes out with my keys afterwards", but said he stopped when he saw the fear in his eyes. At the criminal trial, Goetz's defense attorneys, Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker, argued that this and other extreme statements by Goetz were the product of emotion and an overactive imagination.|$|E
