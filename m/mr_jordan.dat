5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star. Hitchcock had long {{wanted to make a}} film based on the idea of Hamlet, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him {{to play the role of}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jordan</b> in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E
25|$|Xanadu is {{a musical}} comedy {{with a book}} by Douglas Carter Beane and music and lyrics by Jeff Lynne and John Farrar, based on the 1980 cult classic film of the same name, which was, in turn, {{inspired}} by the 1947 Rita Hayworth film Down to Earth, a sequel to the 1941 movie Here Comes <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jordan,</b> which was an adaptation of the play Heaven Can Wait by Harry Segall. The title is {{a reference to the}} poem Kubla Khan, or A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Xanadu {{is the name of the}} Chinese province where Khan establishes his pleasure garden in the poem.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jordan</b> (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). Beckett {{may or may not}} have seen any of these; at the very least he would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening camera shot of It’s a Wonderful Life dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, dark night sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, Philo broadened {{its range}} of {{activities}} as it became a training ground for essayist Randolph Bourne (Class of 1912), poet A. Joyce Kilmer (Class of 1908), and statesman V.K. Wellington Koo (Class of 1909), all prize winners in their time at Philo. In 1910 the society took a decidedly dramatic turn when it commenced a 20-year stretch of annual theatre productions, ranging from Elizabethan comedies to contemporary works. Many of the older productions, {{by the likes of}} Ben Jonson, Nicholas Udall, and Robert Greene, were North American debuts. Oscar-winning screenwriter Sidney Buchman (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Here Comes <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jordan,</b> Cleopatra) (Class of 1923) got a start playing Shakespeare's Richard II for a Philo production.|$|E

2500|$|William Kirk, {{driver of}} the steam tram car on the Derby-road, was summoned for using abusive and {{threatening}} language to Israel Jordan, {{driver of the}} Nottingham and Bulwell omnibus. Mr. W.H. Stevenson appeared for the complainant and Mr. Barlow for the defendant. Mr. Stevenson said this was another instance in which the Tramway Company endeavoured to monopolise all {{the streets in the}} town. There was a case before the Bench the other week in which the company summoned one of this complainant's drivers for being {{on the wrong side of}} the road. The Bench dismissed the case. The next day <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jordan</b> was driving along Derby-road when the defendant used abusive language to him, and said [...] "You beat us yesterday, but I'll be even with you before the week is out. The first time I meet you I'll knock you and the bus off the road." [...] Defendant also threatened to give complainant a [...] "good hiding". Israel Jordan was then called, and said he was one of the proprietors of the Nottingham and Bulwell Bus. He corroborated the statement of Mr. Stevenson. In reply to Mr. Barlow, he denied that he first used threatening language towards complainant. Frederick Bramley, residing at Hucknall Torkard also corroborated.-- There was a cross summons taken out by Kirk against Jordan for abusive language, and obstructing the steam car. The charge of using abusive language was withdrawn, but the other was proceeded with and Kirk was placed in the witness box. After hearing his evidence, however, the Bench dismissed the summons against Jordan, and fined Kirk 10s. The also expressed a hope that a better feeling would be established between tramcar drivers and conductors and the drivers of other vehicles.|$|E
