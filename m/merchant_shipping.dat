5|$|Near {{the end of}} April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, {{the newest}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there. UB-16 did not sink any more ships for the next eight months.|$|E
5|$|Four of the {{submarines}} began {{operations against}} Allied <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping.</b> I-21 patrolled north of Sydney, while I-24 patrolled south of Sydney.

5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who {{saw it as a}} refuge for British {{warships}} and allied <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping.</b> The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the raid, the five Japanese fleet submarines {{that carried the}} midget submarines to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, between midnight and 02:30 on 8 June, two of the submarines bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, {{the newest}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.

50|$|German {{auxiliary}} cruisers prowled the Atlantic and Indian Oceans {{searching for}} Allied <b>merchant</b> <b>ships.</b> Axis <b>merchant</b> <b>ships</b> overseas {{when the war}} began were used to refuel these auxiliary cruisers, pocket battleships, and long-range U-boats. Any Allied <b>merchant</b> <b>ships</b> captured by German ships could be similarly used for resupply. These Axis-crewed ships pretended to be neutral or Allied <b>merchant</b> <b>ships</b> if they encountered Allied patrols.|$|R

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Provence was in Toulon along with Bretagne in the 2nd Squadron, with Provence serving as the flagship of Vice Admiral Ollive. On 21 October, she went into drydock for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 2 December. Two days later, Provence and Bretagne, along with numerous cruisers and destroyers, sortied from Dakar to cover French <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> off West Africa and the Azores. Around {{the middle of the}} month, the French warships returned to port.|$|E
5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the French Republic {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping.</b> To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Germany {{had begun}} its second {{submarine}} offensive against <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> {{at the end}} of February in reaction to the British blockade of Germany. By early 1916, the British blockade was having an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. UB-17 sank no ships during this offensive, which was called off near the end of April by Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Labour difficulties, late {{delivery}} of equipment, additional requirements for Australian operations, and the prioritisation of <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> over naval construction delayed {{the completion of}} Majestic. Incorporation of the new systems and enhancements caused {{the cost of the}} RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AUÂ£8.3million. Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return Vengeance to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 December 1939, The Times of London {{published}} {{the story of the}} Battle of the River Plate and the demise of , and a few hours later RAF Bomber Command attempted to sink another major warship. In accordance with Operational Order B. 60, dated 17 December, the targets were German warships either in port or at sea. The RAF bombers were ordered to overfly the Heligoland Bight and the port of Wilhelmshaven, attacking ships but avoiding civilian living quarters, <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> or land itself.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the Third Fleet {{and being}} re-designated Task Group 38.4, the force began {{operating}} off the Japanese Home Islands in July 1945. It began an intense airstrike campaign against military targets on Honshu and Hokkaido, striking Japanese airfields, <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping,</b> and ground targets. Radford commanded the force in this duty until V-J Day, {{the end of}} the war in the Pacific. Upon receipt of the orders to end hostilities, he signaled his ships that he was proud of their accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|The IJN's faulty anti-submarine {{doctrine}} {{also contributed}} to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> from submarine attack {{before and during the}} early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{efforts to}} secure New Guinea {{included}} a prolonged submarine offensive against the Allied {{lines of communication}} between the United States and Australia and Australia and New Guinea. These were not the first Axis naval attacks on Australia; during 1940 and 1941 five German surface raiders operated in Australian waters at various times. The German attacks were not successful in disrupting Australian <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping,</b> though Sydney was sunk with the loss her entire crew of 645men in November 1941 in a battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Scandinavian {{trade routes}} were equally {{important}} for the Batavian Navy, and to protect their <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> from attack by British frigates, the Batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the Batavian force was sailing southeast {{along the coast of}} Norway, then part of Danish Norway, tacking to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted approaching from the south.|$|E
5|$|The midget {{submarine}} attacks and subsequent bombardments {{are among the}} best-known examples of Axis naval activity in Australian waters during World War II, and are the only occasion in history when either city has come under attack. The physical effects were slight: the Japanese had intended to destroy several major warships, but sank only an unarmed depot ship and failed to damage any significant targets during the bombardments. The main impact was psychological; creating popular fear of an impending Japanese invasion and forcing the Australian military to upgrade defences, including the commencement of convoy operations to protect <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping.</b>|$|E
5|$|UB-12 sank her largest ship, Silksworth Hall of , on 10 April. The British-registered {{ship was}} en route from Hull to Philadelphia in ballast when Kiel torpedoed her without warning {{a little more than}} one {{nautical}} mile (two kilometers) from the Corton Lightvessel. Other ships picked up 31 survivors from Silksworth Hall, but 3 men were lost. Later in the month, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet, called off the <b>merchant</b> <b>shipping</b> offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.|$|E
