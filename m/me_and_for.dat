25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character.

500|$|After Neil Young {{played a}} few concerts with Pearl Jam and {{recorded}} the album Mirror Ball with them, {{some members of}} the media gave him the title [...] "Godfather of Grunge". This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps—but also his dress and persona. A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "Neurotica was a life changer for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> {{a lot of people in}} the Seattle music community." ...|$|E
500|$|Jam and Lewis {{also asked}} the boy band 98 Degrees to join Carey and Joe on the track, as they wanted male harmonies. Carey talked about the {{collaboration}} {{in an interview with}} MTV.

Windsor had previously never taken {{more than two weeks}} leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor's absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: [...] "This has been a very hard decision for me to make because I'm so happy here on EastEnders but it's been a long time without a proper break.

Santos implemented a new tactical formation based on the 4–4–2 diamond. Benfica played their first game against Swiss second-tier side Stade Nyonnais, beating them by a comfortable margin. They followed this with a win against Shakhtar Donetsk in Yverdon-les-Bains, and a loss against FC Sion at the Stade Tourbillon on 15 July. Benfica returned to Portugal on 16 July; they played a presentation match against Bordeaux on 22 July.

500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used to talk about them [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Bristol, England {{and educated}} in London after {{his family moved}} to colonial South Carolina, Zephaniah Kingsley (1765–1843) {{established}} his career as a slave trader and shipping magnate, which allowed him to travel widely. He settled on Fort George Island in 1814 after leasing it from McIntosh. He purchased the land and buildings for $7,000 in 1817 ($ in 2009). Kingsley owned several plantations around the lower St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, and Drayton Island in central Florida; two of them may have been managed part-time by his wife, a former slave named Anna Madgigine Jai (1793–1870). Kingsley married Anna in 1806 when she was 13 years old, recently arrived in Cuba from West Africa. He freed her in 1811 and charged her with running his Laurel Grove plantation at Doctors Lake in modern-day Orange Park. His legal emancipation submitted to the Spanish colonial government read Let it be known that I ... possessed as a slave a black woman called Anna, around eighteen years of age, bought as a bozal [...] in the port of Havana from a slave cargo, who with the permission of the government was introduced here; the said black woman has given birth to three mulatto children: George, about 3 years 9 months, Martha, 20 months old, an Mary, one month old.
