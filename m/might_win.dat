After he brags about the capture, the reporter suggests his heroics <b>might</b> <b>win</b> him back the affections of Ann (Rashida Jones), his ex-girlfriend, much to Andy's excitement. April (Aubrey Plaza), who has romantic feelings for Andy, overhears this and leaves jealously. Evelyn demands delivery of Fairway Frank. Leslie responds that there is uncertainty about the identity of Fairway Frank. She refuses {{to hand over the}} captured opossum and creates a ketchup-blood diversion so that April can escape with the caged animal.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who <b>might</b> <b>win</b> the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting the {{contract}} was a dangerous tactic and could have broken the union {{if not for the}} support of Vice President Richard Nixon.

25|$|The raids {{and attacks}} of the Reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula created captives {{on both sides}} who were either ransomed or sold as slaves. The Portuguese crown {{extended}} this practice to North Africa. After the attack on Ceuta, the king sought papal recognition of the military action as a Crusade. Such a ruling would have enabled those captured to be legitimately sold as slaves. In response to John's request, Pope Martin V issued the Papal bull Sane charissimus of 4 April 1418, which confirmed to the king all of the lands he <b>might</b> <b>win</b> from the Moors. Under the auspices of Prince Henry the Navigator, voyages were organized to explore the African coast. These led {{to the discovery of}} the uninhabited islands of Madeira in 1417 and the Azores in 1427; all were claimed by the Portuguese crown.|$|E

500|$|In July 1875 Serb {{populations in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, then provinces of the Ottoman Empire, rose in revolt against their Turkish masters, alleging {{religious}} persecution and poor administration. The following January, Sultan Abdülaziz agreed to reforms proposed by Hungarian statesman Julius Andrássy, but the rebels, suspecting they <b>might</b> <b>win</b> their freedom, continued their uprising, joined by militants in Serbia and Bulgaria. The Turks suppressed the Bulgarian uprising harshly, and when reports {{of these actions}} escaped, Disraeli and Derby stated in Parliament {{that they did not}} believe them. Disraeli called them [...] "coffee-house babble" [...] and dismissed allegations of torture by the Ottomans since [...] "Oriental people usually terminate their connections with culprits in a more expeditious fashion".|$|E
500|$|Ohio State had {{similarly}} high pre-season expectations {{with their}} No.4 ranking.

[...] The team featured a [...] "dynamic duo" [...] of wide receivers in Ted Ginn, Jr. and Santonio Holmes. Holmes entered his junior year as the No.1 receiver for the Buckeyes after catching a pass in every game he played during the 2004season; he finished the season with 769yards and seventouchdowns on 55catches.

500|$|Pearson and his Liberals faltered {{badly in}} the campaign. The Liberal Party leader {{tried to make}} an issue {{of the fact that}} Diefenbaker had called a winter election, {{generally}} disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson's objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election. Pearson mocked Diefenbaker's northern plans as [...] "igloo-to-igloo" [...] communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending. The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when he was done. By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he <b>might</b> <b>win</b> the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.|$|E
500|$|In 1939, a {{group of}} Hungarian {{scientists}} that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, [...] "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans {{to the possibility that}} German scientists <b>might</b> <b>win</b> the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon." [...] To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.|$|E

500|$|Bede {{writes that}} after Wulfhere became king: [...] "Free {{under their own}} king, they [...] gave willing {{allegiance}} to Christ their true king, so that they <b>might</b> <b>win</b> his eternal kingdom in heaven". [...] While Wulfhere's father had refused to convert to Christianity, and Peada had apparently converted in order to marry Oswiu's daughter, the date and the circumstances of Wulfhere's conversion are unknown. It {{has been suggested that}} he adopted Christianity as part of a settlement with Oswiu. Bede records that two years before Penda's death, his son Peada converted to Christianity, influenced partly by Oswiu's son Ealhfrith, who had married Peada's sister Cyneburh. Peada brought a Christian mission into Mercia, and it is possible that this was when Wulfhere became a Christian. Wulfhere's marriage to Eormenhild of Kent would have brought Mercia into close contact with the Christian kingdoms of Kent and Merovingian Gaul, which were connected by kinship and trade. The political and economic benefits of the marriage may therefore also have been a factor in Wulfhere's Christianisation of his kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{traveled}} to Rome, Georgia and {{appeared at the}} downtown Holiday Inn in November 1987. During the appearance, he railed against the policies of Washington D.C., commenting {{that there was no}} difference between the two major parties, and that both supported [...] "intervention overseas,... in our personal lives... in the marketplace." [...] Paul went on to compare his Libertarian ideology to the mindset of the founding fathers. The next month, vice presidential nominee Andre Marrou {{traveled to}} Texas and discussed the Paul campaign's prospects. He opined that the ticket could possibly win 2 to 12 million votes in the following year's election, and that Paul <b>might</b> <b>win</b> if Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson were selected as the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. He explained that America did not want a preacher as president. Since the chance that either of those candidates would be named as their party's representative seemed unlikely, by this point in the election one of the campaign's priorities was securing a place on the ballot, which they had done in 20 of the 50 states.|$|E
500|$|In {{his early}} career, Jansch was {{sometimes}} {{characterized as a}} British Bob Dylan. During this period, Jansch described his musical influences as [...] "the only three people that I've ever copied were Big Bill Broonzy, Davy Graham and Archie Fisher." [...] Jansch followed his first album with two more, produced in quick succession: It Don't Bother Me and Jack Orion—which contained his first recording of [...] "Blackwaterside," [...] later to be taken up by Jimmy Page and recorded by Led Zeppelin as [...] "Black Mountain Side." [...] Jansch said, [...] "The accompaniment was nicked by a well-known {{member of one of}} the most famous rock bands, who used it, unchanged, on one of their records." [...] Transatlantic took legal advice about the alleged copyright infringement and were advised that there was [...] "a distinct possibility that Bert <b>might</b> <b>win</b> an action against Page." [...] Ultimately, Transatlantic were dubious about the costs involved in taking on Led Zeppelin in the courts, and half the costs would have had to be paid by Jansch personally, which he simply could not afford, so the case was never pursued. The arrangement and recording of Jack Orion was greatly influenced by Jansch's friend, singer Anne Briggs.|$|E

500|$|The geopolitical {{situation}} tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister BJ Vorster pressured him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola {{would join the}} following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia's position was untenable and that South African interests {{would be better served}} by collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this <b>might</b> <b>win</b> South Africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, saying {{in the run-up to the}} conference that [...] "We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government" [...] and that his government instead favoured [...] "a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians... ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times".|$|E
500|$|Critics, such as Cho Ramaswamy, have {{commented that}} Rajinikanth has the {{potential}} to be successful in Indian politics due to his popularity and fan base alone. In 1995, Rajinikanth began supporting the Indian National Congress after meeting Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. An opinion poll conducted by the magazine Kumudam predicted that Congress, with Rajinikanth's support, <b>might</b> <b>win</b> up to 130 seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. In 1996, when the Congress Party decided to align with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for the assembly election in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth changed loyalties and supported the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) alliance. The TMC used a bicycle as their election symbol and used an image of Rajinikanth riding a bicycle from the film Annamalai in their posters. Rajinikanth said: [...] "Even God cannot save Tamil Nadu if AIADMK returns to power." [...] Rajinikanth wholeheartedly supported the DMK and TMC alliance and asked the people of Tamil Nadu and his fans to vote for that alliance. This alliance had a complete victory in 1996. Rajinikanth also supported the DMK-TMC alliance in the parliamentary election, held the same year. Later in 2004, Rajinikanth said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but would not extend his support to any front during the upcoming Indian general election. The party, however, failed to win any seats in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, Ohio Governor Charles Foster, a Republican who {{had held}} the office since 1880, looked for a Republican {{contender}} to succeed him. [...] Foster had sought increased regulation of the liquor trade, offending many German-Americans, who were deemed likely to vote Democratic in reaction, and who were especially concentrated in Cincinnati. [...] Few expected the Republicans to retain the governorship, and prominent candidates such as Senator John Sherman and Congressman Benjamin Butterworth declined to run. [...] Foster saw Foraker as a candidate likely to do well: [...] he was a Civil War veteran with a good record as a lawyer and a promising public speaker—and his Cincinnati residence <b>might</b> <b>win</b> back some votes. [...] Others agreed; the local United States Attorney wrote to Senator Sherman that the Republicans should nominate [...] "Foraker or some other unobjectionable man". [...] Foster accordingly wrote to Foraker, offering him the chance at [...] "honorable distinction and useful service." [...] Foraker came to Columbus just before the 1883 state convention, and sounded out state Republican leaders such as Sherman and Congressman William McKinley. [...] When Foraker found them willing to support him, he allowed his name {{to be placed in}} nomination, and once it was clear that Sherman would not run, the convention nominated Foraker by acclamation. [...] The Democratic Cincinnati Enquirer summed up the Republican strategy: [...] "They determined to sacrifice as little as possible, so they sacrificed Foraker." ...|$|E
