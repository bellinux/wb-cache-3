5|$|New Mexico {{was part}} of the Marshall Islands {{invasion}} force on 12 January 1944. She shelled Kwajalein and Ebeye from 31 January to 1 February. Replenishing at <b>Majuro,</b> on 20 February the ship shelled Wotje, and then the following month also shelled New Ireland and Kavieng. After that, she sailed to the Solomon Islands to practice the attack on the Mariana Islands, stopping at Sydney, in Australia, on the way.|$|E
5|$|Marshall Islands {{president}} Amata Kabua declared nine islands as disaster areas. United States president George H. W. Bush also {{declared the}} Marshall Islands a disaster area on December16. Despite being an independent nation, the Marshall Islands were eligible {{to the same}} funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a U.S. state or territory. The United States provided a loan of $508,245 (1994USD) for emergency assistance and to train locals to mitigate future events. After the storm, workers near <b>Majuro</b> planted seeds to regrow the damaged crops.|$|E
5|$|New Jerseys next war cruise, 13 April– 4 May 1944, {{began and}} ended at <b>Majuro.</b> She {{screened}} the carrier striking force which gave air {{support to the}} invasion of Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay and Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, 22 April, then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk 29 April– 30 April. New Jersey and her formation shot down two enemy torpedo bombers at Truk. Her 16-inch salvos pounded Ponape 1 May, destroying fuel tanks, badly damaging the airfield, and demolishing a headquarters building.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the Marshall Islands, where 5,000people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of <b>Majuro</b> experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor {{traveling around the}} world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon {{of the year to}} affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during Typhoon Omar earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on Saipan, and heavy rainfall in Okinawa, Japan, caused flooding and power outages.|$|E
5|$|Idaho {{moved to}} Pearl Harbor and then joined the {{invasion}} fleet on 10 November, which then steamed to the Gilbert Islands. They arrived off Makin Atoll on 20 November; Idaho continued {{her role as}} gunfire support {{for the next two}} weeks, shelling Japanese positions in the Gilberts as well as contributing her antiaircraft battery to defend against Japanese aerial attacks. On 5 December, she left the area for Pearl Harbor, where she prepared for the next attack, against the Marshall Islands. On 31 January 1944, Idaho {{and the rest of the}} fleet arrived off Kwajalein to begin the preparatory bombardment. She continued to batter Japanese forces until 5 February, by which time the Marines had wrested control of the small island from its Japanese garrison. Idaho replenished fuel and ammunition at <b>Majuro</b> before returning to shell Japanese positions on other islands in the Marshalls before steaming to Kavieng, New Ireland to conduct a diversionary bombardment on 20 March.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gay first {{affected}} the Marshall Islands, striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On Mejit Island, the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left {{most of the}} islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, Ailuk Atoll experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of <b>Majuro</b> experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the Marshall Islands International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000people homeless across the country, {{but there were no}} native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations. However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of the boat's two sailors.|$|E
25|$|Both ships {{entered the}} lagoon at <b>Majuro</b> the next morning. Subsequently, after her damaged bow was {{temporarily}} reinforced, Washington departed from <b>Majuro</b> on 11 February, bound for Pearl Harbor, Oahu.|$|E
25|$|Arriving back at <b>Majuro</b> on 30 May, Washington again flew Admiral Lee's flag as {{he shifted}} to this {{battleship}} soon after her arrival. Lee, now a Vice Admiral, took the battleship to sea again, departing from <b>Majuro</b> on 7 June and joining Mitscher's TF 58.|$|E

25|$|YMS-263 {{completed}} {{fitting out}} and shakedown in the San Diego, California, area from 15 October to 3 November. She then performed sweeping operations in Los Angeles Harbor until sailing for Kauai, Territory of Hawaii, on 5 January 1944. From Hawaii, the sweeper {{was ordered to}} the Marshall Islands to sweep during the amphibious assault on Kwajalein and <b>Majuro</b> Atolls from 31 January to 8 February. <b>Majuro</b> was the sweeper's main base during the next 11 months. From July to December, she made escort trips to Tarawa and Eniwetok. On 6 December 1944, she was ordered to return to San Pedro, California, via Johnston Island and Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|During her {{remaining}} 22 days on station, Sea Devil attacked several targets, but {{scored on}} none. In mid-October, {{she headed for}} <b>Majuro</b> for refit, and, on 19November, she got underway for the waters west of the Nansei Shoto.|$|E
25|$|Ten days later, Tuna bombarded the {{phosphate}} {{works on}} Fais Island with 24 rounds from her deck gun. After {{the remainder of}} her patrol proved fruitless, the submarine returned to the Marshall Islands arriving at <b>Majuro</b> Atoll on 21 June.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Marianas invasion, however, Healy {{screened}} Enterprise on {{a series}} of raids in the western Pacific designed to aid the coming operations. After a stop at Espiritu Santo the ships struck the Palau Islands 30 March, and after beating off Japanese air raids launched an attack on Yap and Ulithi the next day. Enterprise planes attacked Woleai 1 April 1944, and returned to <b>Majuro</b> five days later. Healy put to sea again 14 April to screen Enterprise during strikes on New Guinea, supporting operations and landings at Tanahmerah Bay. Another heavy raid on the Japanese base at Truk 2930 April completed this highly successful operation, and she returned to <b>Majuro</b> 4 May.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two days, the light cruiser participated in several more shore {{bombardment}} missions against Roi Island in support of amphibious landings made by the Northern Attack Force.

25|$|On 6 January 1944, Marshall {{departed}} New York for Pearl Harbor, {{arriving on}} the 28th. She remained at Pearl Harbor, undergoing further training and providing escort services to battle-damaged ships returning for repairs, until mid-March. Then, with Task Group 58.2 (TG58.2), she sailed for <b>Majuro,</b> arriving on the 20th.|$|E
25|$|During the war, LST-476 was {{assigned}} to the Pacific Theater of Operations.

25|$|The Sopoaga Ministry led by Enele Sopoaga made a {{commitment}} under the <b>Majuro</b> Declaration, which was signed on 5 September 2013, to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy (between 2013 and 2020). This commitment is proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand). The feasibility of wind power generation will be considered.|$|E
25|$|The Hornet {{conducted}} shakedown {{training off}} Bermuda before departing Norfolk on 14 February 1944 {{to join the}} Fast Carrier Task Force on 20 March at <b>Majuro</b> Atoll in the Marshall Islands. After lending air support to protect the invasion beaches in New Guinea, she conducted massive aerial raids against Japanese bases in the Caroline Islands and prepared to support the amphibious assault for the occupation of the Marianas Islands.|$|E
25|$|Marshall island women swim in muumuus {{which are}} made of a fine {{polyester}} that quickly dries. In the capital of <b>Majuro,</b> revealing cocktail dresses are inappropriate for both islanders and guests. With the increasing influence of Western media, the younger generation may wear shorts, though the older generation equates shorts with loose morals. T-shirts, jeans, skirts, and makeup are making their way via the media to the islands.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of {{intensive}} training and preparation, she departed <b>Majuro</b> on 6 June for {{the invasion of the}} Marianas, a spectacular amphibious operation to be carried out nearly 1,000 miles (1,800km) from the nearest advance base, Eniwetok. Again acting as screening ship for the carriers, Healy supported softening-up raids 11–15 June and protected them during the period of direct support as Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner's Marines went ashore on Saipan on 15 June.|$|E
25|$|Hall next {{joined the}} escort {{for a group}} of 12 fleet oilers whose job it was to supply vital fuel to units of the 5th Fleet during the Marianas operations. She made two {{fuelling}} voyages from <b>Majuro</b> to the Marianas, then shifted her base to Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, on 26 August to screen refuelling and replacement units during the operations for the capture of the Carolines. Hall continued this duty until 24 November.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen days later, sailing with TG 53.5, {{she began}} to make {{her way back to}} the Marshalls. Detached on 29 January 1944, Mobile, with other of Cruiser Division 13 (CruDiv 13), bombarded Wotje and then rejoined their task force for the assault and {{occupation}} of Kwajalein. Until 6 February, she performed fire support and carrier screening duties off Roi and Namur. She then proceeded to <b>Majuro</b> where, on 12 February, she joined TF 58.|$|E
25|$|From Funafuti, Phaon {{advanced}} westward to <b>Majuro</b> in the Marshall Islands, arriving 6 February 1944, {{shortly after}} the invasion. Here, in the same harbor {{with one of the}} mightiest fleets ever assembled, Phaon worked on minelayers, tankers, minesweepers, destroyers, and small boats (LCVPs and LCMs). On 18 March 1944, Phaon weighed anchor again, proceeded via Kwajalein to Eniwetok in the Marshalls, arriving 23 March for repair work on small boats, LCTs, and yard minesweepers.|$|E
25|$|Underway {{again on}} the 22nd, TheSullivans covered the sortie of Task Groups 58.2, 58.9, and 50.15 from <b>Majuro,</b> bound for the Palaus, Yap, and Woleai Islands. On {{the evening of the}} 29th, while the American {{warships}} were approaching the target area, enemy aircraft attacked but were driven off by the anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The next day, TheSullivans screened the carriers during air strikes and that evening helped to beat off a Japanese air attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} the fast carrier forces had by this time evolved into sealing off {{designated}} enemy-held atolls and islands which the Allies intended to take and interdicting others to isolate and keep to a minimum Japanese resistance at the target. Now a third mission was to be added, the pounding of major enemy bases {{without the aid of}} land-based aircraft, leaving little or no need for a return visit. Thus, to ease the occupation of Eniwetok and to aid in the encirclement of Rabaul, TF 58 departed <b>Majuro</b> and sailed for the Carolines. On 16–17 February, they devastated Truk, the best fleet anchorage in the Mandated Territories, the base of the Japanese combined fleet and the center for air and sea communications between Japan and the Bismarck Archipelago. The force then sailed northwest to the Mariana Islands for strikes on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, encountering heavy aerial resistance there on 21–22 February. After a brief respite for replenishment at <b>Majuro,</b> Mobile sailed to Espiritu Santo, where the ships of TG 58.1 were reorganized as TG 36.1 on 12 March. On 15 March, they steamed northwest to cover Marine forces as they landed on Emirau on 20 March.|$|E
25|$|Kenmore loaded cargo and {{departed}} Oakland, California, 22 November 1943, arriving Pearl Harbor on 1 December.

25|$|Four {{district}} {{centers in}} <b>Majuro,</b> Ebeye, Jaluit, and Wotje provide local government. Each district elects a council and mayor and may appoint local officials. The district centers are {{funded by the}} national government and by local revenues. There are two political parties. Elections are held every four years. In 2011 Nishma Jamore was elected mayor of the district representing the Bikini people. Council members are elected from two wards on Ejit Island (three seats) and Kili Island (12 seats).|$|E
25|$|Training {{with the}} 4th Marine Division followed, and on 13 January 1944, she sailed west, {{screening}} Task Force 53 (TF 53), the Northern Attack Force {{for the invasion}} of the Marshalls. From 29 January, when Wotje was bombarded, until 5 February, when Remey struck an uncharted reef, she screened the transports and Carrier Division 22 (CarDiv 22) and provided gunfire support for the troops fighting for Kwajalein. On the 6th, she got underway for <b>Majuro,</b> thence proceeded to Pearl Harbor for repairs.|$|E
25|$|Initially at <b>Majuro,</b> San Francisco {{shifted to}} Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, {{departed}} that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment {{group of the}} Saipan invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling Tinian, and after the landings on Saipan shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard Guam. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, LST-29 was {{assigned}} to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the following operations: the Gilbert Islands operation during the battle of Tarawa in November and December 1943; the Marshall Islands operation during the occupation of Kwajalein and <b>Majuro</b> Atolls in January and February 1944, and the occupation of Eniwetok Atoll in February March 1944; the Marianas operation during the capture and occupation of Guam in July and August 1944; and the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto in May 1945.|$|E
