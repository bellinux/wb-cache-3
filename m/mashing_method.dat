Therefore, modification of <b>mashing</b> <b>method</b> and Neutrase®; addition were proposed to increase rice/barley malt ratio. Total protein contents of four rice cultivars determined by Kjeldahl method were in a range of 6. 53 - 7. 49 % (w/w). Amount of Neutrase® and mashing time for increasing protein were determined by mashing at 52 °C and found that increasing of mashing time increased soluble nitrogen and Free Alpha Amino Nitrogen (FAN) in wort more than 30 % and 70 %, respectively. The proper mashing time was 60 min and the appropriate amount of Neutrase®; was 400 μl per 50 g rice. In addition, activation of Termamyl SC®; at 950 C for 20 min also influenced more solubilized protein in rice cooking step. Afterward, the appropriate mashing program was evaluated in various rice/barley malt ratios. The qualified wort contained at least 150 mg/L FAN were obtained from wort used rice up to 80 % and had satisfied fermentation performance. Therefore, Neutrase®; addition plus modification <b>mashing</b> <b>method</b> could be one solution for increasing rice/barley malt ratio...|$|E

50|$|Brewing {{in a bag}} (BIAB) is a {{technique}} developed in Australia. The main pioneer and continuing authority on this method is Patrick Hollingdale. The hallmarks of BIAB are a single brewing vessel, a fine mesh bag to hold the grist (crushed malt/grain) and a single heat source. The bag, usually made of nylon or fashioned out of a finely woven material lines the brewing pot which contains the total volume of water needed for the entire brewing process. The water is then heated to strike temperature and then the grist is added. The traditional brewing technique of sparging (rinsing the grains) is skipped and after the mashing period is complete (typically 60-90 minutes) the grain bag, holding the spent grains, is removed (lautering). The all-grain brewing process then proceeds as normal: boiling, cooling, pitching and fermenting. Traditional <b>mashing</b> <b>methods</b> require three vessels and, at least, two heat sources. Brew in a bag has revolutionised home all-grain brewing as batch sizes of 9L (2.5 Gal) through to 45.5L (12 US Gal) of wort into fermenter are easily employed without any compromising on quality or versatility.|$|R

40|$|There is a need for fast, {{cheap and}} {{sufficient}} accurate methods for prediction of barley grain quality. The determination of Brabender hardness {{seems to be}} promising. The aim of this work was to compare three different methods for evaluation of graphic output from Brabender farinograph and subsequently select the most optimal method for routine laboratory work. 108 samples (twelve cultivars from three localities and three years) were analyzed for grain hardness. Simultaneously selected parameters of grain and malt were determined. The correlations among methods for evaluation were estimated as well as among selected technological traits of barley grain and malt. Grain hardness expressed by area under curve (counted by specific weight of paper ´A´ and measured by planimetr ´B´) showed tendencies to distinguish the varieties by their malting quality. The same trend was not observed for the method C (hardness expressed by maximum value of peak). Nearly perfect positive correlation (0. 99 ***) {{was found between the}} results of method A and method B. Medium correlation was found between values obtained by method A and method C (0. 58 ***). Significant correlations were established between values obtained by method A and extract (− 0. 63 ***), <b>mash</b> <b>method</b> according to Hartong and Kretschmer (− 0. 61 ***), the Kolbach index (− 0. 70 ***), friability (− 0. 71 ***), β-glucans in wort (0. 76 ***), partly unmodified grains (0. 71 ***), and non-starch polysaccharides content (in total β-glucans and pentosans) (0. 67 ***). Hardness values obtained by method C were related to partly unmodified grains (0. 52 **), β-glucans in grain (0. 61 **), and non-starch polysaccharides content (in total β-glucans and pentosans) (0. 56 **).

40|$|Gushing is the {{spontaneous}} and wild overfoaming of over-carbonated beverages that {{occurs at the}} opening of the container without any shaking. Primary gushing is related to raw material contaminated by filamentous fungi. These latter produce amphiphilic proteins called hydrophobins that interact with carbon dioxide bubbles to produce overfoaming at the opening. Up to now, to determine the gushing tendency of a malt batch, most beer producers have used the Modified Carlsberg Test (MCT), where a determined volume of sparkling water is replaced by the same volume of an aqueous malt extract. However the precision and the reproducibility of this methodology have been subject to controversy. Recently a new method based on the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was developed in our lab to characterize the primary gushing potential of carbonated beverages. This technique was first applied only on the final product, i. e. bottled or canned beer. It appeared that the main difference between a gushing and a non-gushing beer was the presence of particles with a diameter around 100 nm only in the gushing beer. The objective of the present work was then to apply this new method on earlier stage products of the malting and brewing processes. The Congress <b>Mash</b> <b>method</b> was used to produce wort from non-contaminated and contaminated malts and from a blend of non-contaminated malt and contaminated barley. The MCT was carried out by replacing 20 mL of sparkling water from a 1 L bottle (7 g CO 2 /L) by 20 mL of the worts obtained from the different malt and barley samples. After three-day agitation (horizontal, 150 rpm, 20 °C), the bottles were opened and the overfoaming amount was determined by weighing. The wort/sparkling water samples were then centrifuged (4, 000 × g, 10 minutes) and naturally degassed (i. e. at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure) until the CO 2 concentration reached approximately 1. 7 g CO 2 /L (equilibrium value at 25 °C and under atmospheric pressure). After degassing, the size of particles present in the different samples was determined by DLS. The MCT results showed that worts produced from contaminated raw material (i. e. contaminated malt or blend of non-contaminated malt and contaminated barley) had a clear gushing tendency and DLS allowed to detect the presence of particles with a diameter around 100 nm only in these gushing samples. Our results thus tend to confirm the applicability of DLS as a new method to characterize the primary gushing potential of raw materials. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of different bilberry <b>mash</b> treatment <b>methods,</b> i. e. heat treatment, enzymatic treatment and combined treatment (enzymatic maceration preceded by heat treatment) on total phenolics, anthocyanin profile and ascorbic acid as well as on DPPH’ and OH’ radical scavenging activity of juices. Three fractions of juice containing different groups of phenolic compounds were evaluated. Enzymatic maceration of fruit mash was carried out using three enzymatic preparations: Pektopol PT- 400, Pectinex BE Colour and Gammapect LC Color. Juices obtained by combined treatment of fruit mash (enzymatic maceration preceded by heat treatment) were the richest source of total phenolics, the concentration of which ranged from 2304 to 4418 mg l− 1 in these juices. These juices showed also the strongest DPPH’ and OH’ radical scavenging activity. Juices produced from fruit mash subjected to enzymatic maceration contained the highest amount of anthocyanins. The juices differed considerably with regard to their anthocyanin profile, determined by HPLC. Ascorbic acid content was at a comparable level in all juices, and varied between 13. 5 and 16. 9 mg/ 100 g. Fraction I, containing mostly anthocyanins, showed the highest DPPH⤙ and OH⤙ radical scavenging activity, while fraction III, dominated by phenolic acids, was found to be the least active. ...|$|R
40|$|Taxi trajectories reflect human {{mobility}} {{over the}} urban roads’ network. Although taxi drivers cruise {{the same city}} streets, there is an observed variation in their daily profit. To reveal the reasons behind this issue, this study introduces a novel approach for investigating and understanding the impact of human mobility patterns (taxi drivers’ behavior) on daily drivers’ profit. Firstly, a K-means clustering method is adopted to group taxi drivers into three profitability groups according to their driving duration, driving distance and income. Secondly, the cruising trips and stopping spots for each profitability group are extracted. Thirdly, a comparison among the profitability groups in terms of spatial and temporal patterns on cruising trips and stopping spots is carried out. The comparison applied various <b>methods</b> including the <b>mash</b> map matching <b>method</b> and DBSCAN clustering method. Finally, an overall analysis of the results is discussed in detail. The results {{show that there is}} a significant relationship between human mobility patterns and taxi drivers’ profitability. High profitability drivers based on their experience earn more compared to other driver groups, as they know which places are more active to cruise and to stop and at what times. This study provides suggestions and insights for taxi companies and taxi drivers in order to increase their daily income and to enhance the efficiency of the taxi industry...|$|R
40|$|Toasting time (TT) of {{rapeseed}} meal (RSM), {{the diet}} processing (DP) method {{and the interaction}} between both on the apparent CP digestion along the gastrointestinal tract and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of amino acids of growing pigs were investigated. The experiment consisted of a 3 × 3 factorial design of TT of RSM (0, 60 and 120 min) and DP <b>method</b> (<b>mash,</b> pelleting and extrusion). In total, 81 boars with a starting BW of 20 kg were euthanized 4 h after their last feeding. The gastrointestinal tract was dissected and the small intestine divided in three sections of similar length. Samples were collected from the stomach, 1. 5 m from the ends {{of each of the}} three sections of the small intestine, and the rectum. The apparent digestibility (AD) of CP for each of the small intestine sections was used to calculate the rate of CP digestion. Increasing the TT of RSM resulted in lower protein solubility, lower lysine/reactive lysine contents and higher protein denaturation, indicative of the occurrence of protein aggregation and Maillard reactions. There were significant effects (P⩽ 0. 01) of TT on the AD of CP in the different sections of the gastrointestinal tract. The rate of CP digestion of the 0 min toasted RSM diets was 23 % and 35 % higher than that of the 60 and 120 min toasted RSM diets, respectively. There was a significant interaction (P= 0. 04) between TT and DP for the AID of CP. Although pelleting of the 0 and 60 min toasted RSM diets did not change the AID of CP with respect to the mash diets, pelleting of the 120 min toasted RSM diet increased the AID of CP by 9. 3 % units. Extrusion increased the AID of CP of the 0 and 60 min toasted RSM diets by 3. 4 % and 4. 3 % units with respect to the mash diets, whereas extrusion of the 120 min toasted RSM diet increased the AID of CP by 6. 9 % units. Similar positive effects of pelleting and extrusion were obtained for the AID of lysine and reactive lysine, especially in the diets with higher TT. In conclusion, processing (pelleting and extrusion) of RSM containing diets can ameliorate the negative effects of RSM toasting on protein and amino acid digestibility; these effects were larger for the RSM toasted for longer times...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the deleterious impact of copyright law on music creation. It highlights hip hop music {{as an example of}} a genre significantly and negatively impacted by 1) the per se infringement rule applied in some instances to cases involving unauthorized sampling of sound recordings; and 2) traditional (and arguably erroneous) assumptions in copyright law and policy of independent creation and Romantic authorship. For decades hip hop producers have relied on the innovative use of existing recordings (most of which are protected by copyright), to create completely new works. Specifically, cuttin’ and scratchin’, digital sampling, looping and (most recently) <b>mashing</b> are all <b>methods</b> of creating music and are all integral parts of the hip hop music aesthetic. Collectively these creative processes are the hallmark of the type of innovation and creativity born out of the hip hop music tradition. And hip hop artists and producers from Chuck D, Queen Latifah, A Tribe Called Quest and M. C. Lyte to The RZA, Missy Elliott, Dangermouse and Jay Z have employed the sampler more as a musical instrument or palette than a tool of expediency or theft. But when done without thepermission of the borrowed work’s copyright holder, sampling is at odds with copyright law. Unfortunately, copyright fails to acknowledge the historical role, informal norms and value of borrowing, cumulative creation and citation in music. Additionally, different copyright infringement standards are applied to the two types of music copyright (the musical composition and sound recording). Further, and arguably more troubling, different infringement standards are being applied by the circuits to sound recording infringement cases resulting in a split in the circuits. The per se infringement rule articulated in the leading digital sampling case, Bridgeport v. Dimension Films (410 F. 3 d 792), as compared to a recent decision with analogous facts but an opposite outcome under a traditional infringement analysis in Saregama India Ltd. v. Mosley (687 F. Supp. 2 d 1325), is but one poignant example. Courts in the Sixth Circuit apply a per se infringement standard when a defendant copies any part of a sound recording. By contrast, courts in the Eleventh Circuit consider substantial similarity and the de minimis defense traditionally applied in all infringement cases. These differences, in turn, have lead to unclear judicial definitions, distinctions and interpretations for the role of substantial similarity and what constitutes a de minimis use, a fair use, and a derivative work. The resulting incongruent decisions reflect an inconsistent application of federal law. This inconsistency threatens to diminish both the quality and quantity of second-generation cumulative musical works. Accordingly, copyright law’s fragmented application is proving troublesome forthe music industry, generally, and for music genres like hip hop in particular. Ultimately, this article suggests that music copyright reform is needed and, perhaps, inevitable as technology continues to outpace and stress the law just as the law continues to stress and under-perform in balancing the rights/access continuum. To that end, this article posits that any fix should sample patent to remix copyright. By this I mean music copyright reform should consider and incorporate policies supporting reverse engineering in the patent context, which encourages and values cumulative creation to bolster innovation. Intellectual property should be most narrowly tailored when innovation in the field tends to be highly cumulative. Such is the case in the creation of music. The need for narrowly-tailored intellectual property laws is especially valid in light of the essential role to both of access to first-generation works and a firmly established custom of borrowing in the creative process. Therefore, copyright law must be remixed to achieve an optimal balance between a copyright holder’s exclusive rights and the legal space a second generation innovator needs to build upon existing works in order to create new ones in cumulative creative genres like music...|$|R
