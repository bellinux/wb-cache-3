5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical <b>mammalian</b> <b>cell</b> (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{pores are}} highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical <b>mammalian</b> <b>cell</b> contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear pores, {{which provide}} aqueous {{channels}} through the envelope, {{are composed of}} multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9nm wide, due {{to the presence of}} regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical <b>mammalian</b> <b>cell</b> will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} intracellular distribution of avian reovirus (ARV) core protein sigmaA in cells of avian and mammalian origin revealed that, whereas the viral protein accumulates in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of avian cells, most sigmaA concentrates in the nucleoplasm of <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> in tight association with the insoluble nuclear matrix fraction. Our results further showed that sigmaA becomes arrested in the nucleoplasm of <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> via association with mammalian cell-specific factors and that this association prevents nucleolar targeting. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity, but not of RNA polymerase I activity, in infected <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> induces nucleus-to-cytoplasm sigmaA translocation through a CRM 1 - and RanGTP-dependent mechanism, yet a heterokaryon assay suggests that sigmaA does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

40|$|The Notch {{signaling}} pathway is important for cell fate decisions in embryonic development and adult life. Defining the functional importance of the Notch pathway in these contexts requires the elucidation of essential signal transduction components {{that have not been}} fully characterized. Here, we show that Rabconnectin- 3 B is required for the Notch pathway in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells.</b> siRNA-mediated silencing of Rabconnectin- 3 B in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> attenuated Notch signaling and disrupted the activation and nuclear accumulation of the Notch target Hes 1. Rabconnectin- 3 B knockdown also disrupted V-ATPase activity in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells,</b> consistent with previous observations in Drosophila.

25|$|When {{microorganisms}} {{are able}} to take up and replicate DNA from their local environment, the process is termed transformation, and cells that are in a physiological state such that they can take up DNA {{are said to be}} competent.

25|$|In addition, {{there are}} also other factors that will affect the selectivity. It’s well known that {{cholesterol}} is normally widely distributed in the <b>mammalian</b> <b>cell</b> membranes as a membrane stabilizing agents but absent in bacterial cell membranes; {{and the presence of}} these cholesterols will also generally reduce the activities of the antimicrobial peptides, due either to stabilization of the lipid bilayer or to interactions between cholesterol and the peptide.

40|$|AbstractInfectious {{bronchitis}} virus (IBV) 3 b {{protein is}} highly conserved among group 3 coronaviruses, {{suggesting that it}} is important for infection. A previous report (Virology 2003, 311 : 16 – 27) indicated that transfected IBV 3 b localized to the nucleus in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> using a vaccinia-virus expression system. Although we confirmed these findings, we observed cytoplasmic localization of IBV 3 b with apparent exclusion from the nucleus in avian cells (IBV normally infects chickens). IBV 3 b was virtually undetectable by microscopy in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> transfected without vaccinia virus and in IBV-infected <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> because of a greatly reduced half-life in these cells. A proteasome inhibitor stabilized IBV 3 b in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells,</b> but had little effect on IBV 3 b in avian cells, suggesting that rapid turnover of IBV 3 b in <b>mammalian</b> <b>cells</b> is proteasome-dependent while turnover in avian cells may be proteasome-independent.

25|$|In contrast, {{the outer}} part of the {{membranes}} of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges {{since most of the}} lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes. Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, even though {{a small portion of the}} membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged gangliosides. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of <b>mammalian</b> <b>cell</b> membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding. However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.|$|E
25|$|For ricin to {{function}} cytotoxically, RTA must be reductively cleaved from RTB {{in order to}} release a steric block of the RTA active site. This process is catalysed by the protein PDI (protein disulphide isomerase) that resides in the lumen of the ER. Free RTA in the ER lumen then partially unfolds and partially buries into the ER membrane, where it is thought to mimic a misfolded membrane-associated protein. Roles for the ER chaperones GRP94, EDEM and BiP have been proposed prior to the 'dislocation' of RTA from the ER lumen to the cytosol {{in a manner that}} utilizes components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. ERAD normally removes misfolded ER proteins to the cytosol for their destruction by cytosolic proteasomes. Dislocation of RTA requires ER membrane-integral E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, but RTA avoids the ubiquitination that usually occurs with ERAD substrates because of its low content of lysine residues, which are the usual attachment sites for ubiquitin. Thus, RTA avoids the usual fate of dislocated proteins (destruction that is mediated by targeting ubiquitinylated proteins to the cytosolic proteasomes). In the <b>mammalian</b> <b>cell</b> cytosol, RTA then undergoes triage by the cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and their co-chaperones, as well as by one subunit (RPT5) of the proteasome itself, that results in its folding to a catalytic conformation, which de-purinates ribosomes, thus halting protein synthesis.|$|E
