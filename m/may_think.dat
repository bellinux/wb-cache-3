5|$|Gentlemen may tither, and tither, and tither, and <b>may</b> <b>think</b> it a bad measure; {{but their}} heads at present are hot, and will so remain till they grow cool again, {{and so they}} can't decide right now, but when the day of {{judgement}} comes then honourable gentlemen will be satisfied with this most excellent union.|$|E
5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E
5|$|Some poetry {{types are}} {{specific}} to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of {{abstract}} algebra, since the positive real numbers form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, equation (4) implies that we <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of absolute value as an endomorphism of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} a number of earlier towers in Guernsey (the Guernsey {{loophole}} towers), that many people refer to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of them as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.|$|E

25|$|Social action models {{help explain}} Social Outcomes because of basic sociological ideas {{such as the}} Looking Glass Self. The idea of Cooley's looking glass self is that our sense of self {{develops}} as we observe and reflect upon others and what they <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of our actions. Additionally, impression formation processes allow us to interpret the significance of others' actions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{roles and}} {{responsibilities}} include publicising, through advertisements or otherwise, the nature, origin and qualities of material falling within the definition of Harris Tweed and registering and maintaining {{in any part of}} the world intellectual property rights including patents, trade marks and other marks and designs, and to authorise the user of such intellectual property on such lawful terms and conditions as the Authority <b>may</b> <b>think</b> fit.|$|E
25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker <b>may</b> <b>think</b> he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks {{they are in the}} bathroom, and {{therefore}} urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating on the sofa and simply urinating {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|E

25|$|Kappa legends {{are said}} {{to be based on the}} Japanese giant {{salamander}} or hanzaki, an aggressive salamander that grabs its prey with its powerful jaws. Other theories suggest they are based on historical sightings of the now extinct Japanese river otter as seen from a distance, otters have been known to stand upright and a drunk, frightened or hallucinating person <b>may</b> <b>think</b> they are seeing a humanoid entity and not a wild animal.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party <b>may</b> <b>think</b> negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E
25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different {{from what it was}} in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; it means that we <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

25|$|The {{substance}} of your answer was: That many people exhort others to charity from self-interest; that men of fortune must mind their fortune; that you cannot go about {{to look for}} poor people; {{that when you have}} seen them your-self, and relieved them, they were scarce ever satisfied; that many make an ill use of what you give them; that you cannot trust the account people give of themselves by letters; that nevertheless you do give to private persons by the hands of Colonel Hudson and others; that you have also given to several hospitals an hundred pounds at a time, but that you must support your family; that the Lowther family has continued above four hundred years; that you are for great things -- for public charities and for saving the nation from ruin; and that others <b>may</b> <b>think</b> as they please, but this is your way of thinking, and has been for many years...|$|E

500|$|After {{the guitar}} riffs, Michele sings about {{becoming}} a future superstar, [...] "Yeah, you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> that I'm a zero/ But hey, everyone you wanna be/ Probably started off like me". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see you when you wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner now who never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E

500|$|Advocates {{also believe}} that {{destroying}} ivory can influence the supply side of the ivory market by sending a strong, highly visible and well-publicized message that the ivory market is dangerous and futile. Similarly, those who would otherwise consider ivory as an investment opportunity <b>may</b> <b>think</b> twice if the market is so consistently disrupted. French Minister of Ecology Philippe Martin called the destruction of ivory [...] "indispensable {{in the fight against}} trafficking of threatened species" [...] and said that it sends [...] "a firm message".|$|E
500|$|Marshall and Nichols {{discovered}} that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require [...] of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with Under Secretary of the Treasury Daniel W. Bell and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository. [...] "Young man," [...] Bell told him, [...] "you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> of silver in tons but the Treasury will always think of silver in troy ounces!" [...] Eventually, [...] were used.|$|E
500|$|From the verse's opening A major chord, {{the melody}} {{moves to a}} ii minor voicing, {{rendered}} as B minor 7/11 through {{the inclusion of a}} low-register E note. In his lyrics, Harrison acknowledges the apparent awkwardness of such a change, singing [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> the chords are going wrong" [...] and, in the final verse, that the harmony might be [...] "a little dark and out of key". Musicologist Alan Pollack considers the song's music and lyrical message to be [...] "uncannily in tune" [...] with one another, a combination that is accentuated by surprising and irregular phrase-lengths in the verses.|$|E
