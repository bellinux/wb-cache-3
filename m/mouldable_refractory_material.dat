40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} the corrosion and wear of <b>refractory</b> <b>materials</b> is indisputable because these processes determine the viability of any high-temperature liner used in metallurgical processes. The degradation mechanism of lining <b>materials</b> (<b>refractory</b> bricks) in contact with corrosive gases can be studied by examining the penetration rate or the chemical corrosion that results from the circulation of the atmosphere over the <b>refractory</b> <b>material</b> (by diffusional and convective transport). During the sintering of steel containing Mn the high vapour pressure of Mn enables its sublimation during thermal cycling; therefore, Mn is incorporated into the sintering atmosphere. Although the diffusion of Mn in steel samples is beneficial, the presence of Mn in a sintering atmosphere can modify the composition of refractory components. As a result of atmosphere-refractory interactions, a new phase is formed.

This degradation is costly as well as dangerous for launch infrastructure, crew and vehicle. FF is applied at the pad via the gunnite process, where wetted <b>refractory</b> <b>material</b> is sprayed onto a steel grid mounted on a support structure.
