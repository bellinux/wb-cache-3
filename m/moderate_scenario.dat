After outlining why conventional single-path channel tracking algorithms fail in such scenarios, several new estimation algorithms are developed that are tailored to channels with closely spaced multipaths. This is achieved by removing or minimizing self-interference caused by multipath components. Other interfering users are treated as noise. Both timing tracking and phasor tracking and their interaction are covered in this paper. The derived algorithms are benchmarked against perfect channel knowledge on one hand and conventional tracking algorithms on the other hand, both in a UMTS test <b>scenario.</b> In <b>moderate</b> <b>scenarios,</b> the use of these new algorithms leads to performance improvements of up to 2 dB, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at moderate bit error rates, and even manages to track the channel in conditions where conventional tracking algorithms fail completely.

Using regional land cover reconstructions from historical records, with a bookkeeping model, we estimated the carbon sink changes caused by historical cropland expansion in Northeast China during the past 300 years. The conclusions are as follows: (1) There was a dramatic land reclamation of cropland during the past 300 years in Northeast China. Approximately 26 % of the natural land was cultivated, and 38 % of the grassland and 20 % of the forest and shrubland were converted to cropland. (2) The carbon emission induced by cropland expansion between 1683 and 1980 was 1. 06 - 2. 55 Pg C, and the estimation from the <b>moderate</b> <b>scenario</b> was 1. 45 Pg C. The carbon emissions of the soil carbon pool was larger than that from the vegetation carbon pool and comprised more than 2 / 3 of the total carbon emissions. (3) The carbon emissions of the three provinces in Northeast China were different. Heilongjiang Province had the largest carbon emissions, and Jilin Province had the second largest emissions. (4) The primary source of carbon emissions was forest reclamation (taking 60 % of the total emissions in the <b>moderate</b> <b>scenario),</b> the secondary source was grassland cultivation (taking 27 %), and the tertiary sources were shrubland and wetland reclamation (taking 13 %). Examination on the data accuracy revealed that the high-resolution regional land cover data allowed the carbon budget to be evaluated at the county level and improved the precision of the results. The carbon emission estimation in this study was lower than those in previous studies because of the improved land use data quality and various types of land use change considered. 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|For {{six major}} {{regions of the}} world, ten {{alternative}} scenarios on future fertility and mortality trends are defined and projections performed from the base year 1985 up to the year 2100. Because of the great inertia of population changes, for the next 20 - 30 years the scenarios based on widely diverging assumptions do not produce very different patterns. In the longer run, however, the assumption of constant fertility and mortality rates resulting in continued exponential growth yields a total population size of 15 billion in 2050 and even 39 billion in 2100. The immediate replacement fertility scenario, on the other hand, would result in 7. 5 billion by 2050. This still means an addition {{of more than two}} billion people to today's population of 5. 3, which is entirely due to the momentum of population growth.

40|$|The native Inupiaq {{community}} of Shaktoolik, in northwestern Alaska, {{is located on}} a low-lying barrier spit in Norton Sound. The inhabited portion of the spit is 7. 1 m above MLLW at its highest and only ~ 200 m across. The community is vulnerable to marine flooding on both the open ocean and lagoon sides of the spit during large storms. Storm events in this region typically occur during {{the fall and winter}} months, often when the coastline is protected from flooding and erosion by shorefast ice. High latitudes are experiencing the greatest increases in temperature due to global warming and the reduced duration and extent of sea ice is affecting Alaskan coastal communities. Continued reduction of sea ice, which typically protects the coastline from exposure during large storm events in late fall and winter, may result in the need to relocate many Native Alaskan coastal settlements. The goal {{of this study was to}} quantify changes in storm surge and wave runup during ice-free months for the mid- to late- 21 st century. A combination of field data, including beach profiles, offshore bathymetry, debris line position, and sediment grain size, as well as modeled meteorological data were used to address the research goals. An analytical approach was developed to quantify storm surge in Alaskan coastal communities with historical meteorological data from the North American Regional Reanalysis. This analytical model was used to calculate projected storm surge flooding levels in Shaktoolik for the mid- and late- 21 st century for both a moderate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 respectively), with meteorological output from the MIROC 5 global climate model. Additionally, projected wave runup heights during storm events were determined numerically using WAVEWATCH III to calculate wave height and period from the projected MIROC 5 meteorological data and SBEACH to model the maximum runup heights along the Shaktoolik shoreline. Total storm water levels (storm surge plus wave runup height) were calculated for 236 projected storm events in the Bering Sea and used to find the return periods of flooding for each emissions scenario. When compared to modeled historic storm surge, the results show that the <b>moderate</b> emissions <b>scenario</b> is similar to the historical. The 100 -yr surge level is + 6. 3 m above MLLW for the <b>moderate</b> emissions <b>scenario</b> and + 6. 1 m historically.

Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21 st century distributions for 1, 350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27 - 42 % and 45 - 63 % respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2. 5 - 86 % and 17 - 86 %, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (≈ 60 % species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration.

Objective. This article describes the situation of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea in Afghanistan, including efforts to prevent, protect, and treat the two diseases. It estimates lives saved by scaling up interventions. Methods. A secondary analysis of data was conducted and future scenarios were modelled to estimate lives saved by scaling up a package of interventions. Results. The analysis reveals that 10, 795 additional child deaths could be averted with a moderate scale-up of interventions, decreasing the under-five mortality rate in Afghanistan from 55 per 1, 000 live births in 2015 to 40 per 1, 000 in 2020.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to estimate the future electricity intensity and conservation potential of the Chinese building materials industry. This paper adopts a cointegration method to establish a long-run equilibrium relationship between electricity intensity and factors including technology, power tariff, enterprise scale and value-added per worker. Electricity conservation potential in the Chinese building materials industry is predicted to be 90. 5 billion kW h in 2020 under the <b>moderate</b> <b>scenario,</b> which is more than the total electricity {{consumption of}} Malaysia in 2007; and 150. 9 billion kW h under the advanced scenario, which is more than the total electricity consumption of Saudi Arabia in 2005.

The complexity in this environmental management was approached by “green rating” of PROPER 2 ̆ 7 s criteria regulated by Ministry of Environment & Forestry (KLHK). PROPER is the assessment program of company performance rating in environmental management. Green rating is classified by PROPER in terms of beyond compliance performance. The result of the case study in Jababeka Industrial Estate (KIJA) Bekasi, based on its environmental situational analysis year 2014 by multidimensional scaling (MDS) method, showed that only the management dimension had a sustainability performance. The results of prospective analysis on leverage factors of MDS showed that the key factors of the environmental management model were (1) DRKPL (summary document of environmental management performance), (2) implementation of water conservation and reducing water pollution program, (3) funding for water conservation, (4) monitoring and evaluation of community development program, (5) implementation of 3 R (reduce, reuse, recycle) programs of hazardous waste, (6) technology of 3 R, and (7) benchmarking. Based on the key parameters and referred to the possibilities conditions, three scenarios have been developed to approach the implementative policy. The <b>moderate</b> <b>scenario</b> was recommended to be the right policy in term of consideration of technology, funding availability, time of implementation and organization skills...|$|E
40|$|Now that {{stratospheric ozone}} {{depletion}} has been {{controlled by the}} Montreal Protocol 1, interest has turned {{to the effects of}} climate change on the ozone layer. Climate models predict an accelerated stratospheric circulation, leading to changes in the spatial distribution of stratospheric ozone and an increased stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux. Here we use an atmospheric chemistry climate model to isolate the effects of climate change from those of ozone depletion and recovery on stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux and the clear-sky ultraviolet radiation index—a measure of potential human exposure to ultraviolet radiation. We show that under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <b>moderate</b> emissions <b>scenario,</b> global stratosphere-to- troposphere ozone flux increases by 23...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of selected policy packages and their potential impact in several EU Member States. The scenarios cover the whole EU- 28. However, not all activities were carried out at the same level of detail for all Member States (MS). In nine ENTRANZE target countries, the selection of policy packages was carried out in close cooperation and discussion with policy makers in a continuous dialogue. Although the specific design of policies differs by countries, there is a common logic: Scenario 1 refers to a <b>moderate</b> ambitious <b>scenario</b> according to current national and EU legislation, Scenario 2 and 3 are more ambitious, innovative and stringent policy packages...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{analysis of}} {{the current status of}} energy demand of agriculture sector of Punjab, which is associated with agricultural inputs and farm operations. It also included past trends and future scenarios {{in order to reduce the}} future energy demand. A computer based software called Long Range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) is used to estimate total energy demand of agriculture sector for the base year 2000 and extrapolate till 2030 for the future predictions. All available energy consumption data have been collected and input in to the model to develop scenarios. Initially, a reference scenario was created based on the current energy situation. It is “Business-as-usual ” scenario and two alternative <b>scenarios</b> (<b>Moderate</b> improvement and Accelerated growth scenario) were formulated to predict future energy demand of agriculture sector of Punjab. The calculations showed that energy demand of agriculture sector of Punjab in <b>moderate</b> improvement <b>scenario</b> and accelerated growth scenario would increase from 4. 28 % and 10. 7 % in 2010 to 23. 8 % and 52. 3 % in 2030 respectively. Sustainable agricultural practices could be used to meet the accelerated growth targets with reduced energy demand. Key words: Agriculture sector Energy modeling Punjab Scenario analysis Growth rat...|$|R
