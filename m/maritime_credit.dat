40|$|In the {{international}} framework of provisional measures {{a special place}} has to be assigned {{to the arrest of}} ships, as specifically ruled by “Arrest Convention” of 1952 and subsequently modified by the “Arrest Convention” of 1999. Differently from other tipycal or atipycal provisional measures, the judge does not evaluate circumstances like «fumus boni iuris», «good arguable case on the merits», periculum in mora, documental evidence of the credit and so on; instead, he is called to grant the arrest just on the allegation of a maritime credit: he who has not a <b>maritime</b> <b>credit,</b> expressly numbered in the list of art. 1 (1), he has not the possibility to obtain the arrest of ships and, on the other hand, he who has a <b>maritime</b> <b>credit</b> as listed, he can get the remedy with nothing but alleging his credit...|$|E
2500|$|Rev. Dr. Moses Michael Coady (3 January 1882 – 28 July 1959) was [...] a Roman Catholic priest, adult {{educator}} and co-operative entrepreneur {{best known for}} his instrumental role in the Antigonish Movement. Credited with introducing [...] "an entirely new organizational technique: [...] that of action based on preliminary study" [...] to the co-operative movement in Canada, his work sparked a wave of co-operative development across the <b>Maritimes</b> and <b>credit</b> union development across English Canada. [...] Due to his role and influence, he is often compared to Alphonse Desjardins in Québec. The influence of the movement he led spread across Canada in the 1930s and by the 1940s and 1950s, to the Caribbean, Africa and Asia.|$|R
50|$|The Pre-Classical Malay evolved {{and reached}} its refined form during {{the golden age}} of the Malay empire of Melaka and its {{successor}} Johor starting from the 15th century. As a bustling port city with a diverse population of 200,000 from different nations, the largest in Southeast Asia at that time, Melaka became a melting pot of different cultures and languages. More loan words from Arab, Persian, Tamil and Chinese were absorbed and the period witnessed the flowering of Malay literature as well as professional development in royal leadership and public administration. In contrast with Old Malay, the literary themes of Melaka had expanded beyond the decorative belles-lettres and theological works, evidenced with the inclusion of accountancy, <b>maritime</b> laws, <b>credit</b> notes and trade licenses in its literary tradition. Some prominent manuscripts of this category are Undang-Undang Melaka ('Laws of Melaka'), Undang-Undang Laut Melaka (Melakan Maritime Laws) and Hukum Kanun Pahang ('Laws of Pahang'). The literary tradition was further enriched with the translations of various foreign literary works such as Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah and Hikayat Amir Hamzah, and the emergence of new intellectual writings in philosophy, tasawuf, tafsir, history and many others in Malay, represented by manuscripts like Sulalatus al-Salatin and Furu' Al-Masa'il.|$|R
