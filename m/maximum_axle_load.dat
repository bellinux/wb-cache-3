25|$|The bogies for the {{new cars}} were a new design, {{specifically}} prepared by Vicers Ruwolt. The suspension was based on coil springs, with a secondary cast bolster with spring plank, supported on swing links and coil springs. Each bogie weighed 7000kg, with a wheelbase of 2,445mm and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 14 tonnes, and were designed for operation at up to 130km/h. Tread brakes were fitted, operated by Westinghouse model 250WF brake cylinders. The axle boxes utilised spherical roller bearings, and {{all parts of the}} bogie, except the wheels and axles themselves, were designed for conversion to standard gauge. This latter function was finally used in 2009 when the Mangalore to Albury line was converted to standard gauge.|$|E
500|$|The MX3000 is a three-car {{electric}} {{multiple unit}} built {{exclusively for the}} Oslo Metro by Siemens in Vienna, Austria. It is a modification of trains used on the Vienna U-Bahn. The units are designed by Porsche Design Studio. [...] Unlike the red predecessors, the trains are painted white with black and grey detailing. The chassis is in aluminum. A three-car train is [...] long; the end cars are [...] long each, while the center car is [...] long. The cars are [...] wide and [...] tall.

500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, NSB was {{in need of}} new rolling stock for their {{intercity}} trains. At first electric multiple units were considered, but NSB instead chose to order locomotives and waggons, to have greater operational flexibility. The choice fell on the German DB Class 120, which was the first three-phase asynchronous locomotive in the world in [...] "almost" [...] regular service (prototype 120.0 in test service 1979, the serial version 120.1 from 1986). However, the Norwegian variation was scaled down due to the <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> ( [...] , Class 120 has [...] ) and had a lower power output than the Class 120. Because of this, the El 17 is less powerful than its three predecessors, El 14, El 15 and El 16(3.0 MW instead of 4.4 MW).|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in four batches from 1918 to 1922, all four with different engine weights and <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 9 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 4520 imp gal and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of 9 lt 10 lcwt kg.|$|R
50|$|Until 1922, {{three more}} batches of Class 14C would follow {{from the same}} manufacturer. All four batches {{differed}} in terms of <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading,</b> adhesive weight and engine weight.|$|R
500|$|The {{line had}} 400,000 tonnes of cargo in 2005. Half {{of this was}} for Norske Skog, and 130,000 tonnes for Eklem Meråker, the smelter. The latter was shut down the {{following}} year, with the subsequent drop in traffic.That year the line received a 60-million-kroner upgrade, increasing <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> to 22.5 tonnes, the same as on the Central Line. Speeds increased from [...] for freight trains and from [...] for passenger trains. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, who took the line in 1996, opened the Gevingåsen Tunnel between Hell and Hommelvik 15 August 2011, making the section from Hell to Muruvik a branch. The Rail Administration reclassified the lines in 2008, so that the section from Trondheim to Hell {{is now part of}} the Nordland Line and only the section from Hell to Storlien is regarded as part of the Meråker Line.|$|E
500|$|To {{allow for}} larger trains, the {{permanent}} way was upgraded. The rail profiles were upgraded to 49 kilograms per meter (78lb/yd), were continuously welded and the gravel ballast {{was replaced with}} crushed stone. The distance of the line was after the upgrades [...] The upgrades allowed the <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> to be increased to [...] and the train weight to increased to [...] A nominal train consisted of 20 hooper cars with air brakes. In 1960, work started on demolishing the tracks at the port, followed by all tracks at the workshop at Kirkenes the following year. From then, all non-ore transport in the company was taken over using road transport. The three remaining electric shunters and the steam locomotive were chopped up. Two diesel shunters were sold to Norsk Jernverk in Mo i Rana. Up until this point, the railway had operated 33 steam locomotives, 14 electric locomotives and 4 diesel locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|A Co-Co [...] "Super Deltic" [...] was {{proposed}} but not built. There were three potential designs between 4000hp and 4600hp weighing [...] between 114 and 119 tons with a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of [...] The locomotives {{would have looked}} {{very similar to the}} eventual Class 50s, though slightly longer. All three designs would have had two 18-cylinder turbocharged engines, based on the 9-cylinder turbocharged engine used in the British Rail Class 23 [...] "Baby Deltic" [...] and the locomotive would have been designated Class 51. [...] The Class 55's engines were not turbocharged, although they did have centrifugal scavenging blowers.|$|E
50|$|The Type XM tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 8 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 4000 imp gal and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of 11 lt 18 lcwt kg.|$|R
50|$|The Type WG tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 6 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 3080 imp gal {{and an average}} <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of 9 lt 3 lcwt 3 qtr kg.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after they}} entered service, the front tanks {{of some of}} the {{locomotives}} were modified. While the tank capacity apparently remained the same, the all-up weight of the modified locomotives and their adhesive weight were 4 lt kg less and their individual <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> were different, although their <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> remained at 15 lt kg.|$|R
2500|$|The diesel-hydraulic {{locomotive}} had a 1'BB'1 wheel arrangement and an overall length of [...] It {{was designed to}} be run i multiple and had a driver's cab in the one end only. The unit had two six-cylinder, four stroke diesel engines, the MAN W6V 30/38, each with a power output of , giving a total power output of [...] The locomotives weighed , giving a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 15 tonnes. The locomotives had a maximum speed of , and were during revenue trials on the Bergen Line capable of reaching a maximum [...] and [...] up the steepest hills.|$|E
2500|$|The 9F was {{designed}} at both Derby and Brighton Works in 1951 to operate freight trains {{of up to}} 900tons (914tonnes) at 35mph (56km/h) with maximum fuel efficiency. The original proposal was for a boiler from the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia 4-6-2, adapting it to a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement [...] but Riddles eventually settled upon a 2-10-0 type {{because it had been}} used successfully on some of his previous Austerity locomotives. Distributing the adhesive weight over five axles gave a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of only 15tons, 10cwt. The driving wheels were [...] in diameter. However, in order to clear the rear coupled wheels the grate had to be set higher, thus reducing firebox volume. There were many problems associated with locomotives of such a long wheelbase, but these were solved by the design team through a series of compromises. The centre driving wheels had no flanges, and those on the second and fourth coupled wheels were reduced in depth. This enabled the locomotive to round curves of only [...] radius. As on all other BR standard steam locomotives the leading wheels were [...] in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|An under-strength bridge {{can limit}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> {{for a whole}} line, for example: ...|$|E
50|$|As built, {{the first}} version of the tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 5 lt 10 lcwt t, while the second had a capacity of 6 lt 10 lcwt t, with <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of 8 lt 10 lcwt 2 qtr kg and 9 lt 1 lcwt kg respectively. Both versions had a water capacity of 4000 imp gal.|$|R
50|$|Both {{versions}} ran on {{the same}} 1Co' bogies, three-axle Co' bogies with additional integral single axle pony trucks which was designed and produced by General Steel Castings. The fourth <b>axle</b> reduced the <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> sufficiently to enable these relatively heavy locomotives to operate on the very light rail which was used throughout South West Africa at the time.|$|R
5|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{suburban}} electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115km/h, with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130km/h {{on the same}} track, and up to 160km/h on specified lines. The <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> operating. Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 18 t, later - after {{adaptation}} of the infrastructure - 20 t ...|$|E
50|$|The two tenders {{were not}} identical. The tender of the 9th Class had a coal {{capacity}} of 7 lt 10 lcwt t and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 9 lt 11 lcwt kg, while the tender of the 10th Class had a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 10 lt 18 lcwt kg. Both had a water capacity of 3000 imp gal.|$|E

50|$|The Type YE1 tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 6 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 2825 imp gal {{and an average}} <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of 11 lt 6 lcwt 3 qtr kg. The tender had the same dimensions and water capacity as the Type YE tender, but a 10 lcwt t bigger coal capacity and a 6 in longer wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, {{the last}} {{thirteen}} Class 14C locomotives were ordered from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Canada. They were delivered {{in that same}} year and numbered in the range from 2026 to 2038. Of the four batches built which all differed in terms of <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading,</b> weight on driving wheels and engine weight, the engines of 1922 were the heaviest.|$|R
25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add <b>axles</b> until the <b>maximum</b> weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading.</b> A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|R
5000|$|All {{others had}} a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 9 lt 8 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 11 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 5000 imp gal and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 14 lt 14 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|The tender had a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 8 lt 18 lcwt kg, a coal {{capacity}} of 5 lt t and a water {{capacity of}} 2600 imp gal.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{suburban}} electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115 km/h, with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130 km/h {{on the same}} track, and up to 160 km/h on specified lines. The <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> operating. Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.|$|R
50|$|The Class D VI {{locomotives}} were procured for {{branch lines}} in flat terrain {{and had a}} <b>maximum</b> permitted <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 12 tons.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, a third {{batch of}} twenty Class 14C {{locomotives}} was ordered from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Canada. It was delivered late {{in that same}} year and numbered in the range from 1991 to 2010. In 1922, one more batch of Class 14C locomotives would follow from the same manufacturer. All four batches differed in terms of <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading,</b> adhesive weight and engine weight.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t and a water {{capacity of}} 4000 imp gal, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 12 lt 11 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 5000 imp gal {{and an average}} <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 13 lt 16 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 8 lt 5 lcwt t and a water {{capacity of}} 4000 imp gal, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 10 lt 18 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|The design {{initially}} caused major difficulties, {{because it}} had to keep to the <b>maximum</b> permitted <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> for the railway network of 16 t.|$|R
50|$|The Type MX tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 12 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 6500 imp gal and a <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of 12 lt 10 lcwt kg. It was a tank wagon type tender with a cylindrical water tank, similar in appearance to the North American Vanderbilt type tenders, {{and was the}} first of its kind on the SAR. It rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> and became commonly known as a Torpedo tender.|$|R
50|$|Around 1930, the {{question}} of <b>maximum</b> <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> for locomotives was thoroughly investigated by the Mechanical and Civil Engineering Departments of the SAR. It was found that, among some other locomotive classes, the Class 14C had a rather severe vertical hammer blow effect on the track when running at speed due to an undue proportion of the reciprocating parts being balanced. Modifications were accordingly made to the Class 14C.|$|R
