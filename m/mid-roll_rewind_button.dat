5000|$|On December 9, 2014, [...] "YouTube Rewind: Turn Down for 2014", {{referencing}} Turn Down for What, was uploaded to YouTube Spotlight. It {{was again}} created and produced by YouTube and Portal A Interactive. Over 10 songs were mashed together by DJ Earworm for the video. The video was not structured around songs, as in previous years. More internet memes and trends were used alongside the music. Its main features were the YouTube <b>Rewind</b> <b>Button</b> flag, with which YouTubers and characters {{run from the}} beginning of the video all the way to the end. The flag was run through the sets of The Colbert Report by Big Bird; Conan by Conan O'Brien, running through his own with Freddy Wong acting as the host' and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, by Kid President. The actual <b>Rewind</b> <b>Button</b> was not shown until the end of the video.|$|R
50|$|The Mino {{has many}} {{features}} that the Flip Video does not have. They include an internal rechargeable battery (instead of 2 AA batteries) and touch-sensitive pause, fast forward and <b>rewind</b> <b>buttons,</b> whereas the Flip {{had none of}} these. The Mino is almost 2 ounces lighter than the Flip and the arm with the USB plug on it has changed positions.|$|R
5000|$|Film is {{automatically}} {{advanced to the}} next frame (and the shutter cocked) after each shutter activation. Shutter release and film advance are as described under shutter below.

5000|$|On December 11, 2013, [...] "YouTube Rewind: What Does 2013 Say?", {{referencing}} What Does the Fox Say?, was uploaded to YouTube Spotlight. It {{was created}} and produced by YouTube and Portal A Interactive. This {{was the first}} year that the YouTube <b>Rewind</b> <b>Button</b> was used; otherwise, it was very similar in style to the 2012 video. DJ Earworm mashed up six songs from the year. Jimmy Fallon and The Roots from The Tonight Show, made guest appearances.|$|R
5000|$|Black Wire is the eponymous {{debut album}} by the Leeds band Black Wire. The album was {{released}} on 27 June 2005 in the UK on 48 Crash and 14 February 2006 in the U.S. on Giant Pecker Records. The U.S. version of the album contains the 'secret track' [...] "Braindead". Access to the song is gained by holding the <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> of a CD player {{at the start of}} the first track until there is silence when the song can then be heard.|$|R
5000|$|On December 9, 2015, [...] "YouTube Rewind: Now Watch Me 2015", {{referencing}} Watch Me, was uploaded to the YouTube Spotlight channel. It {{was again}} created and produced by YouTube and Portal A Interactive. It {{was the first}} one to feature a hashtag; #YouTubeRewind. The video heavily incorporated previous years of YouTube due to 2015 being the website's 10th anniversary. The music mashup was composed by The Hood Internet. Additionally, Avicii composed an original remix for the video. The video featured more gamers than previous years, such as YouTube personality Markiplier. It was set up to resemble the Five Nights at Freddy's, an indie, survival horror, point-and-click video game that has gained recognition since its first release in August 2014. The <b>Rewind</b> <b>Button</b> and logo were shown throughout the video. Its main appearance was with PewDiePie and Zoe Sugg about halfway through the video. They appeared next to a scoreboard with two dates of December 9, 2015. Zoe changes one scoreboard date back to February 14, 2005, leaving the other at December 9, 2015. Afterwards Felix [...] "brofists" [...] the <b>rewind</b> <b>button,</b> triggering the video to show viral videos and memes from 2015 back to 2005. After the credits, the Fine Brothers were shown arguing about whether PewDiePie was in the video.|$|R

The viewfinder is located on the upper left-hand side of the camera. The manual <b>rewind</b> <b>button,</b> release catch for the camera back and cable release socket are on the left-hand side of the camera. The lens mount release and frameline preview lever are located {{on the front of the}} camera. The bottom plate has the cover for the batteries and a tripod socket.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Michael Sleazak had {{positive}} {{praise for the}} episode: [...] "Does absence really make the heart grow fonder? Quite possibly so, considering that tonight's episode of Ugly Betty — the first to air since Nov. 30 — had me alternately reaching for the Puffs, pressing the <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> on my DVR (so I could hear dialogue that had been drowned out by my initial hoots of laughter), and fighting the urge {{to stand up and}} cheer. All this, and I'd still rank Swag as only my fourth- or fifth-favorite episode of the Golden Globe-nominated series' young run." ...|$|R
5000|$|The black {{floating}} cube {{on the box}} {{is called}} [...] "CUBI". Along with CUBI, YOHIOloid has many pets. A female cube who functions as a <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> and a male cube who functions as a fast-forward button, {{and they are the}} younger siblings of CUBI. There is another cube that walks on four legs and is a rectangle, it functions as a box to store a microphone. The older sister of CUBI is a cat-like cube that constantly searches for information on the internet and the older brother of CUBI is a large bulky amp. His only non-technological pet is a black cat that wears a yellow ribbon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reaction}} from US critics {{was also very}} positive. Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone stated [...] "obviously the Pogues can do it all. And {{it sounds as if}} they've only just begun." [...] Spin stated that [...] "it's got guts and soul, and will make poor people dance until 4 a.m., even if they have to be at work until 7 a.m." [...] and that despite containing a few songs that could be skipped over, [...] "this LP on cassette will cause more wear on the <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> than on the fast forward". Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] and said that [...] "neither pop nor rock nor disco crossover stays these groghounds from the swift accomplishment of their appointed rounds".|$|R
5000|$|On December 7, 2016, [...] "YouTube Rewind: The Ultimate 2016 Challenge", {{referencing}} {{the increasing}} number of challenges that took place in 2016, was uploaded to the YouTube Spotlight channel. It was again created and produced by YouTube and Portal A Interactive. Music was developed by The Hood Internet with an original remix by Major Lazer. The video begins with Dwayne Johnson showing a miniature <b>Rewind</b> <b>button,</b> and YouTube personalities hunting for 'Rewind' symbols in the style of Pokémon Go. The video also references objects being crushed by a Hydraulic press, Hodor from Game of Thrones and the dabbing dance move. The video ends James Corden and other personalities in a car, in reference to the Carpool Karaoke segments from The Late Late Show.|$|R
5000|$|Users {{operate the}} AudioTron with a PC/laptop {{on the same}} network using the web {{interface}} from the built-in webserver, with a remote control, or on the device itself using buttons and a large [...] "Turn & Push Selector Knob" [...] on its front panel. The knob is used to navigate song selection menu on a green two-line LCD display. Users can select songs by turning and pushing the knob, based on various combinations of Genre, Album, Title and Artist tags. The knob also serves as volume control and playhead control while a song is being played. Standard Play, Pause, Stop, Forward and <b>Rewind</b> <b>buttons</b> {{can be used to}} control playback. An infrared remote control comes with AudioTron and can be used instead of the front panel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bottom of}} the camera {{contains}} the rewind knob release lever, the <b>rewind</b> release <b>button</b> [...] and the rewind knob, which {{is also used to}} open the back. Printing on the bottom includes loading instructions, daylight exposure table, flash exposure table, (both based on ASA 10 film) and suggestions for common focus settings.|$|R
5000|$|In Time Out London, Derek Adams wrote: [...] "Instead of bombarding us with sensational {{imagery and}} scaremongering, this competently narrated, intelligibly {{structured}} and cleverly illustrated film presents its case via {{a succession of}} insights {{from a group of}} smart, rational orators. ... This is a film perhaps better suited to DVD, simply because there are thoughts here of such profundity you might feel the need to reach for the <b>rewind</b> <b>button.</b> I, for one, have been left substantially enlightened." [...] Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian: [...] "In these parlous times, there can never be enough criticism of bankers and tame politicians enjoying what Milton Friedman called socialism for the rich. Ashcroft's documentary lands some punches, but it is hampered by a PowerPoint-style presentation. ... Ashcroft unveils some bold cures at the end, but we need more specifics." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the more}} upbeat side, the album opens with [...] "The Greatest Story Ever Told" [...] which boldly proclaims {{the message of}} Christ and closes with the worshipful [...] "World Without End." [...] The album also {{contains}} examples of Five Iron's humor and irony. [...] "You Probably Shouldn't Move Here" [...] is an offbeat pokes fun at the band's home state of Colorado and at California. [...] "The Phantom Mullet" [...] is a satirical look at the hairdo popular in the 1980s. [...] "It's Not Unusual" [...] is a cover of the singer Tom Jones. A short track entitled [...] "What's Up" [...] was hidden in the 3-second 'header' {{at the beginning of}} the album. To find this track, the listener had to start Track 1, then hold the <b>rewind</b> <b>button.</b> On the album's back cover, the track was listed as 'Track 0'.|$|R
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|R
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the film <b>rewind</b> release <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Lufia games, {{this is an}} action-rpg game. Gameplay is no longer turn-based; players can roam around freely and attack monsters without waiting for the battle scene to occur. Only one character can be playable on-screen. The player can choose a map to go to without fully navigating the map like Lufia: The Ruins of Lore. Players can equip armor and weapons that can give players unique abilities in combat. The game {{takes advantage of the}} dual screen. In certain battles or puzzle-solving, certain actions may be disabled or the top-screen is used to navigate actions committed by bosses. Characters do not gain experience from defeating certain bosses. Players can press the feather button on the screen {{to go back to the}} stage selection menu. Players can also hit the <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> to go back to {{the previous}} dungeon. These options may not be available if an essential event is going to be triggered in that area. Like in all Lufia games besides the Lufia & the Fortress of Doom, The Ancient Cave returns.|$|R
25|$|The {{only other}} {{feature of the}} new-look iPlayer {{discussed}} was a new embeddable video player, being rolled out across {{the whole of the}} BBC's online presence. On 19 June 2012 on the live TV channels it added a <b>rewind</b> to start <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|She quickly {{learns that}} she and several other nursing home {{residents}} had {{signed an agreement with}} Dr. Jimson and Dr. Reed to participate in a study for an experimental drug (PT-1) that reverses the effect of aging by making telomeres grow. All the residents at the nursing home had been given the drug and are now growing younger each day. However, because the drug is experimental, it must be kept a secret. While a second chance at life seems wonderful, when Amelia's first birthday while moving back in time arrives, she finds she cannot remember anything from the last year of her life when she was growing older. The residents realize that as they grow younger, their previous memories are disappearing and being rewritten with new memories from growing younger, even though the brain has plenty of chromosomes left for memory. It's then found out that it's like recording while hitting the <b>rewind</b> <b>button.</b> One man, afraid of forgetting his beloved wife's funeral where so many people said such nice things, is the first to request the Cure, a secondary drug that will halt his age at that exact moment. While the Cure works successfully on lab mice, the man immediately shrivels up, dies, and turns into dust when it is administered to him.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after Nicole and Christine's Eviction, Julie {{announced}} a new twist to the game, the Big Brother <b>Rewind,</b> a large <b>button</b> {{in the middle of}} the former have-not room. The HouseGuests argued about the pros and cons of pushing the button. Frankie won the following HOH competition called Seed Saw. In spite of only having guesses as to the consequences of pushing the <b>rewind</b> <b>button,</b> all the Houseguests pushed it at the same time which started a countdown clock. In a surprise, Jeff Schroeder and Jordan Lloyd returned to the Big Brother house and Jeff proposed to Jordan with both their families present. After the festivities, Frankie nominated Cody and Victoria for eviction. The HouseGuests then competed in the BB Freakshow face morph POV competition, which Frankie won. He chose to keep the nominations the same. On Day 84, due to the pressing of the golden button, the eviction was cancelled and the Big Brother game rewound one week, right before the last HOH competition. All of the HouseGuests except Derrick (who was the outgoing HOH at the time) competed in the Seed Saw competition for a second time. This time, Caleb won HOH, and a plan to send Frankie home was put in motion by the other guys. After a 'luxury competition" [...] where the Jury members destroyed the house in the [...] "Jury Fury" [...] competition, where the jury members had to find knock out pucks and momentarily returning juror Hayden and Victoria each won $5000, Caleb nominated Frankie and Victoria. In a redo of the BB Freakshow competition, Cody won the Power of Veto, and chose to keep the nominations the same. Frankie later threatened the other guys, claiming that due to his fan base and the popularity of his sister, if he were to go to jury he would be able to sway everyone's votes, however this fell on deaf ears and on Day 88, Frankie was evicted by a 2-0 vote and became the seventh member of the jury.|$|R
40|$|Paired {{listening}} {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} research tool with the aim to understand the strategies used by L 2 learners when listening to recorded speech in the target language. It offers researchers a useful combination of direct observation and verbal data, whilst avoiding the common drawbacks of subjective introspection. This paper examines the potential of paired listening as a learning tool in the foreign language classroom. The principle is illustrated {{by means of a}} study that was conducted at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where 19 dyads of undergraduate students were observed as they tried to understand Spanish recordings in pairs. The study examined two sets of data: the way in which each pair played back the recording (using the play, pause and <b>rewind</b> <b>buttons</b> on their machine); and the participants' conversations throughout the task. A number of strategies were identified, comprising cognitive strategies (such as decoding and inferencing), metacognitive strategies (such as playback decisions) and social-affective strategies (such as pair co-operation and affective reactions to the input). The discussion of typical playback patterns and their related strategies forms the basis of a series of recommendations for the teaching of listening skills. Paired listening can assist listening instructors to assess and adjust the relative difficulty of a particular recording for their leamers, to encourage effective playback strategies (such as the optimum pace of progression through a recording), to evaluate and induce pair cooperation, and to channel affective reactions productively during the listening task. It is recommended as a complement to (rather than a replacement of) individual listening practice...|$|R
50|$|The Datasette {{has only}} one {{connection}} cable with a PCB edge connector at the computer end. All input/output signals to the datasette are all digital and so all digital to analog and vice versa is handled within the unit. Power is also included in this cable. The pinout is ground, +5 V DC, motor, read, write, key-sense. The sense signal monitors the play, <b>rewind,</b> and fast-forward <b>buttons,</b> but cannot differentiate between them. A mechanical interlock prevented any two of them being pressed at the same time. Unregulated 6.36 V DC is used to power the cassette motor.|$|R
2500|$|The Head of Household {{competition}} is {{held at the}} beginning of each week, and is most often performed on the live eviction episode. Most often, the first Head of Household competition will require HouseGuests to participate either in pairs or in teams. While the fourth, fifth, and eighth seasons had the HouseGuests competing in pairs, the sixth, seventh, eleventh, twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth editions all saw HouseGuests competing as part of a group. The live Head of Household competitions are typically question based, and will see HouseGuests eliminated each round. Competitions such as [...] "Majority Rules" [...] have been used numerous times, with the game being played in the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth seasons; a variation of the competition was used in the seventh season. Some competitions will attempt to cause drama in the house, such as the [...] "En Garde" [...] Head of Household competition in which the winner of each round selected the next two to face off against one another. This competition was later used in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth seasons. Various competitions throughout the season will be endurance, requiring HouseGuests to be the last one remaining in the competition. Endurance competitions are often held after game changing announcements, such as when a previously evicted HouseGuest returns. Various endurance competitions may have punished or reward contestants who either fall off first or last. Skill based competitions also appear frequently throughout the season, some of which may last for numerous hours. Skill competitions, such as the thirteenth season's [...] "Big Brother Open", are finished during the live eviction broadcast. The final Head of Household competition of each season features three rounds; the first is endurance, the second is skill, and the final is question based. The record for most Head of Household competitions won in a single season is held by Drew Daniel, Janelle Pierzina, Hayden Moss, Rachel Reilly, Ian Terry, Aaryn Gries, Caleb Reynolds, Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses in terms of reigns. Frankie Grande won HOH 5 times the sixteenth season, however he was dethroned twice due to the dual HoH twist that was in play during his season, and third reign was rewound due to the <b>rewind</b> <b>button</b> twist. This leaves Frankie with just two full reigns as HoH. Ian Terry has the record for most consecutive Head of Household wins, with four (winning at the Final 9, 7, 5 and 3 rounds) [...] One of the Head of Household's duties is to nominate 2 people for eviction. Victoria from the sixteenth season holds the record for most times being nominated with nine.|$|R
40|$|The {{completion}} of "Cochlear Implants: Different Generations Share a Miracle" brings journalism, photography, design, and audio {{together in an}} interactive multimedia presentation. The presentation tells three separate success stories of cochlear implant recipients. Each story consists of a slide show of still photographs accompanied by audio clips from interviews conducted with each recipient. Viewers can control the show by clicking on stop, play, <b>rewind</b> and main <b>buttons.</b> The emphasis of this project is the positive impact cochlear implants have on recipients of different generations. Not only is this a personal interest story, {{but it is also}} educational and informative for viewers. Hearing is something that many people take for granted. These individual's stories encourage the viewer with normal hearing to think about how precious and valuable the sense of hearing is. Conversely, these stories can give hope and information to those who are hearing impaired. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R
