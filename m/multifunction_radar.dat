50|$|Six prototypes {{were built}} by December 1988, and the PLANAF {{received}} 12 to 18 {{aircraft in the}} early 1990s for evaluation. The first aircraft used imported Rolls-Royce Spey Mk.202 engines, later replaced by a license-built copy, the WS-9.

40|$|<b>Multifunction</b> <b>radars</b> {{are highly}} {{configurable}} and possess {{some form of}} beam agility, allowing maintenance {{of a large number}} of tasks supporting varied functions. However, the surveillance function is commonly executed using a fixed periodic pattern, not utilising the full hardware potential. In this paper, a new method of surveillance control is proposed which utilises a particle filter to estimate a probability density of the undetected target location. Subsequently, the finite resource available for surveillance is allocated between sectors, based on information extracted from this probability density, using the Continuous Double Auction Parameter Selection algorithm. This method is successfully demonstrated through simulation on a surveillance control problem...|$|R

A system architecture, now under test, is presented with some remarks about the resources management and showing the differences w. r. t. more conventional planar phased arrays (e. g. four faces). Moreover, it is shown how the operating mode can reach {{the one of the}} "ubiquitous radar" permitting virtually instantaneous detection and tracking of short-range, low-elevation targets for sea and ground point defense...|$|R

5000|$|The AN/APY-10 is an American <b>multifunction</b> <b>radar</b> {{developed}} for the U.S. Navy's Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft. [...] AN/APY-10 is the latest descendant of a radar family originally developed by Texas Instruments (TI, and later Raytheon when it acquired the radar business of TI) for Lockheed P-3 Orion, the predecessor of P-8. AN/APY-10 mechanically scanned radar is a development of Raytheon's AN/APS-149 radar. [...] Compared to the AN/APS-137, it is smaller in size, lighter, and uses less power. The radar is optimized for maritime, littoral and overland surveillance.|$|E
50|$|Another {{addition}} to the Gerald R. Ford class is an integrated Active electronically scanned array search and tracking radar system. The dual-band radar (DBR) was being developed for both the Zumwalt-class guided missile destroyers and the Ford-class aircraft carriers by Raytheon. The island can be kept smaller by replacing six to ten radar antennas with a single six-faced radar. The DBR works by combining the X band AN/SPY-3 <b>multifunction</b> <b>radar</b> with the S band Volume Search Radar (VSR) emitters, distributed into three phased arrays. The S-band radar was later deleted from the Zumwalt class destroyers as a cost saving measure.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Typhon Combat System" [...] was an {{integrated}} weapons system {{being developed by}} the United States Navy. The system was being developed to replace the previous Talos, Terrier, and Tartar missile systems in service in the early 1960s. The earlier systems were determined to be vulnerable to large scale saturation missile attacks. At {{the center of the}} system was a <b>multifunction</b> <b>radar</b> called AN/SPG-59. The AN/SPG-59 would provide search, tracking, and guidance functions to the new missiles being developed, the Terrier sized RIM-50 Typhon extended range, and the Tartar sized RIM-55 Typhon Medium range. The Typhon missiles would have inertial guidance and would, in time, share the AN/SPG-59 radar's terminal illumination capabilities.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new planar {{antenna array}} based on 9 {{identical}} Quasi-Yagi elements is presented. In contrast to conventional designs, the feeding network {{is composed of}} 3 -way power dividers, which are carefully designed {{in order to provide}} synchronised output signals over a wide frequency range. The use of spline-shaped microstrip lines suppresses coupling effects by parallel lines. Thus, signal distortions within the feeding network are minimised. Compared to conventional designs with 8 elements, the additional antenna element will enhance the gain of the array, which is between 10. 5 and 13 dB in the XBand. The input return loss of the antenna array is below - 15 dB over most parts of the relevant spectrum, with a total bandwidth of 45 %. The planar antenna array is well-suited as a radiating element in linear phased arrays for <b>multifunction</b> <b>radars</b> including SAR and MTI...|$|R
