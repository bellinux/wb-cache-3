40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} how apprentices in the Swiss VET system receive {{practical instruction}} within training companies {{and how they}} are being supported and guided by experts in the workplace. It does so by paying special attention to verbal and nonverbal interaction between experts and apprentices, exploring the hypothesis that a fine-grained analysis focused on language-in-interaction could profitably inform the conditions in which learning arises from a practice-based training model. The chapter commences with a brief overview of the <b>main</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> challenging initial vocational education in Switzerland. It then identifies and illustrates four distinct interactional configurations through which guidance progresses in the workplace: as spontaneously provided, explicitly requested, collectively distributed, or implicitly denied. This empirical and interactional approach, based on audio-video data analysis, contributes to a reflection on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a practice-based training model as it is implemented in the Swiss apprenticeship system...|$|R

The business of premium news servers is generated primarily on their ability to offer superior completion and retention rates, as well as their ability to offer very fast connections to users. Completion rates are significant when users wish to download large files that are split into pieces; if any one piece is missing, it is impossible to successfully download and reassemble the desired file. To work around the problem, a redundancy scheme known as Parchive (PAR) is commonly used.|$|R

50|$|Co-written with Katy Gardner, Anthropology and Development: Challenges for the 21st Century is a {{completely}} rewritten new edition of the best-selling and critically acclaimed 'Anthropology, Development and the Post-Modern Challenge' (1996). It aims to serve as both an innovative reformulation of the field, and as a key text for students and researchers at leading universities in Europe and North America. Gardner and Lewis update the book by engaging with nearly two decades of continuity and change in the development industry. In particular, they argue that while the world of international development has expanded since the 1990s, {{it has become more}} rigidly technocratic. Furthermore Western aid is in decline and new set of global economic and political processes are shaping the twenty-first century. Anthropology and Development therefore insists on a focus upon the core anthropological issues surrounding poverty and inequality, and argue for a shift away from recent anthropological preoccupations with 'aidnography', and thus provide a timely redefinition what are perceived as the <b>main</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> in the field.|$|R

Among the non-nutritional factors, the type and severity of neurological impairment, ambulatory status, the degree of cognitive impairment, and use of entiepileptic medication altogether concur to determination of nutritional status. With the present review, the current literature is discussed and a practical approach for nutritional assessment in NI children is proposed. Early identification and intervention of nutritional issues of NI children with a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to improve the overall health and quality of life of these complex children...|$|R

40|$|This article gives a {{historical}} {{overview of the}} <b>main</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> facing Christian interpreters of the Bible. The Christian understanding of the Bible is influenced by two main factors. On the one hand, Christians believe that God revealed himself and was present in the life, ministry, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. In other words, Jesus is the one Word of God. On the other hand, Christians believe that the Bible is inspired Holy Scripture, containing the revelation of God. There is a tension between these two approaches, as one locates the divine revelation {{in the person of}} Jesus of Nazareth, the other in the Holy Book. The article argues that this tension has been a major creative driving force in the history of Christian biblical interpretation. It traces the main strategies with which Christian interpreters have approached the Bible in order to reconcile these two elements, or in which they have allowed one to overrule the other. This will provide an introduction to the key approaches and methods in Christian biblical interpretation...|$|R

This paper analyses socioeconomic constraints and environmental impacts experienced by these concessions, {{as well as their}} response to major external drivers of change. Concessionaires considered investment and operating finance their main constraint, followed by insufficient technical and human capacities, and inconsistent application of official regulations. Environmental problems directly produced by concessions' operations represented around one-third of the total score for environmental problems reported. Damage caused by construction of logging roads and erosion were identified as the <b>main</b> <b>issues.</b> Induced <b>problems</b> (two-thirds of the total score) were dominated by hunting, with encroachment and illegal logging perceived as much less significant. Policies, infrastructure, markets and technology are key external drivers of change in concessions' practices, while regional and international forestry institutions reportedly have the least influence, reflecting an emerging scepticism about the proliferation of international institutions and initiatives promoting sustainable forestry...|$|R

40|$|The legal {{protection}} of the sexual orientation has more than {{something to do with}} some of the <b>main</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> of contemporary legal theory: on the one hand, it is necessary to adopt an approach that allows the handling of this topic, from a historical and cultural-anthropological point of view, in the perspective to which it belongs, i. e. that of the legal evolution in the context of Western modern societies. In this Western legal tradition, such claim does not represent a break, but rather it is a necessary linear development, {{if it is true that}} this tradition has been characterized by a progressive struggle for the recognition of liberties and rights. In this perspective there is a fil rouge that links the roles of women and homosexuals in the context of Western modern societies, in their being victims of a natural prejudice on the legal and political level, but also in their being the protagonists of the struggle for the recognition of their rights to obtain for themselves a public and clear political identity and to be included in the circuit of political citizenship.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are made of}} two or more materials providing for properties that could not be obtained from any one material alone. One of the materials performs as the matrix and at least one other material as the reinforcement. Composites can be broadly classified {{on the basis of their}} matrix material: polymer, metal, and ceramic matrix composites. To date, the largest number of composite material industrial applications involves polymer matrix composites and their machining behaviour represent the main focus of this paper. Composite materials belong to the category of difficult-to-cut materials due to the fact that their structure is anisotropic and non-homogeneous and their reinforcing constituents are highly abrasive by nature. These severe machining conditions can lead to critical damage to the final composite part and determine very high wear rates of the cutting tool. Conventional machining processes such as turning, drilling and milling can be readily applied to polymer matrix composites, provided proper tool design is carried out and optimised operating conditions are selected. An outline of the <b>main</b> machinability <b>issues,</b> <b>problems</b> and solutions relevant to applications of conventional machining processes to advanced polymer matrix composite materials is presented...|$|R

40|$|Many {{years have}} passed since Berners-Lee envi- sioned the Web as it should be (1999), but still many {{information}} professionals do not know their precise role in its development, especially con- cerning ontologies –considered one of its main elements. Why? May it still be a lack of under- standing between the different academic commu- nities involved (namely, Computer Science, Lin- guistics and Library and Information Science), as reported by Soergel (1999) ? The idea behind the Semantic Web is that of several technologies working together to get optimum information re- trieval performance, which is based on proper resource description in a machine-understandable way, by means of metadata and vocabularies (Greenberg, Sutton and Campbell, 2003). This is obviously something that Library and Information Science professionals can do very well, but, are we doing enough? When computer scientists put on stage the ontology paradigm they were asking for semantically richer vocabularies that could support logical inferences in artificial intelligence as a way to improve information retrieval systems. Which direction should vocabulary development take to contribute better to that common goal? The main objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to identify <b>main</b> trends, <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> con- cerning ontology research and 2) to identify pos- sible contributions from the Library and Information Science area to the development of ontologies for the semantic web. To do so, our paper has been structured in the following manner. First, the methodology followed in the paper is reported, which is based on a thorough literature review, where main contributions are analysed. Then, the paper presents a discussion of the <b>main</b> trends, <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> concerning ontology re- search identified in the literature review. Recom- mendations of possible contributions from the Library and Information Science area to the devel- opment of ontologies for the semantic web are finally presented...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide objective, empirical, evidence-based practice management information. This is a hitherto under-researched area of considerable interest for both the practitioner and educator. METHODS: A questionnaire eliciting a mix of structured and free text responses was administered to a random sample of 480 practitioners who are members of the American Academy of Periodontology. Potential respondents not in private practice were excluded and the next listed person substituted. RESULTS: The results provide demographic and descriptive information about some of the <b>main</b> <b>issues</b> and <b>problems</b> facing practice managers, central to which are information technology (IT), financial, people management, and marketing. Human resource and marketing management appear to represent the biggest challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontists running practices would prefer more information, development, and support in dealing with IT, finance, marketing, and people management. The empirical evidence reported here suggests that although tailored educational programs on key management issues at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels have become ubiquitous, nevertheless some respondents seek further training opportunities. Evidence-based practice management information will be invaluable to the clinician considering strategic and marketing planning, and also for those responsible for the design and conduct of predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. 8 page(s...|$|R

This issue occurs {{when the number of}} examples representing one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. The aim of this work is to shortly review the <b>main</b> <b>issues</b> of this <b>problem</b> and to describe two common approaches for dealing with imbalance, namely sampling and cost sensitive learning. Additionally, we will pay special attention to some open problems, in particular we will carry out a discussion on the data intrinsic characteristics of the imbalanced classification problem which will help to follow new paths that can lead to the improvement of current models, namely size of the dataset, small disjuncts, the overlapping between the classes and the data fracture between training and test distribution...|$|R
