50|$|To {{improve the}} airport’s connectivity, in 2002 Kamenshchik {{also tried to}} flirt with the {{machinery}} industry as he saw pockets of value in this market, which was then experiencing a certain shortage of electric trains. The result was that his company purchased a 98.19% block of Demikhovskiy Machinery Factory. To add to this spree, Transmash, a project office for transport engineering, was set up and two big purchases were made - Tsentrosvar Factory and Oktyabrskiy Electric Car Repair Factory. In 2004 East Line sold both its own airline company and <b>machinery</b> <b>assets</b> at a profit, as Kamenshchik decided to take his foot off this non-core business pedal {{and focus on the}} airport business.|$|E

40|$|MBA thesis (WBS) This {{research}} was primarily aimed at identifying and reviewing {{the use of}} depreciation factors when undertaking valuation of plant and <b>machinery</b> <b>assets,</b> particularly those under security. This will guide the changes that the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) should implement {{in dealing with the}} uncertainties which arise when valuing plant and equipment and in improving security from current and prospective operational clients. The research will Identify possible losses from liquidation of current and prospective operational clients and propose suitable valuation procedure for equipment to be secured. The researcher conducted a case study survey from the IDC’s operational strategic business units (SBUs) employees. The data for the {{research was}} collected using a questionnaire in a structured survey format and examining current records on trends with regards to the propositions. For each of the SBUs, copies of well-structured questionnaires were given to an account manager. The study also sampled valuation reports prepared by valuers at IDC. The contents of valuation reports were examined and compared with data recovered by IDC after a client default. The researcher noted that recoveries from physical collateral generally lagged behind expected recoveries as reported in valuation reports. There were, however, mixed responses on the certainty and uncertainty of valuation figures reported. The key findings were that there was a need to re-look at the factors considered in the valuation practice. The recognition of appraisal depreciation considers the progressive decline in value as operational use and changes to the technical and economic environment diminish the worth of an asset. The expected asset retirement profile with its influence on life characteristics, in addition to the applied operation and maintenance policies, influences the rate of asset depreciation. These factors {{play a critical role in}} making sound estimates as far as valuation is concerned...|$|E

Within the control system for innovational activities, the effects of the innovative activities on services and products have to be calculated both qualitatively (yes/no) and quantitatively (total/expenses). Control questions on the expenses of innovation are hard to answer, because many of the companies do not include numerous of their activities in their accounting file. Therefore many of the surveys on innovation were limited to certain expenses; expenses related to other companies (with benchmark type) and expenses that provide financial information on intramural, extramural, R+D, <b>machinery,</b> equipment, <b>asset</b> product and the acquisition of external knowledge. innovációs kiadások, ellenőrzési pontok, vezetői számvitel, innovation costs, controlling points, managerial accountancy, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{maintenance}} of <b>machinery</b> and <b>assets</b> {{is a huge}} cost to European industry. Increasing requirements in terms of reliability, availability and quality and safety of production, {{in addition to the}} extension of normal operational ranges pose big challenges to machinery maintenance activities. The majority of corrective and preventive schemes adopted by companies are based on local information and in many cases prove to be costly and inadequate. However, today is possible to take advantage of radically new technologies (i. e internet, mobile devices, micro technologies) to re-design maintenance strategies, taking full advantage of the existing information at machinery facilities, and introducing smart and cheap hardware devices (sensors, PDAs) hence making room for cost-effective dynamic e-maintenance systems. This paper gives a short overview of the analysis of existing use cases for development and demonstration of new technologies, that are being developed as part of European Integrated Project DYNAMITE 017498 (Dynamic Decisions in Maintenance) where new technologies will facilitate the implementation of cost-effective maintenance solutions, with a special focus on condition-based strategies...|$|R

The estimates are provided for two types of capital <b>assets,</b> <b>machinery</b> and equipment and industrial buildings. They also incorporate policy interventions aimed at influencing investment behaviour of manufacturing firms in Ireland. The results show that large capital gains recorded during the Celtic Tiger period created a downward distortion in the user cost of investing in industrial buildings. On average, policy interventions reduced the cost of capital compared to the cost of capital in the absence of these interventions, and the tax-related interventions were more favourable in the case of industrial building than for machinery and equipment...|$|R
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of {{business to business}} relationship dissolution centres upon definitions of relationship dissolution, models of the dissolution process, antecedents for dissolution, and dissolution strategies. In this paper an empirical case example of the network effects of multiple, simultaneous business relationship dissolution is presented. The key idea is to explain the multiple net effects for the disengaged suppliers, retained suppliers, and the customer. The mid-range change event that precipitated this outcome was the planned change by Marks and Spencer of their supplier network structure. The relationships between the customer and their respective suppliers was long-term, exclusive, and involved heavy investment in plant, <b>machinery,</b> and human <b>assets.</b> The contribution of the paper is to move beyond dyadic and triadic studies of relationship dissolution in assessing wider network effects using an empirical case example. ...|$|R

40|$|Standard models fail {{to explain}} {{variation}} in UK capital investment. This paper develops and tests {{a new theory}} based on the insights of Edmond Malinvaud, in which investment under uncertainty is adjusted to balance the cost of excess and deficient capacity. Using quarterly UK manufacturing data on two capital <b>assets</b> (<b>machinery</b> and building) over a 30 -year period, we obtain unique cointegrating relationships for the model, linking investment, profitability and capacity utilization. Non-nested testing shows that the estimated model performs similarly to a frequently used survey of investment intentions. Our model also addresses differences in the behaviour of the two asset classes; we show that building investment fell relative to machinery investment over the period, reflecting not only relative prices and profitability, but also long term influences such as technology or governance. At the macro level we find little role for any effects from taxation or financial constraints. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

The swift flow of foreign funds may be a threat to the country which became the capital inflow in the form of options: pressure of inflation, high cost economy, the defisit Central Bank balance, the economic turbulence, and the threat of economic growth. Improvement of high economic growth accompanied by rising foreign exchange reserves that high also, it turns out is not free from the risk of unbridled inflation and economic cricis, destabilizing the economy during those funds withdrawn by foreign investors.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} equilibrium models {{based on}} Epstein–Zin preferences in a {{framework in which}} exogenous state variables follow affine jump diffusion processes. A main insight is that the equilibrium asset prices can be computed using a standard <b>machinery</b> of affine <b>asset</b> pricing theory by imposing parametric restrictions on market prices of risk, determined inside the model by preference and model parameters. An appealing characteristic of the general equilibrium setup {{is that the state}} variables have an intuitive and testable interpretation as driving the consumption and dividend dynamics. We present a detailed example where large shocks (jumps) in consumption volatility translate into negative jumps in equilibrium prices of the assets as agents demand a higher premium to compensate for higher risks. This endogenous “leverage effect,” which is purely an equilibrium outcome in the economy, leads to significant premiums for out-of-the-money put options. Our model is thus able to produce an equilibrium “volatility smirk,” which realistically mimics that observed for index options...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the effective levels of company taxation in the 15 Member States of the EU. The study is established {{from the perspective of}} a multinational investor and provides relevant qualitative and quantitative information about the company tax regimes in the EU Member States which are in force in 2001. The main aim of the study is to compute and to compare effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) on domestic investment in all 15 EU Member States. A secondary aim is to work out the impact of the different tax drivers on the effective tax burden, i. e. to analyse how the EMTRs of the Member States are influenced by the tax systems, the different types of profit and non-profit taxes, the tax bases and the tax rates. The computation of the EMTR and the quantitative analysis is based on the well known approach of King and Fullerton which is also used, for example, in international tax burden comparison by the OECD and the European Commission. We refer to a typical manufacturing company as a base case. This company – which has the legal structure of a corporation – is characterised by a particular combination of investments and forms of finance. We considered five different types of investment: intangibles, industrial buildings, <b>machinery,</b> financial <b>assets</b> and inventories. The financing policy considered three sources of finance: new equity capital, retained earnings and debt. The calculations take into account the most relevant tax provisions. Relating to company taxation, we considered the corporation tax, additional profit taxes and non-profit taxes, the tax rates and the most relevant aspects of the tax base.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{is an attempt to}} {{evaluate}} the state and changes of innovation of Poland and Polish enterprises and their importance on the technological map of the region over the last decade. The evaluation is bad. A little percentage of firms implements innovations and the share of innovative products/services in the overall sales revenue is small. Moreover, the trend of these indicators is detrimental - their values (in scope of research, which was possible on incomplete data) showed decreases. Indicators of innovations on the scale of the entire market (not just the scale of the enterprise itself), which by definition reach lower values, showed also downward trend. Expenditures on innovation activities during the observed period are increasing, but in terms of real growth (inflation!) this increases are very slow. Also the structure of these expenditures is not desirable: a significant part of them are investments in fixed <b>assets</b> (<b>machinery</b> and equipment, lands and buildings), and small part are expenditures on technological know-how (own firms' research and development, acquisition of knowledge from external sources). Innovativeness of Poland as the whole country, measured by synthetic indicator called Summary Innovation Index, compared with other countries is at very low level, and there is no improvement of it in the last years. There is little fast-growing technology companies in Poland, and from those distinguishing only minority represent more promising branches than the Internet, while among their foreign competitors software producers are dominating.

40|$|We {{employ the}} EU KLEMS {{database}} {{to estimate the}} real rate of return to capital in 14 countries (11 in the EU, three outside the EU) in 10 branches of the market economy plus the market economy as a whole. Our measure of capital is an aggregate over seven types of asset: three ICT assets (computers, communications equipment, and software) and four non-ICT <b>assets</b> (<b>machinery</b> and equipment, nonresidential structures, transport equipment, and other). The real rate of return in the market economy does not vary very much across countries, {{with the exception of}} Spain where it is exceptionally high and in Italy where it is exceptionally low. The real rate appears to be trendless in most countries. Within each country however, the rate varies widely across the 10 branches, often being implausibly high or low. We also estimate the growth of capital services by two different methods: ex-post and exante, and the contribution of capital to output growth by three methods: ex-post, ex-ante and hybrid. Our implementation of the ex-ante method uses an estimate of the required rate of return for each country instead of the actual, average rate of return to calculate user costs and also employs the expected growth of asset prices rather than the actual growth. These estimates are derived from exactly the same data as for the ex-post method, ie without any extraneous data being employed. For estimating the contribution of capital to output growth, the ex-ante method uses ex-ante profit as the weight, while both the ex-post and the hybrid method use ex-post profit. We find that the three methods produce very similar results at the market economy level. But differences are much larger at the branch level, particularly between the ex-post and ex-ante methods.
