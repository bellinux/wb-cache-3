5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the <b>most</b> <b>persistent</b> volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the <b>most</b> <b>persistent</b> problems facing his government.|$|E
5|$|In the 850s, the <b>most</b> <b>persistent</b> {{threats to}} the Empire were the emirate of Melitene (Malatya) under Umar al-Aqta, the emirate of Tarsus under Ali ibn Yahya ("Ali the Armenian"), the emirate of Qaliqala (Theodosiopolis, modern Erzurum) and the Paulicians of Tephrike under their leader Karbeas. Melitene, in particular, was {{a major threat to}} Byzantium as its {{location}} on the western side of the Anti-Taurus range allowed direct access to the Anatolian plateau. An indication of the threat posed by these states came in 860, when their combined actions turned the year into a veritable annus horribilis for the Byzantines: Umar and Karbeas raided deep into Asia Minor and returned with much plunder; they were followed shortly after by another raid by the forces of Tarsus under Ali, while a naval attack from Syria sacked the major Byzantine naval base at Attaleia.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the CL's independence, various larger {{companies}} {{were looking to}} acquire it, mainly for the valuable Court Street terminal property. The <b>most</b> <b>persistent</b> rumor was that the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ, later a NYC line) would buy the CL as an entrance to Cincinnati. The CJ had built south from Michigan to Carlisle, Ohio in 1887, and initially acquired trackage rights over the CH to reach Cincinnati. Negotiations between the CL and CJ convinced the CH that the latter was capable of becoming a strong competitor, despite its poor financial state, and the CH attempted to acquire the CJ in 1892. But the CL stopped the consolidation based on Ohio's laws prohibiting such anti-competitive practices, and the CJ continued {{to look at the}} CL as a possible part of its line. After the CL's conversion to standard gauge was completed in 1894, the CJ secured trackage rights over the CL into Court Street, beginning service on January 27, 1896 via an extension from Carlisle to Franklin, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four, later a NYC line) to Middletown, and the recently opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to the CL at Hageman. The CJ also acquired the long-dormant Deer Creek Tunnel project in an attempt to construct its own route into the city, tired of dealing with Hafer and the CL The Pennsylvania Railroad, owner of the Little Miami Railroad that had been constructed east of Lebanon in the 1840s, entered the negotiations in 1896 to protect its Cincinnati-area interests, and in March it (through the Pennsylvania Company) acquired a majority of the CL's stock. Pennsylvania officials took over management in May, and in 1902 the CL acquired the tunnel property and some terminal property near Court Street from the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, successor to the CJ, which had become part of the Big Four and terminated its use of the CL in 1901.|$|E
