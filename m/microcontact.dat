40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of thermal resistance between contacting solids. Attention is directed towards contiguous solids possessing both surface roughness and waviness. When two such surfaces are brought together under load, they actually touch at isolated <b>microcontacts,</b> and the resulting real area {{is the sum of}} these <b>microcontacts.</b> Because of the waviness the <b>microcontacts</b> are confined to a region called the contour area which may occupy some fraction of the total available area. The non-uniform pressure distribution over the contour area results in <b>microcontacts</b> which vary in size and density. In the absence of an interstitial fluid and negligible radiation heat transfer, all the heat crossing the interface must flow through the <b>microcontacts.</b> A thermal analysis, based on size and spatial distribution, results in a thermal resistance equation which differs from previously developed theories. The equation is verified by liquid analog tests which show that the size and spatial distribution are very significant. (cont.) A surface deformation analysis considers the influence of surface roughness upon the elastic deformation of a rough hemisphere. An equation is developed which shows the extent of the contour area {{as a function of the}} surface geometry, the material properties, and the applied load. The equation is compared with existing theories and qualitatively checked against experimental results. Experimental heat transfer data were obtained to verify the thermal and deformation theories. The agreement between theory and test is quite good over a large range of surface geometry and applied loads. Sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration DS...|$|R

40|$|We {{measure the}} elastic and {{dissipative}} responses of a multicontact interface, formed between the rough surfaces of two contacting macroscopic solids, {{submitted to a}} biased oscillating shear force. We evidence that beyond a linear viscoelastic regime, observed at low shear amplitude, the interface response exhibits a dissipative component which corresponds to the onset of frictional dissipation. The latter regime exists whereas the tangential force applied, far from the nominal static threshold, does not provoke any sliding. This result, akin to that of Mindlin for a single contact, leads us to extend his model of `microslip' {{to the case of}} an interface composed of multiple <b>microcontacts.</b> While describing satisfactorily the elastic response, the model fails to account quantitatively for the observed energy dissipation, which, we believe, results {{from the fact that the}} key assumption of local Coulomb friction in Mindlin's model is not legitimate at the sub-micrometer scale of the microslip zones within <b>microcontacts</b> between surface asperities.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{measurements}} of the electrical conductivity in both a 2 D triangular lattice of metallic beads and in a chain of beads. The voltage/current characteristics are qualitatively similar in both experiments. At low applied current, the voltage is found to increase logarithmically in a good agreement with a model of widely distributed resistances in series. At high enough current, the voltage saturates due to the local welding of <b>microcontacts</b> between beads. The frequency dependence of the saturation voltage gives {{an estimate of the}} size of these welded <b>microcontacts.</b> The DC value of the saturation voltage (~ 0. 4 V per contact) gives an indirect measure of the number of welded contact carrying the current within the 2 D lattice. Also, a new measurement technique provides a map of the current paths within the 2 D lattice of beads. For an isotropic compression of the 2 D granular medium, the current paths are localized in few discrete linear paths. This quasi-onedimensional nature of the electrical conductivity thus explains the similarity between the characteristics in the 1 D and 2 D systems.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} normal contact and {{friction}} measurements of model multicontact interfaces formed between smooth surfaces and substrates textured with a statistical distribution of spherical micro-asperities. Contacts are either formed between a rigid textured lens and a smooth rubber, or a flat textured rubber and a smooth rigid lens. Measurements {{of the real}} area of contact A versus normal load P are performed by imaging the light transmitted at the <b>microcontacts.</b> For both interfaces, A(P) {{is found to be}} sub-linear with a power law behavior. Comparison with two multi-asperity contact models, which extend the Greenwood–Williamson (J. Greenwood and J. Williamson, Proc. Royal Soc. London Ser. A, 295, 300 (1966)) model by taking into account the elastic interaction between asperities at different length scales, is performed, and allows their validation for the first time. We find that long range elastic interactions arising from the curvature of the nominal surfaces are the main source of the non-linearity of A(P). At a shorter range, and except for very low pressures, the pressure dependence of both density and area of <b>microcontacts</b> remains well described by Greenwood–Williamson's model, which neglects any interaction between asperities. In addition, in steady sliding, friction measurements reveal that the mean shear stress at the scale of the asperities is systematically larger than that found for a macroscopic contact between a smooth lens and a rubber. This suggests that frictional stresses measured at macroscopic length scales may not be simply transposed to microscopic multicontact interfaces...|$|R
5000|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} directed at DPN is the patterning speed. The {{reason for this}} {{has more to do}} with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses. For example, the soft lithography method, <b>microcontact</b> printing (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to <b>microcontact</b> printing. The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application. μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as photolithography can pattern over a large area in a single exposure. Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique. DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate. No one would try to apply <b>microcontact</b> printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern. Even if they did, <b>microcontact</b> printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry. [...] The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and e-beam lithography. No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be [...] "too slow". Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, e-beam lithography is slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world. The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by <b>microcontact</b> printing.|$|E

The ODR serves as p-type contact and comprises the semicon-ductor, a metal layer and an intermediate low-refractive index dielectric layer. The dielectric layer is perforated by {{an array of}} AuZn <b>microcontacts</b> thus enabling electrical conductivity. It is shown that the ODR significantly increases light extraction from an AlGaInP LED as compared to a reference LED employing a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR).

We show that following a two-step change in the normal load the system exhibits nonmonotonic aging and memory effects, two hallmarks of glassy dynamics. These dynamics are strongly influenced by the discrete geometry of the frictional interface, characterized by the attachment and detachment of unique <b>microcontacts.</b> The results are in good agreement with a theoretical model we propose that incorporates this geometry into the framework recently used to describe Kovacs-like relaxation in glasses as well as thermal disordered systems.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of mechanical contacts or <b>microcontacts</b> seeks a nearly uniform current density {{over most of}} contact area. When microtopography is homogeneous, this aim is achieved if nominal shape of contacting surfaces yields a nearly uniform central pressure which decreases monotonously to zero in contour points. These authors derived recently this shape for circular contacts by employing high-order surfaces. This paper extends this result to elliptical contacts. Some results are used to this end, derived for elliptical elastic contacts between high-order surfaces. As homogeneous high order surfaces lead to a highly nonuniform pressure distribution, central pressure is flattened by making the first derivatives of pressure vanish in contact center. Then, the contacts between fourth, sixth, and eighth, order surfaces are analyzed and recurrence relations for pressure distribution and contact parameters are proposed...|$|R
