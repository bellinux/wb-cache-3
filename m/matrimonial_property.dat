25|$|On 9 December 2004 the New Zealand Parliament {{passed the}} Civil Union Bill, {{establishing}} civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The debate over Civil Unions was highly divisive in New Zealand, inspiring great public emotion both {{for and against}} the passing. A companion bill, the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was passed shortly thereafter to remove discriminatory provisions {{on the basis of}} relationship status from a range of statutes and regulations. As a result of these bills, all couples in New Zealand, whether married, in a civil union, or in a de facto partnership, now generally enjoy the same rights and undertake the same obligations. These rights extend to immigration, next-of-kin status, social welfare, <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> and other areas.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{culturally}} separate {{communities have}} retained their own traditions. A developing modern state had {{to determine whether}} it should recognize such traditions as it was establishing a centralized system of law. In South Africa, for example, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 1999 retrospectively recognizes as valid all customary marriages so long as they are registered. Further, s2(3) of the Act provides that, if a person has entered into more than one customary law marriage, all valid marriages entered into before the commencement of the Act, are recognized. The Act similarly recognizes all customary marriages entered into after the commencement of the Act where the High Court approves a written contract regulating the future <b>matrimonial</b> <b>property</b> systems for marriages (both present and prospective spouses must be joined in the application).|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of liberal {{measures}} were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 made provision {{for the welfare of}} children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent. This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage. That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the <b>Matrimonial</b> <b>Property</b> Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed. Another important reform, the 1967 Welsh Language Act, granted 'equal validity' to the declining Welsh language and encouraged its revival. Government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts. The Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969, passed in response to the Aberfan tragedy, made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public. In 1967, corporal punishment in borstals and prisons was abolished. 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts, and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from £7.7 million in 1964/64 to £15.3 million in 1968/69. A Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was also set up, which had paid out over £2 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of customary law on widows‟ inheritance rights in <b>matrimonial</b> <b>properties.</b> The study sampled a total of 120 respondents using simple random, purposive and snow ball sampling techniques. Data were collected using questionnaires on a face to face, interview, observation and documentary reviews Data analysis was done using SPSS version 16 for thematic analysis of quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Results indicated that social effects included the loss of friends and social support (39. 1 %), lack of respect among relatives (58. 4 %) and stigmatization especially by men (65. 9 %). Also, it was observed that, economic effects included poverty (75 %), disinheritance of <b>matrimonial</b> <b>properties</b> (68. 4 %), property grabbing by relatives (75. 9 %) and loss of home asserts (19. 1 %). The study concludes that the effects occurred because of the customary laws were ineffective in protecting widows‟ inheritance rights and <b>matrimonial</b> <b>properties.</b> It is therefore recommended that, {{there is a need}} to create widow related law groups, translate the existing customary laws into Swahili and conduct seminars and workshops that create awareness on the applicability of various customary laws geared at protecting widows‟ inheritance rights in <b>matrimonial</b> <b>properties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Until recently, spouses {{living on}} First Nation {{reserves}} in Canada {{did not have}} access to legal recourse when dealing with their family homes following the dissolution of their relationships. Federal law governing life on First Nation reserves did not address the division of <b>matrimonial</b> real <b>property</b> (MRP), and provincial/territorial law had limited application on reserve. In response to mounting concerns about this “legislative gap,” the federal government undertook a nation-wide “consultation” process (2006 - 2007) aimed at identifying a viable legislative solution to deal with MRP on reserve. The outcome of this process was a seemingly straightforward piece of property legislation that would apparently resolve the legislative gap while simultaneously addressing First Nation concerns around jurisdiction, culture/tradition, and consultation. However, despite being championed as a viable legislative solution, the Act was not widely supported. This research is broadly concerned with exploring theories of property to understand various ways in which property is conceptualized. I trace why these different and often competing conceptualizations of property matter in the context of <b>matrimonial</b> real <b>property</b> on reserve. The study is informed by critical legal geography literature and theories of property that argue spatial-legal categories are not fixed, apolitical and neutral. Rather, they are contested, enacted and inextricably linked to relations of power. I analyze discourses around “solving” the legislative gap in order to highlight the ways in which dominant conceptualizations of property serve to bracket <b>matrimonial</b> real <b>property</b> on reserve, and I consider the discursive “work” of property with respect to <b>matrimonial</b> real <b>property</b> on First Nation reserves in Canada. This research expands an understanding of the potential performativity of property with respect to <b>matrimonial</b> real <b>property,</b> and explores the applicability of property theory to questions concerning Indigenous people(s) and spaces in colonial contexts. Exploring the legal geographies of property on reserve is relevant to current Canadian political and social life, and this research contributes greater insight into and appreciation of this under-theorized topic...|$|R

40|$|Title: Business Share in Joint Ownership of Multiple Individuals The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse a {{business}} share in joint ownership of multiple individuals. This paper {{is composed of}} four parts, each of them dealing with a different variation of the business share in joint ownership. The first part of this work is concerned with a legal interpretation of Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code which, inter alia, sets forth that one business share may be held by more than one person. It introduces basic terminology that will be used throughout the work. It concludes that there are three variations of the business share in joint ownership. The first of them is the business share in co-ownership under Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code (joint business share in the stricter sense); the second is the business share in <b>matrimonial</b> (community) <b>property</b> pursuant to Section 143 paragraph 2 of the Civil Code; and the third is the business share in <b>matrimonial</b> (community) <b>property</b> under Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code (joint business share in the broader sense).

2500|$|On April 21, 2011, Sports Seoul {{broke the}} story (later {{confirmed}} by numerous media outlets) that Seo Taiji had secretly married actress Lee Ji-ah (real name Kim Sang-eun) from October 12, 1997 until August 9, 2006. Their union was kept secret because both Seo and Lee notoriously kept their personal lives hidden from the media. Since the shocking news of Seo and Lee's past union, some have speculated {{that this was the}} reason why Lee's past had been undetectable. The couple first met in 1993, and after Seo temporarily retired in 1996, they got married in 1997 and lived in Atlanta and Arizona, until Seo's return to Korea in June 2000. They were separated since the return. Lee filed for divorce in the U.S. in 2006, citing both lifestyle and personality differences. According to Seo, the divorce was finalized in 2006, which Lee disputed, stating it had been 2009. In January 2011, Lee sued Seo for [...] of her share of <b>matrimonial</b> <b>properties</b> and [...] in alimony, and court papers caused their relationship to go public in April. Seo's estimated worth at the time was reported between [...] ($35–44 million US). After a six-month lawsuit, an out-of-court settlement was reached on the alimony and division of assets in July 2011. In August 2014, Seo released a statement denying several of Lee's claims about their marriage when she made a guest appearance on the talk show Healing Camp, Aren't You Happy.|$|R

An analysis of individual experiences reveals the subtlety and complexity of these practices and circuits: apart from economical constraints, women-led financial practices express, reproduce, actualise and sometimes modify the range of intimate and social relations in which these women are embedded. Our analysis also reflects the weight of existing norms and institutions in each context, especially regarding <b>matrimonial</b> alliances, <b>property</b> rights {{and access to the}} labour market. Moreover, our analysis highlights the permanent process of interpretation, adjustment and sometimes bypassing of these norms.
