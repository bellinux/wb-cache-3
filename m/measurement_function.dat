5000|$|The {{concept of}} a {{synthetic}} instrument is {{a subset of the}} virtual instrument concept. A synthetic instrument is a kind of virtual instrument that is purely software defined. A synthetic instrument performs a specific synthesis, analysis, or <b>measurement</b> <b>function</b> on completely generic, measurement agnostic hardware. Virtual instruments can still have measurement specific hardware, and tend to emphasize modular hardware approaches that facilitate this specificity. Hardware supporting synthetic instruments is by definition not specific to the measurement, nor is it necessarily (or usually) modular.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{hardware}} {{instrumentation systems}} {{are made up}} of pre-defined hardware components, such as digital multimeters and oscilloscopes that are completely specific to their stimulus, analysis, or <b>measurement</b> <b>function.</b> Because of their hard-coded function, these systems are more limited in their versatility than virtual instrumentation systems. The primary difference between hardware instrumentation and virtual instrumentation is that software is used to replace a large amount of hardware. The software enables complex and expensive hardware to be replaced by already purchased computer hardware; e. g. analog-to-digital converter can act as a hardware complement of a virtual oscilloscope, a potentiostat enables frequency response acquisition and analysis in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with virtual instrumentation.|$|E

Furthermore, we show how the calculations can be simplified {{in a variety of}} important special cases, such as systems with additive noise as well as identity system or <b>measurement</b> <b>functions.</b> We introduce several novel key components, particularly a distribution-free prediction algorithm, a new and superior formula for the multiplication of wrapped normal densities, and the ability to deal with non-additive system noise.

50|$|The {{particular}} surrogate data {{testing method}} {{to be used}} {{is directly related to}} the null hypothesis. Usually this is similar to the following:The data is a realization of a stationary linear system, whose output has been possibly measured by a monotonically increasing possibly nonlinear (but static) function. Here linear means that each value is linearly dependent on past values or on present and past values of some independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) process, usually also Gaussian. This is equivalent to saying that the process is ARMA type. In case of fluxes (continuous mappings), linearity of system means that it can be expressed by a linear differential equation. In this hypothesis, the static <b>measurement</b> <b>function</b> is one which depends only on the present value of its argument, not on past ones.|$|E

5000|$|In simple terms, {{the public}} {{electrical}} grid that a power company operates was {{originally designed to}} take power from a single source: the operating company's generators and power plants, and feed it into the grid, where the customers consume the power. Now, some customers are operating power generating devices (solar panels, windmills, etc.) and to save costs (or to generate income) are also feeding power back into the grid. As the electric utility is {{required by law to}} buy power produced by customers, the utility wants to make sure this does not damage the grid. The grid must now be measured and controlled in order to ensure the power going into the grid from other sources is of the same quality and standards that customer equipment has been expecting from it, or, if this is not done, as Rob Landley put it, [...] "people's light bulbs start exploding."

Using the Q matrix instead of the analytically computed H takes <b>measurement</b> <b>function</b> values from a larger area into account, analytical differentiation of the <b>measurement</b> <b>function</b> is not needed, and the numerical approximation can be done for any <b>measurement</b> <b>function</b> (1) that is defined everywhere.
