500|$|Four million {{lines of}} codes {{have been written}} to develop the {{advanced}} combat management system onboard INS Kochi. The system is designed {{so that all the}} data about the surrounding threat comes in one place, along with analysis about the kind of threat. The system also advises the commanding officer about the kind of weaponry he should use to tackle the threat. Obviously, all this happens in real-time. The Ship is equipped with sophisticated digital networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode based Integrated Ship Data Network (AISDN), Combat [...] Management System (CMS), Automatic Power Management System (APMS) and Auxiliary Control System (ACS). The AISDN is the information highway on which data from all the sensors and weapon ride. The CMS is used to integrate information from other platforms using indigenous data-link system, to provide <b>Maritime</b> <b>Domain</b> Awareness. The intricate power supply management is done using APMS, and remote control and monitoring of machinery is achieved through the ACS.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Analysts {{frequently}} {{label the}} BRICS grouping of states (Brazil, India, Russia, China, and South Africa) as primarily an economic club emphasising economic performances as primary objectives. Co-operation of international groupings are rarely, if ever, set {{within the context}} of their access to maritime interests, security, and benefits. A second void stems from the lack of emphasis upon the economic benefits of secured <b>maritime</b> <b>domains.</b> In this vein, a common, but neglected aspect of the BRICS grouping’s power and future influence resides in their <b>maritime</b> <b>domains,</b> the value of which ultimately depends upon the responsible governance and use of ocean territories. The maritime interests of BRICS countries only become meaningful if reinforced by maritime security governance and co-operation in the respective oceans. Presently China and India seem to dominate the maritime stage of BRICS, but the South Atlantic is an often overlooked space. For BRICS the value of the South Atlantic stems from how it secures and unlocks the potential of this maritime space through co-operative ventures between Brazil, South Africa as a late BRICS partner, and West African littoral states in particular. Unfortunately, BRICS holds its own maritime tensions, as member countries also pursue competing interests at sea...|$|R

40|$|Maritime {{activity}} is increasing in the Arctic. So is bilateral cooperation across maritime borders between coast guards intent on protecting natural resources, saving lives and assisting navigation. As tensions rose between Russia and the West in 2014, {{due to the}} conflict in Ukraine, coast guard cooperation in the Bering and Barents Seas was unaffected. Why? How did the respective bilateral cooperative structures between Norway/the United States and Russia develop, and why were they deemed “too vital to cancel” {{in the aftermath of}} events in Ukraine? This article examines how the respective states have developed cooperative regimes since the 1970 s, and subsequently how these regimes have come to constitute the backbone of bilateral management of these vast and invaluable <b>maritime</b> <b>domains.</b> The argument made is that the specific character of coast guards and their role as stewards of the sea separate them from other military structures, making bilateral cooperation not only valuable, but indispensable, to the management of the states’ maritime sovereignty...|$|R

But what defines being NCW-capable? And how do we measure how ready the ADF is to adopt NCW? The NCW Prioritisation and Integration (NPI) methodology has been developed to enable characterisation of the NCW readiness of individual planned military capabilities and how well {{they are likely to}} integrate into the planned force-level systems-of-systems. Individual capabilities are assessed against metrics covering support for human-centric military business processes, sophistication of information management and support for applicable standards. Force integration is assessed through analysis of how well communications and other infrastructure services will support each capability.

The University of Modena and Reggio Emilia is partner of the european project “Designing Dynamic Distributed Cooperative Human-Machine Systems” (D 3 CoS, www. d 3 cos. eu), that aim is the definition of affordable methods, techniques and tools which go beyond assistance systems and consequently address the specification, development and evaluation of cooperative systems from a multi-agent perspective where human and machine agents are in charge of common tasks, assigned to the system as a whole. The key on which to base the cooperation between the machine and the human is the amount of workload of the human operator.

40|$|The {{surveillance}} of geographic borders and critical infrastructures using limited sensor capability {{has always been}} a challenging task in many homeland security applications. While geographic borders may be very long and may go through isolated areas, critical assets may be large and numerous and may be located in highly populated areas. As a result, {{it is virtually impossible to}} secure each and every mile of border around the country, and each and every critical infrastructure inside the country. Most often, a compromise must be made between the percentage of border or critical asset covered by surveillance systems and the induced cost. Although threats to homeland security can be conceived to take place in many forms, those regarding illegal penetration of the air, land, and <b>maritime</b> <b>domains</b> under the cover of day-to-day activities have been identified to be of particular interest. For instance, the proliferation of drug smuggling, illegal immigration, international organized crime, resource exploitation, and more recently, modern piracy, require the strengthening of land border and maritime awareness and increasingly complex and challenging national security environments. The complexity and challenges associated to the above mission and to the protection of the homeland may explain why a methodology enabling the design and optimization of distributed detection systems architectures, able to provide accurate scanning of the air, land, and <b>maritime</b> <b>domains,</b> in a specific geographic and climatic environment, is a capital concern for the defense and protection community. This thesis proposes a methodology aimed at addressing the aforementioned gaps and challenges. The methodology particularly reformulates the problem in clear terms so as to facilitate the subsequent modeling and simulation of potential operational scenarios. The needs and challenges involved in the proposed study are investigated and a detailed description of a multidisciplinary strategy for the design and optimization of detection architectures in terms of detection performance and cost is provided. This implies the creation of a framework for the modeling and simulation of notional scenarios, as well as the development of improved methods for accurate optimization of detection architectures. More precisely, the present thesis describes a new approach to determining detection architectures able to provide effective coverage of a given geographical environment at a minimum cost, by optimizing the appropriate number, types, and locations of surveillance and detection systems. The objective of the optimization is twofold. First, given the topography of the terrain under study, several promising locations are determined for each sensor system based on the percentage of terrain it is covering. Second, architectures of sensor systems able to effectively cover large percentages of the terrain at minimal costs are determined by optimizing the number, types and locations of each detection system in the architecture. To do so, a modified Genetic Algorithm and a modified Particle Swarm Optimization are investigated and their ability to provide consistent results is compared. Ultimately, the modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to obtain a Pareto frontier of detection architectures able to satisfy varying customer preferences on coverage performance and related cost.
