2500|$|The premium {{payments}} are generally quarterly, with <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> (and likewise premium payment dates) falling on March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. Due to the {{proximity to the}} IMM dates, which fall on the third Wednesday of these months, these CDS <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> are {{also referred to as}} [...] "IMM dates".|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis on}} Eurodollar interest rates daily {{data in the}} time period 1990 - 1996, is performed and compared with Libor data in the time period 1984 - 1998. The complementary cumulative distributions for the daily fluctuations at different <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> and the Power Spectral Density are computed. We find that the probability distribution shows `fat' tails with non-Gaussian behaviours. Moreover, we study the correlations among Eurodollar interest rates fluctuations with different <b>maturity</b> <b>dates.</b> By using an original clustering linkage, we show how the collective motion of the interest rates curve can be analyzed in sub-groups of <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> with similar behaviours.

25|$|Putability — Some bonds {{give the}} holder {{the right to}} force the issuer to repay the bond before the <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> on the put dates; see put option. These are {{referred}} to as retractable or putable bonds.|$|E
25|$|Maturity/redemption date: Final {{payment date}} of a loan or other {{financial}} instrument, {{at which point}} the principal (and all remaining interest) is due to be paid. In some cases, there is no <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> (i.e. perpetual), this is often the case with preferred convertibles (e.g. US0605056821).|$|E
25|$|Perpetual {{bonds are}} also often called perpetuities or 'Perps'. They have no <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> The {{most famous of}} these are the UK Consols, which are also known as Treasury Annuities or Undated Treasuries. Some of these were issued back in 1888 and still trade today, {{although}} the amounts are now insignificant. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.|$|E

25|$|The bond is a debt security, {{under which}} the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on {{the terms of the}} bond) is obliged to pay them {{interest}} (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.|$|E
25|$|Callability — Some bonds {{give the}} issuer {{the right to}} repay the bond before the <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> on the call dates; see call option. These bonds are {{referred}} to as callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, bullet or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors {{in a single}} payment. The most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|E
40|$|We study a new {{aspect of}} a company’s debt structure, namely the profile of its <b>maturity</b> <b>dates.</b> Based on {{dispersion}} measures of a firm’s debt maturities, we find that these measures vary sub-stantially across firms and time. Newly issued bond maturities complement pre-existing bond maturities, so firms spread out <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> over time to maintain or increase dispersion of maturity profiles. Using an exogenous shock to rollover risk, we find {{a significant increase in}} ma-turity dispersion for firms which need to roll over expiring bonds. Finally, firms actively manage their maturity profiles and adjust toward target levels, which depend on firm characteristics...|$|R

25|$|Vanilla {{convertible}} bonds {{are the most}} plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right to convert into {{a certain number of}} shares determined according to a conversion price determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> where the nominal value of the bond is redeemable by the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the redemption at par depending on whether or not the stock price is above the conversion price.|$|E
25|$|In the {{traditional}} retail model, borrowers visit a payday lending store and secure a small cash loan, with payment due in full at the borrower's next paycheck. The borrower writes a postdated {{check to the}} lender in the full amount of the loan plus fees. On the <b>maturity</b> <b>date,</b> the borrower is expected {{to return to the}} store to repay the loan in person. If the borrower does not repay the loan in person, the lender may redeem the check. If the account is short on funds to cover the check, the borrower may now face a bounced check fee from their bank in addition to the costs of the loan, and the loan may incur additional fees or an increased interest rate (or both) {{as a result of the}} failure to pay.|$|E
25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to {{interest}} rate risk, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.|$|E
40|$|In this note, we {{describe}} the payoff of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit options (GMDB) embedded in annuity contracts and discuss their valuation using data for the Italian male population as a case study. These put options have stochastic <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> due to the involuntary exercise {{at the moment of}} death. We value the GMDB as a weighted average price of a set of deterministic put options with different <b>maturity</b> <b>dates,</b> where the weights are the probability of death at every date. We take into account the mortality risk and investigate the sensitivity of the price of the option to changes in mortality probability using both deterministic and stochastic approaches...|$|R

2500|$|The issuer has {{to repay}} the nominal amount on the <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> As long as all due {{payments}} have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> The length of time until the <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> {{is often referred to}} as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term of up to 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> (irredeemable).

5000|$|Two or more crops simultaneously: Non-competing crops, {{often with}} {{different}} <b>maturity</b> <b>dates,</b> are planted together in various patterns. Intercropping is one pattern approach; companion planting is a related, complementary practice. This method {{is also known}} as Interplanting: The practice of growing two types of plants in the same space. [...] Interplanting requires a certain amount of preplanning and knowledge of the <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> of different types of vegetables. It has been noted that successful interplanting and intensive gardening is done in raised beds within the planting areas. Planting two or more non-competing crops may raise issues with soil-borne diseases and insects that only affect one type of plant. Depending on how close the interplanting varieties are, crop failure is a possibility.|$|R
50|$|IAM (interest at maturity) - usually loan or deposit {{given for}} special {{period of time}} with only two {{principal}} exchanges made at the settlement and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates.</b> So {{there are only two}} associated cashflows when notional is paid/received and one cashflow that refers to interest payment.|$|R
2500|$|Premium {{redemption}} convertibles such as {{the majority}} of French convertibles and zero-coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs), provide a fixed interest return at issue which is significantly (or completely) {{accounted for by the}} appreciation to the redemption price. If, however, the bonds are converted by investors before the <b>maturity</b> <b>date,</b> the issuer will have benefited by having issued the bonds on a low or even zero-coupon. [...] The higher the premium redemption price, (1) the more the shares have to travel for conversion to take place before the <b>maturity</b> <b>date,</b> and (2) the lower the conversion premium has to be at issue to ensure that the conversion rights are credible.|$|E
