At age 25, he attended The Great Exhibition in London, where he <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> examples {{of architecture and}} culture from around the world. Upon his return home, {{he was asked to}} raise funds for a new organization, the Young Men's Christian Association. With the memory of his trip still fresh, he planned a world bazaar, which was staged at the Tremont Temple. Facades of famous buildings around the world were constructed and staffed by well-known local residents who dressed in authentic costumes and sold items imported for the event. The function was spectacularly successful, and the YMCA of Boston was the first chapter of the organization in the United States. Smith was elected their first president in 1855.|$|E

25|$|Tewodros {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the beautiful widow of Haile Melekot, Tidenekialesh. Recently widowed himself, the Emperor commanded her to accompany him back to Gondar. Tidenekialesh agreed to come, but asked for permission to first visit the Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion at Axum, which she had never visited, before she arrived at Gondar. Tewodros gave his permission, upon which Tidenekialesh traveled to Axum, prayed at the shrine, then promptly fled to the coast, where after much difficulty, she was able to board a ship bound for the Holy Land, where she entered the Ethiopian convent in Jerusalem, and died there several years later, as a nun. Upon learning this, Tewodros <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> loyalty of the widow of Haile Melekot in contrast to the betrayal of the late king's mother and grandmother.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his entrance, Weltlich's {{departure}} did {{not result}} in an exodus of players from the program. Penders' first team returned four starters from the previous season, and two talented transfers—Lance Blanks and Joey Wright—gained eligibility, giving Texas a starting five with three future NBA Draft picks and a fourth starter who would play in the NBA. Penders led his first team to a 25–9 overall record, marking the first 20-win season in ten years at Texas and the then-second-highest win total in school history. He quickly validated his promise to bring high-scoring offense to Texas: in the first nine games of the 1988–89 season, the Longhorns scored more than 100 points five times. In Bob Weltlich's 175 games as head coach, Texas had never scored 100 or more points in a game—and had only scored 90 or more points on four occasions (twice requiring an overtime period to reach that mark). The Longhorns opened the season with an 8–1 record before traveling to Oklahoma City to compete in the four-team All-College Tournament. Texas players openly <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wholesale change in coaching philosophy from prior seasons to one that now encouraged them to shoot in large volumes, and some expressed eagerness to see how they would fare against elite competition with their new style of play. Texas defeated the OSU Cowboys 85–84 in the first contest behind 32 points from sophomore guard Joey Wright and two late free throws from junior guard Lance Blanks, who had transferred from Virginia. The win matched Texas in the tournament final against a high-scoring, sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners team only nine months removed from a four-point loss as a prohibitive favorite in the 1988 national championship game. Billy Tubbs' Sooners revealed the distance that remained between Texas and college basketball's elite teams, building a 63–37 halftime lead en route to an easy 124–95 win. Texas won six games in conference play by five or fewer points to finish in second place in the SWC with a 12–4 record, with two losses to Arkansas and one loss apiece to Houston and Texas A Interspersed among the conference contests were games against NCAA Tournament-bound Vanderbilt, which Texas lost by a score of 94–79, and Miami (FL), which the Longhorns won easily, 123–104. Texas defeated both SMU and TCU in overtime in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final, in which Arkansas defeated the Longhorns {{for the third time in}} 10 weeks. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 11 seed to play in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 10 seasons, where the Longhorns would defeat the sixth-seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 76–70, for the program's first NCAA Tournament victory since 1972. Texas fell in the second round to the sixth-ranked and third-seeded Missouri Tigers, 108–89, to end the season at 25–9, a nine-win improvement over Weltlich's final season. The Longhorns' on-court success—in combination with Penders' appealing, fast-tempo brand of basketball and his tireless promotion of the Texas program—produced a rise in average home attendance from the prior season of almost 149 percent (from 4,028 to 10,011), the largest such increase in NCAA Division I basketball for the 1988–89 season.|$|E

The {{offensive}} subsided on February 15, with around 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> level of both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. [...] "It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around", Vonnegut said. [...] "When we came up the city was gone... They burnt the whole damn town down." [...] Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble. He described the activity as a [...] "terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt".|$|E

'In every country in which communism has taken over,' he reminded the Senate, 'the beginning has been a successful campaign of division and confusion.' He <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way the Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.' 'Were the junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the communists, {{he could not have}} done a better job for them.' 'This is a colossal innocence, indeed.'" ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Germany, Gerber learned about Magnus Hirschfeld and the work he and his Scientific-Humanitarian Committee were doing to reform anti-homosexual German law, {{especially}} Paragraph 175, which criminalized sex between men. Gerber traveled to Berlin, which supported a thriving gay subculture, on several occasions and subscribed {{to at least one}} homophile magazine. Gerber <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> development of the gay community in Berlin and later wrote [...] "I had always bitterly felt the injustice with which my own American society accused the homosexual of 'immoral acts.' What could be done about it, I thought. Unlike Germany, where the homosexual was partially organized and where sex legislation was uniform for the whole country, the United States was in a condition of chaos and misunderstanding concerning its sex laws, and no one was trying to unravel the tangle and bring relief to the abused." [...] He was particularly impressed with the work of a group called Bund für Menschenrechte (Association for Human Rights) and absorbed a number of Hirschfeld's ideas, including the notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate. Following his military service, Gerber returned to the United States and {{went to work for the}} post office in Chicago.|$|E

Bendix had recently become a star supporting player and had already perfected a screen persona of a lovable doofus.

50|$|In 2004, the {{decision}} to take the Govenaires to the Drum Corps Associates (DCA) World Championships was made. Featuring an international field of drum corps, DCA had become an important circuit within the drum and bugle corps community. The corps decided to make its first ever trip out east to Scranton, Pennsylvania to compete. Having a membership base of only 38 performers, the Govenaires placed second in the Class A division and sparked a national following that was previously nonexistent.

60|$|The cowboys all had secrets. Madeline {{learned some}} of them. She <b>marveled</b> most <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strange {{way in which}} they hid emotions, except of {{violence}} of mirth and temper so easily aroused. It was all the more remarkable {{in view of the fact}} that they felt intensely over little things to which men of the world were blind and dead. Madeline had to believe that a hard and perilous life in a barren and wild country developed great principles in men. Living close to earth, under the cold, bleak peaks, on the dust-veiled desert, men grew like the nature that developed them--hard, fierce, terrible, perhaps, but big--big with elemental force.|$|R
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

5000|$|In his Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), Thomas Jefferson defended American Indian {{culture and}} <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> how <b>the</b> tribes of Virginia [...] "never {{submitted}} themselves to any laws, any coercive power, any shadow of government" [...] {{due to their}} [...] "moral {{sense of right and}} wrong". [...] He would later write to the Marquis de Chastellux in 1785, [...] "I believe the Indian then to be in body and mind equal to the whiteman". His desire, as interpreted by Francis Paul Prucha, was for the Native Americans to intermix with European Americans and to become one people. To achieve that end, Jefferson would, as President, offer U.S. citizenship to some Indian nations, and propose offering credit to them to facilitate their trade—with the expectation, as Bernard Sheehan argues, that they would be unable to honor their debts and thereby allow the United States to acquire their land.|$|R
5000|$|As the British {{celebrated in}} the Great Redoubt, some troops carved their {{initials}} on the carriages of captured Russian guns and <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> their achievement, <b>the</b> lack of reinforcements soon made itself clear. The First Division, consisting of the Guards and Highland Brigades, was still crossing the river, and a great Russian column was moving straight for the Greater Redoubt in a counterattack. At one point during the Russian counterattack on the Great Redoubt, as the British prepared to meet the Russian counterattack, an unknown officer shouted [...] "Do not fire! They are French."

5000|$|The princesses did not [...] "dress" [...] until dinner, wearing morning gowns {{nearly all}} day. Even when [...] "dressed", the Royal family often wore plain clothes, {{far removed from}} the ornate splendor of other courts. As there were six princesses, the Queen's {{expenses}} even for these clothes was enormous, and she tried to keep costs down and within the allowance she was given. Moving into this new phase of life meant that the amount of money the Queen was spending on her three eldest daughters was rapidly increasing. The Princesses constantly needed dresses, hats, trimmings, fans, and other items. The quarterly expense for their clothes was estimated to be £2000, and the expense of all their servants and tutors added to that. Yet it all paid off in one way: the Princesses were quickly becoming a familiar sight to the public. When their group portrait was exhibited to the people, it was <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> for <b>the</b> porcelain impersonal beauty they displayed. They were dressed the same, and only their accessories hinted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very different personalities that lay underneath the painted masks.|$|R
2500|$|Descartes, {{among other}} philosophers, <b>marveled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{phenomenon}} {{of what we}} now know as metacognition. [...] "It was not so much thinking that was indisputable to Descartes, but rather thinking about thinking.

She sorrowed but she kept her calm judgment, and set about restoring the interrupted routine of our lives. Putting away all signs of the gray intruder whose hands had scattered the ashes of ruin across our floor, she called on me to aid in uniting our broken circle. Under her influence I soon regained a certain composure. With a realization that it was not fair that she should bear all the burden of the family reorganization, I turned from death and faced the future with her. On her depended the continuation of our family. She was its hope and its saving grace.|$|R

Accompanied by these personages, and with great honor, they were conducted to the interior of the island; where, in a house surprisingly large for a people so far removed from civilization, and which, indeed, they afterwards learned had been built by the Portuguese, they found the king, who received them with much honor He was a tall and stout man, with much dignity in his manner. It was clear that his authority among his people was very great, for even the nobles and councilors whom he had sent to greet them bowed to the dust in his presence.|$|R
