50|$|Burramys parvus, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> {{is a small}} rodent-like marsupial. The <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> has {{an average}} weight of {{approximately}} 45 g and an average head and body length of 110 mm. The species is sexually dimorphic, with males being slightly larger than females. They have large, forward pointing eyes and short pointed snouts. Mountain pygmy possums exhibit diprotodont dentition, with three upper incisors and two upper premolars. On the syndactylous hind feet, they possess an opposable hallux. In addition, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> has a pouch which opens anteriorly and contains 4 teats. Pygmy possums are covered in a layer of fine, dense fur. Their pelage is grayish-brown on the dorsal side, with a darker stripe along the midline of the back, and a pale cream color on the ventral side. They typically have a darker gray ring surrounding the eyes. During breeding season, males become more tawny-orange on the abdomen and flanks. The <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> has a long prehensile tail, averaging about 140 mm in length, which is sparsely haired.|$|E

50|$|The {{national}} park protects many threatened species, including the spotted tree frog, she-oak skink, smoky mouse, broad-toothed mouse and <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum.</b>|$|E
50|$|Research {{has also}} {{extended}} {{to identify the}} threats impacting {{the survival of the}} Bogong moth. This moth species is the preferred food source of <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums.</b> Their arrival during the spring months acts as a seasonal indicator signalling the end of hibernation for the possums. In addition, Bogong moths are rich in protein and fat and they provide <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> with the necessary energy reserves to sustain the seven month hibernation period.|$|R
50|$|Male <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums,</b> on {{the other}} hand, tend to be solitary, leaving nesting sites as juveniles to take {{residence}} in lower elevations of the mountain ranges. For this reason, male <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> generally suffer higher mortality than females as the boulderfields appear to offer some protection from predation. Burramys parvus is noted {{to be the only}} small mammal in Australia that hibernates seasonally for long periods of time. All other members of Burramyidae are capable of opportunistic hibernation.|$|R
50|$|During the {{breeding}} {{season in the}} spring and summer months, older, heavier <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> typically occupy the highest quality habitats. While males are generally tolerant of one another during most of the year, they can act aggressively toward each other during {{the breeding}} season. Aggression is noted in both males and females in the form of tail biting. Females are observed to act very aggressively towards both males and females when defending nesting sites, especially when offspring are present. Additionally, females are aggressive to adult males following the breeding season as well as to juvenile males post-weaning.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the fossil record in 1895 when {{a portion of the}} jaw and skull bones were found in the Wombeyan Caves in central New South Wales. At the time, the species was believed to be extinct. It was not until 1966 that a living individual was found at a ski resort at Mount Hotham in Victoria. Since that time, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> has been located in three isolated, genetically distinct populations in the alpine regions of southern Australia.|$|E
50|$|The two genera of {{pygmy possums}} are Burramys and Cercartetus. Burramys {{contains}} only one extant species, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> B. parvus. As currently understood, Cercartetus {{consists of four}} extant species.|$|E
50|$|Many rare or {{threatened}} {{plant and animal}} species occur within the Snowy Mountains. The Kosciuszko National Park is home to one of Australia's most threatened species (the corroboree frog). The endangered <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> and the more common dusky antechinus are located in the high country of the park.|$|E
40|$|In the {{analysis}} of capture-recapture data it is often assumed that the population is closed and any variability in the expected number of captures between occasions is due {{to changes in the}} capture probabilities. However, {{it is also possible that}} the catchable population changes in a systematic way between occasions. Here a martingale estimating equation approach is used to extend closed population estimators to models with systematic changes in the population size that may be explained by covariates. The procedure is applied to capture-recapture data collected on a population of <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> (Burramys Parvus) with capture occasions before and after a major bushfire, to examine the effect of the fire on the population size.

50|$|Many hibernating, small-bodied mammals {{hibernate}} {{in simple}} {{holes in the}} ground, though some use complex systems of tunnels and burrows. <b>Mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> in New South Wales, Australia dig holes in the ground to form hibernacula, with the preferred location being in boulder fields under a layer of snow. During {{the first few months}} of hibernation, possums awaken occasionally and leave one hibernaculum in favor of another, seemingly in an effort to find the hibernaculum with the most suitable microclimate. The reddish-grey mouse lemur also wakes and leaves the hibernaculum spontaenously and for brief periods of time. Their hibernacula are located in holes in large trees with varying levels of insulation. However, the range of insulation levels is relatively narrow, as there are often small numbers of suitably large trees. There can be hibernacula differences even within a species. In Columbian ground squirrels, hibernacula size is proportional to the weight of the individual occupying it, with adults having deeper hibernacula than juveniles, unlike black bears. Most juveniles choose to hibernate within 20 meters of their mother's burrow; those that don't have higher mortality rates.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Cercartetus concinnus), {{also known}} as the southwestern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> or the mundarda, is a small {{marsupial}} found in Australia. Genetic studies indicate its closest relative is probably the eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> from which its ancestors diverged around eight million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} been long {{been used as a}} base for {{environmental}} research, for example for plankton studies in the nearby post glacial lake Blue Lake in 1937 using a flat bottomed boat, and more recently, for example in 1997 as a heliport for studies of the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many rare or {{threatened}} {{plant and animal}} species occur within the boundaries of the park and nine separate wilderness areas have been identified in the latest management scheme. The park is home to one of Australia's most threatened species: the corroboree frog. The endangered <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> and the more common dusky antechinus are located in the high country of the park.|$|E
50|$|Mountain {{pygmy possums}} are nocturnal creatures, preferring to sleep {{during the day}} and forage at night. While all other members of the family Burramyidae are arboreal, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> is a {{terrestrial}} species. The preferred habitat of these pygmy possums is within deep boulderfields in alpine regions of Southern Australia. The females tend to stay in familial groups of up to 10 related individuals. Females also tend to be relatively sedentary and exhibit high nest site fidelity.|$|E
50|$|Banksia <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Possum,</b> {{formerly}} Banksia Austraflora <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Possum,</b> {{and also}} {{known by its}} extended cultivar name Banksia serrata <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Possum,</b> is a registered Banksia cultivar. It is a sprawling, very low growing coastal form of Banksia serrata (Saw Banksia), with very small leaves and small inflorescences.|$|R
50|$|The Tasmanian <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Cercartetus lepidus), {{also known}} as the little <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> is the world's {{smallest}} possum. It was first described by Oldfield Thomas in 1888, after he identified that a museum specimen labelled as an eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> in fact represented a species then unknown to science. The holotype resides in the British Museum of Natural History.|$|R
50|$|Mammals found {{include the}} brushtail possum, {{ringtail}} possum, sugar glider, eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> little <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> echidna, wombats, New Holland mouse, swamp rat, water rat, Tasmanian bettong and the long-nosed potoroo.|$|R
50|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} by alpine herbfield, heaths, bogs and fens supporting a range of native plants and animals, including rare, vulnerable and endangered species, {{as well as several}} kinds of invertebrate restricted to the alpine zone. Rare or threatened plants found within the Ramsar site include the branched carraway, wedge oschatzia and snow-wort, as well as the endangered ecological community of Montane Peatlands and Swamps. Threatened animals found there include the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> and broad-toothed rat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> is {{endemic to}} the alpine regions of {{southern}} Australia. The species is currently restricted to three isolated mountain regions: (1) Mount Blue Cow in Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales, (2) Mount Bogong and Mount Higginbotham/Loch in the Bogong High Plains in Victoria, and (3) Mount Buller in Victoria. The typical home ranges within these mountain ranges differ {{for males and}} females. Females tend to reside at higher elevations of approximately 1400-2228 m near patches of block streams and other deep boulder formations. The home range of a female <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> is correlated with the density of Bogong moths, the pygmy possum’s preferred food source, which varies at different elevations. Females at higher elevations have smaller home ranges due to a relatively greater abundance of Bogong moths, whereas females residing at lower elevations typically have much larger home ranges as the quantity of moths declines. Male mountain pygmy possums reside at low elevations, generally between 1200-1300m, of these mountain ranges. Male home ranges are largest during the breeding season, between November and December, when they migrate to female nesting sites, and decline thereafter.|$|E
50|$|As of 2008, the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> {{has been}} {{declared}} by the IUCN Redlist as Critically endangered. Population estimates totalled less than 2000 individuals from the three combined isolated populations in 2000. Current population estimates indicate that these numbers have severely declined in the last decade. The most recent study conducted in 2006 at Mount Buller tallied only 30 adults. As of 2007, the number of females recorded at Mount Blue Cow had Kosciuzsko {{with a total of}} 60 individuals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> are {{a family}} of small possums that {{together}} form the marsupial family Burramyidae. The five extant species of <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> are grouped into two genera. Four of the species are endemic to Australia, with one species also co-occurring in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.|$|R

50|$|The Bogong High Plains {{continues}} to have an important place in scientific research. In summer, large numbers of scientists conduct research in the area, including studies of hydrology, vegetation change, fire response, weed invasions, occurrence of native animals (<b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> alpine skink) and introduced species (such as hares). The area {{is also home to}} a component of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX), which investigates aspects of global climate change. It is trying to predict the future impacts of temperature increases.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this is a}} harsh {{environment}} there is much endemic wildlife in the Alps including the chameleon-like Alpine thermocolor grasshopper, <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Burramys parvus) and the corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree). One particularly restricted range species is the Baw Baw frog (Philoria frosti) which only lives on the Baw Baw Plateau in Victoria. The larger mammals of the lower elevations include red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus).|$|E
50|$|Of major faunal {{significance}} is the endangered <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Burramys parvus), which from 1894 until 1966 was only {{known from the}} fossil record, and the threatened broad-toothed mouse. These small marsupials are adapted to mountain life, however most other Australian animals {{find it hard to}} survive the cold climate and heavy snow. Animals that do manage to survive in the area and are occasionally seen include eastern grey kangaroos, wombats, platypus, crows, magpies, crimson rosellas, flame robins, and introduced animals such as rabbits, foxes and red deer.|$|E
5000|$|Cercartetus nanus, {{the eastern}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum,</b> a {{marsupial}} species found in south-eastern Australia ...|$|R
50|$|Bones of {{this species}} are often {{recorded}} as fossils or sub-fossils from late Pleistocene and Holocene cave deposits in south-eastern Australia. It is incorporated into the fossil record because owls and/or quolls that have preyed on eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> (and other small mammals) deposit regurgitated or faecal pellets in caves which then act as excellent preservation sites. About 50 such sites form the fossil record for the eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tasmanian <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> is nocturnal and arboreal. It lives {{primarily}} in shrubland or forest undergrowth, and, {{although a good}} climber, rarely ventures into the higher branches of trees, presumably because this would make it more vulnerable to avian predators. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>possums</b> use strips of bark to construct dome-like nests in tree cavities or rotten wood, but are solitary animals that do not share their nests with other individuals except for their own young.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife has {{implemented}} captive {{breeding programmes}} under {{the support and}} guidance of Linda Broome and her colleagues. In addition, Zoos Victoria has also {{become involved in the}} effort to sustain the remaining populations of mountain pygmy possums. The Zoos Victoria started a captive breeding programme for B. parvus in 2007 in the Healesville Sanctuary. The programme currently cares for a population of 45 mountain pygmy possums. Their overall goal is to down-list the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> to a lower-threat category on the IUCN Redlist.|$|E
50|$|Phalangeriformes are quadrupedal diprotodont {{marsupials}} {{with long}} tails. The smallest species, indeed the smallest diprotodont marsupial, is the Tasmanian pygmy possum, {{with an adult}} head-body length of 70 mm and a weight of 10 g. The largest are the two species of bear cuscus which may exceed 7 kg. Phalangeriformes species are typically nocturnal and at least partially arboreal. They inhabit most vegetated habitats, and several species have adjusted well to urban settings. Diets range from generalist herbivores or omnivores (the common brushtail possum) to specialist browsers of eucalyptus (greater glider), insectivores (<b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum)</b> and nectar-feeders (honey possum).|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{threats to}} the <b>mountain</b> <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> populations include habitat {{destruction}} and fragmentation, climate change, predation by feral cats and red foxes, and {{threats to the}} Bogong moth. The construction of ski resorts in the alpine regions in which the mountain pygmy possums inhabit {{has been one of}} the greatest factors attributed to population decline. At Mount Higginbotham, a major road constructed to the Mount Hotham ski resort prevented male mountain pygmy possums from migrating to the female nesting sites during the breeding season. This physical barrier was noted to markedly increase winter mortality in the Mount Higginbotham population. In response to this, an underground tunnel was constructed which provided male pygmy possums with an alternative migratory route.|$|E
5000|$|Rosenberg's goanna (Varanus rosenbergi), eastern <b>pygmy</b> <b>possum</b> (Cercartetus nanus), and the {{squirrel}} glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) are species listed as vulnerable which inhabit the park.|$|R
50|$|Native flora {{within the}} park {{includes}} shrub banksia, one-sided bottlebrush and parrot bush. Fauna includes emus, honey <b>possums,</b> western <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums,</b> short-beaked echidnas, western grey kangaroos, Australian bustards and many reptiles.|$|R
50|$|The genus Cercartetus is a {{group of}} very small <b>possums</b> known as <b>pygmy</b> <b>possums.</b> Four species {{comprise}} this genus, which together with the genus Burramys make up the marsupial family Burramyidae.|$|R
