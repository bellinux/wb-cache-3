The stochastic adding A/D conversion is an adaptive process. The accuracy of measurements using SAADK {{is proportional to the}} square root from <b>measurement</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval,</b> i. e. for the twice greater accuracy, the <b>measurement</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> must be four times longer. The adaptivity of the accuracy of measurement and the possibility of direct fuzzyfication decreases hardware complexity and increases the speed and reliability.

The temporal correlation function scales as a power law in time, t^ 1 /n with measured values of 1 /n varying over a range of 0. 19 pm 0. 04 to 0. 29 pm 0. 04 with no dependence on temperature. The average value of 1 /n = 0. 24 pm 0. 01 is consistent with step-edge diffusion limited fluctuations (n = z = 4, conserved noise). The magnitude of the time correlation function and the width of the fluctuations both scale with temperature with the same apparent activation energy of Eeff = 0. 21 pm 0. 02 eV, indicating that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent. Direct analysis of the autocorrelation function confirms that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent, and thus the apparent correlation length is strongly temperature dependent. This behavior can be reproduced by assuming that the apparent correlation length is governed by the longest wavelength of step fluctuations that can be sampled in the <b>measurement</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> Evaluation of the correlation time for previous measurements for Al/Si(111) (z = 2) yields the same conclusion about <b>measurement</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> In both cases the ratio of the measurement time to the effective correlation time is on the order of 10...|$|E

Mutual injection of the subharmonic waves is achieved by using an intracavity quarter-wave plate.

This article investigates {{the design of a}} passive sensor system to be integrated into a stent for the detection of an in-stent restenosis by measuring the local pulse wave velocity (PWV). The proposed system uses two resonant circuits consisting of a capacitive pressure sensor and a coil as transponders. The pressure sensors are located at the proximal and distal end of the stent. An alternating external magnetic field with a constant frequency is applied such that the resonance frequencies of the transponders cross the excitation frequency when the pulse wave passes. The time delay between the resonances at the transponders can be captured to obtain the PWV. A model for the measurement system and a correlation between transponder design parameters and minimal resolvable time delay are derived. This correlation is based on the criterion that the 3 dB bandwidth of the transponder resonances may not overlap in the <b>measurement</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> This correlation can be used to design and analyze a transponder system for the proposed measurement system.
