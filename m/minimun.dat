JUNESMUN is a national Model United Nations conference that covers topics that are currently discussed in the UN. ISYFUN, the intra-Swiss Forum on the United Nations, is another major event that include a visit to the UN headquarters in Geneva. In addition, a workshop on a UN related topic, a MUN Workshop (e.g. a training on rhetoric, Rules of Procedures), a panel discussion and <b>MiniMUN</b> (Model United Nations conferences at high schools) are organized each year.Besides, UNYA Switzerland conducts various nonrecurring events. In 2011, a large youth UN General Assembly was held in the House of Parliament in Bern. This event took place in connection with the election of Joseph Deiss {{as the president of the}} UN General Assembly. The same year, a media workshop was conducted for MUN teams from across Europe. This workshop aimed to strengthen the communication skills of youth associations in order to raise awareness of UN issues more effectively. In 2013, an intercultural study project is being organized that focuses on the issue of corporate social responsibility. Several events are held in Switzerland and a study trip to Ghana in cooperation with UNYA Ghana takes places.|$|E

40|$|Malaysia had {{introduced}} the Minimum Wage Policy in May 2012 and employers were given until July 2013 to begin {{complying with the}} new regulation. The policy mandates a floor wage of RM 900 (equivalent to USD 300) and RM 800 (equivalent to USD 267) permonth for Peninsular and East Malaysia respectively. While many low income employees, especially unskilled workers, were overjoyed by the gazetted <b>Minimun</b> Wage Order, such move has outraged small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are reluctant to comply due to possible increase in operational costs and even close-downs. This paper seeks to gather the level of awareness and perception of SME's towards this policy, their rate of compliance and outcomes {{as reported by the}} SMEs. Data was collected from 459 small and medium enterprises in Malaysia. Findings show that SMEs which are complaint have high level of awareness and have positive perceptions towards <b>minimun</b> wage order. However, level of awareness and perception are not significantly related to non-compliance. Some other negative effects reported include unemployment, foreign workers employment, increase in business costs, hike in inflation, effect on foreign direct investments and many more. SMEs also question the rationale for single <b>minimun</b> wage order whilst other neighboring countries resorted to multiple wage according to sector or region. The findings from this research which structure the vies and feedback accordingly by region, state, industry and sectors will be usefull not only to all SMEs but also to the National Wage Consultative Council and the Ministry of Human Resource...|$|E

40|$|We discuss {{different}} {{criteria for}} “classical size ” of extremal Dirichlet p-branes in type-II supergravity. Using strong–weak coupling duality, {{we find that}} the size of the strongcoupling region {{at the core of the}} (p < 3) –branes, is always given by the asymptotic string-scale, if measured in the weakly coupled dual string-metric. We also point out how the eleven-dimensional Planck scale arises in the classical 0 -brane solution, as well as the ten-dimensional Planck scale in the D-instanton solution. March 1997 One of the interesting properties of Dirichlet-branes (D-branes) [1], [2], is their sharp character in space-time. Since they are perturbatively defined as a boundary condition for open-string propagation, they have no “bare ” size. Still, they interact at a perturbative level via virtual-string exchange, and there is an effective string-scale “halo ” which represents a <b>minimun</b> size for perturbative string probes (with the notable exception of the D-instanton [3]). A <b>minimun</b> distance of the order of the string scale is also singled out when considering the short-distance interactions of branes and anti-branes [4], [5], [6], [7], due to a local analogue of the well-known Hagedorn phenomenon (see for example [8]). On the other hand, if we use D-branes themselves as probes [9], [10], [11], [12], we ca...|$|E
