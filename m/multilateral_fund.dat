With ozone depletion a global (rather than merely regional) problem, measures to address it have necessarily been international efforts. The international treaty that addressed ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol (with its subsequent amendments), has widely been hailed as a success. However, the triumphs of the Montreal Protocol are inseparable from its <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Fund,</b> whose creation was a prerequisite for developing nations, including juggernauts China and India, to ratify the Protocol. Since its inception the Fund has supplied over $ 2. 5 billion to initiatives that support the phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals in developing nations. These projects have increasingly employed market mechanisms to achieve efficient results, and have generated positive profits for participating firms. Funded initiatives have included upgrading capital, educating maintenance workers, production buyouts, public awareness, and institutional strengthening. Aside from ensuring the success of the overall Protocol, this last item will likely be the Multilateral Fund’s most enduring legacy, as inherent shortcomings of the Fund have largely been attributed to its status as a pioneering financial mechanism. The <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Fund</b> has broken new ground in international environmental regulation and shown that success on ecological issues is indeed possible at the global level, leading many to hope that the Fund will serve as a model for future mechanisms to address climate change. While the more complex chemistry and economics of climate change make such a ready duplication of the Multilateral Fund’s success unlikely, the Fund’s role in strengthening institutions that address ecological concerns has undoubtedly smoothed the way for future international environmental action...|$|E

40|$|The pricing of {{sovereign}} credit risk {{is a necessary}} component of the financial architecture of the European Monetary Union. However, unnecessarily high and volatile risk premia on government bonds are currently preventing effective financial intermediation within the euro area, thereby inhibiting its economic recovery. Several proposals have been made on how these risk premia should be brought down, namely i) permanent pooling of funding through joint bond issuance, ii) temporary liquidity assistance through <b>multilateral</b> <b>funds,</b> iii) debt buybacks using <b>multilateral</b> <b>funds,</b> and iv) debt restructuring. This paper attempts to evaluate these four proposals. It argues that joint bond issuance will not achieve a meaningful reduction of liquidity premia in the sovereign bond market; these instruments would either create perverse incentives or accelerate the sovereign debt crisis for peripheral Europe. An institution to provide temporary liquidity assistance is a necessary addition to the institutional framework of EMU – {{there needs to be}} an EMF to complement the ECB. Debt buybacks using <b>multilateral</b> <b>funds</b> can be a very useful tool for solvent countries such as Spain; they can prevent an overshooting of risk premia that could turn a sovereign liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis. A quantitative assessment shows that debt buybacks at market prices are insufficient to correct Greece’s debt overhang, however. In the case of Greece, a voluntary exchange of existing government bonds into new obligations, complemented by a buyback option at a steep discount to face value, could restore sovereign creditworthiness and allow the private sector to regain market access at acceptable interest rates. In the absence of such an orderly and controlled reduction of public debt, highly indebted euro area governments will likely opt to restructure their sovereign debt unilaterally, if they fail to regain market access after several years. This could have unwelcome consequences for financial stability in the euro area, which should be avoided through a creative and cooperative approach to the problem...|$|R

40|$|In 1991, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was {{established}} as a <b>multilateral</b> <b>fund,</b> recognizing a need for international resource transfer for environmental activities in developing countries. After UNCED in 1992, the GEF was restructured {{in order to become}} an independent organization serving as the financial mechanism for developing country implementation of several environmental Conventions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate and explain the effectiveness of the GEF for the UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). The theoretical approach of this study was based on theories of International Environmental Regime Effectiveness, and I attempted to assess the extent to which the GEF has played an enabling role for the developing countries not yet disposing the necessary and relevant capacity for Convention implementation. The main findings of this study, was that the effectiveness of the GEF varied both according to the different tasks assigned by the Convention and across the group of developing countries. The GEF performed generally well in terms of developing strategies and programs to devise ways in which financial and technology transfers can be made in line with the Convention obligations and objectives. This study also found the GEF’s project portfolio to reflect a funding strategy recognizing the different needs of the different developing countries in the regime. In terms of the outcome of GEF-financed projects, GEF’s performance appears to be mixed. The GEF was given a high score in terms of enabling developing countries to meet their obligations under the Convention. GEF’s efforts to raise awareness and understanding of the problem, and to facilitate policy development appear, however, to have generated varied results. The GEF was found to be more effective in facilitating capacity building in a few developing countries considered to be extremely important due their high levels of greenhouse gas-emissions, but achieved considerably less in other countries. The general pattern flowing from GEF-supported activities was, nevertheless, that project outcomes are slow in emerging, and that the acquisition of technological know-how appears to be more difficult than expected. Two independent variables contributed to explain effectiveness, problem-solving capacity and problem characteristics. Regarding the former, problem-solving capacity was found to vary depending on the different rules of access and decision-making procedures practiced by the different forums of the GEF. In terms of explaining the above findings regarding project outcomes, one factor in particular was found to be important, GEF’s capacity to function as a channel for information. While a few countries have acquired considerable knowledge of GEF’s programs and policies for technology transfer, the majority of developing countries appear to have little understanding of neither the GEF nor its programs and procedures. A consequence of these countries lack of knowledge is that the GEF’s project cycle has become extremely long and complicated, sometimes resulting in projects outcomes that are not necessarily in line with the objectives of the Conventions. Both power and instrumental leadership loomed large within the setting of the GEF. While the most powerful actor, the US was found to be somewhat of a laggard, the GEF CEO proved to be instrumental in the decision-making processes in the GEF forums. The degree to which these actors affected GEF’s problem-solving capacity was difficult to assess, as they worked in opposite direction of each other. This study nevertheless found that many of the limitations faced by GEF’s problem-solving capacity could be traced back to the characteristics of the problem. Problem characteristics were mainly used to shed some additional light on the challenges faced by the GEF and in so doing, became an increasingly important explanatory factor of the GEF’s mixed performance. The problem of climate change was found to be extremely malign due the asymmetrical distribution of past, current and future greenhouse gas-emissions between the developed and developing countries. The developing countries did not display much interest in undertaking climate change activities unless they were related to development issues. The financial resources made available through the GEF appear not to have been sufficient in terms of creating a financial incentive in that regard. The developing countries lack of interest can, nevertheless, also be traced back to the institutional arrangements governing the resource transfer. The GEF is based on existing institutions, and its connection with the World Bank appear to have given the GEF a credibility problem at country level and has discouraged developing country participation in the climate-regime. Based on these findings, this study found that the GEF did not manage to attract sufficient developing country interest; instead it was seen as just one of many donors in the field functioning within a very complex system. Under such conditions, this study concluded that the likelihood that an effective regime would emerge was small...|$|E
40|$|The {{discussion}} paper assesses selected options currently “on the table” {{in the international}} debate and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD). REDD design options are analyzed {{with regard to their}} implications for overall climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and equity issues. First of all, it is found that for REDD to be successful it will not be sufficient simply to put a price on forest carbon. Instead, to permanently reduce and stop global deforestation, REDD needs to trigger a change in our dominant human development model, which will require policy reforms and enforcement to prevent markets from driving deforestation. Among other things, this needs to be reflected in the design of a REDD mechanism, which must i) pay heed to the complex task of reducing deforestation, allowing for a flexible, country-specific approach, to ensure broad participation to tackle deforestation on a global scale; ii) address deforestation by integrating REDD into overall development planning, to achieve lasting results and maximize synergies with other development goals; and iii) be consistent with the overall mitigation effort to prevent dangerous climate change. The scope of REDD, definitions and several methodological issues will have a decisive influence on the extent of benefits, or in some cases even threats, REDD will have for biodiversity conservation and equitable access to REDD. The design of transfer systems at both the international and national level is key to enabling countries to permanently reduce deforestation and forest degradation. To do so, transfer systems must go beyond mere compensation for avoided deforestation. Instead, they must be embedded in overall development planning and engage in providing alternative (at best low-carbon, low-resource) livelihoods. This will require political reforms and investment into other sectors, which may not immediately lead to emission reductions in the forest sector. Transfers channelled through a REDD offsetting mechanism are less suited to do so unless proper national transfer systems are in place. Alternatively, the Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Mechanism (TDERM) Triptych or the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, the latter complemented by the UN REDD Programme, {{could be used as a}} transitional international transfer system for REDD funds in the period 2013 – 2020. Given their comprehensive international approach to tackling deforestation, both can be expected to perform better concerning active consideration of human, and especially indigenous people’s rights, and delivery of benefits other than carbon retention. It is safe to assume that REDD in the period 2013 – 2020 will require several billion US$ a year to set the incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. The real costs may differ significantly from opportunity cost calculations though, both under an offset scheme and a market-linked approach, where prices would either be determined by the market or be negotiated. While prices will influence a countries decision to reduce deforestation, a price below the opportunity costs would not necessarily reverse a countries decision (and policies) to reduce deforestation. The discussion on how these funds should be raised continues to be the most controversial one. While the demand from the Annex-I compliance market in the 2013 – 2020 period could most likely absorb all emission reductions through a REDD offset mechanism, this would seriously undermine domestic emission reductions in countries listed in Annex-I of the UNFCCC (Annex-I countries) and set the world on a path towards dangerous climate change. Depending on whether Annex-I countries commit to low or ambitious 2020 - targets in Copenhagen and the amount of emission reductions from REDD and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Annex-I countries could offset 24 to 69 % of their emissions via the CDM and REDD (not counting Brazil). Furthermore, the present uncertainty on Annex-I reduction targets and quantitative “REDD targets” set by countries not listed in Annex-I of the UNFCCC (non-Annex-I countries) makes it impossible to foresee the impact of REDD on carbon prices. Two models with different policy assumptions show, though, that REDD has a great potential to destabilize the compliance market, unless regulatory instruments, like e. g. banking of credits, are applied. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 4 th Assessment Report, emission reductions of 25 – 40 % in Annex-I and 15 – 30 % in non-Annex-I countries are necessary to see global emissions peak before 2015 and to stabilize the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 450 ppm, which is considered the threshold to dangerous climate change. To design REDD as an offset mechanism for Annex-I compliance, Annex-I 2020 -targets would need to be around 38 %. Limiting the amount of REDD offsets to be used for Annex-I compliance could solve the problem of domestic emission reductions. However, it would also reduce the amount of funding below the level deemed necessary to reduce deforestation significantly. Furthermore, there are legitimate concerns that an offset mechanism could potentially yield lower benefits for biodiversity conservation and lead to an inequitable distribution of funds, though this depends strongly on the governance structure and type of national transfer system of each participating country. Market-linked approaches such as the TDERM or another <b>multilateral</b> <b>fund</b> supplied with proceeds from the auctioning of emission allowances would also be able to raise the necessary funding without jeopardizing domestic emission reductions in Annex-I countries. Here, estimates range from 5. 7 to 113 bn US$ annually, though the top-end figure would have to be split between finance for adaptation, REDD and technology transfer...|$|E
