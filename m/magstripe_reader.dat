50|$|The MM {{feature is}} encoded {{in the middle}} layer of an ISO/IEC 7810 card as a bar code formed by two {{materials}} with different electrical properties. A capacitive sensor head near the <b>magstripe</b> <b>reader</b> observes the changing capacitance as the card is moved past the sensor and decodes the represented number. This sensor works {{in a similar fashion}} to the magnetic read head found in a magstripe card reader, except that it senses not a change in magnetic flux, but a change in the dielectric constant of the card's material. It reads a second data stripe that, unlike the magstripe, cannot easily be rewritten with off-the-shelf equipment.|$|E
5000|$|On November 24, 2015, Samy Kamkar {{released}} MagSpoof; {{a portable}} device that can spoof/emulate any magnetic stripe or credit card [...] "wirelessly", even on standard <b>magstripe</b> <b>readers</b> by generating a strong electromagnetic field that emulates a traditional magnetic stripe card.|$|R
5000|$|Classic [...] - {{user-friendly}} easy to operate, {{available with}} either a magnetic strip (<b>magstripe)</b> card <b>reader,</b> or with optional dual magnetic lock/smart card ability.|$|R
2500|$|On March 27, 1996, Lexmark's {{contract}} to make keyboards for IBM expired, and Lexmark transitioned its keyboard business to IBM and other vendors. Some of its manufacturing assets {{were sold to}} a group of Lexmark employees, who formed Unicomp. Unicomp still manufactures its version of the Model M (similar to part number 42H1292 but first renamed 42H1292U and subsequently the [...] "Customizer"), as well as other configurations including updated 104- and 105-key layouts; a Unix layout (where the Ctrl and Caps Lock keys and Esc and tilde keys are transposed); models with integrated pointing sticks or trackballs; and POS-specific models such as those with built-in <b>magstripe</b> <b>readers.</b> When Lexmark discontinued keyboard production in March 1996, IBM continued production in Greenock, Scotland and subcontracted production of the Model M13 keyboard (IBM Enhanced Keyboard with TrackPoint II) to Maxi Switch in Mexico. These companies stopped producing Model M's in 1999 and 1998 respectively. Although current Unicomp models may still be purchased, original production models retain their value well among collectors and computer enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|In his own words, MagSpoof {{can be used}} as a {{traditional}} credit card and simply store all of your credit cards (and with modification, can technically disable chip requirements) in various form factors, or can be used for security research in any area that would traditionally require a <b>magstripe,</b> such as <b>readers</b> for credit cards, drivers licenses, hotel room keys, automated parking lot tickets, etc.|$|R
