50|$|The optical Kerr effect, or AC Kerr {{effect is}} the case in which the {{electric}} field is due to the light itself. This causes a variation in index of refraction which is proportional to the local irradiance of the light. This refractive index variation is responsible for the nonlinear optical effects of self-focusing, self-phase modulation and modulational instability, and is the basis for Kerr-lens modelocking. This effect only becomes significant with very intense beams such as those from lasers. The optical Kerr effect has also been observed to dynamically alter the mode-coupling properties in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre,</b> a technique that has potential applications for all-optical switching mechanisms.|$|E

In contrast to other optically random environments, <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> feature remarkably faithful cylindrical symmetry. Our experimental studies challenge the commonly held notion that classifies <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> as unpredictable optical systems. Instead, we demonstrate that commercially available <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> are capable of performing as extremely precise optical components. We show that, with a sufficiently accurate theoretical model, light propagation within straight or even significantly deformed segments of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> may be predicted up to distances in excess of hundreds of millimetres. Harnessing this newly discovered predictability in imaging, we demonstrate the unparalleled power of multimode fibre-based endoscopes, which offer exceptional performance both in terms of resolution and instrument footprint.

40|$|When {{research}} on optical fibre communications was first started in 1966 the main interest was in single-mode fibres {{since it was}} thought that the bandwidth of step-index fibres, the only type under consideration at the time, would be rather limited. Subsequently, with the development of SELFOC and other types of graded-index fibres, a high degree of equalisation of the group velocities of the fibre modes became possible so that the bandwidth available with <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> was greatly increased. Interest then shifted away from single-mode fibres because of the difficulties of handling, launching, jointing and fabrication and also because the lifetimes of semiconductor lasers, the only small and relatively efficient sources possible, were not high. However the limits of bandwidth which are theoretically possible with an optimum refractive-index distribution are difficult to achieve in practice and the technology has now advanced to the stage where single-mode fibres may not be as difficult to incorporate into a practical system as was first thought. A renewed interest has therefore been shown in small-core fibres and a comparison of their properties with those of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> is presented here...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A Radio-over-Fibre {{system to}} {{distribute}} wireless LAN signals over <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> {{has been designed}} and analysed. The system employs a novel frequency multiplication technique, to surmount modal-dispersion-induced bandwidth limitation in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> in general and in Graded Index Polymer Optical Fibre (GIPOF) in particular. This is achieved by frequency modulating the optical signal at the source, and then periodically filtering the received signal at the remote station prior to direct detection by the photodiode. Data modulation is added by intensity modulating the frequency modulated optical signal. While {{the frequency of the}} modulating signal at the source is limited by the fibre’s modal bandwidth, the frequency of the generated electrical microwave signal is not. The frequency of the generated electrical signal is determined by optical parameters such as the optical frequency deviation impressed at the source, and the free spectral range of the periodic filter at the remote station. Simulation results show that the system is capable of generating high purity electrical carriers at 5. 4 GHz, and higher microwave and millimetre wave frequencies, which are several orders of magnitude beyond the bandwidth of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> for link lengths of up to 500 m. In addition, the system can handle both linear and constant envelop modulated data such as ASK, PSK and QAM at capacities beyond 56 Mbps per carrier. The use of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibre</b> and especially GIPOF in the wireless LAN feeder network instead of standard single-mode fibre greatly reduces installation and maintenance costs while offering more capacity than the present copper-based infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to make high-density broadband wireless LANs of the future, economically and technically feasible...|$|E

40|$|It is {{virtually}} {{taken for granted}} that the world’s data traffic grows exponentially with time. However the bandwidth of the optical fibre which underpins {{so much of the}} world’s networking infrastructure is not some inexhaustible source of capacity which can be extended indefinitely without some fairly radical approaches to the way light is transmitted down the fibre. Recently, particularly in the 12 months [1 - 4], modal multiplexing in few-modes and <b>multimode</b> <b>fibres</b> has garnered growing interest and has been proposed and demonstrated as a means of exploiting the modal nature of a fibre by transmitting independent channels of information using different eigenmodes of the fibre waveguide. LCoS based Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) are likely to {{play a key role in}} these systems as their ability to adaptively control the amplitude and phase of the light entering and leaving the fibre makes them relevant for both controlling the modal excitation at the transmitting end of the fibre, as well as detecting and demultiplexing the modes at the receiver.
