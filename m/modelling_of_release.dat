40|$|The {{deployment}} of a safe, reliable, and financially economical carbon-capture and storage chain requires detailed considerations {{to be made}} of the hazards of CO 2 transportation, and the risks involved in pipeline operation. CO 2 poses a number of dangers upon its release, and one major concern is the escalation of a pipeline rupture event due to Joule-Thomson cooling within the vicinity of the expansion, leading to embrittlement and possible running fractures. Capable of releasing several thousand tonnes of high density CO 2, such an event could have catastrophic consequences. This paper demonstrates an experimentally validated, numerical approach to the <b>modelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> scenarios. In addition to the prediction of complex phase behaviour, the approach is capable of quantifying temperatures and pressures for the purpose of fracture propagation modelling. This will further the understanding of hazards associated with CO 2 pipeline failure...|$|E
40|$|A common way to {{formulate}} controlled-release (CR) pharmaceuticals is to coat pellets of active substance with a polymer film, decrease {{the size of}} the pellets and distribute them as multiple-unit dosages in capsules. To increase the understanding of the release mechanism, the pellet shape and surface structure of pellets, before and after release in microtitre plates, have been studied by scanning electron microscope and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry. By performing these studies we associate release profiles during the first few hours to the microscopic structure. Pellets were divided into three classes (spherical pellets, dumbbell shaped pellets and twin-pellets) according to pellet form. Cases of burst release occurred for all three shape classes due to "open-window-defects" at the surface. Areas of thinner polymer film in the neck-region of dumbbell shaped pellets broaden the range of intermediate release rates for this pellet shape. The surface of twin pellets and dumbbell shaped pellets showed more defects, which increases the release rates in comparison to spherical pellets. All pellets with high release rates revealed ruptures in the polymer film, whereas only small cracks could be traced for pellets with slow release rates. The information gained is necessary for the development of future formulations and mathematical <b>modelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> patterns. The pharmaceutical used as model was remoxipride coated with a polymer film of ethyl cellulose and 10 wt. % triethyl citrate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In 2010 {{there were}} 60. 5 million people with {{glaucoma}} worldwide and this number {{is expected to}} increase to 79. 6 million by 2020. In most glaucoma patients medical therapy consists of topical eyedrops. However, administration and compliance are often problematic. Surgical and laser treatment for glaucoma is traumatic for the patients, involving high costs and might require repetition of the procedure. Therefore the aim of the present work was the development of drug-eluting biodegradable implants designed to provide a localized and long-term (6 months to 2 years) sustained release of the drug {{that can be used in}} the treatment of glaucoma. The implant should degrade within the site of implantation, eliminating the need for further surgery. The implant should be introduced in the ophthalmologist o ce, under local anaesthesia, with high implications in patient recovery and costs. By delivering controlled amounts of drug the implant would be pharmacologically e cient and increase patient compliance. Several polymer processing and drug loading techniques were used in order to prepare controlled drug delivery systems (CDDS) for intraocular application. The chosen materials were poly("-caprolactone), PCL, because of its slow degradation, which makes it useful for long term delivery and poly(oxyethylene-b-oxypropyleneb-oxyethylene), Lu, because of its release modulation capacity. Moreover, they are both commercially available, inexpensive and well characterised polymers. Three drugs were incorporated: timolol maleate, acetazolamide and dorzolamide hydrochloride. They are all agents that can decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) in open-angle glaucoma. Two types of devices were prepared: monolithic (sponges, bers, disks) and hybrid (disks), using supercritical solvent impregnation (SSI), electrospinning, melt compression and solvent casting. PCL blends were successfully impregnated with timolol maleate using a SSI technique. SSI e ciency results suggested that the best impregnating conditions were obtained when a cosolvent was used and when speci c drug-polymer interactions occurred as a consequence of di erent chemical structures due to polymer blending. Pressure can be either a favourable factor, when there was enough drug a nity for the polymers, or an unfavourable factor, when weaker bonding was involved. Drug loading, heterogeneous/homogeneous dispersion of drug inside the matrix, hydrophilicity and crystallinity all in uenced the drug release. The in vitro release results suggested that a sustained drug release rate can be obtained by changing the SSI operational conditions and by modulating the composition of blends, as a mean to control crystallinity, hydrophilicity and drug a nity for the polymer matrix. Bicomponent bers of PCL and Lu were obtained by electrospinning. Acetazolamide and timolol maleate were loaded in the bers in di erent concentrations (below and above the drug solubility limit in polymer) in order to determine the e ect of drug solubility in polymer, drug state, drug loading and ber composition on ber morphology, drug distribution and drug release kinetics. High loadings bers (with drug in crystalline form) showed higher burst and faster release than low drug content bers, indicating that the release was more sustained when the drug was encapsulated inside the bers in an amorphous form. Moreover, timolol maleate was released faster than acetazolamide, indicating that drug solubility in polymer in uences the partition of drug between polymer and elution medium, while ber composition also controlled drug release. At low loadings total release was not achieved, suggesting that drug remained trapped in the bers. The <b>modelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> data implied a three stage release mechanism: a dissolution stage, a desorption and subsequent di usion through water lled pores, followed by polymer degradation control. Dorzolamide loaded disks (hybrid device) were prepared by solvent-casting of PCL/Lu and subsequent coating with PCL solution. By blending, crystallinity, water uptake and mass loss were modi ed relative to the pure polymers. Burst was diminished by coating the disks with a PCL shell. All samples presented burst release except PCL-coated samples that showed controlled release during 18 days. For PCL-coated samples, barrier-control of di usion coupled with partition control from the core slowed down the release, while for 50 / 50 Lu/PCL-coated samples, the enhancement in porosity of the core diminished partition-control of drug release. Non-linear regression analysis suggested that a degradation model fully described the release curve considering a triphasic release mechanism: the instantaneous di usion (burst), di usion and polymer degradation stages. MTT test indicated that the materials were not cytotoxic for corneal endothelial cells. A good in vitro{in vivo correlation was obtained, with similar amounts of drug released in vitro and in vivo. The decrease in IOP was similar to that obtained by dorzolamide eyedrop instillation. Implantable monolithic disks for glaucoma treatment were prepared by blending PCL, Lu and dorzolamide. Their in vivo performance was assessed by their capacity to decrease IOP in normotensive and hypertensive eyes. Drug mapping showed that release was complete from blend disks and the low molecular weight (MW) PCL after 1 month in vivo. The high MW PCL showed non-cumulative release rates above the therapeutic level during 3 months in vitro. In vivo, the brous capsule formation around the implant controlled the drug release, working as a barrier membrane. Histologic analysis showed normal foreign body reaction response to the implants. In hypertensive eyes, the most sustained decrease was shown by the high MW PCL. The blending o ers the possibility to manipulate the release rate and the amount of released drug in order to prepare devices tailored to the patients needs. The long term degradation of all the prepared constructs (lms, bers, sponges and disks) was studied. The in uence on degradation rate of several factors (construct type, crystallinity, MW, drug presence, blending) was assessed through water uptake, mass loss, crystallinity and MW evaluation. The degradation rate was higher for blends than for PCL and it was similar between di erent types of blends. The low MW disks had a degradation rate that was lower by one order of magnitude than high MW constructs. Porosity was shown to be a very important factor because at initial stage (or initial porosity), it will enhance water uptake and degradation, while at a later stage (or developed porosity), it will decrease degradation rate because of diminished autocatalytic e ects. High initial porosity produced an acceleration of degradation for sponges, bers and lms when compared to disks, while developed porosity reduced degradation for drug-loaded disks when compared to disks without drug. Modelling of the experimental data suggested that the contribution of surface e ects was as signi cant as autocatalytic e ects in overall bulk degradation. This work has revealed some insights into possible polymer processing and drug loading techniques for the preparation of CDDS for intraocular delivery. It also presented some results regarding the preliminary pre-clinical evaluation of PCL-based implants. In vivo, the drug-eluting implants were able to reduce IOP in an animal model of glaucoma. Nevertheless, another extremely important issue has to be addressed: patient compliance. Patience compliance is of extreme importance especially in the therapy of chronic diseases because patients have to keep up constantly with their pharmacological regimen. The superiority of CDDS relative to conventional therapy has to be proven in long term compliance studies because this is one of the main reasons of developing CDDS therapy in the rst place...|$|E

40|$|Plant reoviruses in {{insect vector}} cells are sequestered in spherical multivesicular compartments. We {{demonstrated}} previously that the plant-infecting reovirus Rice dwarf virus (RDV) exploits multivesicular compartments for the transport and <b>release</b> <b>of</b> viral particles from infected insect vector cells. These multivesicular compartments contain small vesicles and, morphologically, they resemble previously reported endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) exploited by enveloped RNA viruses during budding from the plasma membrane of infected cells. Electron microscopy revealed that, at a late stage of infection, RDV virions are released, together with small vesicles similar to secreted vesicles (exosomes), from infected cells.

40|$|SummaryAuditory afferent fiber {{activity}} {{is driven by}} high-fidelity information transfer from the sensory hair cell. Presynaptic specializations, posited to maintain fidelity, are investigated at synapses with characteristic frequencies of 120 Hz and 320 Hz. Morphological data indicate that high-frequency cells have more synapses and higher vesicle density near dense bodies (DBs). Tracking vesicular release via capacitance changes identified three overlapping kinetic components <b>of</b> <b>release</b> corresponding to morphologically identified vesicle pools. High-frequency cells released faster; however, when normalized to release site number, low-frequency cells released faster, likely due to a greater Ca 2 + load per synapse. The Ca 2 +-dependence <b>of</b> <b>release</b> was nonsaturating and independent of frequency, suggesting that release, not refilling, was rate limiting. A <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> derived from vesicle equilibration between morphologically defined pools reproduced the capacitance data, supporting {{a critical role in}} vesicle trafficking for DBs.

40|$|The neocortex {{receives}} inputs {{from many}} other brain regions, it contains {{many different types}} of neurones in 6 layers and processes large volumes of information. This thesis deals with some of the properties of the local synaptic circuitry of the neocortex. Dual intracellular recordings with biocytin labelling were performed in slices of adult rat neocortex in vitro using conventional sharp micro-electrodes. Responses of postsynaptic cells to trains of presynaptic action potentials were recorded. Histological processing identified the cells recorded and laminar location. The amplitude of each excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), in each sweep was measured. Subsets of measurements for which conditions were deemed to be stable were selected. For recordings that included multiple data subsets whose amplitudes differed primarily because of differences in presynaptic release probability (p), the binomial parameters n (number of synapses), p and q (quantal amplitude) were estimated by fitting relationships between EPSP coefficient of variation, variance or proportion <b>of</b> failures <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and mean amplitude, with equations based on simple binomial models. Striking differences in the binomial parameters estimated for different classes of connections were found. To determine how far the outcomes of this analysis depended on the assumption of a simple binomial model in which p and q are identical at all synapses, Monte-Carlo simulations of simple and more complex binomial <b>models</b> <b>of</b> synaptic <b>release</b> were generated. These models demonstrated the wide range of conditions under which analysis based on simple binomial models can provide reliable estimates of n, p and q.
