50|$|Several {{strategies}} for resolving geographic boundary problems in measurement and analysis {{have been proposed}} (Martin 1987; Wong and Fotheringham 1990). To identify {{the effectiveness of the}} strategies, Griffith (1983) reviewed traditional techniques that were developed to mitigate the edge effects: ignoring the effects, undertaking a torus mapping, construction of an empirical butter zone, construction of an artificial butter zone, extrapolation into a buffer zone, utilizing a correction factor, etc. The first method (i.e., the ignorance of the edge effects), assumes and infinite surface in which the edge effects do not occur. In fact, this approach has been used by traditional geographical theories (e.g., central place theory). Its main shortcoming is that empirical phenomena occur within a finite area, so an infinite and homogeneous surface is unrealistic (Griffith and Amrhein 1983). The remaining five approaches are similar in that they attempted to produce unbiased parameter estimation, that is, to provide a medium by which the edge effects are removed (Griffith 1983). (He called these operational solutions as opposed to statistical solutions to be discussed below.) Specifically, the techniques aim at a collection of data beyond the boundary of the study area and fit a larger model, that is, mapping over the area or over-bounding the study area (Ripley 1979; Wong and Fotheringham 1990). Through simulation analysis, however, Griffith and Amrhein (1983) identified the inadequacy of such an overbounding technique. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>this</b> <b>technique</b> can bring about issues related to large-area statistics, that is, ecological fallacy.
