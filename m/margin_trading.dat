25|$|Despite slowing of the economy, as of June 2015 the Chinese stock index, the CSI 300 Index, {{which is}} based on 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, had risen nearly 150% over the past 12 months. In an effort to {{forestall}} damage from collapse of a possible economic bubble fueled by <b>margin</b> <b>trading</b> the central government raised requirements for margin lending. Economic damage from a crash in 2007-2008 was limited due to margin lending being highly restricted. In early July, after a fall in the markets of nearly 30% from their 12 June highs, there were efforts by blue-chip, often state-owned, firms, the Chinese securities industry, and the central government to stabilize the market by buying back stock and increasing purchases of the stock of established firms; however, much of the volatility has been in smaller, less-established firms that had been heavily invested in by unsophisticated, often working class, investors who had purchased stock based solely on its rapid increase in valuation. 80% of Chinese stocks are owned by individual investors, many novices. As of 10 July 2015 efforts by the China Securities Finance Corporation, CFS, a firm created by China's commodities and stock exchanges to finance trades, had apparently stabilized the market. Major Chinese securities firms were required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to buy, and hold, a substantial amount of securities affected by the downturn. Using funds supplied by the central bank and commercial banks the China Securities Finance Corporation purchased enough stocks to halt the slide acquiring as much as 5% of the stock in some firms. Lines of credit were extended by CFS to 21 securities firms, some of which also purchased up to 5% of some companies stocks. Some of the small cap stocks acquired may be overvalued.|$|E

Consistent with previous findings based on the US and Australian stock markets, our results show that heavily shorted stocks generate significant and negative risk-adjusted abnormal returns. Moreover, the negative abnormal returns decrease in magnitude and also become statistically insignificant as the holding period extends from 1 month to 1 year. In addition, we test the effect on stock price overvaluation of the interaction of a short sale constraint and a dispersion of opinion. When using turnover ratio {{as a proxy for}} a dispersion of opinion, we find that even when the holding period is 6 months, the overvaluation is still significant. Moreover, when a high degree of a dispersion of opinion is captured by a high relative short interest and a high relative <b>margin</b> <b>trade</b> level, the overvaluation remains statistically significant even for a 1 -year holding period.
