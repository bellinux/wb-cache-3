5000|$|... 2005 - <b>Cable</b> <b>ducts</b> {{installed}} {{alongside the}} route of the Northern Motorway, during the construction of the Northern Busway, between the Auckland Harbour Bridge and Constellation Drive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>ducting</b> is {{not needed}} in smaller power {{facilities}} where copper cables are less than 25mm2. Without duct work, installation costs are lower with copper than with aluminum.|$|R
5000|$|Much smaller cable size—important where pathway is limited, such as {{networking}} {{an existing}} building, where smaller channels can be drilled and space {{can be saved}} in existing <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> and trays.|$|R
30|$|A {{characteristic}} {{of all the}} buildings are the loose, broken or open exterior ceiling boards and <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts</b> which provide additional roosting and breeding space for the pigeon population index on campus.|$|R
30|$|Adjacent to the OR Tambo {{building}} is the Cas van Vuuren building with seven levels and no exterior <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts</b> positioned above its balconies. Natural areas {{extend to the}} southern and south-western boundaries.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} side walkway had to {{be renewed}} over a length of 750 feet (230 m), and the <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> cast into the walkway and walls were replaced over 300 feet (90 m).|$|R
30|$|The AJH van der Walt {{building}} is positioned {{on the northern}} side of the campus facing an undeveloped vegetated mound which meets the campus’ northern boundary. All seven levels are continuous in balcony and <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts</b> design.|$|R
50|$|Two rocket-firing stands {{themselves}} {{stood at}} Greymare Hills and were {{large enough to}} accommodate a full Blue Streak missile. All firings were controlled from command centre bunkers connected to the stands by tunnels or surface <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts.</b>|$|R
30|$|OR Tambo, the {{administrative}} building, is positioned to the south. It is the tallest building on campus with 14 levels. Balconies and <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts</b> provide uniform exterior structural design, {{with the exception}} of the Good Hope cafeteria and balcony positioned on level four.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Danish Telephone plugs, {{from left}} to right: Shallow wall socket with modern thin plug, shallow wall socket with earlier 18mm plug, shallow wall socket with RJ11 Telephone adapter (doesn't fit due to <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> below), normal size RJ11 wall socket with plug.|$|R
40|$|The {{infrastructure}} for the electronics, such as cabling, mains power distribution, {{low and high}} voltage power supplies, detector safety system, grounding and its installation in the LHCb experimental cavern is presented. In addition, racks, <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> installation and optical fiber link tests are described...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>ducts</b> {{were placed}} beneath the busway during the {{construction}} in 2005, {{to provide for}} the future installation of electricity transmission cables. The cables installed in these ducts during 2012 and 2013 form part of a major upgrade to the security of supply to North Auckland and Northland.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the photon dose within access ways (with a maximum of three sections) and in <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> was investigated at various electron accelerators. The dose from a $^{ 137 }$Cs source within specially constructed labyrinths and ducts was also measured. The results are presented in simple formulae...|$|R
50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> brought more reliable service to customers. They converged at approximately twenty wire centers, which were connected by larger trunk <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> running along the East and West Sides of Manhattan. The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each wire center a new central office arose to house telephone switchboards, panel switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|R
30|$|Penetrations in {{building}} elements are generally provided for mechanical, plumbing, air-conditioning and electrical services throughout a structure. Openings in elements are typically provided for pipes, <b>cables,</b> <b>ducts</b> {{and other services}} for business operations and building occupants. These penetrations require fire stopping where these services pass through a fire rated assembly.|$|R
50|$|Steel wire {{armoured}} cable, commonly abbreviated as SWA, is a hard-wearing {{power cable}} {{designed for the}} supply of mains electricity. It {{is one of a}} number of armoured electrical cables - which include 11 kV Cable and 33 kV Cable - and is found in underground systems, power networks and <b>cable</b> <b>ducting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of utility tunnels are {{the reduction of}} maintenance manholes, one-time relocation, and less excavation and repair, compared to separate <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> for each service. When they are well mapped, they also allow rapid access to all utilities without having to dig access trenches or resort to confused and often inaccurate utility maps.|$|R
50|$|A FMS (Fiber Management System) {{manages the}} fiber {{connections}} {{from outside of}} fiber rack to the fiber routers. Fiber <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> containing many fibers come from far end sites and terminate on FMS using splicing technology. FMS has fiber in and fiber out ports. From fiber out port the fiber patch will go to fiber optics based router.|$|R
30|$|Theo van Wijk, {{the largest}} {{building}} positioned {{on the far}} {{western side of the}} campus, has 11 levels uniform in design with balconies and exterior <b>cabling</b> <b>ducts</b> running the length of the building. Due to its y-shape, the building offers two north facing and two south facing aspects. The Philadelphia cafeteria is positioned on the third floor, which includes an extensive catering balcony.|$|R
50|$|Heat {{stabilizers}} {{are mainly}} used for construction products made of polyvinyl chloride, for instance window profiles, pipes and <b>cable</b> <b>ducts.</b> Light stabilizers, for instance HALS, are especially needed for polypropylene and polyethylene. The {{environmental impact of}} stabilizers for polymers can be problematic because of heavy metal content. In Europe lead stabilizers are increasingly replaced by other types, for example calcium-zinc stabilizers.|$|R
5000|$|Platforms 2 and 3 on the [...] "fast" [...] lines - {{although}} still by definition in use - have been mothballed, and their gravelly surface together with protruding <b>cable</b> <b>ducting</b> poses a trip hazard and renders them {{unlikely to be}} used by passengers even should a disruption prevent use of the [...] "slow" [...] lines at platforms 1 and 4.|$|R
50|$|Switches are {{available}} in many form factors, including: desktop units not mounted in an enclosure which are typically intended {{to be used in}} a home or office environment outside a wiring closet; rack-mounted switches for use in an equipment rack; large chassis units with swappable module cards; DIN rail mounted for use in industrial environments; and small installation switches, mounted into a <b>cable</b> <b>duct,</b> floor box or communications tower, as found, for example, in FTTO Infrastructures.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, BT are {{re-using}} the <b>cable</b> TV <b>ducting</b> to run {{fibre optic}} broadband cabling {{as part of}} the FTTP trial in the town.|$|R
30|$|The Cas van Vuuren {{building}} was identified {{for use of}} bird spikes as the building {{does not have the}} exterior electrical and air conditioning <b>ducts</b> (<b>cabling</b> <b>ducts)</b> which are positioned just below the balcony ceilings above the office windows of other buildings on campus. These ducts provide ideal sites for pigeons to roost and nest on. A single continuous strand of bird spikes (1720  m) was positioned {{along the length of the}} balcony ledge on all seven levels (north and south facing).|$|R
50|$|A utility tunnel, utility corridor, or utilidor is {{a passage}} built {{underground}} or above ground to carry utility lines such as electricity, steam, water supply pipes, and sewer pipes. Communications utilities like fiber optics, cable television, and telephone cables are also sometimes carried. One {{may also be}} referred to as a services tunnel, services trench, services vault, or cable vault. Smaller cable containment {{is often referred to as}} a <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> or underground conduit. Direct-buried cable is a major alternative to ducts or tunnels.|$|R
40|$|Radiation fields {{behind the}} main {{shielding}} wall separating the LHCb detector from its counting rooms have been calculated for different conceptual designs using the Monte Carlo code FLUKA. Implication of different wall thicknesses {{as well as}} of appropriately shielded access openings and <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> on the radiation level behind the shielding wall are examined. It is shown that leakage of stray radiation through the vertical shafts {{to the surface of the}} earth gives rise to doses that are less than dose equivalent limit for Supervised Radiation Area. ...|$|R
40|$|End flanges of {{flexible}} coupling system restrained against excessive rotation or axial separation by inexpensive, lightweight mechanism based on cables and pulleys. Restraining mechanism adapted to <b>cable,</b> <b>duct,</b> hose, or passageway couplings between vehicles, or to other applications in which angular and positional misalignments must {{be restricted to}} moderate specified values. Total misalignment of two end flanges limited to amount of slack available in cable-and-pulley mechanism. When cable taut, further axial separation of flange centers restrained, but small tilts accommodated by running of cable through pulleys...|$|R
50|$|In 1979, the UFO sceptic Steuart Campbell {{visited the}} scene of the {{incident}} with the police. Campbell was convinced that a simple explanation would be found. On his second visit to the site, he stated that he had observed some PVC pipes in an adjoining field. He discovered that the local water authority had laid a <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> within 100m of the clearing. He {{came to the conclusion that}} stacks of pipes may have been stored in the clearing and were responsible for the ground markings.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of tools and {{replacement}} parts may {{be included in a}} repair kit. Some common examples include screwdriver, spare tire, jumper <b>cable,</b> and <b>duct</b> tape.|$|R
25|$|Ventilation ducts {{ran through}} the gaps {{in the body and}} through the <b>cable</b> <b>duct</b> under the floor. They had {{openings}} in the floor and under the windows. The ventilation system doubled as cooling for the braking resistances. During cold weather the carriage air could be routed via the resistance to heat it, and warm and cold air could be mixed at various levels. As there was no resistance in the trailers, these were equipped with electric heaters. The trams had a 24-volt lighting system with cabin lighting from fluorescent lamps.|$|R
50|$|During 2012 Network Rail {{commenced}} resignalling {{the line}} between Armley Junction and Harrogate {{leading up to the}} signalling being commissioned and all coming {{under the control of the}} Harrogate signalbox during the period of 27-29 October 2012. A trench was dug along the Up platform for a <b>cabling</b> <b>duct</b> and access manholes to be installed to carry the signalling cables. Shorter block sections to allow for greater line capacity were installed and, for the first time since the rationalisation of 1969 ironically with longer block sections, signals can once again be seen from the station.|$|R

5000|$|ELECTRICAL DESIGN : MPDS4 ELECTRICAL DESIGN is {{a design}} module for routing or {{connecting}} electrical systems with components throughout a plant, ship or factory. The user extensible and customisable catalogs contain {{many different types}} of electrical and control systems, as well as <b>cable</b> trays, <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> and links, and other supporting components. Auto routing functionality finds the shortest cable route between two designated points. By adding a KVA (kilo volt-ampere) rating to selected components, users can analyse the required power rating of an entire network of connected instances and cables.|$|R
5000|$|Cable jetting is a {{technique}} to install <b>cables</b> in <b>ducts.</b> It is commonly used to install cables with optical fibers in underground polyethylene ducts and is an alternative to pulling.|$|R
50|$|The {{civil war}} {{resulted}} in the complete destruction of Liberia's landline infrastructure. As a result, Libtelco has focused on expanding telephone, Internet and fax services through fixed wireless systems. Beginning in 2009, the company began offering services through a new CDMA-2000 1x-EvDO network. Libtelco owns a 20% interest in the Cable Consortium of Liberia, which owns and operates the cable landing point of the ACE cable system in Monrovia, due {{to be completed in}} 2012. The company is currently using its existing ownership over <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> in the Monrovia area to construct a fiber-optic communications network that will connect to the cable system.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally {{fibre optic}} cables were pulled through <b>cable</b> <b>ducts</b> {{in the same way}} as other cables, via a winch line. Every time a bend or {{undulation}} in the duct is passed the pulling force is multiplied by a friction dependent factor (which can be reduced by using lubricant). This means that the higher the local pulling force is, the higher the friction will be which the cable is experiencing while being pulled against the internal duct wall. This [...] "capstan effect" [...] leads to an exponential force build-up with pull distance, producing generally high pulling forces.|$|R
