5|$|The WHO/EURO <b>Multicentre</b> Study of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded {{that of the}} males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, <b>multicentre</b> trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a <b>multicentre,</b> randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E

The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered {{a reference to the}} ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to John Freeman at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Frozen {{shoulder}} is {{a common}} problem in general practice, but its treatment is difficult since none of the currently used therapies are proven to be effective. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of suprascapular nerve block to relieve pain and improve range of movement, and its suitability for use in primary care. This small study by a single practitioner aims to justify a larger <b>multicentred</b> trial. METHOD: A randomized trial of 30 patients to compare a single suprascapular nerve block with a course of intra-articular injections. Patients' pain levels and ranges of movement were assessed over a 12 -week period. RESULTS: Suprascapular nerve block produced a faster and more complete resolution of pain and restoration of range of movement than a series of intra-articular injections. These differences were confirmed by statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test (P < 0. 01 for pain levels and P < 0. 05 for range of abduction and external rotation.) CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that suprascapular nerve block is a safe and effective treatment for frozen shoulder in primary care, and justifies a larger <b>multicentred</b> trial using independent blinded assessment. Such a study should include a third group treated by suprascapular nerve block without steroid; a more comprehensive assessment of patient debility...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{discuss the}} reasons why 250 ml 7. 5 % {{hypertonic}} saline was chosen as a pre-hospital resuscitation fluid for head injured patients in a <b>multicentred,</b> prospective, randomised controlled trial investigating its long term effects on central nervous system outcome. Data sources: Recent published peer-review articles on the incidence and mechanisms of traumatic head injury and clinical use of hypertonic saline in pre-hospital resuscitation of trauma. Summary of review: Head injury is commonly associated with major trauma and if hypotension also exists the morbidity and mortality due to cerebral injury are high. Hypertonic saline {{has been used in}} clinical practice to treat cerebral oedema and resuscitate burns patients following experimental evidence that it reduces tissue oedema, improves blood flow to damaged organs and may reduce the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction, when compared with resuscitation using isotonic solutions. In pre-hospital trauma patients, initial resuscitation using hypertonic saline rather than conventional isotonic solutions has the potential advantage of requiring a small volume of fluid that is easily stored and administered, and may improve cerebral circulation and reduce the long term neurological effects that are determined by pre-hospital hypovolaemia and hypotension. To answer the question whether hypertonic saline will improve the outcome in trauma patients with hypotension and head injury, a <b>multicentred,</b> randomised controlled trial comparing 250 ml of 7. 5 % hypertonic saline (320 mmol) with 250 ml of Hartmann’s solution (32 mmol) in pre-hospital resuscitation of trauma patients with a Glasgow coma score < 9 and systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, began in 1998 and is anticipated to be completed by 2001. Conclusions: Pre-hospital resuscitation of head injured and hypotensive trauma patients using hypertonic saline, has the potential to reduce long term cerebral injury and reduce social and financial costs to the community.

Enteric neurons exposed to α-syn can also lead to impaired mitochondrial complex I activity, reduced mitochondrial function, and NAD⁺ depletion culminating in cell death via energy restriction.
