6000|$|Becky laughed; she {{was almost}} always good-humoured. [...] "That was when I was on <b>my</b> <b>promotion,</b> Goosey," [...] she said. [...] "Take Rawdon outside with you {{and give him a}} cigar too if you like." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{too late}} now," [...] said Edmund, [...] "and {{there are many reasons}} which {{convince}} me that I ought not to exchange. In a year or two, when I have <b>my</b> <b>promotion,</b> I hope to return, and then, Marian, I shall find you a finished young lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has only}} cost about twenty pounds, and I value my freedom {{at a very}} much higher price than that, Dick. If I had not escaped, I {{should not have been}} in that affair with Moras that got me <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> and, at the present time, should be in some prison in France." ...|$|R
40|$|Acknowledgement. I wish {{to express}} my {{gratitude}} to my friends and collegues, my family and <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> committee for supporting me in this work.

5000|$|Of my eldest brother {{what shall}} I say? Notwithstanding his spiritual and worldly perfections, he took no step without my concurrence, indiscreet as I am, and devoting himself to my interests, {{advanced}} <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> {{and was an}} aid to good intentions. In his poems he speaks of me in a manner which I cannot sufficiently acknowledge, as {{he says in his}} eulogium: ...|$|R

[...] "That's {{the only thing that}} mars my {{happiness}} over <b>my</b> <b>promotion.</b> After the taking of Malolos, Jack Crunger disappeared utterly, and we haven't been able to find hide nor hair of him, although half a dozen scouting parties have been sent out and the stream has been dragged in several places." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father {{shook his}} head. 'I shall very {{probably}} {{have to go back}} to India,' he said. 'My furlough is expired. I am now taking my extra leave. If I can get <b>my</b> <b>promotion,</b> I need not return. Without that I cannot afford to live in Europe. But my absence in all probability will be but very short,' he said. 'And Clive is old enough now to go on without me.' ...|$|R

Systematic {{operations}} were planned against this blot on the honour and prosperity of our hardly-won independence. General Robles commanded, with his well-known ruthless severity. Savage reprisals were exercised on both sides, and no quarter was given in the field. Having won <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> in the Peru campaign, I was a captain on the staff.|$|R
60|$|We are now {{breaking}} up camp here gradually. In {{a few days}} the last {{of us will be}} on our way for the Missouri River, at what point cannot be definitely determined, wood and water being a consideration, as well as a healthy, fine site for a large encampment. A letter addressed to me at Galena will probably find me there. If I get <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> I shall expect to go there for a few days.|$|R

No {{one will ever}} know the cause of Germany's {{suddenly}} belligerent attitude, and her equally speedy climb-down! There are many pages of diplomatic history which the world will never read, {{and this is one}} of them. Come and lunch with me, Lord Wolfenden. My vow is paid and without bloodshed. I am a free man, and <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> is assured. To-day is the happiest of my life!" ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{negative}} effects of the highly competitive academic environment. We summarized the literature on what consequences an over-competitive system has on the people involved and on the productivity of the system as a whole. We conclude that negative effects outweigh the potential gains which competitive sys-tems bring about. The literature suggests that not only do constant rejections demotivate the majority of academ-ics, but also the funding allocation process in itself seems inefficient. The pressure on academics is so high that we tend to systematically over-estimate our success chances of our funding proposals, manuscripts and <b>promotion</b> <b>requests.</b> Key words: academia; competition; negative effect; rejectio...|$|R

Besides, there was little use in going home till I had <b>my</b> <b>promotion,</b> and could offer her a home; and I had no notion how utter the ruin was, or that she had lost so much. So little did I imagine their straits that, but for Alison's look, I should hardly have inquired even on hearing her name." ...|$|R

In those days we had our own {{recording}} studio, right down the hall from the main offices. Now the record was pressed and ready to go, but what I did was, I made up about 30 tape copies, just put the song on a tape on a regular plastic reel, and I called up a bunch of <b>my</b> <b>promotions</b> department friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never do that," [...] {{said the}} captain, turning to him, {{as he leaned}} {{his elbows on the}} table. [...] "It only makes both parties ridiculous. But I'll tell you what you may do. There's a Lord Chatterton who takes the matter up with warmth. If I were not afraid of his {{interests}} hurting <b>my</b> <b>promotion,</b> I should have resented something that fell from him myself. He will fight, I dare say, and I'll just return and require an explanation of his words on your behalf." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Entirely {{owing to}} you, Mrs. Archer, as I told {{you in the}} first letter I wrote to you after I got <b>my</b> <b>promotion.</b> You taught me to like study, and were always ready to help me on with my work, and it was entirely owing to my having learned so much, {{especially}} mathematics, that I was able {{to attract the attention}} of the officers and to get put on the quarter-deck. I have, I am happy to say, done very well, and I am sure of my step as soon as I have passed.|$|R

Harrison said the BBC {{offered him a}} new contract with which he would be financially [...] "made for life" [...] but {{he would no longer}} be a promoter.

60|$|In early boyhood I {{tired of}} the teeming cities and overcrowded rural districts of Arizona. Every {{generation}} of Turcks for over two centuries has been represented in the navy. The navy called to me, as did the free, wide, unpeopled spaces of the mighty oceans. And so I joined the navy, {{coming up from the}} ranks, as we all must, learning our craft as we advance. <b>My</b> <b>promotion</b> was rapid, for my family seems to inherit naval lore. We are born officers, and I reserve to myself no special credit for an early advancement in the service.|$|R
40|$|Librarians have {{a unique}} {{perspective}} on the scholarly ecosystem as authors, consumers, and stewards. This perspective, combined with our roles in collecting and curating information, enables librarians to identify changes in policy, practice, and technology that can improve the openness, transparency, and sustainability of the scholarly ecosystem. It also reveals opportunities for aligning institutional and professional incentives with these changes. I will share examples of evidence used in <b>my</b> <b>promotion</b> and tenure dossier to demonstrate how librarian practitioner-scholars can be both advocates and exemplars for the changes {{we want to see}} in open access, data, and educational resources...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the contrastive analysis of authentic persuasive business correspondence written in English by Thai speakers and native English speakers in the Thai business context. Three types of persuasive correspondence - sales <b>promotion,</b> <b>request,</b> and invitation - were analysed from contrastive text linguistic and pragmatic perspectives. The purpose was to examine, compare and contrast their rhetorical structures, functions and linguistic realisations as well as persuasive and politeness strategies, and to compare these features {{to those found in}} textbook samples of persuasive letters in order to investigate the extent to which those samples represent the authentic, real-life correspondence. The findings report on cross-cultural variations which differentiate the persuasive writing patterns and strategies of Thais and native English speakers. Despite some shared writing conventions, the findings reveal diversity in some rhetorical moves, linguistic realisations, rhetorical appeals and politeness strategies. The diversity includes some cultural-bound discourse patterns and cultural-specific textual features, many of which can be traced to interference from the Thai language and culture. An exploration of the nature of sales <b>promotion,</b> <b>request,</b> and invitation letters presented in one American and two Thai textbooks on Business English writing reveals that their letter samples reflect the characteristics of the authentic corpus in the business contexts to which they belong. The implications of this research are twofold. First, it has implications for the teaching of English business letter writing especially in the Thai context and the innovation of more advanced materials and methods for this pedagogical purpose. Second, it raises an awareness of differences in persuasive writing across languages and cultures, worth noting for developing cross-cultural understanding and communication strategies for effective intercultural business interactions in the dynamic business environment of the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|As an apparel design student, I have {{witnessed}} the reaction of many people to my major. It is usually surprise, mixed {{with a sort of}} sarcasm. It is not a major that is generally taken very seriously, especially amongst well-read, learned members of places such as the Honors College. My classes are just as difficult as those for any other major, and are actually very related to classes taken in fields such as architecture and computer sciences. Yet, to some people, it seems like a laughable career choice. In <b>my</b> <b>Promotions</b> class (FCSMR 481), I learned just how difficult and stressful one of the most utilized choices for events in the apparel design field can be: putting on a professional fashion show. I wanted to take my experiences from this class and show those outside my own field what goes on behind the scenes. I wanted to take the glamour out of fashion for a bit, and show the real work that goes into putting on such an event. In order to do this, I have included an artist's statement which outlines week-by-week the goings-on in <b>my</b> <b>Promotions</b> class, as well a Power Point presentation showing visuals from before and during the fashion show. I plan to also turn in a DVD copy of the fashion show as soon as it is distributed (the expected day is Friday, May 2 nd). Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
25|$|Colonel Ambrosio José Gonzales (1818–1893) - Gonzales, {{a native}} Cuban, settled in South Carolina. He was {{volunteering}} during the bombardment of Fort Sumter {{and became an}} inspector of coastal defences. In 1862 he was assigned as Chief of Artillery to the Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. In 1864 he served as artillery commander at the Battle of Honey Hill during Sherman's March to the Sea. President Jefferson Davis declined <b>promotion</b> <b>requests</b> for the rank of Brigadier General six times. It is believed that neither Gonzales's early experience with Cuban filibusters, without success, nor his contentious relationships with Confederate officers in Richmond were aiding him; but most likely Davis' dislike for P. G. T. Beauregard, who was a schoolmate of Gonzalez and the proponent {{of several of the}} requests, didn´t help either.|$|R
