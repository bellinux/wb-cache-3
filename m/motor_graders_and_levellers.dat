The Trans-Canada was officially opened in 1962 along the southern route.|$|R
40|$|Heavy-duty diesel {{maintenance}} equipment consumes {{significant amounts}} of fuel and consequently emits substantial quantities of pollutants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify which engine activity variables had the greatest impact on fuel use and emissions rates. A real-world data set was used for a case study fleet containing backhoes, <b>motor</b> <b>graders,</b> <b>and</b> wheel loaders. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between engine activity variables and fuel use and emissions rates. The engine activity variables of engine speed, manifold absolute pressure, and intake air temperature were used to predict mass per time fuel use and emissions rates of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter. The results indicated that manifold absolute pressure had the greatest impact on fuel use and emissions rate predictions. Based on this finding, fuel use and emissions estimating models based on manifold absolute pressure were developed as a practical estimating tool for practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Many public {{agencies}} rely on heavy duty diesel equipment to perform highway maintenance activities. This equipment consumes {{large quantities of}} diesel fuel and consequently emits substantial amounts of air pollution, thus posing a significant energy and environmental impact for the nation. In hopes of minimizing these impacts, some public fleet owners have turned to biodiesel {{as an alternative to}} traditional diesel fuel to reduce petroleum consumption as well as air pollutant emissions. The primary goal {{of this paper is to}} present real world HDD equipment fuel use rates and emission rates of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. These fuel use and emissions rates were based on second-by-second data collected by a portable emissions measurement system from five backhoes, six <b>motor</b> <b>graders,</b> <b>and</b> four wheel loaders as they performed real world activities. The primary output of this paper is a dataset of real world fuel use and emissions rates that are categorized by pollutant type, equipment type, EPA Engine Tier standards, and fuel type (including conventional petroleum diesel and B 20 biodiesel). The intended purpose of this dataset is for public fleet owners to use it as a benchmark for comparison to their own equipment fuel use and emissions performance in order to make informed decisions regarding the energy and environmental impacts of their fleets...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{technologies}} on both on-road and off-road applications offer {{potential in}} reducing both GHG emissions and criteria emissions by using sophisticated vehicle designs with multiple power sources. Environmental regulations today {{are starting to}} shift from criteria emissions to include GHG emissions. However, criteria emissions are still significant contributors to local air pollution in many populous areas throughout the United States. Many different designs for hybrid applications have emerged within the last decade, but reliable studies on their performance, efficiency, and emissions are limited for on-road vehicles and non-existent for off-road hybrid equipment. Unexpectedly, some on-road hybrid vehicles studies have shown a considerable increase in criteria emissions while achieving the desired fuel economy benefits. The research presented in this dissertation evaluates the criteria and GHG emissions benefits of hybrid technologies in off-road bulldozers and excavators. Measurements of power duty cycle and emissions hybrid within this dissertation greatly improve {{our understanding of the}} emission inventories of off-road engines, and also offer a new approach on evaluating real world benefits of hybrid off-road engines. Additionally, this dissertation investigates the latest portable emissions measurement equipment (PEMS) technologies which are critical for determining in-use emissions. Finally, in-use emissions rates from a variety of conventional off-road equipment are evaluated for off-road equipment such as backhoe loaders, dozers, excavators, <b>motor</b> <b>graders,</b> wheel tractor-scrapers, <b>and</b> wheel loaders...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} fuel {{consumption}} of a <b>motor</b> <b>grader,</b> {{a method for}} shifting the power curve of the grader engine is proposed. The working principle, calculation method, and design procedure of the novel method are depicted. Considering the nonlinear and time-varying uncertainty of the load of a <b>motor</b> <b>grader,</b> the fuzzy adaptive control is provided to shift the power curve. The shifting action is decided by the gears and the corresponding engine speed together with the displacements of both the hydraulic pump and motor. As a result, the power line adapts to the frequent changes in different external loads. A prototype <b>motor</b> <b>grader</b> is developed to test the above-mentioned energy conservation method in different working conditions. The {{results show that the}} fuel consumption of the prototype motor is reduced by 23 %– 34 % and the skip ratio is decreased by 10 % compared with the traditional grader with only one power curve.

40|$|A velocidade de concepÃÃo e de execuÃÃo das infraestruturas tem aumentado devido Ã utilizaÃÃo de softwares e equipamentos eficientes, o que tem exigido um melhor desempenho de cada etapa. No entanto, apesar dos custos envolvidos com equipamentos serem os itens de maior peso na construÃÃo rodoviÃria, poucos sÃo os sistemas existentes de apoio Ã decisÃo para a seleÃÃo das frotas. Propostas de seleÃÃo de frotas tÃm sido elaboradas por pesquisadores no Brasil e no mundo, porÃm a maioria consideram apenas caminhÃes e escavadeiras/carregadeiras ou scrapers. Este trabalho tem como objetivo desenvolver um sistema de apoio Ã decisÃo na seleÃÃo de motoniveladoras para a execuÃÃo de obras de terraplenagem e de pavimentaÃÃo, denominado SADPATROL. Inicialmente, foi feita uma anÃlise da evoluÃÃo tecnolÃgica do equipamento motoniveladora visando verificar a influÃncia destas melhorias sobre o aumento da produtividade. Foram analisadas as equaÃÃes existentes na {{literatura}} para o cÃlculo de produtividade e apÃs verificada a representatividade da equaÃÃo utilizada no paÃs esta foi escolhida para compor o SADPATROL, com as devidas alteraÃÃes em suas variÃveis. AtravÃs da anÃlise de cada variÃvel da equaÃÃo foi possÃvel identificar o quanto as mesmas influenciavam no resultado da produÃÃo desta forma, foram implementadas melhorias, como a inserÃÃo de valores padrÃes para as variÃveis do sistema, permitindo a obtenÃÃo de resultados mais precisos, caso o usuÃrio nÃo possua dados medidos em campo. O SADPATROL possui cadastrado em seu banco de dados 46 tipos de motoniveladoras, dos mais variados modelos e tamanhos, de 12 fabricantes distintos. Ã possibilitado ao usuÃrio calcular a frota com equipamentos prÃprios e verificar se esta atende ao prazo da obra. Caso o prazo nÃo seja atendido pela frota prÃpria ou o usuÃrio nÃo possua equipamentos, o sistema executa as informaÃÃes da obra para todos os equipamentos do banco de dados e fornece a soluÃÃo com as 46 opÃÃes organizadas em frotas, em ordem crescente de quantidade de equipamento. Ã possibilitado ainda selecionar os equipamentos nos quais se possui informaÃÃo de custo horÃrio, para assim obter a frota de menor custo. Toda a multiplicidade de informaÃÃes necessÃrias Ã seleÃÃo de motoniveladoras, e suas inter-relaÃÃes e dependÃncias, foram organizadas de forma sistÃmica no software SADPATROL, diminuindo assim o empirismo e a dependÃncia da experiÃncia humana na seleÃÃo de frotas. A presente pesquisa pode ainda contribuir para auxiliar a elaboraÃÃo de normas tÃcnicas e para a disseminaÃÃo do conhecimento sobre o referido equipamento. The {{demands on}} speed {{and efficiency of}} infrastructure design and construction has increased due {{to the use of}} software and more productive equipment, which has required better performance of equipment planners at each step. However, even considering that the costs associated with equipment are one of the items with the greatest weight in road construction, there are few computerized systems for fleet selection decision support. Fleet selection systems have been developed by researchers in Brazil and worldwide, but most of them consider only trucks and excavators/loaders or scrapers. This research aims at developing a decision support system for the selection of <b>motor</b> <b>graders</b> for construction activities involving earthmoving and paving works named SADPATROL. Initially, an analysis of the <b>motor</b> <b>grader</b> technological evolution was performed in order to evaluate the influence of the improvements on productivity gains. The equations presented in the literature were studied for productivity calculation and, after verifying the suitability of the equation, the equation was incorporated in the SADPATROL system with the necessary changes in its variables. Through the analysis of the variables in the equation, it was possible to identify how they influenced the productivity. Through this analysis, improvements were implemented. These improvements consisted of the inclusion of standard values for the system variables, allowing the achievement of more accurate results if the user has no data for productivity measured in the field. The SADPATROL system has 46 types of <b>motor</b> <b>graders</b> included in its database, from many different models and sizes and from 12 different manufacturers. The user is able to plan the fleet with its own equipment and verify if it satisfies the construction project deadline. If the deadline cannot be satisfied using the available fleet or the user has no equipment, the system performs the construction planning using all database equipment and provides the optimal solution with 46 options organized into fleets in increasing order according to the amount of equipment needed. It is also possible for the user to select the equipment using time cost information and, thus, achieve the lowest cost fleet. The significant amount of information necessary for <b>motor</b> <b>graders</b> selection <b>and</b> its inter-relationships and dependencies were organized in a systematic way in the SADPATROL system, reducing, the empiricism and the dependence on human expertise in selecting fleets. This research may also help in assisting in the development of technical standards and expanding the dissemination of knowledge about such equipment...|$|R
