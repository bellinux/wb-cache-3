Her melodious voice with powerful lyrics gave us songs that have remained popular even today." [...] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said [...] "She was an artist of extraordinary talent and abilities, and the songs she has left behind in her long career, which she started with AIR in 1937, will continue to enthral music lovers." [...] Her daughter Usha Ratra said [...] "She kept herself away from glamour of the industry despite being one of the top singers of her era as she did not like limelight.

But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. <b>Mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she never had seen such a happy childâ€”that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E

60|$|<b>To</b> <b>say</b> {{this would}} be right in both cases,--there must always be one to command.

60|$|I {{may have}} my faults, but {{procrastination}} {{in the presence}} of rats is not one of them. I didn't hesitate for a second. Here was my chance.

My <b>mother</b> always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that ninety-nine {{times out of}} a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddled with was worse than the first. But I guess it's my duty. I was Margaret's friend, {{and it is my}} duty to protect her child any way I can.

6000|$|We {{went down}} to the country that night, just as the man had told the {{policeman}} we would. I was all worked up, for I had heard so much about the country from Fred that I had always wanted to go there. Fred <b>used</b> <b>to</b> go off on a motor-bicycle sometimes to spend the night with his father in Kent, and once he brought back a squirrel with him, which I thought was for me to eat, but mother said no. 'The first thing a dog has <b>to</b> learn,' <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> often <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'is that the whole world wasn't created for him to eat.' ...|$|R
60|$|My poor, dear <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{she liked}} to see me eat, and {{it has always been}} a {{pleasant}} reflection to me since that I must have given her much gratification in that direction. A growing, healthy lad, taking plenty of exercise and careful to restrain himself from indulging in too much study, can generally satisfy the most exacting expectations as regards his feeding powers.|$|E
60|$|When {{she reached}} the house, she gave another proof of her identity. My father had often hinted that she seldom {{conducted}} herself like any ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked in at that identical window, pressing {{the end of her}} nose against the glass to that extent, that my poor dear <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it became perfectly flat and white in a moment.|$|E
6000|$|My <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to me: [...] "Never {{expect to}} find brains in a pretty girl." [...] Perhaps she said it because I was not a pretty girl and she wished to {{encourage}} me. In any event, that absurd notion of the ancients that when the fairies bestow the gift of beauty on a baby they withhold all other qualities has so often been disproved that we may well disregard it.|$|E
50|$|Mrs. Mill died on 3 November 1858 at the Hotel de l'Europe, Avignon, when on the {{way with}} her husband {{to the south of}} France. In order to be near his wife's grave Mill bought a house at Avignon, which {{subsequently}} passed to Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor now devoted herself entirely to Mill, and became his 'chief comfort.' She not only took entire charge of practical matters and of his heavy correspondence, answering many of his letters herself, but also may have co-operated in his literary work, especially in The Subjection of Women (1869), much of which might have been suggested by her <b>mother.</b> Mill <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of all his later work that it was the result not of one intelligence, but of three, of himself, his wife, and his step-daughter. Mill died in 1873.|$|R

Sara had her lips open, all ready to answer {{whatever}} Ray might say, but she shut them suddenly and the boy went on. [...] "Aunt Josephina thought a lot of <b>Mother,</b> too. She <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she knew {{there was always a}} welcome for her at Maple Hollow.

50|$|Del and Rodney {{return to}} their block of flats but the lift breaks down. After being trapped in there for some time, the two {{brothers}} have a discussion about Rodney and Cassandra's miscarriage. A distraught Rodney confesses that he has {{spent too much time}} feeling sorry for himself since Cassandra lost their baby. Del tells Rodney that it is just a dropped stitch in life's tapestry, which their late <b>mother</b> Joan <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whenever things went wrong. Rodney agrees and is finally at peace with the whole thing, and Del suggests to Rodney to go home and have a heart-to-heart with Cassandra. Once the conversation is over, Del successfully fixes the lift himself, and gets it working again. Only then does Rodney realise that Del had in fact tampered with the controls, in order to force Rodney to talk. The Trotter Brothers share a hearty laugh.|$|R

And it may come in handy some time. <b>Mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if you kept {{anything}} seven years {{it would come to}} use. I've had my field a good bit longer than that, but maybe the time will come yet. Meanwhile I rejoice in the fact that I am a landed proprietor to the extent of four acres." ...|$|E

I always had a hankering to have sent him to Eton, but your dear <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it was not fair on the others.

Here's a bit I don't understand, to begin with: 'It may be {{observed}} generally {{that the law}} considers marriage {{in the light of}} a Contract.' What does that mean? I thought a contract was the sort of a thing a builder signs when he promises to have the workmen out of the house in a given time, and when the time comes (as my poor <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say)</b> the workmen never go." ...|$|E
6000|$|But the {{masterpiece}} went to Mrs. Dinnie, baker, {{in return}} for a flagon bun. Long ago her daughter, Janet, and Betsy had agreed to marry on the same day, and many a quip had Mrs. Dinnie cast at their romantic compact. But Janet died, and so it was a sad letter that Tommy had to write to her mother. [...] "I'm doubting you're no auld enough for this ane," [...] soft-hearted Betsy said, but she did not know her man. [...] "Tell me some one thing the <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> often <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when she was taking her fun off the pair of you," [...] he said, and [...] "Where is she buried?" [...] was a suggestive question, with the happy tag, [...] "Is there a tree hanging over the grave?" [...] Thus assisted, he composed a letter that had a tear in every sentence. Betsy rubbed her eyes red over it, and not all its sentiments were allowed to die, for Mrs. Dinnie, touched to the heart, printed the best of them in black licorice on short bread for funeral feasts, at which they gave rise to solemn reflections as they went down.|$|R
5000|$|Fred's catchphrase is [...] "Yabba-Dabba-Doo!"; Alan Reed, voice {{actor who}} {{provided}} Fred's voice from 1960-1977, reportedly {{said that the}} inspiration for the phrase came from his <b>mother,</b> who <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "A little dab'll do ya," [...] probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called [...] "Yabba Dabba Dew" [...] and {{may or may not have}} also inspired George Jetson's similar-sounding catchphrase, [...] "Hooba-dooba-dooba" [...] (or [...] "Hooba-Dooba"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by Hoagy Carmichael that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of The Flintstones Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled drummer) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend [...] "Hot Lips Hannigan" [...] where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed [...] "the Golden Smog". In another first-season episode, [...] "Girls' Night Out", Fred recorded a demo record at a carnival of the song [...] "Listen to the Rocking Bird", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named [...] "Hi Fye." [...] As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse, eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.|$|R
6000|$|The papa said, [...] "Now {{every time}} you stop me I shall have to begin all over again." [...] But he saw {{that this was not}} going to spite them any, so he went on: [...] "One of the {{locomotives}} was its mother, and she had got hurt once in a big smash-up, so that she couldn't run long trips any more. She was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as you could see her. But she could work round the depot, and pull empty cars in and out, and shunt them off on the side tracks; and she was so anxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her, and they were very kind to the little Pony Engine on her account, though it was always getting in the way, and under their wheels, and everything. They all knew it was an orphan, for before its mother got hurt its father went through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea, and was never heard of again; he {{was supposed to have been}} drowned. The old <b>mother</b> locomotive <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it would never have happened if she had been there; but poor dear No. 236 was always so venturesome, and she had warned him against that very bridge time and again. Then she would whistle so dolefully, and sigh with her air-brakes enough to make anybody cry. You see they <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be a very happy family when they were all together, before the papa locomotive got drowned. He was very fond of the little Pony Engine, and told it stories at night after they got into the car-house, at the end of some of his long runs. It would get up on his cow-catcher, and lean its chimney up against his, and listen till it fell asleep. Then he would put it softly down, and be off again in the morning before it was awake. I tell you, those were happy days for poor No. 236. The little Pony Engine could just remember him; it was awfully proud of its papa." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'If you're a good dog, {{you will}} be happy. If you're not, you won't,' {{but it seems to}} me that in this world it is all a matter of luck. When I did {{everything}} I could to please people, they wanted to shoot me; and when I did nothing except run away, they brought me back and treated me better than the most valuable prize-winner in the kennels. It was puzzling at first, but one day I heard the boss talking to a friend who had come down from the city.|$|E
6000|$|Well, I ask you, I ask any dog, {{what would}} you have done in my place? Ever since I was old enough to listen, mother had told me over and over again what I must do in a case like this. It is the A B C of a dog's education. 'If you are in a room and you hear anyone trying to get in,' <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'bark. It may be someone who has {{business}} there, or it may not. Bark first, and inquire afterwards. Dogs were made to be heard and not seen.' ...|$|E
60|$|When he had gone, Fred and {{his father}} made a great fuss of me. I couldn't {{understand}} it. Men are so odd. The man wasn't a bit pleased that I had brought him and Fred together, but Fred seemed as if he couldn't do enough for me for having {{introduced him to the}} man. However, Fred's father produced some cold ham--my favourite dish--and gave me quite a lot of it, so I stopped worrying over the thing. As <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Don't bother your head about what doesn't concern you. The only thing a dog need concern himself with is the bill-of-fare. Eat your bun, and don't make yourself busy about other people's affairs.' Mother's was in some ways a narrow outlook, but she had a great fund of sterling common sense.|$|E

Your <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> ask me ever so many {{questions}} about you, an' what you <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and do on the rock when this lighthouse was buildin'. She looked so sad and pale, poor thing; I really thought it would be all up with her, an' I believe it would, but for Minnie. It was quite wonderful the way that girl cheered your mother up, by readin' bits o' the Bible to her, an' tellin' her that God would certainly send you back again. She looked and spoke always so brightly too." ...|$|R

60|$|How noble {{he looked}} as he said it, and how sad it was to part with him! my mother wept most bitterly, {{and said it was}} cruel to leave us to our fate, and that he would kill himself in the Dutch marshes; but when the actual pain of parting with him was over, I am not sure that she had not more hope of {{carrying}} out her wishes. She would have begun by forbidding Annora to go, attended only by the servants, to prayers at the England ambassador's: but Eustace had foreseen this, and made arrangements with a good old knight and his lady, Sir Francis Ommaney, always to call for my sister on their way to church, and she was always ready for them. My <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that her devotion was all perverseness, and now and then, when more than usually provoked with her, would declare that it was quite plain that her poor child's religion was only a heresy, since it did not make her a better daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it--I know it, sir, {{and think}} nothing of looks myself.

But mankind go so much by appearances that I do n't like to trust the brig too much afore their eyes. Now, should we be seen in the lower bay, waiting for a wind, or for the ebb tide to make, to carry us over the bar, ten to one but some philotropic or other would be off with a complaint to the District Attorney that we looked like a slaver, and have us all fetched up to be tried for our lives as pirates.

6000|$|It is not {{my purpose}} to trace my future {{progress}} through life. I had extricated myself, or rather had been freed by my friends, from the brambles and thickets of the law; but, as befell the sheep in the fable, {{a great part of}} my fleece was left behind me. Something remained, however: I was in the season for exertion, and, as my good <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> there was always life for living folk. Stern necessity gave my manhood that prudence which my youth was a stranger to. I faced danger, I endured fatigue, I sought foreign climates, and proved that I belonged to the nation which is proverbially patient of labour and prodigal of life. Independence, like liberty to Virgil's shepherd, came late, but came at last, with no great affluence in its train, but bringing enough to support a decent appearance {{for the rest of my}} life, and to induce cousins to be civil, and gossips to say, [...] "I wonder whom old Croft will make his heir?
