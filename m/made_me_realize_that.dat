I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

30|$|Honestly speaking, this [cogen] {{is a very}} {{deliberate}} meet-up {{session with}} them. If without this cogen, I don't think I will have the time, or make time specially for them to actually get to know them, like {{how they feel about}} science lessons.

2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends that are taking place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E

60|$|I {{loved that}} old garden by the harbour shore. Even Abel himself, I think, {{could hardly have}} felt a deeper affection for it. When its gate closed behind me it shut out the world and my {{corroding}} memories and discontents. In its peace my soul emptied itself of the bitterness which had been filling and spoiling it, and grew normal and healthy again, aided thereto by Abel's wise words. He never preached, but he radiated courage and endurance and a frank acceptance of the hard things of life, {{as well as a}} cordial welcome of its pleasant things. He was the sanest soul I ever met. He neither minimized ill nor exaggerated good, but he held that we should never be controlled by either. Pain should not depress us unduly, nor pleasure lure us into forgetfulness and sloth. All unknowingly he <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I had been a bit of a coward and a shirker. I began to understand that my personal woes were not the most important things in the universe, even to myself. In short, Abel taught me to laugh again; and when a man can laugh wholesomely things are not going too badly with him.|$|E

60|$|In the Treaty Ports, Europeans and Americans live {{in their}} own quarters, with streets well paved and lighted, houses in European style, and shops full of American and English goods. There is {{generally}} also a Chinese part of the town, with narrow streets, gaily decorated shops, and the rich mixture of smells characteristic of China. Often one passes through a gate, suddenly, {{from one to the}} other; after the cheerful disordered beauty of the old town, Europe's ugly cleanliness and Sunday-go-to-meeting decency make a strange complex impression, half-love and half-hate. In the European town one finds safety, spaciousness and hygiene; in the Chinese town, romance, overcrowding and disease. In spite of my affection for China, these transitions always <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I am a European; for me, the Chinese manner of life would not mean happiness.

The rusted gates between the crumbling heraldic pillars were folded back, and my uncle flicked the mares impatiently as we flew up the weed-grown avenue, until he pulled them on their haunches before the time-blotched steps.

Do you see your major or your educational experience any differently {{as a result of}} it?'Brief excerpt from interview: The class helped me get to know the students in the class.

60|$|However, a good rest {{helped to}} revive {{strength}} and spirit. Then I started. Once above the saddle I was out {{clear in the}} open, high above the canyons, and the vast basin still farther below, yet far indeed under the pine-fringed rim above. This climb was all over stone. The ridge was narrow-crested, yellow, splintered rock, with a few dwarf pines and spruces and an occasional bunch of manzanita. I did not hear a sound that I did not make myself. Whatever had become of the hounds, and the other hunters? The higher I climbed the more I liked it. After an hour I was sure that I could reach the rim by this route, and of course that stimulated me. To make sure, and allay doubt, I {{sat down on a}} high backbone of bare rock and studied the heave and bulge of ridge above me. Using my glasses I made sure that I could climb out. It would be a task equal to those of lion-hunting days with Jones, and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> happy to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> despite the intervening ten years I was still equal to the task.|$|R
40|$|The {{labour force}} {{participation}} {{of women with}} a Turkish or Moroccan descent in the Netherlands, particularly in Amsterdam, is low, even though their educational level is rising. In this research I will be focussing on women of Turkish and Moroccan descent and their ideas about motherhood and work. I {{have been involved in}} the project ‘Kiezen voor Werk?’ and I have met a range of different Turkish and Moroccan women. Their stories have broadened my understanding of their decisions in life and what they consider important. This <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>realize</b> once more <b>that</b> the division between ‘them’ and ‘us’ is absolutely not as black and white as it is represented in media and public policy. A more nuanced vision is needed. For this research the main question is: How do Turkish and Moroccan women in the Netherlands navigate their way between their own cultural heritage and their experiences in Dutch culture in relation to motherhood and labour force participation? I will focus particularly on the influence motherhood has on the labour force participation of these women. With this thesis I would first of all like to contribute a more nuanced version of the story to the popular debate about the lacking labour force participation of Turkish and Moroccan women. I will look at the viewpoints of young women with a Turkish or Moroccan descent that follow from the data collected from four large focus groups held for the project ‘Kiezen voor Werk?’ and two additional interviews with Moroccan women. Analysing the data I could distinguish three influential factors on these women’s opinions on motherhood and labour force participation; religion, family and societal factors. Influence of family was most often highlighted by these women and could exist of negative or positive influence of the husband, parents, parents-in-law and other family members. Their focus and therefore mine lays on the influence of family. Furthermore, I will focus on the possible solutions they named for negative influences on women’s labour force participation and on solutions that can be extracted from their experiences. Those solutions show the agency and subjectivity of these women and will help increase the labour participation of women of Turkish and Moroccan descent while respecting their own viewpoints...|$|R
