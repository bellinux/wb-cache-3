During {{the past few}} years {{attempts have been made to}} optimise the carbonatation process with regard to impurity removal and filterability. This paper covers in detail the equipment employed to facilitate carbonatation, together with the control philosophy surrounding the gassing of milk of lime, lime dosing rates into <b>melt</b> <b>liquor</b> and filtration throughputs. Practical insights and challenges concerning the management of the saturator equipment, auto-filter station and operations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Trials were {{undertaken}} at the Gledhow refinery (GH) {{to determine}} the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide dosing under South African factory conditions for colour reduction. Peroxide was dosed into the raw melt {{at a rate of}} 200 ppm on brix. The peroxide apparently eliminated a colour rise from <b>melt</b> to limed <b>liquor,</b> but the first and second sugar colours were little changed. However, the colours of the third and fourth sugars dropped significantly, resulting in a lower colour for the packed refined sugar.

40|$|Crystallization is {{the most}} {{critical}} step of the chocolate poduction process and for chocolate quality. For the continuous solidification of chocolate products three steps are needed: nucleation, precrystallization and cooling crystallization. The rate of nucleation {{is influenced by the}} chemical composition and the origin of cocoa butter, by temperature and by shearing forces within the cooled <b>melt.</b> The precrystallized <b>liquor</b> already contains fat crystals but shows a liquid consistency. According to DSC measurements the solid fat content reaches values between 0. 2 and 2 % of fat in tempered masses. The main part of solidification occurs within the cooling tunnel. During this step more or less stable crystal modifications are formed. The quality of the cooling process influences the fat bloom resistance of the products...|$|R
40|$|The {{major fire}} and fire injury {{findings}} for all metal/nonmetal mining categories for 1990 - 2001 {{are shown in}} tables 64 - 65. Table 66, partly illustrated in figure 22, shows the number of fires, fire injuries, fire fatalities, risk rates, employees' working hours, and lost workdays for all metal/nonmetal mining categories by time period. For all metal/nonmetal operations (including stone and sand and gravel), a total of 518 fires occurred during 1990 - 2001; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities (Ewhr = 4, 012 x 106 hr, In = 0. 015, LWD = 36, 204). Thirty fires and 26 injuries involved contractors. The greatest number of fires and fire injuries occurred at surface operations; the highest risk rate values were also calculated for surface operations. The number of fires increased during the first four 2 -year time periods (1990 - 1991, 1992 - 1993, 1994 - 1995, and 1996 - 1997), then decreased {{during the last two}} periods (1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). The number of injuries showed a decrease throughout the periods, accompanied by an increase in employees' working hours. Twenty-five firefighting interventions by mine rescue teams in underground mines and at least 30 interventions at surface operations were required to combat these fires. However, 45 fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. Ninety-seven fires were detected late, and 30 fires were undetected. The ignition sources that caused the greatest number of fires were flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame (169 fires or 33 % with 137 injuries), hydraulic fluid/fuel sprayed onto equipment hot surfaces (89 fires or 17 % with 46 injuries and 3 fatalities), heat source/explosion and flammable liquids/ gas/refueling fuel on hot surfaces (98 fires or 19 % with 73 injuries), electrical short/arcing (51 fires or 10 % with 16 injuries), and spontaneous combustion/hot material (46 fires or 9 % with 17 injuries). The flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame source caused fires usually involving welders' clothing or oxyfuel/grease and other materials (including chute and dust collector liners, flammable liquids, belt material, crusher, hopper and shaker deck materials, washer plants, equipment mechanical components, stampler breaker, hydraulic fluid, rubber tires and hoses, gear boxes, bin feeder, dump rope cables, screen liner and screen panel, kiln and shaft material, pipelines, <b>liquor</b> <b>pumps,</b> wood pallets, electrical junction boxes, handrails, grease, refuse, shop and wood). The spontaneous combustion/hot material and electrical fires were usually detected late due to lack of combustion gas/smoke detection systems. At least 55 of the 89 mobile equipment hydraulic fluid/fuel fires became large fires (requiring 12 mine rescue team interventions in undergroun...|$|R

50|$|Cocoa solids are {{a mixture}} of many {{substances}} remaining after cocoa butter is extracted from cacao beans. When sold as an end product, {{it may also be}} called cocoa powder or cocoa. Cocoa solids are a key ingredient of chocolate, chocolate syrup, and chocolate confections. In contrast, the fatty component of chocolate is cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is 50% to 57% of the weight of cocoa beans and gives chocolate its characteristic <b>melting</b> properties. Cocoa <b>liquor</b> or cocoa mass is a paste of roasted cocoa beans with cocoa butter and solids in their natural proportions. Recipes for chocolate require the addition of extra cocoa butter to cocoa liquor, leading to a cocoa solids surplus and thus a relatively cheap supply of cocoa powder. This contrasts with the earliest European usage of cocoa where, before milk and dark chocolate was popularized, cocoa powder was the primary product and cocoa butter {{was little more than a}} waste product.|$|R
5000|$|In 1347 {{during the}} cortes of Zaragoza, the Union of Valencia allied {{with that of}} Aragon and demanded the right to appoint a Justícia in Valencia like the Aragonese Unidos had. They then {{successfully}} besieged the royalist castle of Játiva. The Union persuaded Ferdinand, Prince of Aragon to be their lieutenant-general and, with an army of 30,000, he dealt the royalists a second defeat. Then Peter IV went from Barcelona to Valencia {{to negotiate with the}} leaders of the Union. The Aragonese union sent a troop of reinforcements, around 20,000, to Ferdinand. Peter offered to declare Ferdinand his heir, but negotiations broke down. Peter was briefly imprisoned in Morvedre in early 1348; only the arrival of the Black Death forced his release. When he had again obtained the upper hand, Peter ordered the [...] "great bell" [...] that had been used to rally the Unidos to be <b>melted</b> and its <b>liquor</b> poured down the throats of the Union's leaders. Peter was even implicated in the death (by poisoning) of his brother James I, Count of Urgell, that year; James had been a supporter of the Union. On 1 November 1348, the Union attacked the Jews of Morvedre because they, being by law serfs of the Crown, were considered de jure royalists.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Modified Ludzak-Ettinger Process" [...] (MLE) is an {{improvement}} {{on the original}} concept, for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the aeration tank {{to the head of}} the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen.
