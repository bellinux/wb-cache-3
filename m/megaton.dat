5|$|Their {{desire to}} return to Bikini was thwarted indefinitely by the U.S. {{decision}} to resume nuclear testing at Bikini in 1954. During 1954, 1956, and 1958, twenty-one more nuclear bombs were detonated at Bikini, yielding a total of , equivalent to more than three thousand Baker bombs. Only one was an air burst, the 3.8 <b>megaton</b> Redwing Cherokee test. Air bursts distribute fallout in a large area, but surface bursts produce intense local fallout. The first after Crossroads was the dirtiest: the 15 <b>megaton</b> Bravo shot of Operation Castle on March 1, 1954, which was the largest-ever U.S. test. Fallout from Bravo caused radiation injury to Bikini islanders who were living on Rongelap Atoll.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one <b>megaton</b> yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three <b>megaton</b> bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
50|$|Castle Yankee had a {{demonstrated}} {{yield of}} 13.5 <b>megatons.</b> The yield for the weaponized Mark 24 was predicted to be 10-15 <b>megatons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although it {{had been}} {{predicted}} to produce a yield of 6 to 10 <b>megatons,</b> it actually produced a yield of 13.5 <b>megatons,</b> the second-largest ever yield in a U.S. fusion weapon test. Like the Mike, Bravo and Romeo tests, {{a large percentage of}} the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium tamper. Of the total yield, 7 <b>megatons</b> were from fission; the other 6.5 <b>megatons</b> were from fusion reactions. The high fusion yield was due to the enriched fuel and set a U.S. record that stood until Hardtack Poplar in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Bravo test, it [...] "ran away" [...] and {{produced}} {{far more than}} its predicted yield, and for the same reason—an unexpected participation of the common lithium-7 isotope in fusion reactions. Although it had been predicted to produce a yield of 4 <b>megatons</b> {{with a range of}} 1.5 to 7 <b>megatons</b> (before the results of the Bravo test caused an upgrade in the estimates, it had originally been estimated to produce 3-5 <b>megatons),</b> it actually produced a yield of 11 <b>megatons,</b> the third-largest test ever conducted by the U.S.|$|R
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the debris at the 10-megaton Ivy Mike nuclear test {{was a part of}} long-term project, {{one of the goals of}} which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 1023 neutrons/cm2 within a microsecond, i.e. about 1029 neutrons/(cm2·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5 neutrons/(cm2·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary {{analysis of}} debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of <b>megaton</b> explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.|$|E
25|$|The {{public records}} for devices that {{produced}} the highest proportion of their yield via fusion-only reactions are the peaceful nuclear explosions of the 1970s, with the 3 detonations that excavated part of Pechora–Kama Canal being cited as 98% fusion each in the Taiga test's 15 kiloton explosive yield devices; that is, a total fission fraction of 0.3 kilotons in a 15 kt device. Others include the 50 <b>megaton</b> Tsar Bomba at 97% fusion, the 9.3 <b>megaton</b> Hardtack Poplar test at 95.2%, and the 4.5 <b>megaton</b> Redwing Navajo test at 95% fusion.|$|E
25|$|Death {{is highly}} likely and {{radiation}} poisoning {{is almost certain}} if one is caught in the open with no terrain or building masking effects within a radius of 0–3km from a 1 <b>megaton</b> airburst, and the 50% chance of death from the blast extends out to ~8km from the same 1 <b>megaton</b> atmospheric explosion.|$|E
50|$|A 1 kg mass {{traveling}} at 99% {{of the speed}} of light would have a kinetic energy of 5.47 joules. In explosive terms, it would be equal to 132 <b>megatons</b> of TNT, or approximately 75 <b>megatons</b> more than the yield of Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. 1 kg of mass-energy is 8.99 joules, or about 21.5 <b>megatons</b> of TNT.|$|R
50|$|RDS-37 was the Soviet Union's first {{two-stage}} hydrogen bomb, first {{tested on}} November 22, 1955. The weapon had a nominal yield of approximately 3 <b>megatons.</b> It was scaled down to 1.6 <b>megatons</b> for the live test.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet Union detonated {{its first}} [...] "true" [...] {{hydrogen}} bomb on November 22, 1955, {{which had a}} yield of 1.6 <b>megatons.</b> On October 30, 1961, the Soviets detonated a hydrogen bomb with a yield of approximately 58 <b>megatons.</b>|$|R

25|$|When {{ballistic}} missiles replaced bombers in the 1960s, most multi-megaton bombs {{were replaced by}} missile warheads (also two-stage thermonuclears) scaled down to one <b>megaton</b> or less.|$|E

25|$|Over {{its history}} as a nuclear test site, Novaya Zemlya hosted 224 nuclear detonations with a total {{explosive}} energy equivalent to 265 <b>megatons</b> of TNT. For comparison, all explosives used in World War II, including the detonations of two US nuclear bombs, amounted to only two <b>megatons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SS-9 was a silo-launched missile {{capable of}} {{delivering}} warheads of 5-18 <b>megatons,</b> {{with a range}} of up to 15,500 km. These were then replaced by the similar SS-18, with payloads of 18-25 <b>megatons.</b> The silos used for launching were the same for both, once modified.|$|R

25|$|A notable {{comparison}} to underline this is found when one compares the 50 <b>megaton</b> air-burst Tsar Bomba, which produced no concentrated local/early fallout, and thus no known deaths from radiation, with the surface burst of the 15 <b>megaton</b> Castle Bravo, which in comparison, {{due to the}} local fallout produced, was implicated {{in the death of}} 1 of 23 crew on the Lucky Dragon and made the entire Bikini Atoll unfit for further nuclear testing until enough time elapsed and the intensity of the radiation field had decayed to acceptable levels.|$|E
25|$|The goal of China was {{to produce}} a {{thermonuclear}} device {{of at least a}} <b>megaton</b> in yield that could be dropped by an aircraft or carried by a ballistic missile. Several explosions to test thermonuclear weapon designs, characteristics and yield boosting preceded the thermonuclear test.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 85 nuclear tests were {{conducted}} in Pahute Mesa between 1965 and 1992. Three of them— Boxcar, Benham and Handley— had a yield of over one <b>megaton.</b> Three {{tests were conducted}} as part of Operation Plowshare and one as part of Vela Uniform.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Ivy Mike, {{the first}} {{two-stage}} thermonuclear detonation, 10.4 <b>megatons,</b> November 1, 1952.|$|R
25|$|The 15 <b>megaton</b> (Mt) {{estimate}} {{represents an}} energy about 1,000 {{times greater than}} that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan — roughly equal to that of the United States' Castle Bravo (15.2 Mt) ground-based thermonuclear detonation on 1 March 1954, and about one-third that of the Soviet Union's Tsar Bomba explosion on October 30, 1961 (which, at 50 Mt, is the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated).|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram above, one method used to {{decrease}} the likelihood of accidental detonation employed metal balls. The balls were emptied into the pit: this prevented detonation by increasing {{the density of the}} hollow pit, thereby preventing symmetrical implosion {{in the event of an}} accident. This design was used in the Green Grass weapon, also known as the Interim <b>Megaton</b> Weapon, which was used in the Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bombs.|$|E
25|$|A spherical {{secondary}} {{can achieve}} higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary, because spherical implosion pushes {{in from all}} directions toward the same spot. However, in warheads yielding more than one <b>megaton,</b> the diameter of a spherical secondary would be too large for most applications. A cylindrical secondary is necessary in such cases. The small, cone-shaped re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields {{of a few hundred}} kilotons.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic design}} concept was {{competing}} with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL; now Los Alamos National Laboratory) design that would become the Mark 28 / B28 nuclear bomb and W28 warhead. The Mark 27 was roughly twice as heavy as the Mark W28 family and had a yield of 2 <b>megatons</b> versus the 1 to 1.5 <b>megatons</b> of the Mark W28 bombs.|$|R
5000|$|Before doing so, he {{remotely}} piloted his ship, the White Star, {{to crash}} into the Shadows' capital city, which he was visiting. The White Star was carrying two nuclear bombs in its cargo bay, each with a yield of over 500 <b>megatons.</b> (The strongest nuclear bomb to be detonated as of 2011 was the Tsar Bomb, which had a yield of 50 <b>megatons.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Using {{equations}} describing impact effects {{based on}} work from Collins et al., Shoemaker, Glasstone & Dolanand others, Hamacher determined that an impacting bolide would have produced {{energy in the}} range of 190 to 750 <b>megatons</b> of TNT (for an asteroid and comet impact, respectively). For comparison, the Tunguska event was estimated to have an explosive force of about 10-15 <b>megatons.</b>|$|R
25|$|Delays and {{failures}} in the Granite programme and the abandonment of Green Bamboo without a test, left {{a gap in the}} programme and an emergency capability weapon to fill that gap was devised from elements of both Green Bamboo and Orange Herald; being known as Knobkerry, or Green Grass, and the Interim <b>Megaton</b> Weapon. There were also other factors involved in the decision to build an Interim <b>Megaton</b> Weapon. One being that the UK HEU production programme was by 1957 producing quantities of HEU for which there was no immediate need; and the Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to see it continue to languish in stores, unused for weapons, when it was being produced at great cost. The Green Grass warhead containing perhaps 70–86kg of HEU (although there are no reliable declassified sources for this figure) was therefore hurriedly produced and installed in a modified Blue Danube casing, to be known as Violet Club, until a better solution based on the Yellow Sun casing could be produced, known then with Green Grass installed, as Yellow Sun Mk.1. Only five Violet Club weapons were produced, known by the RAF description of Bomb, Aircraft, HE 9,000lb HC, and they were stripped of their Green Grass warheads for transfer to the better casings when these became available.|$|E
25|$|This fission stage made fusion weapons {{considerably}} more dirty {{than they were}} made out to be. This {{was evident in the}} towering cloud of deadly fallout that followed the Bravo test. When the Soviet Union tested its first <b>megaton</b> device in 1955, the possibility of a limited nuclear war seemed even more remote in the public and political mind. Even cities and countries that were not direct targets would suffer fallout contamination. Extremely harmful fission products would disperse via normal weather patterns and embed in soil and water around the planet.|$|E
25|$|The bomb had a {{yield of}} 50 <b>megaton</b> TNT (210 PJ). In theory, {{it had a}} maximum yield of 100 megatons {{if it were to}} have {{included}} a U-238 tamper, but because only one bomb was built, this was never demonstrated. The single bomb was detonated at the Sukhoy Nos cape of Severny Island, part of Novaya Zemlya. It was decided that a full 100 Mt detonation would create too great a risk of nuclear fallout, as well as a near certainty that the release plane and crew would be destroyed before it could escape the blast radius.|$|E
