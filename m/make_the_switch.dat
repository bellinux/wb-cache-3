5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled {{for first place}} until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello {{to take the lead}} until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E

25|$|Soap operas were {{originally}} broadcast {{live from the}} studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling {{similar to that of}} a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as General Hospital, Days of our Lives and The Young and the Restless were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. As the World Turns and The Edge of Night were the last to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch,</b> in 1975.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1970 NFL season, the merged league was {{organized}} into two conferences of three divisions each. All ten AFL teams made up the bulk of the new American Football Conference. To avoid having an inequitable number of teams in each conference, the leagues voted to move three NFL teams to the AFC. Motivated by the prospect of an intrastate rivalry with the Bengals as well as by personal animosity toward Paul Brown, Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell quickly offered to include his team in the AFC. He helped persuade the Pittsburgh Steelers (the Browns' archrivals) and Baltimore Colts (who shared the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. market with the Washington Redskins) to follow suit, and each team received US $3 million to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch.</b> All the other NFL squads became part of the National Football Conference.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{started the}} 2002–03 season well, winning 14 {{of their first}} 16 games, and had {{the best record in}} the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most {{versatile}} players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA Champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch,</b> he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Quake II engine, Epic Games had {{unveiled}} its own Unreal Engine. The Unreal Engine was more realistic than Quake II and was better suited to producing open spaces—3D Realms had been struggling to render the Nevada desert. Soon after E3, a programmer suggested that they <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch.</b> After discussions, the developers unanimously agreed to the change, which would mean scrapping much of their work so far, including significant changes 3D Realms had made to the Quake Engine. In June 1998, 14 months after the Quake II announcement, 3D Realms made the switch announcement. Broussard said that the game would not be [...] "significantly delayed" [...] by the switch, but that the project would be back to where it was at E3 [...] "within a month to six weeks". Broussard also said that no content seen in the E3 trailer would be lost. Chris Hargrove, one of the game's programmers at the time, confided that the change amounted to a complete reboot of the project.|$|E

Strummer, for his part, was primed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch.</b> In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
