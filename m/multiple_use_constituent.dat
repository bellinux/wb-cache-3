40|$|The {{design of}} {{advanced}} wireless communication systems {{has been one}} of the most important research areas in recent years. High performance error correction schemes and high speed data services are at the heart of these systems. Due to the excellent performance of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, they are good candidates for many new wireless communication standards. However, complexity, latency scalability and flexibility remain a challenge. This thesis is concerned with investigating a new approach to coding and decoding LDPC codes based on Parallel Concatenated Gallager Code (PCGCs) <b>using</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>constituent</b> codes. These are a class of concatenated codes built from the direct parallel concatenation of LDPC codes without interleavers. They are characterized by a competitive BER performance while still maintaining the low complexity and flexibility attributes. New methods for encoding and decoding are presented together with BER simulation results showing the performance of these codes. Analysis in terms of the number of constituent codes is also carried out. Complexity analysis is performed and preliminary implementation results are also given based on a proposed high throughput architecture...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{summary of}} {{thermoelectric}} principles {{is presented in}} a historical context, following {{the evolution of the}} field from initial discovery to modern day high-zT materials. A specific focus is placed on nanocomposite materials as a means to solve the challenges presented by the contradictory material requirements necessary for efficient thermal energy harvest. Misfit layer compounds are highlighted {{as an example of a}} highly ordered anisotropic nanocomposite system. Their layered structure provides the opportunity to <b>use</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>constituents</b> for improved thermoelectric performance, through both enhanced phonon scattering at interfaces and through electronic interactions between the constituents. Recently, a class of metastable, turbostratically-disordered misfit layer compounds has been synthesized using a kinetically controlled approach with low reaction temperatures. The kinetically stabilized structures can be prepared with a variety of constituent ratios and layering schemes, providing an avenue to systematically understand structure-function relationships not possible in the thermodynamic compounds. We summarize the work that has been done to date on these materials. The observed turbostratic disorder has been shown to result in extremely low cross plane thermal conductivity and in plane thermal conductivities that are also very small, suggesting the structural motif could be attractive as thermoelectric materials if the power factor could be improved. The first 10 compounds in the [(PbSe) 1 +δ]m(TiSe 2) n family (m, n ≤ 3) are reported as a case study. As n increases, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient is significantly increased without a simultaneous decrease in the in-plane electrical conductivity, resulting in an improved thermoelectric power factor...|$|R

40|$|Forested {{watersheds}} are classical {{examples of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> natural resource areas which simultaneously supply timber, water, range, fisheries and wildlife, {{and a variety}} of recreational and esthetic experiences. A change in the forest ecosystem to benefit one forest <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resource brings about concomitant changes which affect other <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources. Forest <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources, while abundant by many standards, are in fact limited. As a result, choices have to be made regarding the combination and levels of forest <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources to be provided. The complexity of <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> management requires the need to approximate complex and dynamic <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources production relationships and to consider, simultaneously, a large number of different management strategies for a heterogeneous set of resources for alternative planning horizons. Redacted for privacy The objectives of this study are to define an analytical framework which facilitates decision-making regarding <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resource allocations and to empirically test this methodology. Economic theory of joint production and the information provided by TREES (Timber Resource Economic Estimation System (Tedder, Schmidt and Gourley, 1980)) was used to construct the analytical framework. The analytical approach was tested utilizing physical data from the upper middle portion of the Drift Creek Watershed of the Hebo Banger District of the Siuslaw National Forest. This study also examines the projected physical and economic impacts on the allocation of timber, deer, elk, cattle grazing, anadromous fisheries, spotted owl and bald eagle <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources within the study area of seven Forest Service management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Oaks are a {{keystone}} species in California ecosystems that aid in regulating ecological processes and support {{a variety of}} wildlife species. There is mounting documentation that California oak species are experiencing a lack of recruitment and declines in populations. Agencies have responded with restoration projects for oaks; some projects, such as those implemented by the U. S. Forest Service, have <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> management goals, such as timber harvesting, fire fuel reduction, and oak restoration. However, the effectiveness of such <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> projects, in which restoration {{is one of the}} goals, has not been well studied.

40|$|Institutional {{arrangements}} have {{a profound}} impact on the use and management of <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> commons. The emergent question is whether existing institutional arrangements governing <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> commons are meeting sustainability needs and delivering desirable outcomes for stakeholders and communities. Sustainability has posed particular challenges to the rationality of bureaucratic organization and decision making. The emerging paradigm for sustainability governance emphasizes systems approaches, adaptive management, incentives, collaborative governance, decentralization, communicative planning, and conflict resolution. However, in many cases, the delivery of these approaches in practice requires substantial institutional change and this must be based on {{a deeper understanding of the}} relationships between institutions and behavior. Using Australia’s Outback Environments as the context for study, this paper will outline a general approach for understanding institutions in <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> contexts and evaluating institutional efficacy in <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> commons.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{cross contamination}} of blood cultures associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices, which {{are widely used}} in clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce labour costs. METHODS: Systematic analysis of 13, 880 blood culture results in a large teaching hospital where <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices were employed. RESULTS: Nine series of potential cross contamination were identified in a 12 month period. Four series involved coagulase negative staphylococci and were unlikely to represent true cross contamination. Five series involved blood cultures which had significant bacterial growth {{at the time of}} venting. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices can be associated with cross contamination of blood cultures. This may result from contamination of the internal lumen of the venting device which is not exposed to the biocide. Medical microbiologists should consider the possibility of cross contamination associated with venting procedures when interpreting blood culture results. Further development of <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices is required {{to reduce the risk of}} cross contamination of cultures...|$|R
