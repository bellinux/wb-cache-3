Although not as well known as the GPS, the Russian global satellite navigation system GLONASS possesses comparable capabilities for navigation, precise geodetic positioning, and time-transfer applications [l]. During the last few years studies of time and frequency comparisons of remote atomic standards have seen several interesting developments involving GLONASS: C/A-code single-channel measurements led to similar to GPS performances for continental links; intercontinental links were affected by lack of post-processed GLONASS precise ephemerides 121. But the performance of single-channel GPS and GLONASS CIA-code common-view time transfer, uncertainty of about 3 ns, is barely sufficient for the comparison of current atomic clocks and needs to be improved rapidly to meet the challenge of the clocks now being designed.

Also, the Canadian satellite RADARSAT- 2 has a special <b>multi-channel</b> <b>mode</b> for radar MTI. The concept of multi-channel MTI alleviates the necessity for high-contrast in the detection of moving objects in the scene and it is very sensitive to low velocities. Its implementation is called space-time adaptive processing or STAP. STAP is capable of detection of moving targets but it offers limited options for their imaging. This thesis is a result of research jointly performed at the International Research Centre for Telecommunications and Radar associated with Delft University of Technology (IRCTR) and the TNO Defense, Security and Safety in the Hague, the Netherlands. The goal was to develop models suitable for general scenarios and to study optimal, yet fast and efficient algorithms capable of processing data created by these models. Theoretical results were to be verified experimentally. The research was to answer several questions: Are there any benefits in combining SAR and STAP? If the task at hand is to perform imaging of moving targets with resolution equal to the resolution of images of stationary targets using SAR, a signal model fully general for the given geometry is required. Inversions of such a model have been found, albeit for some cases only. The approach is mainly suitable for generation of synthetic datasets for numerical evaluation of SAR/MTI processing techniques, but also for the study of new, potentially interesting applications such as MTI with ultra-wideband ground penetrating radar. Is it possible to find a fast yet optimal or near-optimal MTI algorithm? It is suggested that if the channel calibration is done properly, averaging of signals from multiple channels can be used to extract moving targets. Being a relatively inexpensive operation, averaging will yield considerable savings in the computational power necessary to perform MTI. Although the real-time implementation of such an algorithm by means of a high-pass filter was already proposed by other authors, it was not validated using real data. How would such an algorithm perform when applied to measured data? A known STAP algorithm and averaging were applied to two airborne datasets: one based on the MCARM data, the other based on the SOSTAR-X data. It was concluded that a simple channel mismatch model could be assumed. Contrary to the MCARM data, the SOSTAR-X data contained severe channel mismatch. Nevertheless, at least one MTI algorithm worked satisfactorily in both cases. How can we use STAP in a new fashion? A way to detect victims buried in debris during natural disasters or terrorist attacks is proposed. Several experiments with ultra-wideband ground penetrating radar were carried out at the IRCTR. The results were in good agreement with predictions. The main results obtained in this thesis can be summarised as follows: Extended models for multi-channel SAR (MSAR) MTI. The thesis complements the TNO’s expertise in single-channel SAR MTI algorithms. It builds on ideas put forth in open literature and provides more general closed-form expressions for the MSAR transfer function. Heuristic investigations into error sources in real data. A simple model for airborne MTI where so-called internal clutter motion and flight path deviations are neglected, and the mismatch between channels is constant with time is tested on real data from MCARM and SOSTAR-X projects. Although deterministic the STAP techniques used in this thesis have already been applied to the MCARM data, no easy comparison to other published attempts was found. A detailed comparison is provided here. This heuristic validation provided insights into interpretation of SOSTAR-X data. Novel application of STAP to detection of buried victims. A new idea to use STAP for detection of moving objects buried underground or in debris is described. The idea is based on the possibility of detecting a slight motion of the victims produced by breathing. MSAR MTI processing provides fine spatial resolution due to the synthetic aperture concept and slow motion detection capability due to STAP. An alternative side-looking antenna configuration instead of the more traditional downlooking configuration is used. First results with measured data are presented.

40|$|Due to a system-inherent limitation, {{conventional}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) is incapable of imaging a wide swath with high geometric resolution. This restriction can be overcome by systems with multiple receive channels in combination with an additional digital signal processing network. So far, the application of such digital beamforming algorithms for high-resolution wide-swath SAR imaging has been restricted to multi-channel systems in stripmap operation. However, in stripmap mode the overall azimuth antenna length restricts the achievable swath width, thus preventing very wide swaths as requested by future SAR missions. Consequently, new concepts for ultra-wide-swath imaging are needed. A promising candidate is a SAR system with multiple azimuth channels being operated in burst mode.

The data compression technique consists of two parts: the first part based on SVD is responsible for decomposing the covariance matrix generated by the multi-channel measurement signals; the second part is to construct measurement signal using the results of SVD with a proposed model order determination method. For the constructed measurement signal, CWT is applied to form wavelet coefficient matrix (WCM) at the same dilation. With the WCMs, a singular-value vector is constructed using the maximum singular value of each WCM obtained through SVD. In this singular value vector, the maximum component is considered as the dominant oscillation mode indicator to select the right-singular vector.

40|$|Neutron {{multiplicity}} counting is {{a widely}} used technique in safeguards to determine the mass of fissile material. Unfortunately the multiplicity measurement is disturbed by the dead-time effect, which prevents pulses from being detected by the electronic chain on the same channel when they follow shortly in time after another pulse. This is particularly important since this loss due to dead-time especially affects neutrons originating from multiple-emission events, which in fact carry {{a lot of information}} about the sample and so should be measured. There exist a number of different dead-time correction methods. The most widely used (INCC) makes use of a semi-empirical correction for the single and double neutron emissions (Singles, Doubles) and another method (of Dytlewski) for Triples. They require the application of a pre-delay and of dedicated calibration measurements {{in order to determine the}} necessary parameters. Other correction methods have had little in-field use because of the complexity of their formulation. In this paper we present a new approach for correction, based rather on mathematical-combinatorial theory than on heuristic formulas suggested by the physical principles. In contrast to other existing methods this correction is applied to the multiplicity distributions of measured “Reals plus Accidentals” and “Accidentals”. Test results for this new method using simulations are presented as well as comparisons to other, well established methods for dead-time correction. This new technique requires the deployment of new, so-called <b>multi-channel</b> list <b>mode</b> counters. This new approach will result in a number of advantages over the heuristic one: since the Singles, Doubles, Triples, etc. are calculated later from the multiplicity distribution, this method will be suitable to correct also for higher number of simultaneous neutron emissions than Triples (Quadruples, Quintuples). Since this method is based on the collected data itself, no prior calibration will be necessary. Furthermore use of a pre-delay may not be necessary, leading to an increased gate-fraction and – in principle – to increased quality of the results.
