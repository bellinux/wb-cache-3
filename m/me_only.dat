500|$|Banks was {{a lifelong}} Republican – {{and he also}} once stated that [...] "I'm not goin' {{anywhere}} I'm not wanted" [...] – prompting critics to claim that he was [...] "soft" [...] on Jim Crow; he ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963. He lost the election and later said, [...] "People knew <b>me</b> <b>only</b> as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified as a government official {{and no matter what}} I did I couldn't change my image...What I learned, was {{that it was going to}} be hard for me to disengage myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after my playing days were over." [...] Banks endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the hell out of <b>me</b> <b>only</b> because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov socialized and {{discussed}} music {{with the other}} members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with Alexander Borodin, whose music [...] "astonished" [...] him. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running [...] "toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets". Mendelssohn was not thought of highly, Mozart and Haydn [...] "were considered out of date and naïve", and J.S. Bach merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz [...] "was highly esteemed", Liszt [...] "crippled and perverted from a musical point of view... even a caricature", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination". Often, the musical works in question [...] "were played before <b>me</b> <b>only</b> in fragments, and I had no idea of the whole work". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them [...] "as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth".|$|E

500|$|As his {{political}} significance waned, Livingstone gained more {{work in the}} media, commenting that the press [...] "started to use <b>me</b> <b>only</b> once they thought I was harmless". To receive these outside earnings, he founded a company known as Localaction Ltd. In 1987 he authored an autobiography for HarperCollins, If Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It, conducted journalism for the London Daily News, stood in for BBC Radio 2 disk-jockey Jimmy Young, {{and served as a}} judge for that year's Whitbread Prize. In 1989, Unwin Hyman published his second book, Livingstone's Labour: A Programme for the 90s, in which he expressed his views on a variety of issues, while that same year he was employed to promote Red Leicester cheese in adverts for the National Dairy Council and to appear in adverts for British Coal alongside Edwina Currie. In October 1991 Livingstone began writing a column for Rupert Murdoch's right-wing tabloid The Sun, a controversial move among British socialists. In his column he often discussed his love of amphibians and campaigned {{for the protection of the}} great crested newt, on the basis of which he was appointed vice president of the London Zoological Society in 1996–97. He subsequently began to write a food column for Esquire and then the Evening Standard, also making regular appearances on the BBC quiz show Have I Got News For You?. In 1995, Livingstone was invited to appear on the track [...] "Ernold Same" [...] by the band Blur.|$|E
500|$|Like part one, {{the second}} part premiered to {{critical}} acclaim. IGN's Ramsey Isler wrote that it [...] "changed the whole landscape of the show's main plot arc. Although there were some rough spots in the execution of this story, overall it's {{one hell of a}} way to end the season." [...] He rated the episode 8.6/10. While praising Noble's performance, Isler criticized some plot aspects. He was [...] "kind of torn" [...] on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday device had been set up more for the third season, and believed the Olivia-Fauxlivia interaction to be [...] "a little strange," [...] as the two went from discussing their respective families to [...] "ass kicking". Isler did praise the fight itself. Ken Tucker praised the acting and the writers, noting [...] "The fact that the series can accommodate a fan like <b>me</b> <b>only</b> confirms what a well-wrought piece of pop culture Fringe has become." [...] Tucker included {{the second part}} of the season in his mid-year [...] "Top 10" [...] list for 2010, partly attributing this ranking to Fringe [...] "offer the season's best cliffhanger", alongside Breaking Bad. Noel Murray declared that he enjoyed part two slightly more, grading it an A. He praised Torv and Noble's performances for [...] "inhabiting their respective worlds so well", and Goldsman for [...] " [...] this episode with an emphasis on the characters more than the setting".|$|E

In response, West said that [...] "J Street's efforts to attack <b>me</b> <b>only</b> embolden my stand for our greatest ally and my spiritual home, the State of Israel." [...] Walsh's chief of staff commented that [...] "If J Street is attacking you, you know you're doing something right." [...] Both representatives were defeated in the general election.|$|E
2500|$|But Enos also visited an old friend, Hugh Crockett, who {{was quoted}} by the Times {{as saying that}} Enos [...] "told <b>me</b> <b>only</b> {{a few weeks ago}} that she has (the scalp) at her house in San Francisco." [...] Those two {{articles}} are the most reliable accounts to date of where that [...] "sad memento" [...] of Ebey's death was kept.

According to family reports, the scalp was last known to be in the possession of the Almira Enos family in California as of 1914.|$|E
2500|$|I had {{measured}} the difference that separated art prior to 1900 {{from the art}} which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to {{be judged by the}} finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about <b>me</b> <b>only</b> a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born) ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{leaders were}} elected in Palermo, {{messengers}} spread word across {{the island for}} the rebels to strike before the French had time to organise resistance. In a fortnight the rebels gained control {{over most of the}} island, and within six weeks it was all under rebel control, except for Messina which was well fortified, and whose leading family, the Riso, remained faithful to Charles. But on 28 April it too broke into open revolt and, most significantly, the islanders' first act was to set fire to Charles's fleet in the harbor. It is reported that upon hearing of the fleet's destruction, King Charles exclaimed [...] "Lord God, since it has pleased You to ruin my fortune, let <b>me</b> <b>only</b> go down in small steps." ...|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher John Taurek {{also argued}} {{that the idea of}} adding {{happiness}} or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant. Taurek's basic concern comes down to this: we cannot explain what it means to say that things would be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies. [...] "I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind," [...] he wrote (p.304). He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures. [...] There isn't five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: [...] who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? [...] "Each person's potential loss has the same significance to <b>me,</b> <b>only</b> as a loss to that person alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss" [...] (p.307). Parfit and others have criticized Taurek's line, and it continues to be discussed.|$|E
2500|$|After he recovered, he made {{a second}} effort and {{went back into the}} desert to a farther {{mountain}} by the Nile called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun), opposite Arsinoe. There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned Roman fort for some 20 years. According to Athanasius, the devil again resumed his war against Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes, and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, [...] "If any of you have any authority over <b>me,</b> <b>only</b> one would have been sufficient to fight me." [...] At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed and he would say a few words. Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.|$|E
