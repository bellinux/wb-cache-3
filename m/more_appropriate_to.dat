5|$|Two-level {{utilitarian}}ism (sometimes Government House utilitarianism) is a utilitarian {{theory of}} ethics developed by R. M. Hare. According to the theory, a person's moral decisions {{should be based}} on a set of 'intuitive' moral rules, except in certain rare situations where it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> engage in a 'critical' level of moral reasoning.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, St Thomas's Hospital Medical School {{was granted}} its own {{coat of arms}}. However, the St Thomas' Hospital coat of arms has still been used. Guy’s Medical School {{proposed}} to apply for its own coat of arms after separating from Guy’s Hospital, yet the school decided to continue to use Guy's Hospital’s arms in 1954. The two medical schools merged in 1982 and became the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS). Simon Argles, secretary of UMDS, said {{that because of the}} name of the medical school it was <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> use the hospital's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} (especially the sister species, Pinguinus alfrednewtoni) and {{molecular}} evidence {{show that the}} three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but {{the evolution of the}} little auk is sparsely documented. The molecular data are compatible with either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists still believe it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> retain the species in the genus Alca. It is the only recorded British bird made extinct in historic times.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, kiosks can be {{operated}} under longer leases {{of up to}} ten years. Some consider this <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> due <b>to</b> {{the expense of the}} kiosk (which often starts at 20,000 and is capable of exceeding 100,000).|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{computing}} systematically the gauge invariant extension of WZW term through equivariant cohomology is addressed. The analysis done by Witten in the two-dimensional case is {{extended to the}} four-dimensional ones. While Cartan's model is used to find the anomaly cancelation condition. It is shown that the Weil model is <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> <b>to</b> find the gauge invariant extension of the WZW term. In the process we point out that Weil's and Cartan's models are also useful to stress some connections with the abelian anomaly. Comment: 10 pages, no figure...|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of Araki, it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> discuss ‘personal markers’ (rather than ‘pronouns’). There are seven morphosyntactic person markings: first, second, third, and in {{the case of}} {{non-singular}} first person, there is an inclusive/exclusive distinction.|$|E
25|$|Halsey said he {{gave this}} order {{to conform to}} Army {{practice}} and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked {{the image of a}} brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> the tropics than to war.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the boiler}} is {{typically}} placed horizontally, for locomotives {{designed to work}} in locations with steep slopes it may be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> consider a vertical boiler or one mounted such that the boiler remains horizontal but the wheels are inclined to suit {{the slope of the}} rails.|$|E

25|$|As {{shown in}} diagram at right, this {{phenomenon}} has relatively small effect if {{the standard deviation}} (as compared to the mean) is relatively small, as it makes the log-normal distribution appear similar to an arithmetical normal distribution. Thus, the arithmetical normal distribution may be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> use with small standard deviations for convenience, and the log-normal distribution with large standard deviations.|$|E
25|$|Ulva's {{human history}} goes back {{thousands}} of years. Its standing stones have been dated to 1500 BC, and a shell midden in Livingstones Cave dates to c. 5650 BC; it includes remains of flint and a human infant, {{as well as}} fauna <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> the Ice Age, such as lemming and Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). The cave has been excavated since 1987 by archaeologists from the University of Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|There are an {{overwhelming}} number of mathematical models which {{are referred to as}} Boussinesq equations. This may easily lead to confusion, since often they are loosely referenced to as the Boussinesq equations, while in fact a variant thereof is considered. So it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> call them Boussinesq-type equations. Strictly speaking, the Boussinesq equations is the above-mentioned set B, since it is used in the analysis in the remainder of his 1872 paper.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{derivation}} applies the law of mass action, which is reliant on free diffusion. However, in the environment of a living cell where there is a high concentration of proteins, the cytoplasm often behaves more like a gel than a liquid, limiting molecular movements and altering reaction rates. Although the law of mass action can be valid in heterogeneous environments, it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> model the cytoplasm as a fractal, in order to capture its limited-mobility kinetics.|$|E
25|$|The term Arabic numerals is ambiguous. It most {{commonly}} {{refers to the}} numerals widely used in Europe and the Americas; to avoid confusion, Unicode calls these European digits. Arabic numerals is also the conventional name for the entire family of related numerals of Arabic and Indian numerals. It may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs, in which case it generally refers to the Eastern Arabic numerals. It would be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> refer to the Arabic numeral system, where {{the value of a}} digit in a number depends on its position.|$|E
25|$|Quark matter or QCD matter {{refers to}} any {{of a number of}} theorized phases of matter whose degrees of freedom include quarks and gluons. These {{theoretical}} phases would occur at extremely high temperatures and/or densities, billions of times higher than can be produced in equilibrium in laboratories. Under such extreme conditions, the familiar structure of matter, where the basic constituents are nuclei (consisting of nucleons which are bound states of quarks) and electrons, is disrupted. In quark matter it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> treat the quarks themselves as the basic degrees of freedom.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} {{resources of the}} Athenian State were not excessive. All the glory of Athens in the Age of Pericles, its constructions, public works, religious buildings, sculptures, etc. {{would not have been}} possible without the treasury of the Delian League. The treasury was originally held on the island of Delos but Pericles moved it to Athens under the pretext that Delos wasn't safe enough. This resulted in internal friction within the league and the rebellion of some city-states that were members. Athens retaliated quickly and some scholars believe this to be the period wherein it would be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> discuss an Athenian Empire instead of a league.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, {{two decades}} after its construction, the Sunday school wing was doubled in size. In {{accordance}} with the Akron Plan developed by Lewis Miller and other influential religious educational theorists of the day, it also was reconfigured into {{the form of a}} two-story rotunda with classrooms surrounding the central space on both levels, to provide for a graded Sunday school where children could study the same Biblical lesson as their parents, but in a manner <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> their developmental level, and then return to discuss it as a group. This was an increasingly common design or redesign for American Protestant churches of the era.|$|E
25|$|It may be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> use for e.g. folate, since {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of}} North Americans may actually suffer {{more or less}} from folate deficiency, but only the 2.5 percent that have the lowest levels will fall below the standard reference range. In this case, the actual folate ranges for optimal health are substantially higher than the standard reference ranges. Vitamin D has a similar tendency. In contrast, for e.g. uric acid, having a level not exceeding the standard reference range still does not exclude the risk of getting gout or kidney stones. Furthermore, for most toxins, the standard reference range is generally lower than the level of toxic effect.|$|E

25|$|The interrelationship of {{the keys}} most {{commonly}} used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the circle of fifths. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as {{the doctrine of the}} affections, were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> certain emotions than others. Indian classical music theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.|$|E
25|$|One {{tree species}} in direct {{competition}} with bigcone is Calocedrus decurrens, with preliminary post-fire regeneration {{of this species}} exponentially greater than bigcone. After 1 or 2 years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson. It may be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> perform population stability estimates up to 5 yrs or much later (i.e. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, {{as well as the}} well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life.|$|E
25|$|The UEFA Celebration Match was a {{football}} match played on 13 March 2007 as {{a celebration of}} both the 50th anniversary of {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Rome, which laid the foundations for the European Union, and the 50th year of Manchester United's participation in UEFA competitions. Representatives felt it would be <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the landmark using {{a football}} match rather than another form of celebration. A Europe XI managed by Italian World Cup-winning manager Marcello Lippi played against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Manchester. The match was televised live on BBC Three in the United Kingdom and also streamed live via the BBC Online website. The £1.25million raised went towards the Manchester United Foundation.
