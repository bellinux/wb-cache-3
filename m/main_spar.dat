5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong <b>main</b> <b>spar.</b> The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
50|$|False <b>spars,</b> like <b>main</b> <b>spars,</b> are {{load bearing}} {{structural}} members running spanwise {{but are not}} joined to the fuselage. Their most common purpose is to carry moving surfaces, principally ailerons.|$|R

25|$|C/N 4825 City of Miami - {{parked on}} an unused runway at the Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. It {{was struck by}} a runaway DC-4 on February 3, 1992, {{resulting}} in damage to the right wing and <b>main</b> <b>spar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{layout of the}} fuselage suffered from the same obstruction {{as some of the}} earlier Lockheeds. The <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> and its related hump virtually separated the cockpit from the main cabin. This required two different entry doors, both requiring over-wing access.|$|E
25|$|PA474 was {{transferred}} to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight in 1973. In 1975 a mid-upper turret was found in Argentina and fitted. During the winter of 1995 the Lancaster was fitted with a new <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> to extend the flying life.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of the wing was built up from angle bar and sheet Duralumin with the structure forward of the spars skinned in Duralumin to form torsion boxes, but aft of the <b>main</b> <b>spars</b> the wings were fabric covered.|$|R
50|$|The raft was {{partially}} decked in split bamboo. The <b>main</b> <b>spars</b> were a laminate {{of wood and}} reeds and Heyerdahl tested more than twenty different composites before settling on one that proved an effective compromise between bulk and torsional rigidity.

25|$|The 1-26D was {{introduced}} in 1968 and incorporated some evolutionary improvements to make the aircraft simpler and easier to construct. These include a new monocoque nose forward of the <b>main</b> <b>spar,</b> top and bottom dive brakes to replace the top surface only spoilers of earlier models, new ailerons and a gross weight increased to 700 lbs.|$|E
25|$|It was {{determined}} that the accident {{was caused by a}} fatigue crack in the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> of the left wing that caused the outer part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, to separate from the remainder of the aircraft. The expert panel investigating the accident believed this to be the first fatal aircraft accident anywhere in the world directly attributable to metal fatigue.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} by the Australian Department of Civil Aviation was completed in September 1969 and concluded:The cause of this accident was that the fatigue endurance of the starboard inner <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> lower boom was substantially reduced by the insertion of a flared bush at Station 143 when the margin of safety associated with the retirement life specified for such booms did not ensure that this boom would achieve its retirement life {{in the presence of}} such a defect.|$|E
50|$|The Friendship 3 was {{designed}} for both soaring and cross-country powered flying, with a glide ratio of 24:1.

50|$|The {{sturdiness}} {{of construction}} of the aircraft has ensured many have survived to this day. Some suggest the massive spruce <b>main</b> <b>spars</b> can be loaded up to 10g, and while that figure is unproved, all prewar utility category aircraft were designed to withstand at least 4.1g {{as opposed to the}} 3.8g postwar design limit standard.|$|R

25|$|Construction {{started in}} 2011 {{on the second}} aircraft, known as Solar Impulse 2, which carries the Swiss {{registration}} HB-SIB. Completion was initially planned for 2013, with a 25-day circumnavigation of the globe planned for 2014. A structural failure occurred on the aircraft's <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> during static tests in July 2012, leading to delays in the flight testing schedule to allow repairs. Solar Impulse 2s first flight took place at Payerne Air Base on 2 June 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{means of}} {{securing}} the oil metering unit to the no. 2 cabin blower became ineffective and {{this led to}} the initiation of a fire within the blower, which propagated to the wing fuel tank and substantially reduced the strength of the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> upper boom. It is probable that the separation of the oil metering unit arose from an out-of-balance condition induced by rotor break-up but the source of the rotor break-up could not be determined.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{primary cause}} for the accident was a gross structural failure of the aircraft's <b>main</b> <b>spar,</b> which was confirmed by amateur footage, photographs and eyewitness accounts. The reason for the failure was not determined by the Board of Inquiry (BoI), but it was suggested by an accident investigator called in by Rolls Royce that the main cause was that the pilot, upon performing the planned aerobatic display, exceeded the prototype's briefed speed and turning rate limits.|$|E

25|$|The Vulcan flew along runway 07 {{then started}} a rolling climb to starboard. During this {{manoeuvre}} the starboard wing disintegrated, {{resulting in a}} collapse of the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> and wing structure. The Vulcan went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground. Three occupants of a controllers' caravan were killed by debris, {{all four of the}} Vulcan crew were also killed. Three servicemen who were in an ambulance were also injured by debris from the crash.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Inquiry {{found the}} {{accident}} {{was due to the}} failure of the port <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> of the outer wing which had resulted in the disintegration of the wing round the fracture and damage to the rear fuselage and tail. The board also said it found that spar failure was due to over-stressing and they suggested this was due to the extreme air turbulence which was known to have existed in the area at the time. The board said they had found no sign of a fatigue failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{repair work}} to the {{aircraft}}'s <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> delayed Solar Impulse 2s circumnavigation of the Earth from 2012 to 2015. The aircraft was delivered to Masdar City in Abu Dhabi for the World Future Energy Summit in late January 2015, and it began the journey from Al Bateen Executive Airport on 9 March 2015. It was scheduled {{to return to the}} same location in August 2015. A mission control centre for the circumnavigation was established in Monaco, using satellite links to gather real-time flight telemetry and remain in constant contact with the aircraft and the support team.|$|E
50|$|Of {{very similar}} {{construction}} to the Grunau Baby, the Wolf had strut-braced high-set monoplane wings supported on a pylon aft of the cockpit. The hexagonal-section fuselage was constructed largely of wood with plywood skinning and {{the wings and}} tail surfaces were plywood-skinned back to the <b>main</b> <b>spars</b> with wooden-framed fabric-covered rear portions. The undercarriage consisted of rubber-sprung skids under the nose and tail with a fixed mainwheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity.|$|R

25|$|Another {{example of}} the Bf 109's {{advanced}} design {{was the use of}} a single, I-beam <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{found nothing}} in the {{wreckage}} to indicate {{there had been an}} explosion or fire in the aircraft prior to it striking the ground. It was immediately clear that the outer part of the left wing had broken away from the aircraft. The lower boom in the <b>main</b> <b>spar</b> had failed at the outboard edge of the engine nacelle and then the upper boom had also failed {{as the result of the}} wing folding upwards under the air loads imposed on it. The rear spar had then failed, allowing the entire outer part of the wing to separate from the aircraft and drift slowly to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{all-metal}} rotor blades, {{through which}} the compressed air travelled to be ejected at the blade tips, consist of a spar of ing thickness, a honeycomb-filled trailing edge, and feature faired roots in order to the increase their lift coefficient. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the blades possessed a highly homogenous structure, a highly finished surface and a constant profile, and could be easily dismantled to facilitate inspection of the <b>main</b> <b>spar.</b> Additionally, the blade had no risk of icing {{as a consequence of}} the internal current of warm air passing though. The Djinn used relatively standard flight controls, such as the collective pitch control (upon which the throttle was positioned) and adjustable friction trims.|$|E
50|$|Construction was all-wood with plywood {{skinning}} for loaded {{areas and}} fabric covering for lightly loaded {{areas such as}} control surfaces and the wings aft of the <b>main</b> <b>spars.</b> The undercarriage consisted of a semi-recessed mainwheel and small skids under the nose and tail. The cockpit, covered by a built-up plexi-glas canopy was directly forward of the wing leading edge. Control surfaces were of standard wood and fabric construction with the ailerons fitted with external mass balances.|$|R
