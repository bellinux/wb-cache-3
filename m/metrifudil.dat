40|$|Poliovirus (PV) and {{enterovirus}} 71 (EV 71) {{cause severe}} neurological symptoms in their infections {{of the central}} nervous system. To identify compounds with anti-PV and anti-EV 71 activities that would not allow the emergence of resistant mutants, we performed drug screening by utilizing a pharmacologically active compound library targeting cellular factors with PV and EV 71 pseudoviruses that encapsidated luciferase-encoding replicons. We have found that <b>metrifudil</b> (N-[2 -methylphenyl]methyl) -adenosine) (an A 2 adenosine receptor agonist), N 6 -benzyladenosine (an A 1 adenosine receptor agonist) and NF 449 (4, 49, 40, 409 -[carbonylbis[imino- 5, 1, 3 -benzenetriyl bis(carbonyl-imino) ]] tetrakis (benzene- 1, 3 -disulfonic acid) octasodium salt) (a Gs-a inhibitor) have anti-EV 71 activity, and that GW 5074 (3 -(3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzylidine- 5 -iodo- 1, 3 dihydro-indol- 2 -one)) (a Raf- 1 inhibitor) has both anti-PV and anti-EV 71 activities. EV 71 mutants resistant to <b>metrifudil,</b> N 6 -benzyladenosine and NF 449 were isolated after passages {{in the presence of}} these compounds, but mutants resistant to GW 5074 were not isolated for both PV and EV 71. The inhibitory effect of GW 5074 was not observed in Sendai virus infection and the treatment did not induce the expression of OAS 1 and STAT 1 mRNA. Small interfering RNA treatment against putative cellular targets of GW 5074, including Raf- 1, B-Raf, Pim- 1,- 2, and- 3, HIPK 2, GAK, MST 2 and ATF- 3, did not consistently suppress PV replication. Moreover, downregulation of Raf- 1 and B-Raf did not affect the sensitivity of RD cells to the inhibitory effect of GW 5074. These results suggest that GW 5074 has strong and selective inhibitory effect against the replication of PV and EV 71 by inhibiting conserved targets in the infection independently of the interferon response...|$|E
