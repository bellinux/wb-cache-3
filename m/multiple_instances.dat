Deep {{neural networks}} have achieved great success in supervised learning problems, and <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> learning {{as a typical}} weakly-supervised learning method is effective for many applications in computer vision, biometrics, nature language processing, etc. In this paper, we revisit the problem of solving <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> learning problems using neural networks. Neural networks are appealing for solving <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> learning problem. The <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> neural networks perform <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> learning in an end-to-end way, which take a bag with various number of instances as input and directly output bag label. All of the parameters in a <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> network are able to be optimized via back-propagation.

In addition, recent tricks developed in deep learning have been studied in <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> networks, we find deep supervision is effective for boosting bag classification accuracy. In the experiments, the proposed <b>multiple</b> <b>instance</b> networks achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on several MIL benchmarks.

The ability to predict the student academic performance is also most important in higher education system. There are many challenges in this regard. In this paper, we present a <b>Multiple</b> <b>Instance</b> regression algorithm that models the internal data structure of three data sets to identify items that are most relevant to the data set labels, which operates on three data sets with real valued labels, each containing a set of unlabeled items, in which the relevance of each item to its data set is unknown.

5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have <b>multiple</b> <b>instances</b> of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning what was then a dot moving on a screen into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E

The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as Wade in extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is possible that this person was either named after—or has been conflated over time with—one of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade.
