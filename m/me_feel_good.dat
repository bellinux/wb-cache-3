500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really supported me and made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about being an artist." [...] Like many {{young people in the}} area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really know what he was doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E
500|$|... "After a while I {{got sick}} of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean myself off. I see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. It makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> Growing up, I admired {{the kind of}} beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E

500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, it gives me a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I just want to go there and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds). He was 13 minutes and 39 seconds behind the race winner Jaroslav Kulhavý of the Czech Republic (one hour, 29 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E
500|$|... "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was lauded by {{television}} critics. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald {{called it an}} [...] "incredible episode"; [...] "Walking Dead again proves {{it is one of}} the best dramas on TV and almost makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about paying my cable bill." [...] Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Rene Guzman opined that it [...] "delivers all that messy drama in spades with a true gut-wrenching end to one of the series’ core characters". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman stated that in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the audience [...] "finally had a reason to shed some tears and remember just how much we care about the original gang of apocalyptic misfits". Kevin Yeoman of The Christian Science Monitor and E! Online journalist Tierney Bricker concluded that the episode managed to effectively surprise the audience, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 declared that [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was inferior to its predecessor by writing that it [...] "served up a bunch of quasi-entertaining scenes of people arguing and capped them off with one of the most accidentally funny closers ever committed to basic cable". In his B+ review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that the episode continued the series' path of a more focused and central direction. Josh Jackson of Paste was intrigued with the series' exploration of morality during an apocalyptic event in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner". Eric Goldman of IGN was much more pessimistic about the episode than the general consensus. In his 6.5 out of 10 rating review, he called it [...] "especially dull" [...] when compared to the previous installment.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> To get a few of my favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another of Lynch's {{prominent}} themes is industry, {{with repeated}} imagery of [...] "the clunk of machinery, {{the power of}} pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", {{as can be seen}} with the industrial wasteland in Eraserhead, the factories in The Elephant Man, the sawmill in Twin Peaks and the lawn mower in The Straight Story. Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I {{just want you to}} know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me." [...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> that he called me personally and let me know how he felt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009 {{she made}} a cover of Amy Winehouse' [...] "Blonde Trick" [...] and, after a friend posted the song into MySpace, the {{production}} team The Cataracs noticed it and contacted Dev. To Fashion Indie Magazine she said: [...] "I decided to put up this song on MySpace. [...] it was basically a [...] "diss track" [...] and I didn't expect anything out of it. It was just to make <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> like how music usually do but Niles [...] came across to my page and was really into my voice {{and they kind of}} got me into singing and opened up my eyes to business opportunities". She dropped out of college in her first year to pursue her singing career and was then signed by the Los Angeles-based record label and management team, Indie-Pop, who also discovered The Cataracs. Six months later, Dev and The Cataracs' song [...] "2Nite" [...] began to gain exposure on the radio, the television channel MtvU and the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. In 2009, Dev moved to Los Angeles to produce music with the Cataracs and work directly with Indie-Pop.|$|E

60|$|With my {{surgical}} instruments it is different. While I {{have not yet}} had serious use for them, I do not regret the space they occupy. The thought of them makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> They are so much life insurance, only, fairer than that last grim game, one {{is not supposed to}} die in order to win. Of course, I don't know how to use them, and what I don't know about surgery would set up a dozen quacks in prosperous practice. But needs must when the devil drives, and we of the Snark have no warning when the devil may take it into his head to drive, ay, even a thousand miles from land and twenty days from the nearest port.|$|E

60|$|But Tom was aboard by this time, and {{he started}} the balloon up a little, and stopped it again {{as soon as the}} end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me, and roaring and {{springing}} up in the air at the ladder, and only missing it about a quarter of an inch, it seemed to me. It was delicious to be out of his reach, perfectly delicious, and made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> and thankful all up one side; but I was hanging there helpless and couldn't climb, and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other. It is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that; and it is not to be recommended, either.|$|E
