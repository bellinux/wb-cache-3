5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in the wreck of the Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a <b>mongrel</b> between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to muzzle Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a <b>mongrel</b> guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E

50|$|Several {{episodes of}} Pets are {{currently}} {{available as a}} free podcast downloadable via iTunes. In 2010, a similar show named <b>Mongrels</b> aired on BBC3, sparking controversy between the two. The casts of characters in those two shows are almost similar as well, although Pets had four main characters while <b>Mongrels</b> had five. Also, <b>Mongrels</b> range of locations is more diverse (though often behind a London pub), while Pets is confined to a single flat.|$|R

25|$|The words cur, tyke, mutt, and <b>mongrel</b> are used, {{sometimes}} in a derogatory manner. There are also regional terms for mixed-breed dogs. In the United Kingdom <b>mongrel</b> is the unique technical {{word for a}} mixed-breed dog. North Americans generally prefer the term mix or mixed-breed. Mutt is also commonly used (in the United States and Canada). Some American registries and dog clubs that accept mixed-breed dogs use the breed description All American.|$|E

60|$|I shall here {{discuss this}} subject with extreme brevity. The most {{important}} distinction is, {{that in the}} first generation <b>mongrels</b> are more variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact. Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away. When <b>mongrels</b> and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious; but some few cases both of hybrids and <b>mongrels</b> long retaining uniformity of character could be given. The variability, however, in the successive generations of <b>mongrels</b> is, perhaps, greater than in hybrids.|$|R

25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the <b>mongrel,</b> was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E
500|$|Peggy Rockman {{was born}} around 1940.

500|$|For Susan McHugh of the University of New England, the {{political}} coalition that rallied to the statue's defence reflected the brown dog's <b>mongrel</b> status.

500|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} entitled We Are <b>Mongrels,</b> but the title {{had to be}} changed for two reasons: one was that the title was too similar to another BBC Three comedy show, We Are Klang.

Everywhere!; Undergrowth and Never Been Stroked. The last of these titles was rejected after one of the show's additional writers, Danielle Ward; [...] "said it sounded like 'a makeover show for virgins'."

500|$|The Tahitian Dog became {{extinct in}} the Society Islands {{some time after}} the arrival of European {{settlers}} due to the introduction and interbreeding with European dog breeds.

500|$|Paul Kelly {{has written}} a memoir, How to Make Gravy, which was {{published}} by Penguin Books (Australia) on 22 September 2010. [...] "It's a <b>mongrel</b> memoir. It's a bit hard to describe at the moment. It's not traditional; it's writing around the A-Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order. It's slow, {{so it will be}} a while coming, but I'll get there". As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8×CD box set, A – Z Recordings, with live performances from his A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010. The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights. The set includes a booklet of photographs.

500|$|None of {{the party}} had any {{remaining}} faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs {{on the other side}} of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons. Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter's Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers, and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by <b>mongrel</b> teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another [...] long stretch of desert lay ahead.|$|E
