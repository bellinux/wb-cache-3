40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a <b>multi–channel</b> <b>modulation</b> {{technique}} that {{makes use of}} Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) being modulated by a low bit rate digital stream. The main reason of using OFDM is because here the symbol detection is easy and also to increase the robustness against frequency selective fading and narrow band interference. Certain parameter like CFO (carrier frequency offset),I/Q imbalance (inphase and quadrature phase imbalance) imbalance causes distortion in the received signal. Here comparison is made for the given parameters using different channels and a method is proposed for Multiple Input Multiple output (MIMO) OFDM system when symbol generated is not a integral multiple of number of transmitters used...|$|E
40|$|Multi-Carrier Modulation is a {{technique}} for data-transmission by dividing a high-bit rate data stream is several parallel low bit-rate data streams and using these low bit-rate data streams to modulate several carriers. Multi-Carrier Transmission {{has a lot of}} useful properties such as delay-spread tolerance and spectrum efficiency that encourage their use in un-tethered broadband communications. OFDM is a multi-carrier modulation technique with densely spaced sub-carriers that has gained a lot of popularity among the broadband community in the last few years. This report is intended to provide a tutorial level introduction to OFDM Modulation, its advantages and demerits, and some applications of OFDM.

40|$|Single-channel {{modulation}} detection thresholds (MDTs) {{have been}} shown to predict cochlear implant (CI) users ’ speech performance. However, little is known about <b>multi-channel</b> <b>modulation</b> sensitivity. Two factors likely contribute to multichannel modulation sensitivity: multichannel loudness summation and the across-site variance in single-channel MDTs. In this study, single- and multi-channel MDTs were measured in 9 CI users at relatively low and high presentation levels and modulation frequencies. Single-channel MDTs were measured at widely spaced electrode locations, and these same channels were used for the multichannel stimuli. Multichannel MDTs were measured twice, with and without adjustment for multichannel loudness summation (i. e., at the same loudness as for the single-channel MDTs or louder). Results showed that the effect of presentation level and modulation frequency were similar for single- and multi-channel MDTs. Multichannel MDTs were significantly poorer than single-channel MDTs when the current levels of the multichannel stimuli were reduced to match the loudness of the single-channel stimuli. This suggests that, at equal loudness, single-channel measures may over-estimate CI users ’ multichannel modulation sensitivity. At equal loudness, there was no significant correlation between the amount of multichannel loudness summation and the deficit in multichannel MDTs, relative to the average single-channel MDT. With no loudness compensation, multichannel MDTs were significantly better than the best single-channel MDT. The across-site variance in single-channel MDTs varied substantially across subjects. However, the across-site varianc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A mixed-signal {{architecture}} for continuous-time multidimensional model-free optimization is presented. It {{is based}} on <b>multi-channel</b> coherent <b>modulation</b> and detection that reliably estimates the objective function’s gradient, {{with respect to the}} system parameters, in the presence of time delays. The narrowband nature of the excitation signals reduces the unknown dynamics of the objective function to a single parameter per control channel, the phase delay. An efficient implementation of the adaptive control architecture is presented; it incorporates parallel control channels with individually selectable 6 -level phase delay adjustment. Initial experimental results indicate wide operating range covering almost 7 decades of excitation frequencies. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} for bandwidth-hungry {{applications}} and increasing number of smart interconnected devices has increased the data traffic on radio access networks. Subsequently, the saturating spectral efficiencies in crowded radio frequency spectrum has impelled the researchers to exploit the optical spectrum for communications. In particular, many developments in the visible light communication (VLC) as a combined lighting and communications system have taken place. Despite abundant optical bandwidth, the data transmission rates and power efficiencies in VLC are partly limited by the electrical channel bandwidth {{and the type of}} signalling sets which can be used in this intensity modulated, direct detected system. In order to improve the power and spectral efficiencies, this thesis focuses on physical layer (PHY) techniques. The state-of-the-art single channel modulations (SCM) based on M-PAM, <b>multi-channel</b> <b>modulations</b> (MCM) based on OFDM, and IEEE standardised multi-colour modulations are investigated comprehensively through simulations and theoretical analysis, over representative VLC channels considering the optical properties of front-end devices. The bit error performances and spectral efficiencies of DC-biased and non DC-biased MCM systems are compared. A new vector coding based MCM is proposed to optimally utilise the channel state information at the transmitter as an alternative to optical OFDM. The throughputs, peak-to-average power ratios and DC-bias requirements of SCM and MCM systems are investigated which show that the lower DC-bias requirements reduce power consumed for the same throughput in SCM systems when compared to MCM systems. A new quad-chromatic colour shift keying (CSK) system is proposed which reduces power requirements and complexity, enhances throughput and realises a four-dimensional signalling to outperform the IEEE standardised tri-chromatic CSK system. For improved power efficiency and throughput of VLC PHY, use of rate-adaptive binary convolutional coding and Viterbi decoding is proposed along with frequency domain channel equalisation to mitigate temporal dispersion over representative VLC channels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ⎯ Evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) fuzzy {{models and}} the method for their on-line {{identification}} has been recently introduced {{as an effective}} tool for design of flexible system models with minimum a priori information. Their structure develops on-line {{during the process of}} model identification itself. In this paper, this approach has been extended for the case of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system model. Both parts of the identification algorithm, namely the unsupervised fuzzy rule-base antecedents learning by a recursive, non-iterative clustering, and the supervised linear sub-model parameters learning by Kalman-filtering-based procedure, are extended for the MIMO case. The radius of influence of each fuzzy rule is considered a vector instead of a scalar as in the original eTS approach, allowing different areas of the data space to be covered by each input variable. As in the eTS, in MIMO eTS, the rule-base and parameters of the fuzzy model continually evolve by adding new rules with more summarization power and by modifying existing rules and parameters. Simulation results using a well-known benchmark are considered in this paper. Further investigation concern the application of MIMO eTS to predictive modeling of the speech spectrum magnitude, classification of <b>multi-channel</b> source <b>modulation</b> etc. I...|$|R
40|$|Accurate pitch {{perception}} on {{the basis}} of fundamental frequency patterns is essential for the processing of lexical tones in tonal languages such as Cantonese. Speech intelligibility in Cantonese-speaking CI recipients was compared using current signal processing strategies, which typically result in poor pitch perception, and a new strategy, known as the <b>multi-channel</b> envelope <b>modulation</b> (MEM) strategy, was designed to enhance temporal periodicity cues to the fundamental frequency. Performance of nine postlingually hearing-impaired adult cochlear implant users was measured twice using each strategy, initially after a four week trial, and again after two weeks of use with each strategy. Speech intelligibility in speech-spectrum shaped noise was measured using the Cantonese hearing in noise test. A fixed noise level of 65 dB A was used and the signal-to-noise ratios were fixed at either + 10, + 15, or + 20 dB, depending on the baseline performance of individual subjects using the clinical processor. Self-reported benefit in 18 listening situations and overall preference for strategies were obtained at the end of these trial periods. Results showed poorer speech intelligibility with CIS while results obtained using ACE and MEM were comparable. Unfamiliar place coding might have contributed to poorer performance using CIS. Self-reported benefit across strategies did not differ in most listening situations. Participants preferred ACE for listening overall in daily situations, and a few preferred MEM in noise. Whilst the results did not demonstrate any advantages for speech recognition in noise when using MEM compared to ACE, no degradation in performance was observed. This implies that the form of processing employed by MEM retains similar segmental information to that provided by ACE and that potentially, future variations/optimizations of MEM may lead to some improvement in tone perception. © 2008 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Pitch ranking and tonal {{language}} {{perception was}} investigated with nine native Cantonese-speaking postlingually deaf adults who were {{users of the}} Nucleus CI 24 implant system. All subjects were experienced users of the Advanced Combinational Encoding (ACE) strategy. The subject’s use of three sound coding strategies was evaluated. Two of these were the ACE and the Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) strategy which are widely used in current clinical practice. The third was a novel experimental strategy termed <b>Multi-channel</b> Envelope <b>Modulation</b> (MEM) that was specifically designed to enhance F 0 periodicity cues in the stimulus envelope. All three strategies were implemented in an experimental body-worn research processor (SPEAR 3). A repeated ABC-ABC experimental design was adopted, in which each strategy was taken home by subjects and used {{for a period of}} 4 weeks (for each strategy) in the first stage of evaluation and then subsequently for a further 2 weeks in the second stage (providing a total of 6 weeks use with each strategy over a period of 18 weeks in total, excluding follow-up tests). Tonal language perception was measured using the Cantonese HINT (CHINT) sentence test (presented in speech-spectrum shaped noise) and a Cantonese tone minimal-pair identification test. Pitch perception through the processor/strategy was measured using a 3 -harmonic complex-tone pitch ranking test. There {{were no significant differences in}} perception scores for use of the MEM strategy as compared to ACE for the Cantonese speech perception tests. However, scores using the CIS strategy were significantly lower than either ACE or MEM strategies for the CHINT sentence test in noise. Results for the pitch ranking tests provided lower F 0 difference limens (DLs) for three of the subjects, comparable DLs for five of the subjects, and a poorer DL in one subject, when using the MEM strategy compared to the clinical strategies. Previous studies had demonstrated that enhancement of F 0 periodicity cues in the stimulus envelope can provide improvement to pitch perception, at least for pitch ranking of sung vowel stimuli. It may be that lack of experience and/or training in use of temporal periodicity cues exclusively for tone perception in tonal language may be important, and that this contributed to the findings of the current study. In addition, differences in central processing of pitch in music and language tasks may be partly responsible for these outcomes.

40|$|The {{capacity}} and reach of today's long-haul fiber optical communication systems {{is limited by}} amplifier noise and fiber nonlinearities. Conventional, phase-insensitive amplifiers (PIAs), have a quantum limited noise figure (NF) of 3 dB at high gain, meaning that with a shot-noise limited input signal the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is degraded by at least 3 dB. Phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSAs), have a quantum limited NF of 0 dB, meaning that a shot-noise limited input signal can be amplified without degrading the SNR. The capability of PSAs to provide noiseless amplification makes them interesting for transmission system applications. The objective of this thesis has been to experimentally realize transmission systems based on two-mode PSAs and explore their properties, both experimentally and numerically. We present the first demonstrations of <b>multi-channel</b> compatible and <b>modulation</b> format independent single-span and multi-span PSA-amplifield transmission systems. In addition to demonstrating a performance benefit due to reduced amplifier noise we also show that two-mode PSA-amplified transmission systems can mitigate distortions originating from fiber nonlinearities, such as selfphase modulation (SPM) and nonlinear phase noise (NLPN). In particular, we demonstrate PSA-amplified transmission of 10 GBd quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM) signals over 105 km single-span transmission systems showing significant performance improvements, in terms of sensitivity, compared to conventional PIA-amplified transmission systems. In the case of 16 QAM transmission the improved sensitivity allows for 12 dB larger span loss. We also demonstrate PSA-amplified multi-span transmission of a 10 GBd QPSK signal achieving a maximum reach of 3465 km, a threefold reach improvement compared to the maximum reach of 1050 km that was obtained using in-line PIAs at optimal launch power...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{spectrum}} management, {{in order}} to guarantee the coexistence of the various wireless services, assigns prescribed and fixed frequency bands to licensed users, or, primary users (PUs). Anyway these portions of spectrum {{are not at all}} time and in all locations used by PUs, as pointed out by measurements conducted by the Federal Communication Commission. This leads to an inefficient utilization of these bands, creating however an opportunity for unlicensed (secondary) users (SUs) that wish to transmit opportunistically over those bands. To this goal, Mitola, in 1999, proposed the concept of cognitive radio (CR), a device able to sense the environment, find the portions of spectrum temporarily left free by PUs and transmit over them. The proposed work copes with the resource allocation (RA) problem for the downlink of a cognitive secondary base station (SBS) which transmits to its secondary receivers over the licensed frequencies of the PUs, keeping the interference caused to the PUs below a certain threshold called interference temperature. In order to exploit these spectrum opportunities, a CR device needs a highly flexible physical layer, allowing it to adapt its transmission parameters (e. g. modulation order, coding size, power, etc.) to the network conditions. For these reasons, the considered SBS is a bit interleaved coded OFDMA (BIC-OFDMA) system. The <b>multi-channel</b> OFDM(A) <b>modulation</b> allows an efficient transmission over wireless selective channels and the BICM scheme offers a further robustness increase against the harsh propagation conditions of wireless channels. Recently, a huge number of works has been devoted to the problem of managing resources in underlay CR, exploiting different approaches, as for instance capacity maximization, subject to interference power constraints. The Shannon capacity, however, to be achievable, requires independent Gaussian inputs across parallel subchannels and perfect Shannon code knowledge. In practice, it results unfeasible and, for this reason, this work considers an objective function entailing practical modulation and coding schemes, as M-QAM modulation and turbo codes. Moreover the presence of the ARQ retransmission mechanism at the data link layer is taken into account {{in order to}} quantify the trade-off between data rate and link reliability. To this goal, a significant figure of metric has been detected in the offered layer 3 data rate, or goodput (GP) for short. Considering the scenario described above, the RA problem at the SBS results in finding how to jointly allocate bits and subcarriers to each secondary user in order to maximize the overall goodput realized by the system. Unfortunately, this problem has a NP-hard complexity. Thus, after a proper analysis of the goodput function, we tackled the RA problem resorting to the Ant Colony Optimization framework, which offers a valid set of tools to solve this kind of combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed algorithm, named max-sum goodput (MSG), is compared with other pragmatic algorithms bearing the same complexity and simulation results show how the MSG can remarkably boost GP performance...|$|R
