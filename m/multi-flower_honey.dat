50|$|Miel d'Alsace is a honey from France that is {{protected}} under EU law with PGI status, first published under relevant laws in 2005. The PGI status covers several varieties of honey produced in Alsace, namely silver fir honey, chestnut honey, acacia honey, lime honey, forest honey, and <b>multi-flower</b> <b>honey.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{based on}} solid phase extraction with a strongly acidic cation-exchanger Dowex 50 WÃ— 8 - 200 was proposed to pre-concentrate and determine ultra-traces of Li in different floral honeys. When loading 10 % (m/v) honey solutions onto columns packed with the cation-exchanger, Li+ ions were retained on the resin along with K+ and Na+, while simple sugars were passed through columns and were entirely found in effluents. In turn, columns were washed {{with water and}} eluted with a 1. 0 mol L- 1 HCl solution to strip Li+ that was subsequently determined in respective eluates by flame optical emission spectrometry (FOES). The proposed method was characterized by a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 05 ng g- 1 of Li and later used for analysis of several raw and commercial mono- and <b>multi-flower</b> <b>honeys.</b> It enabled to determine from 0. 4 to 5. 3 ng g- 1 of Li with precision being within 8 - 11 %. Accuracy of this sample pre-treatment procedure and analysis method was assessed applying spike recovery tests. Recoveries of added Li {{were found to be}} within 98 to 106 %, demonstrating trustworthiness of results achieved...|$|R
