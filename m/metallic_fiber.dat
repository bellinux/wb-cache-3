5000|$|Gold {{and silver}} {{have been used}} since ancient times as {{decoration}} in the clothing and textiles of kings, leaders, nobility and people of status. Many of these elegant textiles {{can be found in}} museums around the world. Historically, the metallic thread was constructed by wrapping a metal strip around a fiber core (cotton or silk), often {{in such a way as}} to reveal the color of the fiber core to enhance visual quality of the decoration. Ancient textiles and clothing woven from wholly or partly gold threads is sometimes referred to as cloth of gold. They have been woven on Byzantine looms from the 7th to 9th Centuries, and after that in Sicily, Cyprus, Lucca, and Venice. Weaving also flourished in the 12th Century during the legacy of Genghis Khan when art and trade flourished under Mongol rule in China and some Middle Eastern areas. The Dobeckmum Company produced the first modern <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber</b> in 1946.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{addition}} of fiber in a concrete mixture causes reduction of workability while increasing both viscosity and yield stress (Tattersall and Banfill 1983). It means FRC is still not suitable for on-site placement with a general ready-mix concrete system. Thus, for FRC, the fiber content should be balanced between mechanical properties and workability. The reinforcing fibers used to improve the performance of cementitious materials have different roles or performances depending on their aspect ratios (length-to-diameter ratio), materials, or shapes (straight, bent, or hooked). Especially, regarding the materials, the reinforcing fiber can be categorized into metallic and polymeric fibers (Balaguru and Shah 1992; Bentur and Mindess 2006). First, <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber,</b> mainly steel fiber, increases the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and toughness of the mixture. The <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber</b> itself has a high tensile strength and elastic modulus; thus, it increases tensile strength and elastic modulus until it is pulled out from the cement matrix. Since the <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber</b> has a higher tensile strength than cement matrix, the failure behavior of metallic FRC is mainly due to fiber pull-out or debonding, so there are various geometries designed to keep this from happening. Otherwise, generally, polymeric fiber has been known as a fiber with lower tensile strength and elastic modulus than <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber,</b> although some polymeric fibers has a higher tensile strength than some metallic fibers. Hence, the polymeric fiber cannot improve the mechanical properties of the mixture like the <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber</b> does; however, because of the advantage of good dispersion inside of fresh state cementitious materials, it helps control cracking of the concrete (Ferrara et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Wear {{resistance}} and Frictional stability are key performance requirements for brake lining. Automotive brake linings are usually made of various ingredients such as binder, filler, friction modifiers and reinforcement. Rockwool is a mineral fiber and steel fiber is a <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber.</b> In this work reinforcement fibers used are both the mineral and metallic fibers with six different composition prepared and tested. The result shows that metallic fibers should be high compared to mineral fiber for best frictional performance and wear resistance. Friction-wear {{properties of the}} reinforced samples were investigated on the cast iron disc as a counterpart using a pin on disc wear tester. The investigation confirmed that the sample with increase in steel fiber (4 %, 8 % and 12 %) improves the wear resistance. On the other hand specimen with high content of Rockwool fiber forms an improper ratio among the other ingredients. The SEM images of the sample indicated that an increase in steel fiber higher than 12 % content resulted in adhesive wear. Analysis of the experimental result shows that the sample with 12 % steel fiber and 8 % Rockwool fiber exhibited the optimum friction-wear behavior. Finally the effect of environment on the composites was investigated in water, salt water and oil...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} uses for <b>metallic</b> <b>fibers</b> is {{upholstery}} fabric and textiles such as lamé and brocade. Many people also use <b>metallic</b> <b>fibers</b> in weaving and needlepoint. Increasingly common today are <b>metallic</b> <b>fibers</b> in clothing, anything from party and evening wear to club clothing, cold weather and survival clothing, and everyday wear. Metallic yarns are woven, braided, and knit into many fashionable fabrics and trims. For additional variety, metallic yarns are twisted with other fibers such as wool, nylon, cotton, and synthetic blends to produce yarns which add novelty effects {{to the end}} cloth or trim. Stainless steel and other metal fibers are used in communication lines such as phone lines and cable television lines. Stainless steel fibers are also used in carpets. They are dispersed throughout the carpet with other fibers so they are not detected. The presence of the fibers helps to conduct electricity so that the static shock is reduced. These types of carpets are often used in computer-use areas where the chance of producing static is much greater. Other uses include tire cord, missile nose cones, work clothing such as protective suits, space suits, and cut resistant gloves for butchers and other people working near bladed or dangerous machinery.|$|R

40|$|The high {{reactivity}} between the fiber and matrix in silicon carbide/titanium aluminide MMCs {{leads to the}} formation of brittle reaction products at the fiber/matrix (F/M) interface. Also, the high thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the fiber and matrix leads to high tensile residual stresses at the F/M interface, and this can lead to premature cracking during cooldown. One solution to these problems is the use of a <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber</b> coating like Ta which acts as an F/M diffusion barrier and reacts with the matrix to form a beta stabilized compliant layer. A finite element micromechanics analysis was performed to study the effects of Ta and beta interphase layers on the thermal residual stresses during consolidation. A 5 -micron-thick beta layer reduced cool-down stresses by 8 percent compared to a 2 percent reduction computed for a Ta layer of the same thickness. Plastic yielding in the Ta was not effective in reducing cool-down stresses. Compliant alpha- 2 particles next to the stiffer gamma particles reduced stresses in the gamma particles by less than 2 percent. A simple closed form analysis was developed to calculate thermal residual stresses in a fiber/interphase/matrix system. A 2 -micron-thick Ag interphase layer was found to reduce residual stresses by about 11 percent...|$|E

40|$|Rigid <b>metallic</b> <b>fiber</b> {{structures}} {{made from}} a variety of different metals and alloys have been investigated mainly with regard to their functional properties such as heat transfer, pressure drop, or filtration characteristics. With the recent advent of aluminum and magnesium-based fiber structures, the application of such structures in light-weight crash absorbers has become conceivable. The present paper therefore elucidates the mechanical behavior of rigid sintered fiber structures under quasi-static and dynamic loading. Special attention is paid to the strongly anisotropic properties observed for different directions of loading in relation to the main fiber orientation. Basically, the structures show an orthotropic behavior; however, a finite thickness of the fiber slabs results in moderate deviations from a purely orthotropic behavior. The morphology of the tested specimens is examined by computed tomography, and experimental results for different directions of loading as well as different relative densities are presented. Numerical calculations were carried out using real structural data derived from the computed tomography data. Depending on the direction of loading, the fiber structures show a distinctively different deformation behavior both experimentally and numerically. Based on these results, the prevalent modes of deformation are discussed and a first comparison with an established polymer foam and an assessment of the applicability of aluminum fiber structures in crash protection devices is attempted...|$|E
