5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting <b>member</b> <b>state</b> or a national of a contracting <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E

The analysis shows {{significant differences in}} the exploitation of economies of scale among EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> In particular, old <b>member</b> <b>states</b> exhibit increasing returns to scale whereas most new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> show either constant or decreasing returns to scale. The differences among old and new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are also pronounced from a dynamic perspective: whereas the old <b>member</b> <b>states</b> improved their productivity in pork production through scale efficiency, its impact in new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> was rather negative...|$|R
