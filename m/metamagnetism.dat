50|$|A quantum {{critical}} endpoint {{arises when}} a nonzero temperature critical point is tuned to zero temperature. One {{of the best}} studied examples occurs in the layered ruthenate metal, Sr3Ru2O7 in a magnetic field. This material shows <b>metamagnetism</b> with a low-temperature first-order metamagnetic transition where the magnetization jumps when a magnetic field is applied within the directions of the layers. The first-order jump terminates in a critical endpoint at about 1 kelvin. By switching {{the direction of the}} magnetic field so that it points almost perpendicular to the layers, the critical endpoint is tuned to zero temperature at a field of about 8 teslas. The resulting quantum critical fluctuations dominate the physical properties of this material at nonzero temperatures and way from the critical field. The resistivity shows a non-Fermi liquid response, the effective mass of the electron grows and the magnetothermal expansion of the material is modified all in response to the quantum critical fluctuations.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a `disordered local moment' (DLM) first-principles electronic structure theory which demonstrates that tricritical <b>metamagnetism</b> can arise in an antiferromagnetic metal {{due to the}} dependence of local moment interactions on the magnetisation state. Itinerant electrons can therefore play a defining role in <b>metamagnetism</b> {{in the absence of}} large magnetic anisotropy. Our model is used to accurately predict the temperature dependence of the metamagnetic critical fields in CoMnSi-based alloys, explaining the sensitivity of <b>metamagnetism</b> to Mn-Mn separations and compositional variations found previously. We thus provide a finite-temperature framework for modelling and predicting new metamagnets of interest in applications such as magnetic cooling. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

Since there is no charge ordering sign in the present system, {{it can not be}} understood by using the phase separation model or the prior martensite/austenitic phase transition scenario. A theoretical electronic nematic order phase formation is evidenced to answer for the two consecutive metamagnetic transitions, which separate the nematic phase from the low-field (H 7. 0 T) isotropic phases.

40|$|Sr₃Ru₂O₇ is a quasi-two-dimensional {{metal and}} has a {{paramagnetic}} ground state that is heavily renormalised by electron-electron correlations and magnetic exchange interactions. Inextricably linked to this renormalisation is the <b>metamagnetism</b> of Sr₃Ru₂O₇ - a rapid rise in uniform magnetisation over a narrow range of applied magnetic field. Knowledge of the zero-field physics is essential to any description of the <b>metamagnetism.</b> Light may be shed on the enigmatic ground state of Sr₃Ru₂O₇ by doping the crystal lattice with foreign cations: this is {{the primary purpose of}} the original research referred to in this thesis, in which studies of some of the electronic properties of crystals of cation-doped Sr₃Ru₂O₇ are reported. Single crystals of Sr₃(Ru[subscript(1 -x) ]Ti[subscript(x) ]) ₂O₇ and Sr₃(Ru[subscript(1 -x) ]Cr[subscript(x) ]) ₂O₇ have been synthesised in an image furnace and some of the properties of these crystals have been measured. Evidence that indicates the emergence of a spin density wave as a function of Ti-doping in Sr₃(Ru[subscript(1 -x) ]Ti[subscript(x) ]) ₂O₇ is presented. Time-dependent magnetic irreversibility has been observed in samples of Sr₃(Ru[subscript(1 -x) ]Cr[subscript(x) ]) ₂O₇, thus hinting at the involvement of the RKKY mechanism in these materials. Regarding cation doping out of the conducting RuO₂ planes, samples of (Sr[subscript(1 -y) ]La[subscript(y) ]) ₃Ru₂O₇ have been grown and investigated. Both the Sommerfeld coefficient and the Fermi liquid A coefficient of (Sr[subscript(1 -y) ]La[subscript(y) ]) ₃Ru₂O₇ are found to decrease as a function of y (0 ≤ y ≤ 0. 02); these observations point towards a reduction in the thermodynamic mass of the Landau quasiparticles. Results from magnetoresistance and magnetisation measurements indicate that the <b>metamagnetism</b> of the (Sr[subscript(1 -y) ]La[subscript(y) ]) ₃Ru₂O₇ series probably cannot be explained by a rigid band-shift model. Also, some aspects of these data imply that the <b>metamagnetism</b> cannot be fully accounted for by a spin fluctuation extension to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of uniform magnetisation...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of La and Ca doped Sr 4 Ru 3 O 10, featuring a coexistence of interlayer ferromagnetism and intralayer <b>metamagnetism,</b> is presented. La doping readily changes magnetism between ferromagnetism and <b>metamagnetism</b> by tuning {{the density of}} states. It also results in different Curie temperatures for the c-axis and the basal plane, highlighting a rare spin-orbit coupling with the crystal field states. In contrast, Ca doping enhances the c-axis ferromagnetism and the magnetic anisotropy. La doping also induces a dimensional crossover in the interlayer transport whereas Ca doping exhibits a tunneling magnetoresistance and an extraordinary T 3 / 2 -dependence of the resisitivity. The drastic changes caused by the dilute doping demonstrate a rare borderline magnetism that is delicately linked to the interplay of the density of states and spin-orbit coupling.

40|$|Paramagnetic heavy-fermion {{compound}} CeRu_ 2 Si_ 2 shows {{a number}} of unusual magnetic properties due to the competition between the Kondo fluctuation and the antiferromagnetic correlation. One of the remarkable features at low temperature is the metamagnetic non-linear magnetization process. Although several models for the <b>metamagnetism</b> in CeRu_ 2 Si_ 2 have been proposed so far，full explanation of this phenomenon has not been established yet. However the experiments of high pressure: and substituting La，Y for Ce in CeRu_ 2 Si_ 2 show that this <b>metamagnetism</b> is strongly related to Kondo effect. In this paper， magnetic susceptibility， magnetization and specific heat measurements and μSR experiments have been performed on Ce(Ru_ 1 -x>T_x) _ 2 Si_ 2 (T = Rh(4 d^ 7 5 s^ 1) ，Mo(4 d^ 7 5 s^ 1) ，Pd (4 d^ 7 5 s^ 1)) in the Ru (4 d^ 7 5 s^ 1) rich region(O<_ _ -x<O. 5) with {{a special interest in}} the small T substitution effects on the Kondo effect，the antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation and the metamagnetic transition in CeRu_ 2 Si_ 2. The present study clearly demonstrates that the small T doping has a significant effect on the magnetic fluctuations in CeRu_ 2 Si_ 2 Then we obtain new information as follows. (1) The shift of Kondo temperature and metamagnetic transition field in this system was opposite to what is expected from the simple volume effect discussed about substitution for Ce site so far. This result suggests that c-f hybridization of the system is rather sensitive to the d-electron number. In these solid solutions，the change in the d-electron number is overwhelming the volume effect. (2) At low Rh and Pd concentration，a weak AF ordering appears respectively. The nature of the ordering seems to be， however， not so simple. First of all，the ordered moment is small. We consider that in the weak AF ordering state the local fluctuation still plays a role. Further μSR measurement indicates the existence of complicated magnetic ordering as SDW in Rh doped system. This point is in contrast with the La doped system where the AF long range order with rather localized character is observed. (3) For Rh doped system metamagnetic transition clearly exists in the AF ordered samples，where another transition is observed in field at H_C below the metamagnetic transition field H_M. This is interpreted as follow; the AF ordering is destroyed above H_C and the system further undergoes a metamagnetic transition at H_M. Coexistence of antiferrmagnetism and <b>metamagnetism</b> has not been reported yet. Thus，a study in further detail of this system is significant in order to make clear <b>metamagnetism.</b> 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E

The most intriguing result is discovery of a metamagnetic-like transition in both systems from magnetization measurements in a pulsed magnetic fields. This is the first observation of the <b>metamagnetism</b> for isomorphic Ce and Yb paramagnetic systems. Similar to other metamagnets, the metamagnetic transition fields for both compounds are well scaled by the temperature T_χ^ max, at which the magnetic susceptibility shows a maximum.
