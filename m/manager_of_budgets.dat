40|$|Purpose &# 8211; The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>budget</b> {{participation}} conflict (BPC) on job performance and the mediating effect of job satisfaction and job tenure on this relationship in a South Korean setting. BPC is defined as the difference between a manager’s actual budget participation and the same <b>manager’s</b> preferred level <b>of</b> <b>budget</b> participation. Design/methodology/approach &# 8211; Survey data, analyzed using path analysis, were used to measure the direct effect of BPC on performance, and the indirect effects between BPC and performance running through job satisfaction and job tenure. Findings &# 8211; Findings suggest that BPC does not directly impact job performance. Overall, this study suggests that BPC has a negative impact on job satisfaction and that job satisfaction in turn can significantly influence job performance. The authors also find some marginal effect of job satisfaction on job tenure, implying that increasing satisfaction can marginally increase job tenure. Research limitations/implications &# 8211; Limitations of this study are those usually found in cross-sectional survey research. Originality/value &# 8211; Despite its limitations, this study has both academic and practical implications. The study adds to the job performance literature in an Asian country which has not been widely researched. The study also finds that managers’ job performance and job satisfaction can be improved by minimizing BPC.

The {{presence of a}} number of possibly conflicting decision criteria, the large number of possible maintenance policies, and the reality <b>of</b> <b>budget</b> constraints often produce complex problems, where the underlying trade-offs are not apparent to the asset manager.
