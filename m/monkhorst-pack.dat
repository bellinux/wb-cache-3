The supercells are used to simulate the isolated sheet and the sheets are separated by larger than 12 Å to avoid interlayer interactions. The <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> scheme is used for sampling the Brillouin zone. In the calculations, the structures are fully relaxed with a mesh of 5 × 5 × 1, and the mesh of k space is increased to 7 × 7 × 1, in the static calculations. In the spin-polarized calculations, both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states are constructed for the initial magnetic structures of the H-BC [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{calculations}} {{were based}} on the spin density functional theory. We employed the projector augmented wave method implemented in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP-PAW)[22, 23]. The exchange-correlation potential used was the generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof[24] approach. The method has been previously used to study the structural and electronic properties of bulk rutile SnO 2 [25]. The valence electronic distributions for the PAWs representing the atoms were Sn 4 d 105 s 25 p 2, Fe 3 d 74 s 1, Co 3 d 74 s 2, and O 2 s 22 p 6. The onsite correction Hubbard U for Co- and Fe d orbitals was not considered. Previous calculations for Cr doping SnO 2 taking into account a U correction show no major changes in our conclusions. Scalar relativistic effects were taken into account. To describe the alloys, we used a 72 -atom supercell (24 Sn and 48 O atoms) and a 4 × 4 × 4 mesh of <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> k-points for integration in the Brillouin zone. All the calculations were done with a 490 -eV energy cutoff in the plane-wave expansions, and the systems were fully relaxed until the residual forces on the ions were less than 10 meV/Å.|$|E
30|$|The {{electronic}} band structures {{along with}} the density of states (DOS) of the compounds are calculated by density functional theory (DFT) {{using one of the}} three non-local gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functionals (generalized gradient approximation-Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization, GGA-PBE). Calculations were performed with the CASTEP code [25, 26], which uses a plane wave basis set for the valence electrons and norm-conserving pseudopotential [27] for the core electrons. The number of plane waves included in the basis was determined by a cutoff energy Ec of 500.0  eV. The summation over the Brillouin zone was carried out with a k-point sampling using a <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> grid [28] with parameters of 5 × 5 × 5 and 4 × 5 × 2 for Li 2 SiO 3 and Li 2 Si 2 O 5, respectively. Pseudoatomic calculations were performed for Li- 2 [*]s 2, Si- 3 s 23 p 2, O- 2 s 22 p 4. The parameters used in the calculations and convergence criteria were set by the default values of the CASTEP code, e.g., reciprocal space pseudo-potentials representations, eigen-energy convergence tolerance of 1 × 10 - 6  eV, Gaussian smearing scheme with the smearing width of 0.1  eV, and Fermi energy convergence tolerance of 1 × 10 - 7  eV.|$|E
30|$|As for the WF, the {{previous}} scanning probe-based studies {{had shown that}} the WF is measured as 4.6  eV, such as with graphite [35]. Generally, WFs {{in the range of}} 4.6 – 4.9  eV are acceptable [36, 37]. In addition, the WF was predicted by LDA [38] and GGA [39] as 4.48 and 4.49  eV, respectively. In comparison with the experiment date, the WF calculated by theory is slightly smaller. GGA has joined a non-local density gradient and its nonlocality is more suitable for processing the inhomogeneity of density, but LDA works better in a stacking system. Therefore, in the calculations of WF and electric property of graphene, GGA was chosen in this theoretical study. Furthermore, in this calculation, the vacuum distance is set as 15  Å so that the electrostatic interactions between two sides of a slab are negligible, and the electrostatic potential reaches its asymptotic value. The ultrasoft pseudopotential is used to describe the interaction between electrons and ions. Cutoff energy is at 340  eV, the Brillouin zone is sampled using a 9 [*]×[*] 9 [*]×[*] 1 <b>Monkhorst–Pack</b> k-point grid [40], and Methfessel–Paxton [41] smearing is at 0.05  eV. The convergence criterion of self-consistent field energy was 1.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  eV, and the MAX force is 0.03  eV/Å.|$|E
