25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the <b>monitoring</b> <b>committee</b> has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many monitoring committees receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{examine the}} {{association}} between the presence of <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> (i. e., audit, nomination, and remuneration) and market valuation in South Africa using a sample of 169 listed corporations from 2002 to 2007. Design/methodology/approach: We distinctively employ fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regressions to innovatively investigate {{the association between}} the presence of <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> and market valuation. Findings: We find a significant positive connection between the presence of <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> and market valuation, but only in corporations that have independent <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> and/or all three <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> that we have investigated simultaneously. This implies that the market values corporations with independent and/or the three <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> more highly. Our results provide empirical support for agency theory, which indicates {{that the presence of}} independent board committees increases the capacity of corporate boards to effectively advise, monitor and discipline top management, and thereby improving market valuation. Originality/value: There is an acute dearth of studies examining the connection between the presence of <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> and market valuation generally, but particularly in developing countries. Therefore, our evidence contributes to the literature by demonstrating how the presence of <b>monitoring</b> board <b>committees</b> affects market valuation in a major developing African country. Further, we distinctively employ a number of econometric models that adequately control for different types of endogeneity problems and market valuation proxies.

While large board size in combination with the existence of at least three committees enhances accounting performance and does not have any impact on market performance, the existence of a board dominated by independent directors with the presence of at least three committees seems to have only a negative impact on accounting performance.

25|$|The {{extraction}} of conjugated estrogens from the urine of pregnant mares {{led to the}} marketing in 1943 of the first HRT treatment, Premarin. From that time until 1975, estrogen was administered without supplemental progesterone or progestin. A study from Kaiser Permanente by Dr. Harry Ziel demonstrated that {{in the absence of}} progesterone, patients were at increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen therapy. After this, progestin was supplemented in women who had not received surgical hysterectomy, to reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. This was followed by the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in 2002. However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined Estrogen and Progesterone therapy was closed prematurely by its Data <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Committee</b> (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of the {{intensity}} of board monitoring on directors' effectiveness in performing their monitoring and advising duties. We find that monitoring quality improves when a majority of independent directors serve on {{at least two of the}} three principal <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees.</b> These firms exhibit greater sensitivity of CEO turnover to firm performance, lower excess executive compensation, and reduced earnings management. The improvement in monitoring quality comes at the significant cost of weaker strategic advising and greater managerial myopia.

Firm value results suggest that the negative advising effects outweigh the benefits of improved monitoring, especially when acquisitions or corporate innovation are significant value drivers or the firm's operations are complex.

40|$|Small group {{processes}} {{relevant to}} data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> in controlled clinical trials: {{an overview of}} reviews Anne E Walker, Sharon K McLeer and the DAMOCLES group 1 Background The quality of the decisions reached by data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees</b> (DMCs) is crucial. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify factors that may make errors more or less likely in small, task-oriented, decision-making expert groups and to consider the implications of these factors for data <b>monitoring</b> <b>committees.</b> Methods A systematic overview was carried out of reviews of empirical studies of small group processes and decision errors in small, task-oriented decision-making groups in laboratory or real-world settings, published between 1950 and 2002 (n = 57 included reviews). Results These reviews suggest that a number of factors may increase the likelihood that small groups will make poor and potentially erroneous decisions. The most important of these, in terms of empirical support, are: biased or overly directive leadership, expression of a limited range of opinions during group discussion, poor procedures for identifying or appraising the available information, and presentation of the available information in a way that is likely to result in biased perception of it. Conclusions The main implications for DMCs relate to membership, the role of the chairperson, the information provided for DMCs and training for DMC members. Selection methods that encourage a degree of diversity within the DMC are recommended. Chairs of DMCs should be experienced members, who have the skills to facilitate a discussion, can manage conflict effectively and can be impartial. Adherence to a prespecified analysis plan is recommended to reduce the risk of error associated with strong evidence or excess information. Training in the use of methodical decision-making procedures, education about the factors that influence decision quality and an opportunity to participate in mock DMC discussions may be of benefit for new members.
