5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, <b>methylphenidate</b> (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and <b>methylphenidate</b> are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, <b>methylphenidate,</b> Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and <b>methylphenidate</b> being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> is a {{commonly}} prescribed psychostimulant and works {{by increasing the}} activity of the central nervous system. It produces such effects as increasing or maintaining alertness, combating fatigue, and improving attention. The short-term benefits and cost effectiveness of <b>methylphenidate</b> are well established. <b>Methylphenidate</b> is not approved for children under six years of age. <b>Methylphenidate</b> may also be prescribed for off-label use in treatment-resistant cases of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.|$|E
25|$|Both {{amphetamine}} and <b>methylphenidate</b> {{are predominantly}} dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. <b>Methylphenidate</b> {{acts as a}} norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives, as <b>methylphenidate</b> is thought to increase neuronal firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate, but causes monoamine release by reversing {{the flow of the}} monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms. The difference in mechanism of action between <b>methylphenidate</b> and amphetamine results in <b>methylphenidate</b> inhibiting amphetamine's effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered.|$|E
25|$|The dextrorotary {{enantiomer}} of <b>methylphenidate,</b> {{known as}} dexmethylphenidate, is {{sold as a}} generic and under the brand names Focalin and Attenade in both an immediate-release and an extended-release form. In some circumstances it may be prescribed instead of <b>methylphenidate,</b> however it has no significant advantages over <b>methylphenidate</b> at equipotent dosages {{and so it is}} sometimes considered to be an example of an evergreened drug.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>methylphenidate</b> is a {{controlled}} 'Class B' substance. Possession without prescription carries a sentence up to 5 years or an unlimited fine, or both; supplying <b>methylphenidate</b> is 14 years or an unlimited fine, or both.|$|E
25|$|In India, <b>methylphenidate</b> is a {{schedule}} X drug and {{is controlled by}} the Drugs and Cosmetics Rule, 1945. It is dispensed only by physician's prescription. Legally, 2 grams of <b>methylphenidate</b> are classified as a small quantity, and 50 grams as a large or commercial quantity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> {{may be used}} in {{addition}} to an antidepressant for refractory major depressive disorder. It can also improve depression in several groups including stroke, cancer, and HIV-positive patients. However, the use of stimulants such as <b>methylphenidate</b> in cases of treatment-resistant depression is controversial. Stimulants may have fewer side-effects than tricyclic antidepressants in the elderly and medically ill. In individuals with terminal cancer, <b>methylphenidate</b> can be used to counteract opioid-induced somnolence, to increase the analgesic effects of opioids, to treat depression, and to improve cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the expectation, taking <b>methylphenidate</b> with a meal speeds absorption.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy, {{a chronic}} sleep {{disorder}} characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden need for sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. <b>Methylphenidate</b> is considered effective in increasing wakefulness, vigilance, and performance. <b>Methylphenidate</b> improves measures of somnolence on standardized tests, {{such as the}} Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy controls.|$|E
25|$|Long-term <b>methylphenidate</b> or {{amphetamine}} {{exposure in}} some species {{is known to}} produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage, but humans experience normal development and nerve growth. Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine or <b>methylphenidate</b> decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function of the right caudate nucleus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a sigma-1 receptor agonist in rats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> is {{available}} in numerous forms, a doctor will determine the appropriate formulation of the drug to prescribe based on the patient's history, the doctor's experiences treating other patients with <b>methylphenidate</b> products, and product pricing/availability. Currently available forms include a variety of tablets and capsules, an adhesive-based matrix transdermal system (transdermal patch), and an oral suspension (liquid syrup).|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> taken orally has a {{bioavailability}} of 11–52% with a {{duration of}} peak action around 2–4hours for instant release (i.e. Ritalin), 3–8hours for sustained release (i.e. Ritalin SR), and 8–12hours for extended release (i.e. Concerta). The half-life of <b>methylphenidate</b> is 2–3hours, depending on the individual. The peak plasma time is achieved at about 2hours.|$|E
25|$|Stimulants such as cocaine, {{amphetamine}} (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), methamphetamine (Desoxyn), methcathinone, and <b>methylphenidate</b> (Ritalin).|$|E
25|$|Internationally, <b>methylphenidate</b> is a Schedule II drug {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> {{may have}} benefit as a {{treatment}} of apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1944, and {{was identified as}} a stimulant in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Medical use {{began in}} 1960; the drug has become {{increasingly}} prescribed since the 1990s, when the diagnosis of ADHD became more widely accepted. Between 2007 and 2012, <b>methylphenidate</b> prescriptions increased by 50% in the United Kingdom and in 2013 global <b>methylphenidate</b> consumption increased to 2.4 billion doses, a 66% increase from the year before. The United States continues to {{account for more than}} 80% of global consumption.|$|E
25|$|In the US and the UK, it is {{approved}} {{for use in}} children and adolescents. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of <b>methylphenidate</b> in 2008 for use in treating adult ADHD. In the UK, while not licensed for use in adult ADHD, NICE guidelines suggest it be prescribed off-license for the condition. <b>Methylphenidate</b> has been approved for adult use {{in the treatment of}} narcolepsy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> is metabolized into ritalinic acid by CES1A1. Dextromethylphenidate is {{selectively}} metabolized at {{a slower}} rate than levomethylphenidate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> is {{sometimes}} used by students {{to enhance their}} mental abilities, improving their concentration and helping them to study.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethylphenidate is {{much more}} {{bioavailable}} than levomethylphenidate when administered orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of racemic <b>methylphenidate.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> {{and other}} stimulants {{are also used}} to improve {{vasoconstriction}} {{in the treatment of}} orthostatic intolerance (OI), a dysautonomic/autonomic nervous system (ANS) disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> can worsen {{psychosis}} in psychotic patients, and in {{very rare}} cases {{it has been}} associated with the emergence of new psychotic symptoms. It should be used with extreme caution in patients with bipolar disorder due to the potential induction of mania or hypomania. There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation, but evidence does not support a link. The long-term effects on mental health disorders in later life of chronic use of <b>methylphenidate</b> is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, <b>methylphenidate</b> is a 'class B2 {{controlled}} substance'. Unlawful possession is {{punishable by}} six-month prison sentence and distribution by a 14-year sentence.|$|E
25|$|Stimulant {{medications}} may be resold {{by patients}} as recreational drugs, and <b>methylphenidate</b> (Ritalin) {{is used as}} a study aid by some students without ADHD.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, <b>methylphenidate</b> is a List II {{controlled}} substance with recognized medical value. Possession {{without a prescription}} is punishable by {{up to three years}} in prison.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylphenidate</b> {{primarily}} {{acts as a}} norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is a benzylpiperidine and phenethylamine derivative {{which also}} shares part of its basic structure with catecholamines.|$|E
