40|$|Heavy metal amount {{typically}} is {{much bigger}} in coastal and lagoon sediment than into overlying water. Sediment {{can be considered}} as a temporary sink for pollutants; in fact, remobilisation processes are able to bring to diffusion of contaminants into water body trough bioturbation, concentration gradient or resuspension caused by flooding, tide or boat traffic, all process that could easily change their geochemical parameters (e. g. redox potential) and make them more bioavailable. A complex net of this kind of events is notable in the Venice Lagoon (Italy), where two heavy metal-source point (Porto Marghera industrial area and the Murano island, renowned for artistic glass production), a water basin with an intense inland navigation (due both to local traffic and to shipping through the three harbour mouths, connecting the Lagoon with sea) and fishing activities are really active. Specifically, trough a multidisciplinary approach, aim of this study has been to define and characterize both the best aquaculture lagoon sites and the <b>Mollusc</b> <b>Bivalves</b> population growing up into. Tapes philippinarum and T. decussatus particularly has shown an increased economic value, then environmental and social sustainability must be supported. Both ecotoxicological (e. g. heavy metal bioaccumulation and tissue partitioning, metallothionein induction, condition index, influence of geochemical texture) and molecular markers have been used in order to evaluate environmental quality of old and new aquaculture sites and to look for a <b>Mollusc</b> <b>Bivalves</b> sub-population identification...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of cadmium {{and lead}} were {{determined}} in nine different species of <b>mollusc</b> <b>bivalves</b> (Modiolus barbatus, Venus verrucosa, Scapharca inaequivalvis, Tapes decussatus, Callista chione, Pecten jacobeus, Ensis siliqua, Venus gallina, Cardium tubercolata) collected from different coastal areas of the Adriatic Sea (north, middle and south Adriatic). The levels of {{cadmium and lead}} found in bivalves from the north Adriatic Sea were significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than those detected in those from the middle and sough Adriatic Sea. In some species of molluscan bivalves (M. barbatus and T. decussatus) from the north Adriatic Sea, concentrations of cadmium and lead exceeded the maximum limit (2 mg/kg w. w.) established by the Italian legislation. Weekly intakes were estimated and compared with the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) recommended by the FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives...|$|E
40|$|We have {{different}} possibilities and tools {{to assess the}} impact of pollution on marine ecosystems. The ecotoxicological approaches are based on the use of biomonitors and biomarkers. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) as biomarkers in an edible species, Pinctada radiata (Mollusca, Bivalvia) associated with the environmental pollution(heavy metal, Cd, Pb, Ni) in the Persian gulf. Samples were collected seasonly from march 2012 till march 2013 at three station in the Persian gulf (Nakhilo, Hendorabi and lavan Islnad). <b>Mollusc</b> <b>bivalves</b> (Pinctada radiata) with the same shell length (40 - 50 mm) were collected from the sampling sites, transferred to the laboratory and dissected the same day. The mantle was dissected and samples were prepared for biomarker analyses and measuring the heavy metal in soft tissue. The enzyme concentration were determined by using standard methods. Biochemical data showed a no significant The results concluded from the amount of heavy metals in the sediment and soft tissue of pearl oyster(pinctada radiata) show no significant correlation with the level of catalase enzyme. The present study strongly suggests that monitoring programs should compare sites with similar physicochemical characteristics when using...|$|E

40|$|Dreissena polymorpha' (Pallas 1771) and 'Dreissena bugensis' (Andrusov, 1897) are {{two species}} of {{invasive}} <b>mollusc</b> <b>bivalves</b> native to the Ponto-Caspian region. They are regarded {{as some of the}} most dangerous invasive species in terms of risk of arrival, establishment and detrimental ecological effects. The extent of the species' invasion is largely unprecedented with all continents except Antarctica affected. The United Kingdom has been invaded 'D. polymorpha' which was first recorded in 1824 at the Surrey docks in London and 'D. bugensis' thought to have invaded more recently. Since their arrival the species have placed an immense strain on freshwater ecosystems resulting in significant economic and ecological damage. Species assignment and identification has been a contentious matter with many conflicting reports. Over the last 25 years more focus has been placed on molecular methods of identification as opposed to traditional methods relying heavily on morphological characteristics. Despite extensive work on populations in mainland Europe and North America there no detailed studies on the molecular identification or variation of 'Dreissena' int he UK. Molecular data generated from several sites across London have indicated that that morphological identification of these organisms is largely inaccurate. By using a combination of markers the mitochondrial COI and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed region it has been possible to accurately identify 'D. polymorpha' and 'D. bugensis'. Using this approach has not only allowed improved resolution in mussel identification but has also identified the first putative hybrids between 'D. polymorpha' as well as 'D. bugensis', further complicating their taxonomy. The accurate identification of both species allowed for analysis of population genetic structure with local populations; a task not yet undertaken...|$|E

50|$|The statocyst is {{a balance}} sensory {{receptor}} present in some aquatic invertebrates, including <b>molluscs,</b> <b>bivalves,</b> cnidarians, ctenophorans, echinoderms, cephalopods, and crustaceans. A similar structure {{is also found}} in Xenoturbella. The statocyst consists of a sac-like structure containing a mineralised mass (statolith) and numerous innervated sensory hairs (setae). The statolith's inertia causes it to push against the setae when the animal accelerates. Deflection of setae by the statolith in response to gravity activates neurons, providing feedback to the animal on change in orientation and allowing balance to be maintained.|$|R

50|$|The {{yellow eel}} is {{essentially}} a nocturnal benthic omnivore. Prey includes fishes, <b>molluscs,</b> <b>bivalves,</b> crustaceans, insect larvae, surface-dwelling insects, worms, frogs and plants. The eel prefers small prey animals which can easily be attacked. Food type varies with body size. Stomachs of eels less than 40 cm and captured in streams contained mainly aquatic insect larvae, whereas larger eels fed predominantly on fishes and crayfishes. Insect abundance decreased in larger eels. The eel diet adapts to seasonal changes and the immediate environment. Feeding activity decreases or stops during the winter, and food intake ceases as eels physiologically prepare for the spawning migration.|$|R
