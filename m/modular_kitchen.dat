5000|$|In 1930, Zwart was {{employed}} by the Bruynzeel Company. First he designed their annual calendars and other commercial items. He helped with {{other areas of the}} company, too. He was the first to design a kitchen for mass production. Zwart {{is best known for his}} design of the Bruynzeel <b>modular</b> <b>kitchen</b> in 1937, which is still available today. The design reflects graphic organization and it is considered mass-production. The design was highly-progressive for its time. Zwart's Bruynzeel <b>Modular</b> <b>Kitchen</b> was exhibited in Germany-Netherlands: Interactions 1920-1940 at the Haags Gemeentemuseum. This was an example of a 'rational kitchen.' ...|$|E

25|$|Knock-down {{fasteners}} are {{a hardware}} device {{made for the}} purpose of constructing butt joints that can be assembled and re-assembled repeatedly (hence knock-down). This type of fastener is very popular in flat-pack furniture, which is typified by items such as book cases and wall units that come in a package of pre-cut and pre-drilled components ready to assemble by a novice. They are also very common in modern <b>modular</b> <b>kitchens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The company {{successfully}} introduced several <b>modular</b> <b>kitchen</b> designs {{into the}} marketplace during the 1960s and 1970s, working {{with a variety of}} European designers as Lucci & Orlandini, Carlo Bartoli, Ettore Sottsass e Associati, Roberto Pamio, Enzo Berti. In 1987, Arclinea partnered with Italian architect Antonio Citterio, that designed and coordinated various kitchen models.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, {{when the}} {{production}} had {{expanded to include}} floors and kitchens {{and the threat of}} World War II was causing a decline in the building industry, he considered alternatives and pioneered the development of new timber materials for the production of the Bruynzeel kitchen and for boat construction. Using a newly developed water-resistant synthetic resin glue, Bruynzeel developed a durable three-ply wood, similar to plywood, for the fabrication of external doors. Bruynzeel went on to extend the concept of the <b>modular</b> <b>kitchen</b> and with E.G. van de Stadt developed the first industrialised boat construction system in the world.|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{management}} requires traditional tools for vendor selection (VS) and evaluation (VE) {{to be modified}} to foster customer-supplier collaboration and coordination. In this way {{it is possible to}} reduce information asymmetries and opportunistic behaviours of counterparts in supply networks. The aim of this paper is (1) to describe an integrated tool for VS and VE that overcomes the limits of the traditional tools in supply networks, (2) to give {{a detailed description of the}} implementation of such a tool and (3) to explain how the use of this tool can improve customerssuppliers relationships. These issues are discussed through the analysis of a successful case of a Italian company leader in the <b>modular</b> <b>kitchen</b> industry and its supplier network, who implemented a balanced and transparent web-base platform for vendor selection and evaluation...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{face the}} topic of {{physical}} distribution and logistics management in the business industry of <b>modular</b> <b>kitchens</b> studying {{the case of the}} Febal group, an Italian important brand at national and European level. The paper analyzes the firm’s critical aspects of the physical distribution system, highlighting a policy of answering to the market referable to the Assemble To Order (ATO) logic even if there are some elements of the manufacturing planning system which make the case particularly interesting. The proposed solution is articulated in a series of useful algorithms for a future implementation of an ICT solution for the management and the automatic allocation of the orders to the transport carriers and for the communication to the customer of the product’s delivery date. Finally the integration of the ICT solution with complementary companies inside the ECOSELL project is presented...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} {{questions}} of physical distribution and logistics management in the business industry of <b>modular</b> <b>kitchens</b> by studying {{the case of the}} Febal Group, an important brand name at the Italian and European level. More specifically, this work highlights the firm’s critical aspects of the physical distribution system and analyses its importance {{in the context of a}} manufacturing planning system that responds to the market using an Assemble To Order (ATO) logic; however there are certain specific features of this case that are particularly interesting. The article focuses on the development of a scenario with a new logic for managing areas that involve transport carriers. A series of algorithms are proposed which could be useful for future implementation of an ICT (Information and Communication Technology) tool for managing and automatically assigning orders to transport carriers and for informing customers of the product’s delivery date. Finally the integration of the solution proposed with a wider ICT toolset developed within the framework of an European project named ECOSELL is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Among stove {{developers}} and implementers {{it has now}} become common knowledge {{that it is possible}} to reduce the amount of fuel, emissions, indoor air pollutants and greenhouse gases produced by traditional cookstoves through introducing improved cookstoves. However, improved cookstove effectiveness has not yet translated into an increase in the health and wellbeing of cookstove users. For this reason, the Kitchen 2. 0 team set out to investigate an alternative approach to solving the global health impacts of poor indoor air quality due to the use of biomass as cookstove fuel: ventilation. To better understand the role ventilation plays in kitchens with fires and cookstoves, a three-pronged approach was used, including global community surveys, a full-scale physical model, and a computational model. Field agents affiliated with Michigan Technological University helped complete surveys on cooking habits and structures worldwide. Physical testing was conducted in the Kitchen 2. 0 <b>modular</b> <b>kitchen</b> by running cooking tests with different kitchen structure configurations and stoves. The computational model was developed to simplify the testing of cooking scenarios. Ventilatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a framework to support cost transparency implementation. Though cost transparency is a well-known practice in supply chain management literature, {{there is a lack of}} guidelines supporting managers to effectively implement it. The study has been developed using empirical findings from an action research, the authors conducted in close collaboration with an Italian manufacturer of modular kitchens and 19 suppliers. This research discusses a methodology to support (1) the selection of those customer-supplier relationships worth being developed into cost transparency, and (2) the identification, for each of these relationships, of appropriate forms of actions/incentives to stimulate suppliers to share cost information. The key outcome lies in the theoretical framework emerging from on-field empirical evidences supporting managers in cost transparency implementation. The proposed model fills some gaps found in supply chain literature and explicitly addresses an unusual variable to be considered in the suppliers' selection phase: the buyer's interest. From a managerial point of view our model provides a framework buying companies use to select and classify the subset of suppliers willing and worth being engaged in cost transparency initiatives, and to identify appropriate actions to implement cost transparency. The findings of a single action research cannot be generalized to the overall population of manufacturing entities. Large sample data collection efforts will be needed to test the proposed findings and make our prescriptions more robust. Additionally, the proposed model could be tested in other industries outside the <b>modular</b> <b>kitchen</b> industry...|$|E
50|$|Started in Liverpool in 1925 to make Hoosier cabinets, it {{was bought}} by new investors in 1938, who after the war built <b>modular</b> <b>kitchens</b> for the new British post-war {{temporary}} prefab houses. With the introduction of design concepts based on the Frankfurt kitchen and new materials such as formica, Hygena became the dominant brand in kitchens from the 1960s through the 1970s. But mass manufacture and a change in styles meant that it ended up as an economy brand in the UK, bought out in the 1987 by the MFI Group. MFI sold the mainland European rights to the brand to Nobia in 2006, who on MFI's bankruptcy two years later also bought the global brand rights. However, the UK and Irish rights were bought by the Home Retail Group in 2009. Nobia sold the international rights to the brand to Groupe Fournier in 2015, who replaced it with its own SoCoo'c brand over the next 18 months. In 2016, the Home Retail Group was purchased by the UK retailer Sainsbury's, including the UK and Irish rights and the sole use of the Hygena brand.|$|R

40|$|Though Open Book Accounting (OBA) is a {{well-known}} practice in supply chain management, the lack of guidelines to support managers to implement it effectively has been highlighted in the literature. This paper discusses a methodology to support the selection of suppliers with whom to successfully cooperate in OBA projects and the identification, for each buyersupplier dyad, of appropriate incentives to enable cost data disclosure. The methodology has been developed using empirical findings from an action research the authors have conducted in close collaboration with an Italian manufacturer of <b>modular</b> <b>kitchens</b> and 19 of its suppliers. It emerges that the sourcing strategy {{and the nature of}} cost data disclosed should drive the buyers decisions on how to use disclosed account data and how to select the most appropriate set of incentives to encourage suppliers participation. In particular, the sourcing strategy mainly affects the suppliers reaction to incentives and the uses of cost data shared, while the nature of open books agreements primarily influences the buyers attitude to commit resources to specific suppliers and, therefore, to activate the more costly incentives. These findings have interesting implications for the identification of the suppliers with whom to collaborate in open books programs, for the selection of incentives to mitigate suppliers natural reluctance to disclose cost data, and for restrictions in the use of disclosed data to ensure that they are not abused within and outside the relation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} empirically the criticalities of a production system constrained by distribution, in order to propose a model capable of integrating production and distribution planning for a simultaneous improvement in terms of efficiency and efficacy. Design/methodology/approach – Starting from an overview of previous works about integrated analysis of a production-distribution system, an exploratory case study in the Italian industry of <b>modular</b> <b>kitchens</b> has been used, with multiple levels of analysis and multiple data collection methods. Findings – Three solutions for a better integration of production-distribution systems are proposed; the solutions are characterized by increasing levels of benefits and complexity. The article focuses on {{the implementation of the}} less complex scenario, called “overlapping of selling areas”, proposing a series of algorithms used for the implementation of a software prototype. Research limitations/implications – The case study has been chosen because it is representative of the assemble to delivery logic, where production is pulled and constrained by distribution, but it may not necessarily reflect all the firm’s experiences in the furniture market. Practical implications – The software prototype, developed {{on the basis of the}} proposed algorithms, allows a firm with production planning severely constrained by the distribution process to achieve better performance in terms of level of accomplishment in the delivery date promised and reduction of the lead time of delivery. Originality/value – This paper proposes effective solutions for customer order-driven-production constrained by the distribution process, also offering practical help for managing and automatically assigning orders to transport carriers and for informing customers of the product’s delivery date...|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, Hygena had {{established}} {{itself as the}} leader in the fitted kitchen market, making itself vulnerable to attack from others, and changes in style. While the clean lines of its 1950s designs were popular post-War, the late 1970s saw {{the return of the}} bespoke country kitchen styles to the kitchen, which were unsuited to Hygena's design style and manufacture methods. In an attempt to survive, Standen considered diversifying: Marshall produced <b>modular</b> designs for <b>kitchens,</b> bedroom furniture and garden sheds, but his designs were regarded as too 'futuristic', and Norcros looked to dissolve the company and sell the Hygena name. Sold by a private investor (who now has investments in Ebuyer and its sister company Wren Kitchens) in 1987 to the MFI Group for £200 million, it sat alongside MFI other well known household brands as the economy choice.|$|R
