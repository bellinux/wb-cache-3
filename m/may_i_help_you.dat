60|$|But that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to {{understand}} the character of your great-grandfather, I shall give an incident which shows how fervent and real were the emotions which prompted the violent moods which I have described. I was about twelve at the time, my brothers Hosea and Ephraim were respectively nine and seven, while little Ruth could scarce {{have been more than}} four. It chanced that a few days before a wandering preacher of the Independents had put up at our house, and his religious ministrations had left my father moody and excitable. One night I had gone to bed as usual, and was sound asleep with my two brothers beside me, when we were roused and ordered to come downstairs. Huddling on our clothes we followed him into the kitchen, where my mother was sitting pale and scared with Ruth upon her knee.|$|R

In general, all banks are beautiful things, and will reward work better than large landscapes. If {{you live in a}} lowland country, you must look for places where the ground is broken to the river's edges, with decayed posts, or roots of trees; or, if by great good luck there should be such things within your reach, for remnants of stone quays or steps, mossy mill-dams, etc. Nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful bits of broken bank at its sides; better in form and color than high chalk cliffs. In woods, one or two trunks, with the flowery ground below, are at once the richest and easiest kind of study: a not very thick trunk, say nine inches or a foot in diameter, with ivy running up it sparingly, is an easy, and always a rewarding subject.|$|R

[34], emotion can be understood more widely as a manipulation of the range of interaction affordances available to each counterpart in a conversation.

In their study, the representation of the user state was defined [...] "only in terms of dialogue act or expected user intent". They found that emotional information can be useful to improve the dialogue strategies and predict system errors, but it was not employed in their system to adapt dialogue management.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{whenever}} the princess commanded the prince's attendance, Dil-aram, {{of all the}} girls, paid him attention and waited on him best.

6000|$|After a short period, Lady Roehampton saw Adriana, and {{not very}} long after, Lady Montfort. They both of them, from that time, were her frequent, if not constant, companions, but she saw no one else. Once only, since the terrible event, was she seen by the world, {{and that was when}} a tall figure, {{shrouded}} in the darkest attire, attended as chief mourner at the burial of her lord in Westminster Abbey. She remained permanently in London, not only because she had no country house, but because she wished to be with her brother. As time advanced, she frequently saw Mr. Sidney Wilton, who, being chief executor of the will, and charged with all her affairs, had necessarily much on which to consult her. One of the greatest difficulties was to provide her with a suitable residence, for of course, she was not to remain in the family mansion in St. James' Square. That difficulty was ultimately overcome in a manner highly interesting to her feelings. Her father's mansion in Hill Street, where she had passed her prosperous and gorgeous childhood, was in the market, and she was most desirous to occupy it. [...] "It will seem like a great step towards the restoration," [...] she said to Endymion. [...] "My plans are, that you should give up the Albany, and that we should live together. I should like to live together in Hill Street; I should like to see our nursery once more. The past then will be a dream, or at least all the past that is disagreeable. My fortune is yours; as we are twins, it is likely that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> live as long as you do. But I wish you to be the master of the house, and in time receive your friends in a manner becoming your position.

40|$|Large margin {{classifiers}} such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Adaboost {{are obvious}} choices for natural language document or call routing. However, how to combine several binary classifiers {{to optimize the}} whole routing process and how this process scales when it involves many different decisions (or classes) is a complex problem that has only received partial answers [1, 2]. We propose a global optimization process based on an optimal channel communication model that allows a combination of possibly heterogeneous binary classifiers. As in Markov modeling, computational feasibility is achieved through simplifications and independence assumptions {{that are easy to}} interpret.

40|$|Spoken dialog systems aim to {{interpret}} meanings of users’ utterances {{and respond to}} them accordingly. The users ’ utterances are first recognized by an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) and the intents of the users are extracted by the spoken language understanding (SLU) unit. Both ASR and SLU are noisy and in general their noise statistics are not correlated. Our goal is to exploit the signal-noise information and ASR lattice-based and semantic confidence scores for SLU error prediction and prevention of these by rejecting erroneous utterances, or asking confirmation questions. In our experiments, we have shown up to 80 % relative decrease in the error rate of the accepted utterances collected using the AT&T How <b>May</b> <b>I</b> <b>Help</b> <b>You</b> Spoken Dialog System used for customer care. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} language modeling word {{prediction is}} based on the local context (e. g. n-gram). In spoken dialog, lan-guage statistics are affected by the multidimensional structure of the human-machine interaction. In this paper we investi-gate the statistical dependencies of users ’ responses with re-spect to the system’s and user’s channel. The system chan-nel components are the prompts ’ text, dialogue history, di-alogue state. The user channel components are the Auto-matic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcriptions, the seman-tic classifier output and the sentence length. We describe an algorithm for language model rescoring using users ’ re-sponse classification. The user’s response is first mapped into a multidimensional state and the state specific language model is applied for ASR rescoring.

40|$|A natural {{language}} spoken dialog system includes a large vocabulary {{automatic speech recognition}} (ASR) engine, whose output is used as the input of a spoken language understanding component. Two challenges in such a framework are that the ASR component {{is far from being}} perfect and the users can say the same thing in very different ways. So, {{it is very important to}} be tolerant to recognition errors and some amount of orthographic variability. In this paper, we present our work on developing new methods and investigating various ways of robust recognition and understanding of an utterance. To this end, we exploit word-level confusion networks (sausages), obtained from ASR word graphs (lattices) instead of the ASR 1 -best hypothesis.

We train a problematic dialogue classifier using automaticallyobtainable features that can identify problematic dialogues significantly better (23 %) than the base- line.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of voice-based user interface technology will enable easy-to-use automation of new and existing communication services. A critical issue is {{to move away from}} highly-structured menus to a more natural human-machine paradigm. In recent years, we have developed algorithms which learn to extract meaning from fluent speech via automatic acquisition and exploitation of salient words, phrases and grammar fragments from a corpus. These methods have been previously applied to the ’How <b>may</b> <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>you?</b> ’ task for automated operator services, in English, Spanish and Japanese. In this paper, we report on a new application of these language acquisition methods to a more complex customer care task.

Experimental results on call-type classification will be reported for this new corpus of 10 K utterances from live customer traffic. 1...|$|E
