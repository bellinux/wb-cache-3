40|$|Self-emulsifying drug {{delivery}} system offers a solution to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly aqueous soluble drugs. Etoricoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is a selective cycooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitor. The poor aqueous solubility of etoricoxib results variable dissolution rate, which is the major cause of poor bioavailability. In the current study, formulation of solid self-emulsifying systems for the dissolution enhancement of etoricoxib was attempted. The self-emulsifying tablet of etoricoxib containing goat fat and Tween 60 admixture was formulated by pour moulding technique using a plastic <b>mould.</b> The <b>weight</b> uniformity, drug content, liquefaction time, and in vitro dissolution in simulated gastric fluid of the formulated tablets were evaluated. There was increase in in vitro drug release with increase in Tween 60 content and decrease in goat fat content. The etoricoxib release in simulated gastric fluid followed the non-Fickian diffusion model (anomalous behaviour) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} nanocomposites {{consisting}} of a polyamide 6 (PA 6) and polypropylene (PP) matrix (70 : 30) with a maleated polyethylene-octene elastomer (POEgMAH) and organophilic modified montmorillonite (MMT) were prepared by melt compounding in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder followed by injection <b>moulding.</b> The <b>weight</b> fraction of organoclay was adjusted from 2 - 10 wt% by increments of 2 wt% and the weight fraction of POEgMAH was fixed at 10 wt%. POEgMAH {{was used as an}} impact modifier as well as compatibiliser in the nanocomposites. Mechanical properties of the blends were investigated by tensile, flexural and impact testing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterise the nanocomposites. The thermal properties were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Addition of 4 wt% organoclay showed the highest tensile and flexural strengths for the blends. The Young's and flexural moduli were also improved with increasing the organoclay concentration but with a corresponding reduction in impact strength and elongation at break. XRD result revealed that the organoclay was dispersed uniformly (exfoliated) although the degree of exfoliation decreased with increasing organoclay content. The DSC analysis showed that the crystallinity of the blends decreased with increasing organoclay concentration. It was shown from the TGA analysis that the thermal stability of the PA 6 /PP nanocomposites was significantly improved in the presence of impermeable silicate layers in the blends...|$|R
5000|$|The Bofinger Chair, {{also named}} BA 1171, was {{designed}} by architect and designer Helmut Bätzner in 1964. In close co-operation with Bofinger company, situated in Ilsfeld in Baden-Württemberg/Germany, under owner and managing director Rudolf Baresel-Bofinger, the Bofinger stacking chair was developed into the first one-piece plastic chair worldwide in fibreglass- reinforced polyester to be mass-produced in one single pressing process over a steel mould. [...] The material was dyed all way through before being processed and available {{in a range of}} colours including white, yellow, black, red, blue, green, brown and orange. In a long trial series the characteristic shape of the chair was found in regard to seating shape, maximum stability by smallest quantity of material used, required elasticity, stacking capability, and industrial mass-production. The pressing process in the heated steel <b>mould</b> with a <b>weight</b> of approximately 11 tons lasted under five minutes and required as finishing treatment only simple scraping round the edges to remove excess polyester.|$|R
40|$|Since many decades, {{microcellular}} foamed {{materials have}} been produced basically to reduce {{the density of the}} materials in order to get lightweight parts. Meanwhile, {{it is well known that}} microcellular foaming by injection moulding offers many more advantages compared to compact injection moulding. Those are, e. g. lower shrinkage and warpage, shorter cycle times, lower clamp forces, reduced viscosity but improved properties of the foamed material in contrast to the compact material. These arguments are all known, but to improve the properties of the material, it is necessary to understand the interrelationship between the morphology and the mechanical properties. Furthermore, it is important to know how the processing parameters influence the morphology and the properties of the produced part. By understanding the relation between processing parameters and the consequential properties, it has become possible to create microcellular foamed parts with exactly defined properties. Through the variation of different processing parameters such as blowing agent concentration, injection velocity, mass temperature, <b>mould</b> temperature, <b>weight</b> reduction and different moulding processes like gas counter pressure injection moulded test, samples were produced to characterise the morphology and the mechanical properties. The experiments were performed with a polycarbonate type from Bayer MaterialScience. The cell size, thickness of the skin layer and distance between the cells were correlated to the processing parameters by means of nonlinear regression equations. Based on these equation, 3 D graphs were created by variation of two parameters by fixing the remaining parameters to illustrate the relationships. Furthermore, the relation between the morphology and the mechanical properties was correlated, which makes it possible to produce parts through injection moulding with a well-defined Young’s modulus or flexural strength...|$|R
50|$|The site of Százhalombatta is 200 m by 100 m in area. It is {{estimated}} that up to {{two thirds of the}} original area was destroyed during clay extraction by a local brick factory and by erosion from the River Danube.The Bronze Age settlement was built on a bluff with valleys to north and south, the River Danube to the east and it was fortified with a ditch to the west, a feature common to other Vatya tells. It was strategically positioned {{at the end of the}} Benta valley, potentially controlling access to other sites including smaller settlements within the valley. It overlooks a long stretch of the River Danube and may have been involved in river-borne trade and communication.The settlement was first occupied at the end of the Early Bronze Age (the transition from the classic Nagyrév (Szigetszentmiklós) to the late Nagyrév (Kulcs). It was continuously inhabited through the Middle Bronze Age Vatya and Vatya-Koszider period. This was followed by a hiatus in occupation until the Urnfield phase of the Late Bronze Age from which there are only a few traces. Occupation layers at the site are up to 6 m deep. Finds from the site include pottery, daub, plaster, metalwork, <b>moulds,</b> loom <b>weights,</b> bone tools, antler objects, ground stone, lithics, amber, animal and occasional human bones. Many of the Bronze Age houses were burnt. This has resulted in outstanding preservation of organic material including botanical remains such as thatch from house roofs and Bronze Age food like crabapples, peas, beans and lentils. There is also worked wood and basketry. Thin section soil micromorphology, phytoliths, charcoal and coprolites add to the data from the site.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the effects of packaging (MAP) and preservation conditions on the packaged fresh walnut kernel quality. The central composite plan was used for evaluating the effect of oxygen (0 – 10 %), carbon dioxide (0 - 10 %), and temperature (4 - 26 °C) on qualitative characteristics of walnut kernels. Also, the response level technique was used to find the optimal conditions for interactive effects of factors, as well as estimating the best conditions of process using least amount of testing. Measured qualitative parameters were: peroxide index, color, decreased <b>weight,</b> <b>mould</b> and yeast counting test, and sensory evaluation. The {{results showed that the}} defined model for peroxide index, color, weight loss, and sensory evaluation is significant (p < 0. 001), so that increase of temperature causes the peroxide value, color variation, and weight loss to increase and it reduces the overall acceptability of walnut kernels. An increase in oxygen percentage caused the color variation level and peroxide value to increase and resulted in lower overall acceptability of the walnuts. An increase in CO 2 percentage caused the peroxide value to decrease, but did not significantly affect other indices (p ≥ 0. 05). Mould and yeast were not found in any samples. Optimal packaging conditions to achieve maximum quality of walnuts include: 1. 46 % oxygen, 10 % carbon dioxide, and temperature of 4 °C...|$|R
40|$|In {{foundries}} a lot {{of effort}} is done to minimize energy consumption in the production to reduce costs and hence increase the competitiveness. At the same time the foundries must live up to the increased demands for high quality castings. Traditional gating systems are known for a straight tapered down runner, a well base and 90 ?bends in the runner system. Previous work has shown that the traditional way of designing gating systems creates high inconsistency in fl ow patterns during fi lling. In the streamlined gating systems there are no sharp changes in direction and a large effort is done to confi ne and control the fl ow of the molten metal during mould fi lling. The main objective in the work presented here is to use the principles of the streamlined gating systems to reduce the weight of the gating system relative to the traditional layouts. By reducing the weight of gating system and thereby improving yield, the amount of molten iron needed is also reduced, hence reducing the energy consumption for melting. Experiments in real production lines have proven {{that it is possible to}} achieve a reduction in the poured weight by using the streamlined gating systems. In a layout for casting of three valve housings in a vertically parted <b>mould</b> the <b>weight</b> of the gating system was reduced by 1. 1 kg changing from the traditional layouts to the streamlined gating systems. This weight reduction corresponds in this case to a 20 % weight reduction for the gating system. Using streamlined gating systems with fan gates to give a benefi cial heat distribution in the castings may be an effi cient tool to eliminate the need for heat treatment. In the experiments the change in gating system from the traditional layout to the streamlined layout removed the need for heat treatment. This obviously means a huge energy saving in the foundry. The energy consumption for heat treatment of iron has been found to be 0. 489 kWh/kg. The valve housing in the experiments weighs 3 kg so when the need for heat treatment is removed, around 1. 5 kWh is saved per casting. Along with the reduction in energy used the foundry also save the cost of handling the castings for the heat treatment and the production times is reduced considerably. When the moulds for the vertical layout is produced on a DISAMATIC that produces 350 moulds an hour the total energy saved per hour for both melting and heat treatment becomes 2, 000 kWh and per eight hour work day 16, 000 kWh. Seen in this perspective the potential for saving energy in the foundries is substantial. Furthermore the experiments where ductile iron valve housings was cast also proved that it is possible to lower the pouring temperature from 1, 400 篊 to 1, 300 篊 without the risk of cold runs. This is possible due to a high flow rate during mould fi lling in combination with low velocities due to the use of fan gates. All of this has also been investigated in experiments using glass plate fronted moulds...|$|R
