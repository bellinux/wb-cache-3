Some people—to further the realism of their homemade simulator—buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine.

50|$|If {{the least}} {{significant}} bit of the first octet of an address is set to 0 (zero), the frame is meant to reach only one receiving NIC. This type of transmission is called unicast. A unicast frame is transmitted to all nodes within the collision domain, which typically ends at the nearest network switch or router. A switch will forward a unicast frame through all of its ports (except for the port that originated the frame) if the switch has no knowledge of which port leads to that MAC address, or just to the proper port if it does have knowledge. Only the node with the <b>matching</b> <b>hardware</b> MAC address will accept the frame; network frames with non-matching MAC-addresses are ignored, unless the device is in promiscuous mode.|$|E

40|$|A high {{fidelity}} simulation using a PC based Trick framework {{has been developed}} for Johnson Space Center's Morpheus test bed flight vehicle. There is an iterative development loop of refining and testing the hardware, refining the software, comparing the software simulation to hardware performance and adjusting either or both the hardware and the simulation to extract the best performance from the hardware {{as well as the}} most realistic representation of the hardware from the software. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based technique has been developed that increases speed and accuracy of the iterative development cycle. Parameters in software can be automatically tuned to make the simulation match real world subsystem data from test flights. Special considerations for scale, linearity, discontinuities, can be all but ignored with this technique, allowing fast turnaround both for simulation tune up to <b>match</b> <b>hardware</b> changes as well as during the test and validation phase to help identify hardware issues. Software models with insufficient control authority to <b>match</b> <b>hardware</b> test data can be immediately identified and using this technique requires very little to no specialized knowledge of optimization, freeing model developers to concentrate on spacecraft engineering.

40|$|Abstract. Pattern {{matching}} is one {{of critical}} parts of Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). Pattern <b>matching</b> <b>hardware</b> for NIPS should find a matching pattern at wire speed. However, that alone is not good enough. First, pattern <b>matching</b> <b>hardware</b> {{should be able to}} generate sufficient pattern match information including the pattern index number and the location of the match found at wire speed. Second, it should support pattern grouping to reduce unnecessary pattern matches. Third, it should show constant worst-case performance even if the number of patterns is increased. Finally it should be able to update patterns in a few minutes or seconds without stopping its operations. We modify Shift-OR hardware accelerator and propose a system architectures to meet the above requirement. Using Xilinx FPGA simulation, we show the new system scaled well to achieve a high speed over 10 Gbps and satisfies all of the above requirements. ...|$|E

The created Verilog HDL source is embed in an FPGA using the design tool provided by the FPGA vendor. Since the hardware embedded in the FPGA is designed for a particular template, it is an instance-specific hardware that allows us to achieve extreme acceleration.

The proposed FCAM employs cache to accelerate the root state and non-root state with the multiple characters matching, and applies the fuzzy decision to improve the cache performance.

40|$|The {{assumption}} of maximum parallelism {{support for the}} successful realization of scalable quantum computers has led to homogeneous, ``sea-of-qubits'' architectures. The resulting architectures overcome the primary challenges of reliability and scalability {{at the cost of}} physically unacceptable system area. We find that by exploiting the natural serialization at both the application and the physical microarchitecture level of a quantum computer, we can reduce the area requirement while improving performance. In particular we present a scalable quantum architecture design that employs specialization of the system into memory and computational regions, each individually optimized to <b>match</b> <b>hardware</b> support to the available parallelism. Through careful application and system analysis, we find that our new architecture can yield up to a factor of thirteen savings in area due to specialization. In addition, by providing a memory hierarchy design for quantum computers, we can increase time performance by a factor of eight. This result brings us closer to the realization of a quantum processor that can solve meaningful problems.

40|$|AbstractSince 1988, TCC of PMIVSD {{became an}} {{alternative}} treatment for anatomically suitable patients with {{high risk of}} surgical closure. TCC is less invasive but the optimal timing and technique have not developed much {{in the last four}} decades. The dismal prognosis at the contemporary sight should not be discouraged. The rapid innovation in TAVI is an example. The learning curve slopes down to the line of inertia in inaction. Some innovations have slept for centuries but their potential needs to be celebrated. The published experience of TCC of PMIVSD across the globe is limited as they are based on consensus. The experience related to clinical practice has heterogeneous topography around the globe because of the morbid pathology. The increasing number of onsite cardiothoracic wings, better imaging tools, LVADS, and ECMO, along with improvement in well <b>matching</b> <b>hardware</b> to the pathology of PMIVSD, build incremental confidence.

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} and demonstrate {{the implementation of}} attractor neural network dynamics in analog VLSI chips [1]. The on-chip network is composed of an excitatory and an inhibitory population of recurrently connected linear integrate-and-fire neurons. Besides from the recurrent input these two populations receive external input {{in the form of}} spike trains from an Address-Event-Representation (AER) based system. External AER input stimulates the attractor network and provides also an adequate background activity for the on-chip populations. We use the mean-field approximation of a model attractor neural network to identify regions of parameter space allowing for attractor states, <b>matching</b> <b>hardware</b> constraints. Consistency between theoretical predictions and the observed collective behaviour of the network on chip is checked using the ‘effective transfer function ’ (ETF) [2]. We demonstrate that the silicon network can support two equilibrium states of sustained firing activity that are attractors of the dynamics, and that external stimulation can provoke a transition from the lower to the higher state.

40|$|Rule mining is the {{practice}} of discovering interesting and unexpected rules from large data sets. Depending on the exact problem formulation, {{this may be a}} very complicated problem. Existing methods typically make strong simplifying assumptions about the form of the rules, and limit the measure of rule quality to simple properties, such as confidence. Because confidence in itself is not a good indicator of how interesting a rule is to the user, the mined rules are typically sorted according to some secondary interestingness measure. In this paper we present a rule mining method that is based on genetic programming. Because we use specialized pattern <b>matching</b> <b>hardware</b> to evaluate each rule, our method supports a very wide range of rule formats, and can use any reasonable fitness measure. We develop a fitness measure that is well-suited for our method, and give empirical results of applying the method to synthetic and real-world data sets...|$|E
