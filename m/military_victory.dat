5|$|Although the <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> of the absolutist city {{authorities}} was complete, the war {{had also}} shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} Louis XIV.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of the city Japanese {{soldiers}} massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of looting and rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre. Though Japan's <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> excited and emboldened them, the subsequent massacre tarnished their reputation {{in the eyes of}} the world. Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years.|$|E

After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a <b>military</b> <b>victory.</b>|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the credit}} {{was given to}} Augustus for each {{subsequent}} Roman <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> after this time, {{because the majority of}} Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major <b>military</b> <b>victory.</b> This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19BC. (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes.) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through <b>military</b> <b>victory,</b> Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E

5|$|After the Morea {{military}} expedition, the Greeks {{only had}} to face the Turkish troops in Central Greece. Livadeia, gateway to Boeotia, was conquered at the beginning of November 1828. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. In April, Naupaktos was restored to the Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi. However, it took the <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.|$|E
5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} <b>military</b> <b>victory,</b> with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.|$|E

5|$|It was Voivode Basarab I (c. 1310–1352) {{who broke}} {{off with the}} Kingdom of Hungary and {{refused to accept the}} king's suzerainty. Basarab I {{received}} international support and the recognition of the autonomy of Wallachia due to his great <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> over King Charles I of Hungary (1301–1342) at Posada on November 12, 1330. The Metropolitan See of Wallachia, directly subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, was set up during the reign of Basarab I's son, Nicolae Alexandru (1352–1364). The first silver and bronze coins were minted in Wallachia in 1365.|$|E
5|$|President Smetona {{received}} memoranda {{from nine}} nationalistic organizations urging {{the government to}} reject the ultimatum. However, a decisive comment was made by General Stasys Raštikis, {{the commander of the}} Lithuanian army: He testified that a <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> over Poland was impossible and argued for a peaceful resolution. The government's decision was confirmed by the Fourth Seimas with minimal discussion. On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as a show of good faith.|$|E

Roosevelt's goals – <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> in both Europe and Asia, the {{achievement}} of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, {{and the creation of}} a world peace organization – were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total <b>military</b> <b>victory,</b> they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{started on}} 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and {{reportedly}} coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought {{the fall of}} the capital on 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first <b>military</b> <b>victory</b> and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
