50|$|Talarurus was {{described}} by Malejev as having had five fingers on the hand and four toes on the foot. However, a four-toed foot was not found in articulation; the <b>mounted</b> <b>foot</b> is a composite and three is the more likely number as all other known ankylosaurids show three toes; earlier reports that Pinacosaurus also possessed four are incorrect. Another presumed diagnostic characteristics: that the osteoderms had a furrowed ornamentation, making for a specially formidable armour, with each plate adorned with additional pleated spines, was also based on a misunderstanding. These were segments of the halfrings protecting the neck, with their typical low keels. The mount has the further peculiarity that it shows Talarurus as built like a hippopotamus, with a barrel-shaped thorax, not with the characteristic ankylosaurid low and wide body type. This was caused by an incorrect positioning of the ribs {{as if they were}} appending instead of sticking out sideways; this mistake also prevented a mounting of the wide upper pelvic elements.|$|E

5000|$|Perrie {{made her}} acting debut as Mrs Casper in the 1969 film Kes. Although {{she had no}} formal acting training, she had a natural quality which she brought to the screen and her {{performance}} in the award-winning film received positive reviews from the critics. As recently as 2011, one critic wrote: [...] "Lynne Perrie is outstanding as Mrs. Casper, infusing her steely exterior with real vulnerability and pathos.Perrie's role in the film, which achieved international acclaim, ultimately led to her getting the part of Ivy Tilsley (later Brennan) in the soap opera, Coronation Street. The show's casting director Paul Bernard had seen her in Kes and cast her without audition. She first appeared in 1971 as a minor character, but the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance to offer her a more substantial role from the mid-1970s, when the character was joined by her family and moved into a house on Coronation Street. The character became infamous for interfering, and was known for her acid tongue. As a result, Ivy Tilsley was nicknamed 'Poison Ivy' by the media.During the early 1970s, whilst still only a semi-regular on Coronation Street, Perrie was always available to take up other acting work. She appeared in early episodes of several popular television shows such as the children's serials Follyfoot and The Intruder, in which she starred as Mavis the hairdresser, the long-running courtroom drama series Crown Court, and the sitcom The Cuckoo Waltz.Perrie's first regular television role was in the popular Yorkshire TV comedy series Queenie's Castle (1970-1972), written by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. The sitcom starred Diana Dors, with Perrie in second female lead playing her arch-enemy Mrs. Petty, the busy-bodying residents' association secretary with conservative values. Queenie's Castle was first broadcast on bonfire night in 1970 and ran for two years. eighteen episodes were made, with Perrie appearing in nine of them.She also appeared in two television plays written by Colin Welland, of whom had also appeared in Kes. The first, 1970's Slattery's <b>Mounted</b> <b>Foot</b> saw her playing a pub regular, and in 1974, she starred as the pivotal role of a militant union leader in the BBC Play For Today factory drama Leeds United. Upon Perrie's death, the film's director Roy Battersby praised her work and wrote in an obituary letter to The Guardian newspaper: [...] "The bravura of the performance by Lynne Perrie was, and remains, glorious.|$|E

The project focuses on improving the design of the <b>mounting</b> <b>feet</b> for the current Boundary Layer Data System at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Dr. Russ Westphal, the project’s sponsor, wishes that our team focus primarily on a reliable and lightweight mount design for a curved wing, with only transverse curvature.
