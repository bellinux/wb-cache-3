40|$|ABSTRACT: Dextran hydrolysis-mediated {{conversion}} of polyethylene glycol (PEG) -dextran (DEX) aqueous two-phase system droplets {{to a single}} phase was used to directly visualize Dextranase activity. DEX droplets were formed either by manual <b>micropipetting</b> or within a continuous PEG phase by computer controlled actuation of an orifice connecting rounded channels formed by backside diffused light lithography. The time required for the two-phase to one-phase transition was dependent on the Dextranase concentration, pH of the medium, and temperature. The apparent Michaelis constants for Dextranase were estimated based on previously reported catalytic constants, the binodal polymer concentration curves for PEG-DEX phase transition for each temperature, and pH condition. The combination of a microfluidic droplet system and phase transition observation provides a new method for label-free direct measurement of enzyme activity.

40|$|Background : Pasteur pipets as {{generally}} used pipets {{on conventional}} EDTA addition certainly result in significant difference of platelet count than vacutainer EDTA. This {{is caused by}} the overdose of EDTA that spuriously increases the platelet count. One of the way in reducing the possibility in making mistake with still using the conventional EDTA is the use of pipets which drop volume correctly as needed. <b>Micropipet</b> is a solution.

The use of AC fields as an input signal enables the magnitude and phase angle of membrane impedance to be measured at various frequencies.

Previous experiments investigating ciliary-mediated cellular mechanosensation have used either fluid flow chambers or <b>micropipetting</b> to elicit a biological response. The interpretation of these experiments in terms of the “ciliary hypothesis” has been difficult due the spatially distributed nature of the mechanical disturbance—several competing hypotheses regarding possible roles of primary cilium, glycocalyx, microvilli, cell junctions, and actin cytoskeleton exist. I report initial data using optical tweezers to manipulate individual primary cilia in an attempt to elicit a mechanotransduction response—specifically, the release of intracellular calcium. The advantage of using laser tweezers over previous work is that the applied disturbance is highly localized. I find that stimulation of a primary cilium elicits a response, while stimulation of the apical surface membrane does not. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the primary cilium mediates transduction of mechanical strain into a biochemical response in renal epithelia...|$|E

The initiation rate of new bends at the base is directly governed by the frequency of the vibration and changes immediately to the new frequency. The length and the propagation velocity of the developed bends become adjusted to the new conditions within approximately 1 beat cycle, whereas the bend angles take more than 4 beat cycles to attain their new steady-state value.

In SMCM, a moveable <b>micropipet</b> probe (diameter 300 nm to 1 mu m) containing an electroactive species in electrolyte solution {{is brought to}} a sample electrode surface so that the liquid meniscus makes contact. The <b>micropipet</b> contains a reference-counter electrode, and the sample is connected as the working electrode to make a two-electrode voltammetric measurement.

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of pseudopods and lamellae after ligation of chemoattractant sensitive G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{is essential for}} chemotaxis. Here, pseudopod extension was stimulated with chemoattractant delivered from a <b>micropipet.</b> The chemoattractant diffusion and convection mass transport were considered, and it is shown that when the delivery of chemoattractant was limited by diffusion {{there was a strong}} chemoattractant gradient along the cell surface. The diffusion-limited delivery of chemoattractant from a <b>micropipet</b> allowed for maintaining an almost constant chemoattractant concentration at the leading edge of single pseudopods during their growth. In these conditions, the rate of pseudopod extension was dependent on the concentration of chemoattractant in the pipet delivering chemoattractant. The pseudopod extension induced using <b>micropipets</b> was oscillatory even {{in the presence of a}} constant delivery of chemoattractant. This oscillatory pseudopod extension was controlled by activated RhoA and its downstream effector kinase ROCK and was abolished after the inhibition of RhoA activation with Clostridium botulinium C 3 exoenzyme (C 3) or the blocking of ROCK activation with Y- 27632. The ability of the <b>micropipet</b> assay to establish a well-defined chemoattractant distribution around the activated cell over a wide range of molecular weights of the used chemoattractants allowed for comparison of the effect of chemoattractant stimulation on the dynamics of pseudopod growth. Pseudopod growth was stimulated using N-formylated peptide (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)), platelet activating factor (PAF), leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4), C 5 a anaphylotoxin (C 5 a), and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), which represent the typical ligands for G-protein coupled chemotactic receptors. The dependence of the rate of pseudopod extension on the concentration of these chemoattractants and their equimolar mixture was measured and shown to be similar for all chemoattractants. The inhibition of the activity of phosphoinositide- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) with wortmannin showed that 72 %– 80 % of the rate of pseudopod extension induced with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, platelet activating factor, and leukotriene B 4 was phosphoinositide- 3 kinase-dependent, in contrast to 55 % of the rate of pseudopod extension induced with interleukin- 8. The dependence of the rate of pseudopod extension on the concentration of individual chemoattractants and their equimolar mixture suggests that there is a common rate-limiting mechanism for the polymerization of cytoskeletal F-actin in the pseudopod region induced by G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors...|$|R

The transcriptomes included at least 18, 000 unique transcripts, about 25 % of which had antisense transcripts. In silico anther-minus-pollen subtraction produced transcripts largely unique to the tapetum; these transcripts include all the reported tapetum-specific transcripts of orthologs in other species. The differential developmental profiles of the transcripts and their antisense transcripts signify extensive regulation of gene expression in the anther, especially the tapetum, during development. The transcriptomes were used to dissect two major cell/biochemical functions of the tapetum.

Such an injection {{of more than}} 104 molecules per cell failed to induce any antiviral state when challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). These findings are discussed {{in relation to the}} possible role of internalization in the mechanism of antiviral action of interferon. © 1983. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a biol. probe at the nanoscale with a magnetic carbon nanotube (mCNT) tip that {{has the ability to}} transfer fluids. Fabrication is performed by injection of mCNTs into <b>micropipets,</b> which are then positioned as probe tips via magnetophoresis, and affixed with polymeric adhesive. In this letter the authors discuss the magnetic fabrication process and demonstrate the versatility of this probe...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} electrochemical imaging methods {{provide opportunities}} to study localized phenomena on electrode surfaces. Here, we review {{recent advances in}} scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to study materials involved in (electrocatalytic) energy-related applications. In particular, we discuss SECM as a powerful screening technique and also advances in novel techniques based on micro- and nanopipets, such as the scanning <b>micropipet</b> contact method and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy and their use in energy-related research...|$|R
40|$|Expression of {{fibroblast}} {{growth factors}} and their receptors in rat glomeruli. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, {{and are also}} important regulators of extracellular matrix. They {{are among the most}} potent angiogenic factors known. Evidence suggests the FGFs play a role in glomerular development and pathology. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether FGF- 1 (acidic FGF) and FGF- 2 (basic FGF) and their receptors (FGFRs) were expressed in normal adult rat glomeruli, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. For RT-PCR studies, the kidneys of 200 g female Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with buffer and glomeruli isolated using conventional sieving techniques followed by <b>micropipetting.</b> FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 were expressed in cortex and in glomeruli. All seven receptor isoforms assayed (FGFR 1, 2 and 3 IIIb and IIIc splice variants, and FGFR 4) were expressed in whole cortex. However, only the IIIc variants and FGFR 4 were expressed in glomeruli. The relative levels of glomerular expression of these isoforms were determined using a semiquantitative RT-PCR assay using primers designed against three transmembrane regions: FGFR 1 (100 %); FGFR 2 (0. 1 %); and FGFR 4 (6 %). Immunohistochemistry revealed specific immunostaining for all four FGFRs within glomeruli. The differential expression pattern of FGFR isoforms between glomeruli and whole cortex, and the mutually exclusive nature of the expression of IIIc but not IIIb isoforms within glomeruli, indicates that FGFR expression and thereby FGF activity is tightly regulated in glomeruli. These findings have important implications for the roles of the FGFs in glomerular health and disease...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we report {{the results of}} RS {{measurements}} on some common military explosives {{and some of the}} most common explosives precursors deposited on clothing fabrics, both synthetic and natural, such as polyester, leather and denim cotton at concentration comparable to those obtained from a single fingerprint. RS Spectra were obtained using an integrated portable Raman system equipped with an optical microscope, focusing the light of a solid state GaAlAs laser emitting at 785 nm. A maximum exposure time of 10 s was used, focusing the beam in a 45 m diameter spot on the sample. The substances were deposited starting from commercial solutions with a <b>Micropipetting</b> Nano-Plotter, ideal for generating high-quality spots by non-contact dispensing of sub-nanoliter volumes of liquids, in order to simulate a homogeneous stain on the fabric surface. Images acquired with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope provided further details of the deposition process showing single parti cles of micrometric volume trapped or deposited on the underlying tissues. The spectral features of each substance was clearly identified and discriminated from those belonging to the substrate fabric or from the surrounding fluorescence. Our results show that the application of RS using a microscope-based apparatus can provide interpretable Raman spectra in a fast, in-situ analysis, directly from explosive particles of some m 3 as the ones that it could be found in a single fingerprint, despite the contribution of the substrate, leaving the sample completely unaltered for further, more specific and propaedeutic laboratory analysis. The same approach can be envisaged for the detection of other illicit substances like drugs...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidic devices allow assays to be {{performed}} using minute amounts of sample and have recently been used to control the microenvironment of cells. Microfluidics is commonly associated with closed microchannels which limit their use to samples that can be introduced, and cultured {{in the case of}} cells, within a confined volume. On the other hand, <b>micropipetting</b> system have been used to locally perfuse cells and surfaces, notably using push-pull setups where one pipette acts as source and the other one as sink, but the confinement of the flow is difficult in three dimensions. Furthermore, pipettes are fragile and difficult to position and hence are used in static configuration only. The microfluidic probe (MFP) circumvents the constraints imposed by the construction of closed microfluidic channels and instead of enclosing the sample into the microfluidic system, the microfluidic flow can be directly delivered onto the sample, and scanned across the sample, using the MFP.. The injection and aspiration openings are located within a few tens of micrometers of one another so that a microjet injected into the gap is confined by the hydrodynamic forces of the surrounding liquid and entirely aspirated back into the other opening. The microjet can be flushed across the substrate surface and provides a precise tool for localized deposition/delivery of reagents which can be used over large areas by scanning the probe across the surface. In this video we present the microfluidic probe (MFP). We explain in detail how to assemble the MFP, mount it atop an inverted microscope, and align it relative to the substrate surface, and finally show how to use it to process a substrate surface immersed in a buffer...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel micropipet-assisted technique {{for the construction}} of complex, surface-immobilized two-dimensional microscopic networks of unilamellar phospholipid bilayer vesicles (1 - 50 pm in diameter, 10 (- 15) - 10 (- 12) L) interconnected by lipid nanotubes (100 - 300 nm in diameter). As starting material {{for the construction of}} networks, we used twinned vesicle pairs, one of which is multilamellar and functions as a membrane donor and the other unilamellar and functions as a membrane acceptor upon manipulation. By electromechanical insertion of a pipet tip into the unilamellar vesicle followed by lateral pulling of the <b>micropipet</b> away from the vesicle, a nanotube was formed. Buffer solution contained in the pipet was then injected into the nanotube orifice, forming a vesicle of controlled size that was immobilized on the surface. The networks have controlled connectivity and are well-defined with regard to the container size, angle between nanotube extensions, and nanotube length. The internal fluid composition of individual vesicles is defined during the formation of a network by selection of the solution contained in the <b>micropipet...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{procedure is}} demonstrated {{which can be}} used to determine the interfacial free energy density for red cell membrane adhesion and membrane elastic properties. The experiment involves <b>micropipet</b> aspiration of a flaccid red blood cell and manipulation of the cell proximal to a surface where adhesion occurs. A minimum free energy method is developed to model the equilibrium contour of unsupported membrane regions and to evaluate the partial derivatives of the total free energy, which correspond to the <b>micropipet</b> suction force and the interfacial free energy density of adhesion. It is shown that the bending elasticity of the red cell membrane does not contribute significantly to the pressure required to aspirate a flaccid red cell. Based on experimental evidence, the upper bound for the bending or curvature elastic modulus of the red cell membranes is 10 - 12 ergs (dyn-cm). Analysis of the adhesion experiment shows that interfacial free energy densities for red cell adhesion can be measured from a lower limit of 10 - 4 ergs/cm 2 to an upper limit established by the membrane tension for lysis of 5 - 10 ergs/cm 2...|$|R
50|$|Varieties of SECM {{employing}} the <b>micropipet</b> tip geometry {{have been used}} to generate spatially resolved microcrystals of a solid solution. Here, glass microcapillaries with sub-micron sized orifices replace the standard UME allowing femtoliter-sized droplets to be suspended from the capillary over a conductive surface acting as the working electrode. Upon contact with the positively biased surface, the droplets of salt solutions achieve supersaturation and crystallize with well-defined, microscale geometries. Such technology could lend itself well to solid-state electrochemical sensors on microdevices.|$|R
