Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E

5|$|These {{stations}} are connected by the Dronning Maud Land Air Network Project (DROMLAN), {{which is a}} cooperative agreement for transportation between eleven nations with research stations in East Antarctica. Long-range aircraft fly between Cape Town, South Africa and either the Troll Airfield, located at the Troll research station, or the runway at the Novolazarevskaya Station. From these two main airfields, smaller aircraft <b>may</b> <b>fly</b> further to other Antarctic destinations.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds <b>may</b> <b>fly</b> by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E

5|$|According to protocol, {{the flag}} <b>may</b> <b>fly</b> from sunrise until sunset; {{businesses}} and schools {{are permitted to}} fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and {{the flag of the}} guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be at the same height and of equal size. When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the Hinomaru and other prefectural flags.|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They <b>may</b> <b>fly</b> over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
