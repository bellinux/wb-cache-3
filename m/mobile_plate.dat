40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{design of}} {{parallel}} kinematic machines goes through two fundamental stages. The first one concerns the structural synthesis. It enables, a priori, {{to determine the}} choice of families of the most adapted architectures according to the desired applications such as flight simulators, machine-tools, medical applications, etc. This {{can be done by}} applying several techniques such as: screw theory, Lie groups, graph theory, finite element method, etc. The second one concerns the dimensional synthesis and aims to determine the dimensions of the architecture that has been selected during the structural synthesis. This stage remains a major task because the criteria of performance of a given architecture are strongly dependent on its sizing. In this paper, we present a dimensioning methodology of the architectural parameters of the 6 -dof UPS (U: universal joint, P: prismatic joint, and S: ball-and-socket joint) parallel manipulators (the positions of the attachment points of the actuators on the base and <b>mobile</b> <b>plate</b> as well as the radius of the base and the <b>mobile</b> <b>plate).</b> The problem will be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP) by taking into account simultaneously several criteria of performance such as the workspace, kinetostatic performances, stiffness, and dynamic dexterity.

The earth is distinguished by its distinct, <b>mobile</b> <b>plates,</b> which are recycled into the mantle and show large-scale lateral movements, whereas the moon, Mars, and Mercury are single spherical shells, showing no evidence of destruction and renewal of the lithospheric plates over the latter 80 % of their history.

40|$|We {{investigate}} fluid mediated effective {{interactions in}} a confined film geometry, between two rigid, no-slip plates, {{where one of}} the plates is mobile and subjected to a random external forcing with zero average. The fluid is assumed to be compressible and viscous, and the external surface forcing to be of small amplitude, thus enabling a linear hydrodynamic analysis. While the transverse and longitudinal hydrodynamic stresses (forces per unit area) acting on either of the plates vanish on average, they exhibit significant fluctuations that can be quantified through their equal-time, two-point correlators. For transverse (shear) stresses, the same-plate correlators on both the fixed and the mobile plates, and also the cross-plate correlator, exhibit decaying power-law behaviors as functions of the inter-plate separation with universal exponents: At small separations, the exponents are given by - 1 in all cases, while at large separations the exponents are found to be larger, differing in magnitude, viz., - 2 (for the same-plate correlator on the fixed plate), - 4 (for the excess same-plate correlator on the <b>mobile</b> <b>plate)</b> and - 3 (for the cross-plate correlator). For longitudinal (compressional) stresses, we find much weaker power-law decays with exponents - 3 / 2 (for the excess same-plate correlator on the <b>mobile</b> <b>plate)</b> and - 1 (for the cross-plate correlator) in the large inter-plate separation regime. The same-plate stress correlator on the fixed plate increases and saturates on increase of the inter-plate separation, reflecting the non-decaying nature of the longitudinal forces acting on the fixed plate. The qualitative differences between the transverse and longitudinal stress correlators stem from the distinct nature of the shear and compression modes as, for instance, the latter exhibit acoustic propagation and, hence, relatively large fluctuations across the fluid film.

However, {{the use of such}} parallel robots is not widespread due to three factors: the limited workspace, the singularity configurations existing inside the workspace, and the high cost.

40|$|Most volcanoes and {{earthquakes}} happen {{where they}} do because of how the Earth's outer layers behave. The outer rigid shell is broken into <b>mobile</b> <b>plates,</b> whose migration and interaction {{is referred to as}} 'plate tectonics'. Sporadic grinding action between plates as they move causes most of the large earthquakes. Interactions between plates are also responsible for producing molten rock (magma) and allowing it to rise to the surface where it can erupt through volcanoes, although not all volcanoes are related to plate boundaries. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have many consequences, which can be fatal to humans, destructive to property and harmful to the environment. At worst, a really bad eruption can change the climate of the whole globe. Tsunamis are powerful waves in the ocean that can be devastating when they come ashore. Unlike most volcanoes and earthquakes, tsunamis are not direct consequences of plate tectonics. The most common tsunami trigger is submarine earthquakes, but they can also be set off by a volcanic eruption under, or next to, the sea. Thus volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis are part of the same story.

40|$|We {{develop a}} general method of calculating the linear {{stability}} of a fluid with homogeneous layers that is heated from below. The method employs a propagator technique to obtain expressions for the fluid velocity, stress, and temperature. The principal {{advantage of the}} method is {{the ease with which}} solutions are adapted {{to a wide variety of}} boundary conditions and fluid properties. We demonstrate the utility of the method using three examples which quantify the effects of (1) rheological layering, (2) <b>mobile</b> <b>plates</b> at the surface, and (3) multiple phase transitions. Each example is presented in the context of Earth's mantle. In the first example, we predict that convection becomes confined to the upper mantle once the viscosity increase between the upper and lower mantle exceeds a factor of 2000, consistent with the nonlinear calculations of Davies (1977). In the second example we find that the heat flux variations in a convecting fluid with variably sized, surface plates can be attributed, in part, to changes in the critical Rayleigh number. The linear stability of a fluid with multiple phase transitions is significantly affects by the locations of the transitions. We find that phase transitions have their largest effect when they are located at the center of the fluid layer and become much less important when they are located near the exterior boundaries...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} function of RFID in vehicle tracking is to store information concerning tagged elements {{in order to}} improve the overall performance of movable asset management. There is a need to discover an RFID system for the tracking of vehicles, as existing vehicle tracking systems are undependable. Experiments were performed with SIRIT, SAVI, and RF code RFID systems under differing conditions, attaching the tag to the license plate instead of the windshield. Different spacers were also tested to reduce the effect of metal surfaces on RFID signals. Preliminary experiments were performed before stationary and motion testing in order to better understand the RFID systems. Testing was also conducted to identify the angle at which the reader should be fixed and the ideal placement of the tag on the license plate. Stationary and motion testing were then performed on the three RFID systems, using different spacers and speeds, and the effect of spacers and speed on signal strength was found to be significant. In addition, environmental testing was performed on RF code systems in low temperature conditions. Upon completion of these experiments, the resulting data was analyzed to identify not only the best material to embed between tag and license plate in practical situations, but also the most effective thickness of that material and the optimum height of the reader. Finally, a benefit cost analysis was performed comparing both the RF code RFID and <b>mobile</b> <b>plate</b> hunter (MPH) - 900 camera system.

40|$|The {{orientation}} of the principal stress axes within deformation zones between two <b>mobile</b> <b>plates</b> is modeled here analytically, using a thin-plate theory. The simple analytical approach helps to explain why plates cease to move after collision. Orogenic periods last only several tens of million years because the stress associated with a particular constant driving force (causing a constant strain rate) is {{no longer able to}} maintain a significant horizontal displacement. In contrast, the uplift rate increases rapidly as the horizontal velocity decreases, and this may explain why the termination of orogenic epochs are usually heralded by the rapid deposition of thick sequences of immature sedimentary rocks or flysch. The analytical model also elaborates the relationship between homogeneous bulk deformations driven by a constant stress orientation and those due to a fixed displacement direction of physical boundaries of the deformation zone. Two major kinematic possibilities are considered: (1) plates converging either orthogonally or obliquely, making the deformation zone an analogue for orogenic collision; and (2) plates diverging either orthogonally or obliquely, so that the deformation zone is dynamically similar to initiating rift basins. The theoretical investigation led to the formulation of the following rules. Deformation zones between converging plates have the major axis of bulk deviatoric stress coinciding with the bisector of the acute angle between the relative plate velocity vector and the normal to the deformation-zone boundary. In case of extension within a deformation or rift zone separating diverging plates, th...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} method with {{constrained}} elements and Lagrange multipliers is used to study tectonic faults in a viscous medium. A fault, representing the interface between overriding and subducting plates, has been incorporated into a viscous flow model of a subduction zone in which both thermal buoyancy and the buoyancy associated with the phase change from olivine to spinel are included. The fault causes stress to concentrate in its vicinity, giving rise to a weak plate margin and a <b>mobile</b> <b>plate</b> if a power law rheology is used. Surface dynamic topography with either a Newtonian or a power law rheology and with typical subduction zone parameters {{is characterized by a}} narrow and deep trench and a broadly depressed back arc basin. This suggests that oceanic trenches and back arc basins over subduction zones are dynamically compensated by viscous flow. Our models show that trench depth increases with fault dip angle, slab dip angle, slab length, and age of oceanic lithosphere just prior to subduction. The influence of fault dip angle and age of lithosphere on trench depth is greater than the influence of slab dip angle and slab length. These relationships of trench depth versus subduction zone parameters explain well the statistics of observed trench depths. For those subduction zones with oceanic lithosphere {{on both sides of the}} trench, observed trench depths have been corrected for fault and slab dip angles, based on the relationships from the dynamic models. After correction to a common set of parameters, trench depth correlates linearly with age of lithosphere prior to subduction with a slope which is close to what models having high viscosities within the transition zone and lower mantle predict. Comparison between the trench depths, corrected for fault and slab dip angles, and model trench depths suggests that the resisting tangential stress on faults in subduction zones may range from 15 MPa to 30 MPa, depending on model details...|$|E
40|$|Suspensions of colloid {{particles}} {{possess the}} remarkable property to solidify upon {{the addition of}} minimal amount of a second liquid that preferentially wets the particles. The hardening {{is due to the}} formation of capillary bridges (pendular rings), which connect the particles. Here, we review works on the mechanical properties of such suspensions and related works on the capillary-bridge force, and present new rheological data for the weakly studied concentration range 30 - 55 vol% particles. The mechanical strength of the solidified capillary suspensions, characterized by the yield stress Y, is measured at the elastic limit for various volume fractions of the particles and the preferentially wetting liquid. A quantitative theoretical model is developed, which relates Y with the maximum of the capillary-bridge force, projected on the shear plane. A semi-empirical expression for the mean number of capillary bridges per particle is proposed. The model agrees very well with the experimental data and gives a quantitative description of the yield stress, which increases with the rise of interfacial tension and with the volume fractions of particles and capillary bridges, but decreases with the rise of particle radius and contact angle. The quantitative description of capillary force is based on the exact theory and numerical calculation of the capillary bridge profile at various bridge volumes and contact angles. An analytical formula for Y is also derived. The comparison of the theoretical and experimental strain at the elastic limit reveals that the fluidization of the capillary suspension takes place only in a deformation zone of thickness up to several hundred particle diameters, which is adjacent to the rheometer's <b>mobile</b> <b>plate.</b> The reported experimental results refer to water-continuous suspension with hydrophobic particles and oily capillary bridges. The comparison of data for bridges from soybean oil and hexadecane surprisingly indicate that the yield strength is greater for the suspension with soybean oil despite its lower interfacial tension against water. The result can be explained with the different contact angles of the two oils in agreement with the theoretical predictions. The results could contribute for a better understanding, quantitative prediction and control of the mechanical properties of three-phase capillary suspensions solid/liquid/liquid...|$|E

30|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{detection}} {{of a large}} number of super-Earths, i.e., extrasolar planets with a mass of up to ten times the Earth’s (e.g., Borucki et al. 2011), many researchers have explored dynamics of the mantle of super-Earths, because it is a key to understanding their tectonics, thermal history, and surface environments (e.g., Valencia et al. 2007; Valencia and O’Connell 2009; van Heck and Tackley 2011; Foley et al. 2012; Lenardic and Crowley 2012; Stein et al. 2013; Tackley et al. 2013; Stamenković and Breuer 2014). In the terrestrial planets of our solar system, two of the most important factors that dominate mantle dynamics are the lithosphere and hot ascending plumes (e.g., Schubert et al. 2001; Davies 2011). Whether the lithosphere on super-Earths is rifted into <b>mobile</b> <b>plates</b> as observed on the Earth or remains stagnant as observed on Venus and Mars has been a central issue, and the predictions made in the literature range from the stagnant lithosphere (e.g., O’Neill and Lenardic 2007; Stein et al. 2013) to active plate tectonics (e.g., Valencia et al. 2007; Valencia and O’Connell 2009; van Heck and Tackley 2011; Foley et al. 2012; Tackley et al. 2013). In their review of parameterized convection models for super-Earths, Stamenković and Breuer (2014) conclude that whether plate tectonics can operate or not sensitively depends on the detail of the parameterization. The vigor of hot ascending plumes, although it has not drawn so much attention, is also an important issue, since hot plumes affect the activity of hot spot volcanism and large igneous provinces that have been suggested to rift the lithosphere on the Earth (e.g., Richards et al. 1989). Before challenging these issues on the real super-Earths, however, it is important to explore thermal convection in the mantle of super-Earths as a problem of fluid dynamics. Recently, Miyagoshi et al. (2014, 2015, 2017) have focused on the effects of adiabatic compression in super-Earths of ten times the Earth’s mass, and found that the effects are substantial, as summarized below. Here, we apply our earlier numerical models to super-Earths of various mass to clarify the threshold in planetary mass above which the effects of adiabatic heating we found become important.|$|R

The obtained supernatant was applied to radio-thin-layer chromatography (radio-TLC silica gel <b>plates,</b> <b>mobile</b> phase acetonitrile/water 70 / 30 v/v, application volume 2  μL on origin) and analysed via a Canberra-Packard Instant Imager.|$|R

The growing {{performance}} of low-cost mobile devices {{makes it possible}} to perform advanced processing on mobile sensors. This creates the need to building a management system for groups of sensors actively analyzing signals fromhardware devices. In this paper, an architecture of a CouchDB-Based Sensor Management Platform is presented and its application for the problem of finding stolen cars is shown. Detailed performance tests of the platform as well as its application are provided. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

50|$|The arms divide frequently, like tree {{branches}}, {{so that at}} the top {{end there}} may be over than 50 branches in all. The arms are formed of piles of calcite plates. The arms carry many thin feeding branches (or pinnae, like a fern frond). These pinnae have tube feet, that are covered in mucus, reach {{into the water and}} catch plankton. These arms were not very <b>mobile.</b> The arms <b>plates</b> of the arms have an insertion, that forms a grove that runs {{along the length of the}} arm and onto the calyx and transports the food particles to the mouth.|$|R
30|$|The {{powdered}} {{sample was}} dissolved in distilled water, and 5 [*]μl of sample was loaded on 8 -mm-thick pre-coated silica gel 60 F 254 TLC plate (20 [*]cm[*]×[*] 15 [*]cm) and processed in a CAMAG-LINOMAT 5 instrument. The plate {{was developed in}} butane-ammonia-pyridine-water (3.9 : 1 : 3.4 : 2.6) <b>mobile</b> phase. The <b>plate</b> was sprayed with a ninhydrin reagent prepared in propan- 2 -ol and dried. The developed plate was documented using a photo-documentation chamber (CAMAG-REPROSTAR 3) at UV 254 -nm and UV 366 -nm lights. Finally, the plate was scanned at 500 [*]nm using a CAMAG-TLC SCANNER 3. The peak area {{of the sample was}} compared with standard amino acids and quantified.|$|R
