Treating the contamination, it also makes the <b>Multiple</b> Organ <b>Deficiency</b> <b>Syndrome</b> less likely. DCS requests specific surgical skills. The best results are obtained when an abbreviated surgery is performed in collaboration with the intensive care. The non trauma surgical specialties should be involved in the reconstruction surgery. Courses are dedicated to the decision making and to these specific DCS procedures. They should be more widely implemented in Europe. They could be an asset for centers dealing with major trauma...|$|R

Serum samples from 21 cases of Yang <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> HCC patients (YDS-HCC) and 21 cases of non-Yang <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> HCC patients (NYDS-HCC) were analyzed using 1 H NMR spectroscopy and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to visualize the variation patterns in metabolic profiling of sera from different groups.

We found that the intensities of six metabolites (LDL/VLDL, isoleucine, lactate, lipids, choline, and glucose/sugars) in serum of Yang <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients were {{lower than those of}} non-Yang <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients. It implies that multiple metabolisms, mainly including lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolisms, are unbalanced or weakened in Yang <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients with HCC.

40|$|Anabolic hormones are {{endowed with}} {{powerful}} actions {{on both the}} cardiovascular system and the skeletal muscle. In western countries, an age-related decline of anabolic hormones including IGF- 1, testosterone and DHEA-S is extensively described, and thought to contribute to sarcopenia, visceral adiposity and osteopenia. This decline has been {{often referred to as}} somato- and andro-pause [4] and [5]. In the last decade, a growing body of evidence has led to the hypothesis that chronic heart failure (CHF) is indeed a <b>multiple</b> hormone <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> (MHDS), characterized by a reduced anabolic drive that bears relevant functional and prognostic implications. Of note, Growth Hormone (GH) or testosterone replacement therapy provides beneficial effects, particularly on exercise tolerance and well-being. Despite the emerging role of the MHDS, very few studies have described its prevalence in mild-to-moderate CHF, particularly focusing on age-related trends, and none has described simultaneous deficiencies of somatotropic, thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal axes. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to clarify the age-related prevalence of MHDS in patients with CHF. In an unselected population of 202 stable CHF patients, 107 male subjects with CHF, NYHA classes I–III, were enrolled in three tertiary referral centers. The inclusion criteria were: male sex, age > 18 years, stable medications for at least three months including ß-blocker, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40 % or below, and signed informed consent. Patients undergoing an active hormone treatment, with known advanced kidney disease (eGRF < 30 mL/min) or liver cirrhosis were excluded. The patients recruited were studied after 3 months of optimized medical therapy and clinical stability. In conclusion, the high prevalence of HD in CHF patients particularly in younger patients, its association with poor survival, and the recent evidence of beneficial effects of hormonal replacement therapies in CHF, supports the role for a hormonal screening in these patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To set a {{quantified}} diagnostic {{standard for}} large intestinal cancer of spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: The spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> was identified by {{experts on the}} basis of clinical epidemiological investigation of 311 patients suffering from large intestinal cancer. Corresponding points were assigned to the correlative factors (traditional Chinese medicine symptoms) {{on the basis of}} symptom differences between spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> and non-spleen-qi-deficiency syndrome. The best threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) according to syndrome differentiation from expert team, and the quantified diagnostic standard was established. The syndrome identification from the expert team which was regarded as golden standard was tested retrospectively. Results: All the traditional Chinese medicine symptoms possibly related to spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> were analyzed based on the opinions of experts, and 28 symptoms were confirmed as candidate correlative factors. The occurrence of 11 symptoms between spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> and non-spleen-qi-deficiency syndrome showed statistical differences by means of crosstabs analysis (P< 0. 05). The 11 symptoms were filtered by logistic regression analysis, and tiredness, fatigue, loose stool, and poor appetite were finally determined as the symptoms relative to large intestinal cancer. These four symptoms were analyzed with conditional probability conversion and endowed with 16, 11, 4 and 8 points respectively. The diagnostic standard of spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> of large intestinal cancer was over 13 points. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of retrospective examination were all above 80 %, and its positive likelihood ratio was 9. 89. Conclusion: The quantified diagnostic standard for spleen qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> of large intestinal cancer is in accordance with clinical characteristics of large intestine cancer and the characteristics of TCM syndrome diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore and understand nurses&# 039; experiences of managing pain for persons living with human immune virus/ acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> receiving palliative care at home in Botswana. Background: Community palliative and hospice care in Africa and Botswana were developed for persons with end-stage acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> and other terminal illnesses being cared for at home. As antiretro viral therapies extend the lives of persons living with human immune virus/acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndromes,</b> there is an increase in the chronic conditions associated with human immune virus/acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Despite a strong demand for care of persons living with human immune virus/acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndromes</b> and other chronic illnesses, little is known about Botswanan community nurses&# 039; capacity to manage community-based end-of-life care for persons living with human immune virus/acquired immune <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Design: A qualitative study approach guided by van Manen&# 039;s interpretive analysis was undertaken. Methods: Data were collected using semi-structured interviews that were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative interpretive analysis. Thirteen nurses from 12 health districts in Botswana were recruited to the study using purposeful sampling. Results: Participants identified that pain management was a significant issue. A lack of nurses&# 039; ability to advocate effectively for patients {{because of a lack of}} relevant skills and knowledge and poor availability of appropriate analgesics was a limiting factor along with doctors&# 039; reluctance to prescribe opioids to effectively manage pain...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a treatable neurometabolic disorder, {{characterized}} by a low concentration of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a decreased CSF to blood glucose ratio. Reports of patients with apparently normal CSF glucose levels, however, have raised the question whether CSF analysis is a reliable screening tool for GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome.</b> OBJECTIVE To determine the value of CSF analysis in the workup of GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome.</b> EVIDENCE REVIEW PubMed was searched until July 2012 by using the terms glucose transporter 1 (GLUT- 1) <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome,</b> glucose transporter defect, and SLC 2 A 1 -gene. Relevant references mentioned in the articles were also included. The CSF results of all patients with genetically proven GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> described in literature were reevaluated. FINDINGS The levels of glucose in CSF, the CSF to blood glucose ratios, and the levels of lactate in CSF were reported for 147 (94 %), 152 (97 %), and 73 (46 %) of 157 patients, respectively. The CSF glucose levels ranged from 16. 2 to 50. 5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10 th percentile for all 147 patients. The CSF to blood glucose ratios ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 59 and were at or below the 10 th percentile for 139 of 152 patients (91 %), but they could be within the normal range as well. The CSF lactate levels ranged from 5. 4 to 13. 5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10 th percentile for 59 of 73 patients (81 %). A typical CSF profile for GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which {{is defined as a}} CSF glucose level at or below the 10 th percentile, a CSF to blood glucose ratio at or below the 25 th percentile, and a CSF lactate level at or below the 10 th percentile, was found in only 35 of 4099 CSF samples (0. 9 %) present in our CSF database of patients who received a diagnosis other than GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We conclude that if age-specific reference values are applied, CSF glucose and lactate levels are adequate biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Future availability of whole-exome sequencing in clinical practice will make the existence of a reliable biomarker for GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome</b> even more important, in order to interpret genetic results and, even more importantly, not to miss SLC 2 A 1 -negative patients with GLUT 1 <b>deficiency</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
