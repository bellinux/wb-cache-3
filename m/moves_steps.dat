Many break moves can begin from the 6-step. The move sets up the direction of rotation and builds momentum while imparting body control. The breaker stays low and in contact with the ground, which places him in perfect position for performing other moves. Each of the six distinct steps puts the body in a different position which can be used as starting points for other <b>moves.</b> <b>Steps</b> 1/2 and 3/4 (described below) are most often used for launching other moves. Conversely, any move which ends on the ground can be transitioned smoothly back into the 6-step.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhenever we open a {{household}} appliance (or any other mechanical or electrical product, {{such as a}} toy) {{we can find a}} user's manual; this can be a leaflet or an 80 -page book. In any case, we agree to name it instruction/user's manual and we treat it as a unit. This communication presents a research done with the purpose of establishing the rhetorical structure of instruction manuals for household appliances and to contrast the differences in two languages, Spanish and English. With this commitment we have complied a 52 -text bilingual corpus divided into two comparable subcorpora following Sinclair's (1991) and Leech's (1996) ideas on corpus linguistics as well as other scholars. The theoretical framework for this contrastive study is based on macro-linguistics. We have taken the notion of genre to approach the corpus and considered instruction manuals as one more of them. This macro-linguistic perspective is based on Swales (1993), Halliday and Hasan (1989), Werlich (1983) and Bhatia's (1993, 2004) notions. Then, as the communicative process (Shannon, 1948) and the pragmatic relations are similar in every case, {{we have been able to}} preform a rhetoric analysis from a twofold perspective: qualitative and quantitative. On the qualitative side of the analysis, we have determined the prototypical structure, following and adapting Swales model (1993) to the instructional genre, and according to it we have tagged the corpus into <b>moves,</b> <b>steps</b> and sub-steps. On the quantitative side of the analysis, we have looked for the significance of the different <b>moves,</b> <b>steps</b> and sub-steps in numerical terms and percentages. This raw information needs interpretation, and the conclusion will extract it from the differences and similarities in terms of priorities in one language and the other...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} two aspects, first to explore written academic feedback as a genre and second, to use corpus approaches to investigate any significant strategy revealed by the genre study. Feedback reports were gathered from two Humanities departments from undergraduate students who were doing an English programme in a UK higher education institution. The first aim {{of this research is}} to identify the rhetorical structures or functions of feedback by analyzing its <b>moves,</b> <b>steps,</b> and acts structure. A genre analysis was carried with 100 feedback reports. Although both departments used different templates in giving feedback, the findings from the genre analysis show some distinctive patterning of feedback, indicating that written academic feedback is a genre. The second part of this research was developed in the process of genre analysis where one of the salient features of feedback is in tutors’ use of hedging. The EdEng corpus was compiled from the feedback reports. From the findings of the corpus study, hedging is often expressed through four sub-components: modal verbs, vague language, stance adverbs, and submodifiers. Through the findings of this study, I {{hope to be able to}} raise awareness of the current feedback writing system and to provide salient ways for tutors to give feedback in essays...|$|E

40|$|The article {{proposes a}} generic {{model for a}} type of {{communicative}} discourse: the discourse of negotiation based on the concepts and methodology of the pragma dialectic theory of argumentation. The first part defines negotiation as an argumentative type of discourse and argues in favour of a generic analysis. In what follows a short presentation of the pragma-dialectic theory is made outlining its major benefit for the genre analysis, i. e. its normative and descriptive nature. The most important concepts of this theory – the critical discussion, the concept of relevance {{and the role of}} arguments – are analysed {{within the framework of the}} discourse of negotiation. The proposed generic model comprises stages, <b>moves,</b> <b>steps</b> and speech acts which are most frequently encountered in the discourse of negotiation. The article concludes with a parallel between the critical discussion and the negotiation model proposed in which the major differences between the two are highlighted. Although the paper is largely theoretical offering few examples, it claims that the study of generic structures for different types of discourses can be extremely useful in the ESP or EAP classes. The reason is that such an analysis highlights not only the lexical and grammatical aspects, but also the overall structure, the structure of arguments, their role and relevance in a text type thus contributing to the development of communicative competence...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 47 - 50). This thesis {{presents a}} genre-based study of U. S. law school lectures attended by foreign lawyers. With {{the practice of}} law becoming more international, an increasing number of working professionals in the field of law are enrolling in U. S. law schools to gain knowledge of the U. S. legal system. Previous research within English for Academic Legal Purposes (EALP) has mainly been concerned with developing and improving reading and writing skills primarily of native speakers. Very few studies have focused on analyzing the spoken interactions in a law school classroom and addressing the needs of foreign lawyers that attend U. S. law schools. This study reports on an analysis of aural and oral needs of foreign lawyers enrolled in a certificate program at a U. S. law school by focusing on the rhetorical structure of lectures and students' role in classroom interaction. The analysis showed that law school lectures constitute a genre made up of <b>moves,</b> <b>steps</b> and sub-steps comprised within three larger units of organization: Content Introduction, Content Development, and Session Closing. Each of these rhetorical functions is signaled by particular lexical items and grammatical choices. The analysis revealed that not all moves and steps are obligatory. Furthermore, instead of following a linear structure, the moves are highly recursive, which is a notable feature of spoken discourse. In addition, the bulk of the lecture is composed of move cycles which resemble the structure of the analytical and organizational tool widely known in the field of law as IRAC (Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion). The analysis of classroom interaction revealed variation in interactivity across larger units and moves. Turn-taking is most frequently initiated by students' questions fulfilling a number of functions, such as seeking information, confirming understanding, seeking clarification, and applying a legal concept to hypothetical situations. In addition to the functions, the forms of questions were also explored. The thesis concludes with suggestions for employing {{the results of this study}} in an EALP course. In particular, the use of lecture transcripts for developing students' aural and oral skills is advocated...|$|E

40|$|Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) {{represents}} a powerful alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of static Bayesian models. SMC involves specifying {{a sequence of}} distributions connecting one that is easy to sample from with one that is the target, the posterior distribution. SMC uses a sequence of reweighting, resampling and <b>move</b> <b>steps</b> to traverse a population of particles through this sequence of distributions. The <b>move</b> <b>step</b> is important as it is generally the most computationally expensive step and is critical in maintaining particle diversity. A common choice in the literature is to adopt an MCMC kernel for the <b>move</b> <b>step,</b> which can utilise the population of particles to help devise efficient proposals. Since the MCMC kernel may reject proposals, the kernel may be applied a fixed prescribed number of times on each particle. In this paper we propose to take further advantage {{of the population of}} particles by forming an independent proposal based on a copula model. An interesting by-product of the independent proposal choice is that we are able to consider various importance sampling (IS) estimators of the marginal likelihood or the evidence. We devise a novel IS evidence estimator and compare it with other IS-based estimators and the standard SMC estimator. We demonstrate on several examples in this paper that our novel approach with independent proposals can lead to more efficient posterior approximations and more accurate estimates of the evidence compared with other derivative-free MCMC proposals...|$|R
