500|$|Dinklage and writer-director Sacha Gervasi {{spent several}} years writing and {{producing}} a film based on {{the final days of}} actor Hervé Villechaize, who committed suicide shortly after his 1993 interview with Gervasi. As of 2017, Dinklage will star and play the title role in <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> with Hervé. The movie has been approved by HBO, with Dinklage being set to co-star alongside Jamie Dornan. [...] In 2017, it was announced that Dinklage has been attached to star in the American comedy O Lucky Day, which is to be directed by Adam Shankman and {{is said to be a}} [...] "leprechaun comedy".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. He recorded his lines at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. The episode makes cultural references to the films <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> with Andre, The Terminator, On the Town, [...] "Crocodile" [...] Dundee, Deliverance, Friday the 13th, and Boyz n the Hood (in the title) {{as well as the}} song [...] "Sugar, Sugar" [...] by The Archies. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 13.0, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{referred}} to The Original Series as [...] "cartoonish" [...] in Mind Meld, but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, [...] "I {{never thought it}} was a cartoon ... I never thought it was beneath me." [...] In a February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, Shatner said Mind Meld was similar to <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> with Andre, and indicated that he and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature. Nimoy said of the film, [...] "This is the most personal insight the fans will get into our relationship and into aspects of Bill and myself they've never heard before." [...] In April 2002, Mind Meld was screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Two years later, Mind Meld was included in the bonus material when the first six Star Trek films were re-released as a special edition box set.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet probing attack {{began at}} 07:00 hours, but the 21st Rifle Division {{achieved}} no breakthrough. After the Soviets had been repelled, the defending 11th Infantry Division received some artillery reinforcements. The artillery commanders {{wanted to use}} the church tower of Radzymin as an observation post and to move the batteries forward, closer to the front line. However, before the relocation of the artillery was complete, a new Soviet attack began at around 17:00, this time carried out by four brigades of the 21st and 27th Rifle Divisions, reinforced with 59 artillery pieces. The Russians achieved a 3:1 superiority in firepower. Deprived of artillery support, the inexperienced and overstretched 1/46th Infantry Regiment, defending the village of Kraszew, broke, and the Soviets gained entry to Radzymin. The Polish unit withdrew in panic, and soldiers left their arms and backpacks behind. One of the artillery officers noted that the Russians achieved complete tactical surprise: [...] "I ordered <b>my</b> <b>dinner</b> prepared when my aide came shouting 'Lieutenant Sir, the Reds are in the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{staff of}} The Line of Best Fit ranked [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] at number 6 {{on their list}} of the 50 Best Tracks of 2013 and wrote that it was [...] "easily {{one of the most}} vital pop songs of the year". Rolling Stone ranked the {{recording}} at number 23 on their list of the 50 Best songs of 2014 and compared the song's production to that of Lorde's music and the lyrics to those of Kesha's songs. Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press deemed it {{as one of the best}} singles of that year and stated that [...] "it was refreshing to hear the debauchery depicted" [...] in the song. Echoing this thought, Chris DeVille of Stereogum ranked the track at number 26 on his list of Top 50 Pop Songs of 2014 and confessed that: [...] "For a song that derives much of its appeal from being out-of-control and over-the-top, 'Habits' is a work of extreme poise and precision from a pop songwriter with a blindingly bright future." [...] Entertainment Weekly 's Miles Raymer selected the line [...] "I eat <b>my</b> <b>dinner</b> in my bathtub / Then I go to sex clubs / Watching freaky people gettin' it on" [...] on his list of the best lyrics of 2014 and wrote that it was [...] "one of the most interesting images to come out of a pop singer's mouth this year".|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be <b>my</b> <b>dinner,</b> my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E
500|$|When Bart and Milhouse {{visit the}} local video arcade at the {{beginning}} of the episode, Martin Prince is seen playing an arcade game based on the 1981 film <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> with Andre. Other games at the arcade include a game based on the 1984 film The Terminator. The [...] "Springfield, Springfield" [...] number performed by Bart and Milhouse on their night out in town is a reference to the musical number [...] "New York, New York" [...] from the film On the Town, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. During a scene in which Hans Moleman and Moe fight with knives, Hans tells Moe, [...] "You call that a knife? This is a knife!", a reference to a line from the 1986 film [...] "Crocodile" [...] Dundee. [...] Ernest Borgnine introduces himself a la Troy McClure to the Junior Campers by recalling his role in From Here to Eternity, a film which modern children are unlikely to have seen. During a hallucination, Homer imagines himself singing the song [...] "Sugar, Sugar" [...] by The Archies while dancing with lollipops and ice cream cones. While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner when he says [...] "Water, water everywhere/So let's all have a drink. The scene in which Borgnine and the other rafters drift through a dark forest watched by mountain men is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film Deliverance, and the scene features the music from the film's [...] "Dueling Banjos" [...] scene. The unseen person or creature that attacks Borgnine at the end of the episode is implied to be Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th film series.|$|E

500|$|The {{third floor}} {{contains}} the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners {{in the grand}} ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet {{was held at the}} Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf-Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black-tie charitable affair co-chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria-Hungary which celebrated the Enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, [...] "I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack when I get up to speak that I leave <b>my</b> <b>dinner</b> jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time". Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Center). It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the [...] "Starlight Roof". Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and many of the suites including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vertès, Louis XVI and Cole Porter, named after the celebrities who stayed in them. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday night card games were played. There is also a re-creation of one of the living rooms of Hoover's Waldorf-Astoria suite in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Kevin McDonough argues that, [...] "in less talented hands, Two of Us, {{like any}} Beatles-reenactment movie, {{could have been}} an awful {{exercise}} in bad wigs and Liverpool accents. Instead, Lindsay-Hogg and first-time screen writer Mark Stanfield have created a small masterpiece, a variation on <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> With Andre meets The Beatles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1880 and 1887, Heaviside {{developed}} the operational calculus using p for the differential operator, (which Boole had previously denoted by D), giving {{a method of}} solving differential equations by direct solution as algebraic equations. This later caused {{a great deal of}} controversy, owing to its lack of rigour. He famously said, [...] "Mathematics is an experimental science, and definitions do not come first, but later on." [...] On another occasion he asked somewhat more defensively, [...] "Shall I refuse <b>my</b> <b>dinner</b> because I do not fully understand the process of digestion?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Simpsons go to a {{screening}} of The Poke of Zorro, which is largely a parody of the Zorro film The Mask of Zorro (1998). Jonathan Gray wrote in Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality that The Poke of Zorro [...] "ridicules the outlandishness of Hollywood blockbuster fare", especially its [...] "blatant historical inaccuracies" [...] which sees the film feature Zorro, King Arthur, the Three Musketeers, the Scarlet Pimpernel, [...] "the Man in the Iron Mask and ninjas in nineteenth century Mexico." [...] The film's credits list, actors John Byner, Shawn Wayans, Rita Rudner, Cheech Marin, Gina Gershon, Curtis Armstrong, Eric Roberts, Spalding Gray, Anthony Hopkins, James Earl Jones and Meryl Streep, singer Victoria Beckham, wrestler Steve Austin, soccer player Pelé and producer Robert Evans as having roles in the film, and, amongst others, thanks publisher Bob Guccione and hockey team the Philadelphia Flyers. The Buzz Cola advertisement shown before The Poke of Zorro is a parody of the opening Normandy invasion sequence from the film Saving Private Ryan (1998). Gray writes that it [...] "scorns the proclivity of ads to use any gimmick to grab attention, regardless of the ethics: as an indignant Lisa asks incredulously, 'Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?'" [...] Amongst the other films advertised at the theater is <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> with Jar Jar, {{a reference to the}} character Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars and the 1981 film <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> with Andre.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, Kaufman and his {{business}} partner Michael Herz founded Troma Entertainment and began producing and distributing independent action and comedy films. In order to pay the bills, Kaufman did some freelance work for major Hollywood productions, including Rocky (edited on Troma's flatbed machines), Saturday Night Fever, and The Final Countdown, which he also produced (Kaufman {{has said that it}} was his experience on this film that made him never want to deal with a major studio again). From 1979 to 1981, the two wrote, produced and directed a series of profitable [...] "sexy comedies" [...] including Squeeze Play!, Waitress!, Stuck on You! and The First Turn-On!. On most of these early films, Kaufman is credited as [...] "Samuel Weil." [...] Kaufman also made a small appearance in Rocky and served as the production manager on Louis Malle's <b>My</b> <b>Dinner</b> With Andre.|$|E
2500|$|Theodora was {{followed}} by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, Marion Delorme, written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not {{give her a chance}} to show her talents. She next put on Hamlet, with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful. Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: [...] "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance {{what they are going to}} serve at <b>my</b> <b>dinner,</b> and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gus admired {{it as much}} as I did; for {{since my}} return, and {{especially}} since <b>my</b> venison <b>dinner</b> and drive with Lady Drum, he thought I was the finest fellow in the world, and boasted about his [...] "West End friend" [...] everywhere.|$|R

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for <b>my</b> <b>dinner</b> was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
