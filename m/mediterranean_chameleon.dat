5000|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.Birds: The reserve is home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are considered rare at the national level. More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, and {{at least two or three}} species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), rock sparrow (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: rock partridge (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). The reserve is also home to many species of birds of prey such as: griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).Reptiles and amphibians: Al-shouf cedar reserve is home to a rich variety of reptiles, 26 species were documented with two species endemic to Lebanon and the chouf area in particular.

40|$|Reptiles are traded {{globally}} for medicinal purposes. Historic qualitative {{accounts of}} reptiles used as medicine in Morocco are numerous, but contemporary quantitative data are rare. In 2013 - 2014, we surveyed 49 wildlife markets in 20 towns throughout Morocco, plus the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. We recorded 1, 586 specimens {{of at least}} nine species for sale in 14 of the Moroccan markets with a combined value of about US $ 100, 000. The most prominent markets were those in Marrakesh, Meknes, Casablanca, and Fez, with the former two cites trading equal quantities of dried and live specimens and the latter two trading mainly dried specimens. Common species were the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>chameleon</b> (Chamaeleo chamaeleon) with 720 specimens (506 dried, 214 alive) and the Bell’s Dabb lizard (Uromastyx acanthinura) with 428 specimens (247 dried, 181 alive), both traded in 10 markets, and spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca; 57 carapaces), for sale in eight cities. Over 200 African rock python (Python sebae) skins were identified {{and may have been}} illicitly imported from other parts of Africa. The turnover of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>chameleon</b> and Bell’s Dabb lizard specimens after four weeks as measured by repeat surveys was 66 % for both species, resulting in an estimated annual turnover of 1, 520 chameleons (range 921 – 2, 303) and 775 lizards (range 364 – 1, 174). Despite legal protection and regulations locally within Morocco and internationally through CITES, reptiles are commonly and openly traded for medicinal purposes throughout Morocco. However, traders are not forthcoming in conveying the legal status of these species and restrictions on trade to potential buyers. Increased enforcement of existing wildlife protection legislation is needed to prevent this exploitation from the illegal wildlife trade that could negatively impacts imperiled species...|$|E
40|$|RNA-seq is {{becoming}} a preferred tool for genomics studies of model and non-model organisms. However, DNA-based analysis of organisms lacking sequenced genomes cannot rely on RNA-seq data alone to isolate most genes of interest, as DNA codes both exons and introns. With this in mind, we designed a novel tool, LEMONS, that exploits the evolutionary conservation of both exon/intron boundary positions and splice junction recognition signals to produce high throughput splice-junction predictions {{in the absence of}} a reference genome. When tested on multiple annotated vertebrate mRNA data, LEMONS accurately identified 87 % (average) of the splice-junctions. LEMONS was then applied to our updated <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>chameleon</b> transcriptome, which lacks a reference genome, and predicted a total of 90, 820 exon-exon junctions. We experimentally verified these splice-junction predictions by amplifying and sequencing twenty randomly selected genes from chameleon DNA templates. Exons and introns were detected in 19 of 20 of the positions predicted by LEMONS. To the best of our knowledge, LEMONS is currently the only experimentally verified tool that can accurately predict splice-junctions in organisms that lack a reference genome...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy concerning {{the origin of}} Iberian populations of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>chameleon,</b> Chamaeleo chamaeleon. Current opinion dictates that Spanish populations result from introductions during the 18 th and 19 th centuries, with subsequent translocations from the original populations {{to other parts of}} Spain. The Portugese population in the Algarve {{is believed to have been}} introduced from Africa or Spain during the 1920 s. However, Holocene remains of chameleons suggest that the Malaga population at least could have a much older origin. Analysis of sequences from the mitochondrial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene of samples from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa revealed a double origin for the Iberian population. The Mediterranean Iberian (Malaga) population is closely related to Mediterranean North African populations, with Atlantic Iberian populations more closely related to populations of the Atlantic coast of North Africa. The overall genetic differentiation and diversity observed was very low, preventing precise dating of the colonization events. However this low level of differentiation is not consistent with Plio-Pleistocene colonization, the assumed timing for a natural colonization event and suggests that chameleons were probably introduced twice by man in the recent past...|$|E
