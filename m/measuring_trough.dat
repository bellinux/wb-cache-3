40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{biologic}} anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) agents infliximab and adalimumab are monoclonal antibodies with binding specificity to TNFalpha, {{which are}} used {{for the treatment of}} Crohn's disease. Clinical response is varied from complete with mucosal healing, to primary non-response, loss of response and adverse drug reactions. <b>Measuring</b> <b>trough</b> blood levels of infliximab and adalimumab may guide clinical management. The sample handling requirements for infliximab and adalimumab were previously unknown. AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the in vitro stability of infliximab and adalimumab in samples stored for up to seven days at room temperature. METHODS: Samples were stored as clotted whole blood or serum at room temperature for up to seven days, before being frozen (- 20) and analysed as a batch for either infliximab or adalimumab. RESULTS: No significant difference between the concentration of infliximab and adalimumab measured in samples stored as serum or whole blood for seven days at room temperature, as compared to baseline was found (t-test; infliximab: P =. 35 [serum], P =. 38 [whole blood]; adalimumab: P =. 12 [serum], P =. 49 [whole blood]).

40|$|Aims To {{review the}} basis and optimal use of {{therapeutic}} drug monitoring of antimicrobial agents. Methods Antimicrobial agents {{for which a}} reasonable case exists for therapeutic drug monitoring are reviewed under the following headings: pharmacokinetics, why monitor, therapeutic range, individualization of therapy, sampling times, methods of analysis, interpretative problems and cost-effectiveness of monitoring. Results There is a strong historical case for monitoring aminoglycosides. The recent move to once-daily dosing means that criteria for therapeutic drug monitoring need to be redefined. Vancomycin has been monitored routinely but many questions remain about the most appropriate approach to this. A {{case can be made}} for monitoring teicoplanin, flucytosine and itraconazole in certain circumstances. Conclusions The approach to monitoring aminoglycosides is being redefined in the light of once daily dosing. It may be that less stringent monitoring is required in some circumstances but toxicity, especially ototoxicity, remains a problem with these drugs. Monitoring to avoid high AUCs (areas under the concentration-time curve) is recommended. The ideal method for monitoring vancomycin remains to be defined although a reasonable case exists for <b>measuring</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations, mainly to ensure efficacy. Teicoplanin is sometimes monitored to ensure efficacy while flucytosine may be monitored to avoid high concentrations associated with toxicity. Itraconazole has various pharmacokinetic problems and monitoring has been suggested to ensure that adequate concentrations are achieved...|$|E

Fifty pediatric patients (3 - 16 years of age) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were initially included during the maintenance phase (with dexamethasone) of the Dutch ALL treatment protocol. As a marker of glucocorticoid sensitivity, the salivary very low-dose DST was used. A post-dexamethasone cortisol level < 2. 0 nmol/L was considered a hypersensitive response. The neurobehavioral endpoints consisted of questionnaires regarding psychosocial and sleeping problems administered {{before and during the}} course of dexamethasone (6 mg/m(2)), and dexamethasone trough levels were measured during dexamethasone treatment. Patients with a hypersensitive response to dexamethasone had more behavioral problems (N= 11), sleeping problems, and/or somnolence (N= 12) (P < 0. 05 for all three endpoints). The positive predictive values of the DST for psychosocial problems and sleeping problems were 50 % and 30 %, respectively. Dexamethasone levels were not associated with neurobehavioral side effects. We conclude that neither the very low-dose DST nor measuring dexamethasone trough levels can accurately predict dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral side effects. However, patients with glucocorticoid hypersensitivity experienced significantly more symptoms associated with dexamethasone-induced depression. Future studies should elucidate further the mechanisms by which neurobehavioral side effects are influenced by glucocorticoid sensitivit...|$|E

V raziskavi smo primerjali dva komercialno dostopna testa za določanje najnižje serumske koncentracije zdravila infliksimab (angl. {{trough level}} of {{infliximab}} – TL IFX) – test Lisa-Tracker Duo Infliximab (Lisa-Tracker) in test apDia Infliximab ELISA (apDia) ter rezultate primerjali z rezultati komercialno nedostopnega testa, razvitega na Univerzi v Leuvnu (UHL). Pearsonovi koeficienti korelacije med testi so znašali R = 0, 92 (UHL in apDia), R = 0, 91 (apDia in Lisa-Tracker) ter R = 0, 89 (UHL in Lisa-Tracker). Dokazali smo povezanost TL IFX s koncentracijo C-reaktivnega proteina pri vseh treh testih ter povezanost TL IFX z endoskopsko določeno aktivnostjo bolezni pri testih UHL in Lisa-Tracker. Dokazali smo, da so zaznavni TL IFX dober napovedovalec, da bo bolnik ostal na terapiji z IFX. Izmerili smo tudi protitelesa proti IFX (angl. antibodies to infliximab – ATI) in sicer s komercialno dostopnim testom Lisa-Tracker, rezultate pa kvalitativno primerjali z rezultati komercialno nedostopnega testa za določanje ATI – UHL. Pri obeh testih je odsotnost ATI dober napovedovalec, da bo bolnik ostal na terapiji z IFX. Odsotnost ATI (določena z UHL) pomeni večjo verjetnost, da bodo zaznavni TL IFX s časom ostali zaznavni, prisotnost ATI pa je povezana z manjšo verjetnostjo, da bodo TL IFX postali visoki. Monitoring trough {{levels of the}} drug and antibodies to the drug is important when patients with inflammatory bowel disease are treated with anti-TNF biological drugs, because it can help to guide therapeutic decisions. In our research we compared two commercial assays for <b>measuring</b> <b>trough</b> level of infliximab (TL IFX) – test Lisa-Tracker Duo Infliximab (Lisa-Tracker) and test apDia Infliximab ELISA (apDia). We compared our results to in-house developed ELISA test from University of Leuven (UHL). Linear correlations (Pearson R) between tests were R = 0, 92 (UHL and apDia), R = 0, 91 (apDia and Lisa-Tracker) and R = 0, 89 (UHL and Lisa-Tracker). Our results indicate that TL IFX, meassured with three different assays correlate with concentration of C-reactive protein. Higher TL IFX, measured with UHL and Lisa-Tracker also correlate with endoscopic remission of disease. We showed that detectable TL IFX lead to continuation of the treatment with IFX. In our research we measured antibodies to infliximab (ATI) with commercial test Lisa-Tracker and compared our results with in-house developed ELISA test – UHL. Because {{of a lack of}} standardization among assays for ATI determination, we can only compare results qualitative. We found out that the absence of ATI, measured with both assays leads to continuation of treatment with IFX. When determinating predictors for high TL IFX in the future, the absence of ATI (determinated with UHL) was found out to be a good predictor for detectable TL IFX in the future...|$|E

40|$|Background: The imatinib trough plasma {{concentration}} (C(min)) correlates with clinical response in cancer patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of plasma C(min) is therefore suggested. In practice, however, blood sampling for TDM {{is often not}} performed at trough. The corresponding measurement is thus only remotely informative about C(min) exposure. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study were}} to improve the interpretation of randomly measured concentrations by using a Bayesian approach for the prediction of C(min), incorporating correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters, and to compare the predictive performance of this method with alternative approaches, by comparing predictions with actual <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> levels, and with predictions obtained by a reference method, respectively. Methods: A Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method accounting for correlation (MAP-ρ) between pharmacokinetic parameters was developed {{on the basis of a}} population pharmacokinetic model, which was validated on external data. Thirty-one paired random and trough levels, observed in gastrointestinal stromal tumour patients, were then used for the evaluation of the Bayesian MAP-ρ method: individual C(min) predictions, derived from single random observations, were compared with actual <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> levels for assessment of predictive performance (accuracy and precision). The method was also compared with alternative approaches: classical Bayesian MAP estimation assuming uncorrelated pharmacokinetic parameters, linear extrapolation along the typical elimination constant of imatinib, and non-linear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) with interaction. Predictions of all methods were finally compared with 'best-possible' predictions obtained by a reference method (NONMEM FOCE, using both random and trough observations for individual C(min) prediction). Results: The developed Bayesian MAP-ρ method accounting for correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters allowed non-biased prediction of imatinib C(min) with a precision of ± 30. 7 %. This predictive performance was similar for the alternative methods that were applied. The range of relative prediction errors was, however, smallest for the Bayesian MAP-ρ method and largest for the linear extrapolation method. When compared with the reference method, predictive performance was comparable for all methods. The time interval between random and trough sampling did not influence the precision of Bayesian MAP-ρ predictions. Conclusion: Clinical interpretation of randomly measured imatinib {{plasma concentration}}s can be assisted by Bayesian TDM. Classical Bayesian MAP estimation can be applied even without consideration of the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters. Individual C(min) predictions are expected to vary less through Bayesian TDM than linear extrapolation. Bayesian TDM could be developed in the future for other targeted anticancer drugs and for the prediction of other pharmacokinetic parameters that have been correlated with clinical outcomes...|$|R

Vancomycin is a key {{antibiotic}} {{for the treatment of}} Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. Vancomycin has a narrow therapeutic range. Overdosing imposes a risk of nephro- and ototoxicity, wherease underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15 – 20 lg/mL have been identified as the optimal target trough levels. Methods. A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis. Results. The model identified 3 simple parameters that were responsible for 94. 6 % of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77. 9 % of patients, whereas major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> level of 16. 5 lg/mL was 5. 6 % lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17. 5 lg/mL.

Methods. The role of LH-R over-expression was studied using EC cells (Hec 1 A, e. g. cells with low endogenous LH-R expression) transfected with the LH-R (Hec 1 A-LH-R). In vitro cell proliferation was measured through the WST 1 assay, whereas cell invasion was <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> the matrigel assay. The effects of LH/hCG-R overexpresion in vivo were analyzed in an appropriately developed preclinical mouse model of EC, which mimicked postmenopausal conditions. The model consisted in an orthotopic xenograft of Hec 1 A cells into immunodeficient mice treated daily with recombinant LH, to assure high levels of LH. Results. In vitro data indicated that LH-R overexpression increased Hec 1 A invasiveness. In vivo results showed that tumors arising from Hec 1 A-LH-R cells injection displayed a higher local invasion and a higher number of distant metastases, mainly in the lung, compared to tumors obtained from the injection of Hec 1 A cells. LH withdrawl strongly inhibited local and distant metastatic spread of tumors, especially those arising from Hec 1 A-LH-R cells. Conclusions.

Clinical and biological evaluations were performed at V 3 and V 4 and compared with those at V 1. RESULTS: We included 24 patients. The final therapeutic decision differed from the preliminary decision for 12 patients (50 %). For patients with increased infliximab dosage at V 2, mean disease activity score for 28 joints (DAS 28) decreased by about 20 % at V 3 or V 4 as compared with V 1 (P < 0. 05). Decreased DAS 28 was correlated with increased serum infliximab concentration (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of infliximab trough concentration modifies the therapeutic decision for RA patients and helps improve control of disease activity. Therapeutic drug monitoring of infliximab in RA may be useful for individual dosage adjustment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{delivery}} of personalized antimicrobial therapy {{is a critical}} component {{in the treatment of}} patients with invasive infections. Vancomycin, the drug of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, requires the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for {{delivery of}} optimal therapy. Current guidance on vancomycin TDM includes the measurement of a trough concentration as a surrogate for achieving an AUC to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by broth microdilution (AUC/MICBMD) ratio ≥ 400. Although trough-only monitoring has been widely integrated into clinical practice, there is a high degree of inter-individual variability between a <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> concentration and the actual AUC value. The therapeutic discordance between AUC and trough may lead to suboptimal outcomes among patients with infections due to less susceptible pathogens or unnecessarily increase the probability of acute kidney injury (AKI) in others. Given the potentially narrow vancomycin AUC range for optimal effect and minimal AKI, clinicians need a “real-time” system to predict accurately the AUC with limited pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling. This article reviews two innovative approaches for calculating the vancomycin AUC in clinical practice based on one or two drug concentrations. One such approach involves the use of Bayesian computer software programs to estimate the “true” vancomycin AUC value with minimal PK sampling and provide AUC-guided dosing recommendations at the bedside. An alternative involves use of two concentrations (peak and trough) and simple analytic equations to estimate AUC values. Both approaches provide considerable improvements over the current trough-only concentration monitoring method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: many oral pathologies, such as dental caries, {{periodontal}} disease and peri-implantitis are plaque-related. Dental plaque is a microbial biofilm formed by organisms tightly bound to a solid substrate {{and each other}} {{by means of an}} exopolymer matrix. Bacteria exhibit difefrent properties when contained within a biofilm. Knowing the mechanism controlling the formation and deveopment of biofilms can help to understand the emergence and progression of such pathologies and to plan effective treatment. Most periodontal pathogens are common saprophytes of the oral cavity, expressing their virulence only in a sisceptible host or when some changes comw about in the oral envirnment. Physical, metabolic and physiological interactions may cause positive or negative effects among the various microbiota present. Such mechanisms of antagonisms/synergy select the bacterial population and alterations of its composition affect the balance with the host and may lead to pathology. The efefctivenes of antimicrobial agents, as <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> in vitro tests, is dramatically reduced in vivo due to the properties of the microbial community: mature, intact biofilms are les sensitive to such agents, as the exopolymer matrix, bacterial enzymes and slow growth rate hinder the action of chemotherapeutic agents. The present literature review aims to examine the most representative sudies, focusing on the characteristics of the bacterial communities and the crucial shift from the oral health to plaque-related diseases.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to quantify the relationship between secondary structure of gelatin and its adsorption at the fish-oil/water interface and to quantify the implication of the adsorption on the dynamic interfacial tension (DST) and emulsion stability. The surface hydrophobicity of the gelatin solutions decreased when the pH increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0, while opposite tend was observed in the viscosity of the solution. The DST values decreased as the pH increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0, indicating that higher positive charges (<b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> zeta potential) in the gelatin solution tended to result in higher DST values. The adsorption kinetics of the gelatin solution was examined through the calculated diffusion coefficients (Des). The addition of acid promoted the random coil and beta-turn structures at the expense of alpha-helical structure. The addition of NaOH decreased the beta-turn and increased the a-helix and random coil. The decrease in the random coil and triple helix structures in the gelatin solution resulted into increased D-eff values. The highest diffusion coefficients, the highest emulsion stability and the lowest amount of random coil and triple helix structures were observed at pH = 4. 8. The lowest amount of random coil and triple helix structures in the interfacial protein layer correlated with the highest stability of the emulsion (highest ESI value). The lower amount of random coil and triple helix structures allowed higher coverage of the oil-water interface by relatively highly ordered secondary structure of gelatin...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} issue of Arthritis Research & Therapy, Ducourau and colleagues {{report that they}} retrospectively detected anti-infliximab antibodies in 21 % of patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients with anti-infliximab antibodies had lower serum drug concentrations. These findings contribute to the existing evidence of immunogenicity of biologicals and its clinical relevance. We argue for therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize treatment response. Therapeutic drug monitoring {{seems to be an}} important new aspect in the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases. This is argued by Ducourau and colleagues [1] in {{the previous}} issue of Arthritis Research & Therapy. In a retrospective study of 17 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 91 patients with spondyloarthritis, the authors <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> serum infliximab levels and antibodies toward infliximab at each visit. Antibodies against infliximab were detected in 21 patients (19 %), and the median detection time was 3. 7 months. In the larger group of patients with spondyloarthritis, infliximab levels were only 1. 6 mg/L in those with antibodies and 15. 8 mg/L in those without antibodies (P < 0. 001), and the same pattern was found in the smaller rheumatoid arthritis group. In addition, patients with antibodies used methotrexate less often and infusion reactions occurred more often in the antibody-positive patients (52 % versus 1 %). We believe that this is an adequately performed but retrospective study that does not show exciting new data but that does confirm the clinical relevance of measuring serum levels and anti-drug antibodies in patients treated with biologicals...|$|R
40|$|Intrapatient {{variability}} of drug concentrations over time {{has not been}} evaluated {{as a predictor of}} drug response but may provide information on the onset and maintenance of response and a patient's adherence to therapy. Our objective was to develop a pharmacologically based measure of intrapatient {{variability of}} concentrations and investigate its association with a patient's response to antiretroviral therapy. Efavirenz concentrations were obtained for 50 children enrolled in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group study 382, a concentration-controlled trial of efavirenz plus nelfinavir and at least one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from 24 -h concentration-time profiles at weeks 2 and 6 and used to predict trough concentrations obtained during 1 year of therapy. A concentration predictability score, defined as the fraction of <b>measured</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations that fell within a ± 50 % range of the predicted concentration, was used to place subjects into high and low concentration predictability groups. Relationships between this score and human immunodeficiency virus RNA levels in plasma were investigated. Eight of 33 children (24 %) in the high-predictability group experienced viral rebound, compared with 9 of 17 children (53 %) in the low-predictability group (P = 0. 042). Children with low predictability scores exhibited a significantly shorter time to their first viral rebounds and {{were significantly more likely to}} experience viral rebound; the latter finding persisted after adjustment for baseline viral load and efavirenz exposure at week 6. This novel method for the quantitation of intrapatient concentration variability was independently predictive of virologic rebound. This measure may allow interventions to minimize therapeutic failure and is applicable to other drugs...|$|R
