Method for registration of the acoustic oscillations induced during the heterophase transitions executing in liquid medium was proposed (method of acoustic emission (AE)). Using of conical vessel serving as a resonator allows the amplification of registered acoustic signal and provides high sensitivity of the registration. The experimental {{results show that the}} using of AE-method allows remote monitoring of the dynamics of concrete mixtures condition during setting. Therefore, this method can be successfully applied in building as a non-destructive method for determining the start and end of the solidification of the cement solution...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that the informal sector in developing countries shows a dual structure, with part of the informal sector being competitive to the formal sector {{and part of the}} informal sector being the result of market segmentation. Although several authors have stressed this hypothesis, it has so far not received satisfactory empirical treatment. Hence, we formulate a model that allows to test econometrically the hypothesis that the informal labor market comprises two distinct segments. Our model integrates Heckman regression with sample selection into a finite <b>mixture</b> <b>setting,</b> which takes into account both selectivity bias and the fact that sector affiliation of an individual in the informal sector is generally unobservable. An estimation of the model for the urban labor market in Côte d’Ivoire, shows that the informal labor market is indeed composed of two segments with both competitive as well as segmented employment...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{development}} of relatively ice-free fuel-metering systems, {{the widespread use of}} alternate and heated-air intakes, and the use of alcohol for emergency de-icing, icing of aircraft-engine induction systems is a serious problem. Investigations have been made to study and to combat all phases of this icing problem. From these investigations, criterions for safe operation and for design of new induction systems have been established. The results were obtained from laboratory investigations of carburetor-supercharger combinations, wind-tunnel investigations of air scoops, multicylinder-engine studies, and flight investigations. Characteristics of three forms of ice, impact, throttling, and fuel evaporation were studied. The effects of several factors on the icing characteristics were also studied and included: (1) atmospheric conditions, (2) engine and air-scoop configurations, including light-airplane system, (3) type fuel used, and (4) operating variables, such as power condition, use of a manifold pressure regulator, <b>mixture</b> <b>setting,</b> carburetor heat, and water-alcohol injection. In addition, ice-detection methods were investigated and methods of preventing and removing induction-system ice were studied. Recommendations are given for design and operation with regard to induction-system design...|$|E

However, the nature of <b>mixture</b> <b>sets</b> over finite domains has been little studied. In this paper we provide a complete characterisation. More recently, another abstract convex structure for finite domains, the antimatroid, {{has appeared in the}} literature on decision theory and social choice.

40|$|The {{class of}} mixture GARCH models {{introduced}} by Haas, Mittnik and Paollela (2004) and Alexander and Lazar (2006) provides a better alternative for fitting financial data than various other GARCH models {{driven by the}} normal or skewed t-distribution. In this paper we propose different option pricing methodologies when the underlying stock dynamic is modeled by an asymmetric normal mixture GARCH model with K volatility components. Since under GARCH models the market is incomplete there are {{an infinite number of}} martingale measures one can use for pricing. For our <b>mixture</b> <b>setting</b> we analyze the impact of three risk-neutral candidates: a generalized local risk neutral valuation relationship, an Esscher transform and an extended Girsanov principle. We investigate the out-of-sample performance of an asymmetric GARCH model with a mixture density of two normals for Call options written on the S&P 500 Index. The performance under all three transformations is quite impressive when compared to the benchmark GARCH model with normal driving noise. The overall improvement is explained not only by the skewness and leptokurtosis exhibited by the innovation mixture distribution, but also by the richer parametrization used in modeling the dynamics of the multi-component conditional volatility. ...|$|E
40|$|A recent meta-regression of {{antidepressant}} {{efficacy on}} baseline depression severity has caused considerable {{controversy in the}} popular media. A central source of the controversy {{is a lack of}} clarity about the relation of meta-regression parameters to corresponding parameters in models for subject-level data. This paper focuses on a linear regression with continuous outcome and predictor, a case that is often considered less problematic. We frame meta-regression in a general <b>mixture</b> <b>setting</b> that encompasses both finite and infinite mixture models. In many applications of meta-analysis, the goal is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment from several studies, and authors use meta-regression on grouped data to explain variations in the treatment efficacy by study features. When the study feature is a characteristic that has been averaged over subjects, it is difficult not to interpret the meta-regression results on a subject level, a practice that is still widespread in medical research. Although much of the attention in the literature is on methods of estimating meta-regression model parameters, our results illustrate that estimation methods cannot protect against erroneous interpretations of meta-regression on grouped data. We derive relations between meta-regression parameters and within-study model parameters and show that the conditions under which slopes from these models are equal cannot be verified on the basis of group-level information only. The effects of these model violations cannot be known without subject-level data. We conclude that interpretations of meta-regression results are highly problematic when the predictor is a subject-level characteristic that has been averaged over study subjects...|$|E
40|$|A finite {{mixture is}} a {{distribution}} where a given observation {{can come from}} any of a finite set of components. That is, {{the density of the}} random variable X is of the form f(x) = 1 I ' 1 f 1 (x) + 1 I' 2 f 2 (x) + [...] . + lI'kfk(x), where the lI'i are the mixing proportions and the f i are the component densities. Mixture models are common in many areas of biology; the most commonly applied is a mixture of normal densities. Many of the problems with inference in the <b>mixture</b> <b>setting</b> are well known. Not so well documented, however, are the extreme biases that can occur in the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) when there is model misspecification. This paper shows that even the seemingly innocuous assumption of equal variances for the components of the mixture can lead to surprisingly large asymptotic biases in the MLEs of the parameters. Assuming normality when the underlying distributions are skewed can also lead to strong biases. We explicitly calculate the asymptotic biases when maximum likelihood is carried out assuming normality for several types of true underlying distributions. If the true distribution is- ~ mixture of skewed components, then an application of the Box-Cox power transformation can reduce the asymptotic bias substantially. The power A in the Box-Cox transformation is in this case treated as an additional parameter to be estimated. In many cases the bias can be reduced to acceptable levels, thus leading to meaningful inference. A modest Monte Carlo study gives an indication of the small sample performance of inference procedures (including the power and level of likelihood ratio tests) based on a likelihood which incorporates estimation of A. A real data example illustrates the method...|$|E
