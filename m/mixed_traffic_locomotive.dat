50|$|A {{single number}} without a suffix letter was {{originally}} {{used by the}} LMS on locomotives that were not of Midland Railway origin until 1928. Thereafter, {{it was used to}} indicate a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive.</b> Where a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> fell into different power ranges, dual classification was used, e.g. 5P4F. In the 1950s the suffixes 'FA' and 'FB' were used to distinguish between freight locos at the lower and higher ends of the power range.|$|E

25|$|The AA class {{inherited}} {{a number of}} design improvements from the Dd class <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> which were introduced in 1902.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} in three {{distinct}} batches leading to detail differences. They remain in use as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives,</b> mostly with TER and Transilien.|$|R
50|$|The Class 4 Mountain type {{locomotive}} {{was designed}} at the Salt River shops as a heavy <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> by H.M. Beatty, the last Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Government Railways (CGR).|$|E
50|$|EU07 is {{the name}} for a Polish {{electric}} locomotive in service of the Polish railway operator PKP. This locomotive {{was designed as a}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and as such is used both in freight and passenger traffic.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, the South African Railways {{placed a}} single Class 21 steam {{locomotive}} with a 2-10-4 Texas type wheel arrangement in service, {{designed as a}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> suitable for use on light rail. A simultaneously proposed heavier mainline version Class 22 2-10-4 was never built.|$|E
5000|$|The Caledonian Railway 908 Class were 4-6-0 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{designed}} by John F. McIntosh and built in 1906, at the Caledonian Railway's own St. Rollox Works.|$|R
50|$|They were {{conceived}} as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives,</b> equally suitable for goods and passenger work, and had bar frames, narrow fireboxes and used saturated steam. The Type WG bogie tender entered service with these engines.|$|R
50|$|Although {{commonly}} {{believed that}} they were intended as express passenger locomotives, the Great Central actually classified and used them as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The minutes of the Locomotive Committee show that they were ordered as a superheated version of the 8F (Immingham) class <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives.</b> They were described as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the contemporary Great Central publication 'Per Rail' which promoted the company's goods services. When new, three of the class - 423, 425 and 428 were painted in GCR's standard green passenger livery, while the other three - 424, 426 and 427 were painted in the lined black goods livery; all were green by the end of 1922. Their initial allocations included the 'Pipe trains', the vacuum-brake fitted express goods services between Manchester and London, among the most important services on the Great Central. There is no evidence that they were intended to challenge the contemporary 11E (Director) class 4-4-0s for the generally light express passenger services of the pre-1914 years on the London Extension.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911, the CGR placed two 4-8-2 Mountain {{locomotives}} in service. Designed by Chief Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty as a heavy <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> with Stephenson {{valve gear}} and that used saturated steam, {{they were built}} by NBL. They were not classified on the CGR but a year later, when they were taken onto the SAR roster, they were designated Class 4.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, had bar frames, piston {{valves and}} used Walschaerts valve gear. The Class GF {{was the only}} Double Pacific type Garratt to see service on the SAR and, until {{the arrival of the}} Class GMA, was the most numerous Garratt locomotive class in SAR service. It was designed as a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> for use on branch lines and secondary mainlines throughout the country.|$|E
50|$|In 1927, the South African Railways (SAR) placed 37 Class GF Garratt {{locomotives}} in service. They {{were the}} first of the 4-6-2+2-6-4 type and were built by Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG (Hanomag) in Germany. The locomotive specifications were prepared by Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1922 to 1929, who designed it as a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> for use on branch lines and secondary mainlines throughout the country.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} 0-4-2 wheel {{arrangement}} for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> was later followed by Patrick Stirling on the GNR and by William Adams on his Jubilee class for the London and South Western Railway 1887-1894.|$|R
50|$|The Glasgow and South Western Railway (GSWR) 187 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-2 steam <b>locomotives</b> {{designed}} for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> duties, by James Stirling in 1870. They formed a model for large numbers of similar 0-4-2 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> subsequently built on GSWR and other British railways.|$|R
50|$|They were <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{for use on}} {{express and}} local {{passenger}} trains as well as freight trains on {{all parts of the}} État network. The design was inspired by, and similar to Midi 1301 to 1370, Nord 3.078 to 3.354, and PO 1721 to 1735.|$|R
50|$|The class 92 was {{intended}} as a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> for hauling both international freight trains and the ill-fated and never introduced Nightstar passenger sleeper trains though the Channel Tunnel. Since introduction the fleet was exclusively allocated to freight, however, in March 2015 six locomotives owned by GB Railfreight have begun passenger operations hauling the Caledonian Sleeper on behalf of Serco between London and Scotland, marking the very first use of the class in commercial passenger service.|$|E
5000|$|In 1914, ten Class 15 {{locomotives}} entered service, {{built by}} NBL and designed by Hendrie {{as a large}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> with larger 57 in coupled wheels {{for use in the}} Orange Free State, where grades and curvature were less severe than on the coastal sections. To reduce the weight on the trailing wheels, steel fireboxes were used, a feature that became standard on large locomotives, but necessitated the introduction of water treatment plants {{in some parts of the}} country to prevent corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Class 4 Mountain type locomotive {{was designed}} as a heavy <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> by H.M. Beatty, the last Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Government Railways (CGR), at the Salt River shops. Soon after the South African Railways (SAR) locomotive renumbering project was implemented in 1912, an order was placed with North British for a further ten locomotives of this type. They were delivered late in 1913 and were designated Class 4A. The Type XM entered service as tenders to these engines.|$|E
50|$|Between 1846 and 1880, the 2-4-0 was the {{standard}} type for passenger and <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> and {{was built in}} large numbers by, amongst others, the LNWR (1846-96), the Midland Railway (1846-1880), the Great Northern Railway (1849-97), the North Eastern Railway (1856-88) and the Great Eastern Railway (1856-1902).|$|R
50|$|In 1918 the PMR {{sought a}} class of 50 more {{powerful}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> to replace the Coal Engines and relegate the 395 class to lighter duties. However, British locomotive builders were so busy with War orders that none could supply {{a class of}} 50 locomotives quickly enough.|$|R
50|$|They were {{conceived}} as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives,</b> equally suitable for goods and passenger work, and had bar frames, narrow fireboxes, used saturated steam and had cylinders with overhead slide valves which were actuated by inside Stephenson valve gear. The Type WG bogie tender entered service with these engines.|$|R
5000|$|In 1923 {{when the}} railway {{became part of}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, its Chief Mechanical Engineer was George Hughes. In 1926 he was {{responsible}} for the design of a 2-6-0 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> of unusual appearance, which became known as the [...] "Horwich Crab." [...] The class proved extremely successful, and 245 locomotives were built, 70 at Horwich, including the first 30 examples. The [...] "Crabs" [...] continued in service with British Railways London Midland and Scottish Regions until the last two survivors were withdrawn in early 1967.|$|E
5000|$|In {{production}} {{for a mere}} three years (1955-1958), the series was built at the Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke works [...] - [...] commonly shortened to LEW [...] - [...] in Hennigsdorf, East Germany. During this time, 34 units were produced with the intention {{for use as a}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> [...] - [...] hence its EU designation [...] - [...] though {{the reality is that the}} EU20 saw more use as a freight locomotive than a passenger one. EU20s were the first electric locomotives to be used on the route between Warsaw and Silesia.|$|E
50|$|The V2 was a {{versatile}} locomotive, capable of hauling fast fitted freights and express passenger trains. Their relatively heavy 22 ton axle load meant their use {{was restricted to}} around 40% of the LNER's route miles. For example, they were barred {{from all of the}} former Great Eastern Railway main lines. Gresley recognised that a lighter mixed-traffic locomotive was required, and the V4 class was designed to this end. However, it was to be the versatile LNER Thompson Class B1 4-6-0 which succeeded the V2 as the LNER's standard <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive,</b> although the B1 never matched the V2's power output.|$|E
50|$|Robert Urie of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) {{introduced}} three successful classes, the H15 class <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{introduced in}} 1914 and built until 1924, the N15 King Arthur class, with 74 locomotives built between 1919 and 1926, and the S15 class, with 45 locomotives built between 1920 and 1936.|$|R
50|$|The first United Kingdom 2-6-2 tender {{locomotive}} was the unsuccessful prototype Midland Railway Paget locomotive of 1908. Thereafter, {{the wheel}} arrangement was rare on tender locomotives, {{with the exception}} of two classes on the London and North Eastern Railway. These were the Class V2 and Class V4 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> which totalled 186 locomotives between them.|$|R
5000|$|The GCR Class 9Q, {{classified}} B7 by the LNER, was a {{class of}} 4-6-0 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> designed by John G. Robinson for fast goods, relief passenger and excursion services on the Great Central Railway. They were a smaller wheeled version of Robinson’s earlier Class 9P [...] "Lord Faringdon" [...] express passenger class (LNER Class B3).|$|R
50|$|The first 4-6-0 {{locomotive}} to {{be introduced}} in the United Kingdom was the Highland Railway’s Jones Goods class of 1894. Within five years, however, the wheel arrangement was being used primarily on passenger service, since British heavy freight trains were generally too slow to require a locomotive with a four-wheel leading bogie. Between 1906 and 1925, the 4-6-0 became the most common express passenger locomotive type in everyday use in the United Kingdom, as a logical development from the 4-4-0 type that was previously used. The 4-6-0 type continued {{to be used as}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> until the end of steam in the United Kingdom in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, the South African Railways (SAR) placed one [...] Class 21 steam {{locomotive}} with a Texas wheel arrangement in service, {{designed as a}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive</b> suitable for light rail. It was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1929 to 1936, and built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow. Only the one locomotive was built, at the time representing the maximum power obtainable on Cape gauge from a ten-coupled non-articulated locomotive that was limited to a 15 LT axle load on [...] rail. To enable it to negotiate tight curves, {{the third and fourth}} sets of coupled wheels were flangeless.|$|E
5000|$|The Black Fives were a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotive,</b> a [...] "do-anything go-anywhere" [...] type, {{designed}} by Stanier, {{who had previously}} been with the GWR. In his early LMS days, he designed his Stanier Mogul 2-6-0 in which he experimented with the GWR school of thought on locomotive design. A number of details in this design he would never use again realising the superiority of details not used on the GWR. Stanier realised {{that there was a}} need for larger locomotives. These were to be the LMS version of the GWR Halls but not a copy, as the Hall was too wide to run most places in Britain. They shared similar cylinder arrangement (two outside), internal boiler design and size and 6 foot driving wheel diameters.|$|E
50|$|The first Locomotive, Carriage & Wagon Superintendent for the South Eastern and Chatham Railway was H.S. Wainwright who {{produced}} {{a series of}} successful and elegant designs at Ashford. Wainwright's tender engines built at Ashford included 0-6-0 freight locomotives of the 'C' class, and the 4-4-0 passenger engines of the 'D' and 'E' classes. His tank engines built at the works included the versatile and long-lived 0-4-4 'H' class, the larger 0-6-4 'J' class and the diminutive 0-6-0 tank engines of the 'P' class. Wainwright was followed by R.E.L.Maunsell, who introduced the ultimately unsuccessful 'K' class 2-6-4 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> tank <b>locomotives</b> (which were later rebuilt into 2-6-0 tender locomotives), and the useful 'N' class 2-6-0 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1917.|$|R
50|$|The Great Central Railway Class 1A, {{classified}} B8 by the LNER, was a {{class of}} 4-6-0 <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> designed by John G. Robinson for fast goods, relief passenger and excursion services. They were known as the ‘Glenalmond Class’ and were a smaller wheeled version of Robinson’s earlier Sir Sam Fay express passenger class (LNER Class B2), which they closely resembled.|$|R
50|$|RSH {{streamlined}} the PC {{class to}} resemble British passenger express Pacifics, with a nose rounded like the LMS Coronation Class and valancing styled like the LNER Class A4. However, whereas the LMS and LNER classes had 6 ft or 6 ft driving wheels, the PC class had 5 ft driving wheels: a size akin {{to those on}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>locomotives</b> in Great Britain.|$|R
