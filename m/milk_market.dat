25|$|Pakistan is a net food exporter, {{except in}} {{occasional}} years when its harvest is {{adversely affected by}} droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest camel market, second-largest apricot and ghee market and third-largest cotton, onion and <b>milk</b> <b>market.</b> The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, {{play a central role}} in the government's economic reform package.|$|E

40|$|Though {{informal}} <b>milk</b> <b>markets</b> {{dominate the}} supply of <b>marketed</b> <b>milk</b> in most developing countries, they are largely discouraged by policies based on perceived quality and safety concerns.

5000|$|Irishtown (...) {{is an area}} {{of central}} Limerick, Ireland. The area along with Englishtown and Newtown Pery forms Limerick City Centre. Broad Street, John Street and Mungret Street are the main streets in the district. St. John's Square, a prized early Georgian {{development}} is located here as is St. John's Cathedral and the <b>Milk</b> <b>Market</b> which is located off Mungret Street.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{origins of}} The <b>Milk</b> <b>Market</b> are unknown but its {{location}} on Mungret Street in Limerick's Irishtown area can suggest a pre 19th century origin. In the early 19th century, {{there were a}} number of markets located in and around the city. It was suggested at this time that the various markets would be brought under a single management system. The Limerick Market Trustees was set up by an Act of the British Parliament, passed in 1852, to expand and manage the affairs of markets within the city boundary and its environs. In order to fulfill their charter the Trustees raised finance and acquired a large parcel of land in the Garryowen area of the city where many of the markets were relocated with the original market properties disposed of. The Butter Market, the Pig Market and the Hay Market were transferred to the new market area. The new market area eventually became a sports ground as is now known as the Markets Field stadium as eventually over time these markets began to fail. The Potato Market (on Merchant's Quay near the old Limerick Port) and the Corn Market (latterly known as the <b>Milk</b> <b>Market)</b> were retained in their original locations. The Potato Market ended in the 1940s, however the Corn Market or <b>Milk</b> <b>Market,</b> continued to thrive. The nature of the produce traded there also changed. In addition to the sale of fruit and vegetables there was also lively trade in fowl, homemade butter and homemade breads and cakes. It was not until the 1950s that the market for bedding plants and shrubs began to grow and this range of produce expanded rapidly in the 1960s. Another feature of the Market during this period was the Christmas market for turkeys. Through much of its history (1897 - 1988) the Limerick Market Trustees was in receivership the longest receivership period in Irish history. Following the release of the Trustees from receivership an ambitious renovation of the <b>Milk</b> <b>Market</b> was undertaken. This project won a European Heritage Award and it was reopened on September 1, 1995.|$|E
