5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>than</b> women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E

25|$|Galen {{may have}} {{produced}} <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>than</b> any author in antiquity, rivaling {{the quantity of}} work issued from Augustine of Hippo. So profuse was Galen's output that the surviving texts represent {{nearly half of all}} the extant literature from ancient Greece. It has been reported that Galen employed twenty scribes to write down his words. Galen may have written as many as 500 treatises, amounting to some 10 million words. Although his surviving works amount to some 3 million words, this is thought to represent {{less than a third of}} his complete writings. In AD 191, a fire in the Temple of Peace destroyed many of his works, in particular treatises on philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{rehabilitation}} {{methods have}} also been seen to present difficulties to those participating in them. At times these difficulties keep anywhere from 30%–66% of people from reaching their goals for their therapy. When the goals are not achieved people are generally made to participate in longer therapy sessions, more therapy sessions, or more in-depth and difficult sessions than before, such as constraint-induced movement therapy. In each of these cases, patients are generally forced {{to pay more than}} before and are also put through <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>than</b> they initially planned. It has been found through research, however, that virtual reality situations can likely increase a person's desire to participate in therapy and therefore increase their chances of reaching their therapy goals, unlike those left underachieved with regular methods.|$|E

500|$|Originally a fast-medium bowler—a {{style to}} which he {{sometimes}} reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. He gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he {{thought it might be}} effective. To deceive the batsman he varied [...] the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His Wisden obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a [...] "fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>than</b> was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and The Times described him as [...] "subtle in flight and with artful variations".|$|E

Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>than</b> an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it.

2500|$|Fletcher and Hurd {{state that}} unions may also face issues of {{resistance}} by pre-existing [...] "staff," [...] {{who may be}} hesitant or even suspicious at {{the adoption of the}} organizing model. Dealing with resistant staff would be a major disadvantage of using the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with. Fletcher and Hurd assert that, {{based on the fact that}} unions employing the organizing model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, [...] "...following the organizing model creates <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>than</b> sticking to the servicing model." [...] Richard Hurd argues that the organizing model can, at times, create [...] "...continual warfare..." [...] between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers [...] "...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle." [...] If this is really the mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain the organizing model for long periods of time. Fred Glass says that [...] "...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications" [...] because the organizing model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently. Bob Carter, in regard to the organizing model [...] in British unions, is concerned with the method of implementation and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing. Carter says that [...] "A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion..." [...] Carter worries about whether or not workers are a part of the transition process and whether they consent to all of the implications that come with the organizing model.|$|E
