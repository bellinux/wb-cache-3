5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, <b>mouses,</b> a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

40|$|Objective—Natural killer (NK) {{cells have}} been {{identified}} in human vascular pathologies. In this study, we identified NK cells in aortic root atherosclerotic lesions of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor–deficient (LDLr/) <b>mice.</b> To characterize the role of NK cell–mediated cytolysis in atherosclerosis, we generated C 57 Bl/ 6 double-mutant <b>mice</b> by crossing LDLr/ <b>mice</b> with NK cell–defective Lystbeige <b>mice</b> (creating beige,LDLr/ <b>mice)</b> and with perforin-deficient <b>mice</b> (creating Pfp/,LDLr/ <b>mice).</b> Methods and Results—Male <b>mice</b> (8 to 10 weeks old) were fed a high-fat diet to induce atherosclerosis. Compared with LDLr/ <b>mice,</b> beige,LDLr/ <b>mice</b> had impaired NK cell cytolytic activity and significantly increased atheroscle-rosis (P 0. 05). Pfp/,LDLr/ <b>mice</b> had impaired NK cell cytolytic activity, yet they had lesions that were similar to those of control <b>mice.</b> This suggested that NK cell cytolysis did not {{play a significant role in}} atherosclerosis and that the exacerbated atherosclerosis of the beige,LDLr/ <b>mouse</b> was independent of impaired NK cell cytolytic activity. Therefore, we investigated the role of T and B lymphocytes in atherosclerosis of beige <b>mice</b> by crossing them with recombinase activator gene 1 –deficient LDLr/ <b>mice</b> (Rag 1 /,LDLr/ <b>mice),</b> thus creating beige,Rag 1 /, LDLr/ <b>mice.</b> As in the double-mutant study, beige,Rag 1 /,LDLr/ <b>mice</b> had significantly increased lesions compared with Rag 1 /,LDLr/ control <b>mice.</b> Conclusions—Therefore, the Lystbeige mutation in LDLr/ <b>mice</b> has proatherogenic properties that are independent o...|$|R
40|$|Graves-like {{hyperthyroidism}} is induced in BALB/c <b>mice</b> by immunization with adenovirus {{expressing the}} human TSH receptor (TSHR) A-subunit (amino acids 1 - 289). However, because of nonidentity between {{the human and}} <b>mouse</b> TSHR (approximately 87 % amino acid homology), we compared the responses of <b>mice</b> immunized with adenoviruses expressing either the <b>mouse</b> or the human TSHR A-subunit. Wild-type (wt) BALB/c <b>mice</b> immunized with the <b>mouse</b> A-subunit developed neither TSHR antibodies (measured by flow cytometry) nor thyroid lymphocytic infiltration. However, wt C 57 BL/ 6 <b>mice</b> developed sparse intrathyroidal lymphocyte infiltration without antibody production. Depletion of naturally occurring regulatory CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T cells had little effect. These results indicate the inability to break tolerance to the <b>mouse</b> TSHR in wt <b>mice.</b> In contrast, TSHR knockout (KO) BALB/c <b>mice</b> generated <b>mouse</b> TSHR antibodies in response to <b>mouse</b> A-subunit immunization and augmented human TSHR antibody response to human A-subunit immunization. Thyroid-stimulating antibody titers measured in a functional bioassay were comparable in human A-subunit immunized wt <b>mice</b> and in TSHR KO <b>mice</b> immunized with either the <b>mouse</b> or human A-subunit. In conclusion, immune response to the <b>mouse</b> TSHR is readily induced in TSHR KO but not in wt <b>mice.</b> Only in the former does immunization with adenovirus expressing the <b>mouse</b> A-subunit generate antibodies capable of activating the <b>mouse</b> TSHR. TSHR KO <b>mice</b> are, therefore, of value for future studies dissecting the autoimmune response to the <b>mouse</b> TSHR...|$|R

Compared to wild type, apoE−/− <b>mice</b> exhibit neuronal deficits, similar to apoE 4 -Tg compared to apoE 3 -Tg <b>mice,</b> providing a model for Aβ-independent apoE effects on neurodegeneration. To {{determine the effects of}} apoE on Aβ-induced neuropathology, apoE−/− <b>mice</b> were crossed with Aβ-Tg <b>mice,</b> resulting in a significant delay in plaque deposition.

One approach to address hAPOE-induced temporal delay in Aβ pathology is an additional insult, like head injury. Another is crossing human-apoE-Tg <b>mice</b> with Aβ-Tg <b>mice</b> that have rapid-onset Aβ pathology. For example, because 5 xFAD <b>mice</b> develop plaques by 2 months, the prediction is that human-apoE/ 5 xFAD-Tg <b>mice</b> develop plaques around 6 months and 12 months before other human-apoE/Aβ-Tg <b>mice.</b> Thus, tractable models for human-apoE/Aβ-Tg <b>mice</b> continue to evolve...|$|R
