5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{writings}} of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) were highly influential in {{the return of the}} formal garden near to the house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife. Walter Scott's dislike of the sweeping away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and were highly influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig. New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots, such as the rhododendron and <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by an eclectic mix of the formal, picturesque and gardenesque. By {{the end of the century}} the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and kitchen garden, as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall, Fife by Robert Lorimer.|$|E

25|$|Many {{plants and}} trees growing {{throughout}} Vancouver and the Lower Mainland were imported {{from other parts}} of the continent and from points across the Pacific. Examples include the <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>tree,</b> the Japanese Maple, and various flowering exotics, such as magnolias, azaleas, and rhododendrons. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native Douglas Maple can also attain a tremendous size. Many of the city's streets are lined with flowering varieties of Japanese cherry trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year, an occasion celebrated by the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut, horse chestnut, and other decorative shade trees.|$|E

The song begins with Gruff Rhys singing the first verse backed only by finger picked {{acoustic}} guitar. Rhys's vocals are joined by sparse drums, a synthesizer, organ and harmony backing vocals in the second verse which immediately follows the first at 31 seconds. The drums become louder during the third and final verse which leads into a bridge that begins after 1 minute and 31 seconds. During the bridge Rhys sings the lines [...] "Oh the <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>tree</b> has some questions for the watchdogs of the profane, and I ask, is it sad that I'm driving myself mad as this fire in my heart turns blue". A key change to F♯ major follows for the final verse, with Rhys repeating the line [...] "I've got a fire in my heart for you" [...] backed by multiple harmony vocals.

The two parent species would not likely cross in the wild as their natural ranges are more than [...] apart, but in 1888 the hybrid cross occurred when the female flowers or cones of Nootka cypress were fertilised by pollen from Monterey cypress.|$|R

The garden {{originally}} extended {{to the other side}} of the Warrambine Creek, but became badly overgrown in recent times. Warrambine Creek runs along the north side of the garden, and a sunken croquet lawn is just north-east of the house. The garden has 2ha of informal area and parkland, and 3ha of formal garden which includes a rose garden, orchard, kitchen garden, various shrubberies with small tress, a variety of shrubs and perennials, and mature pines, <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzles</b> <b>trees,</b> and cypresses.

50|$|Flowering plants (angiosperms) spread {{during this}} period, {{although}} they did not become predominant until the Campanian Age {{near the end of}} the period. Their evolution was aided by the appearance of bees; in fact angiosperms and insects are a good example of coevolution. The first representatives of many leafy trees, including figs, planes and magnolias, appeared in the Cretaceous. At the same time, some earlier Mesozoic gymnosperms continued to thrive; pehuéns (<b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>trees,</b> Araucaria) and other conifers being notably plentiful and widespread. Some fern orders such as Gleicheniales appeared as early in the fossil record as the Cretaceous, and achieved an early broad distribution. Gymnosperm taxa like Bennettitales and hirmerellan conifers died out before the end of the period.|$|R

40|$|Most {{ecosystems}} of {{the world}} are being increasingly invaded by a variety of alien species. However, {{little is known about the}} combined ecological impacts of multiple co-occurring invaders. We assessed the impact of a community of exotic mammals (five domestic and four wild) on forests of <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> (Araucaria araucana), a globally endangered tree restricted to ca 400 km 2 on the slopes of the Andes in Chile and Argentina. Seeds of <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzles</b> provide food during winter to a small community of native mice and Austral parakeets (Enicognathus ferrugineus). We recorded the number of uneaten seeds and the number of young seedlings at the end of winter under 516 female <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>trees</b> located across the species’ distribution, and identified the signals of native and exotic species that visited the under-canopy of each tree. Moreover, we studied the diet and foraging behavior of Austral parakeets to explore the potential indirect effects of exotic mammals through the disruption of a key ecosystem service (seed dispersal) supposedly provided by parakeets. All but one tree were visited by at least one seed predator species. Austral parakeets and mice predated seeds from 85 % and at least 45 % of the trees, respectively, and both the number of remaining seeds and seedlings were significantly larger when only parakeets or mice predated seeds than when exotic mammals also visited the trees. At least 90 % of trees were visited by one or more exotic species, and the number of seeds and seedlings dropped drastically when at least two and four exotic species visited the tree, respectively. Austral parakeets mostly foraged on <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> <b>trees</b> during the winter period and dispersed their seeds in most feeding instances once seeds fell to the ground. The proliferation of exotic mammals may reduce the populations of native seed-predators in the long-term as well as the regeneration of <b>monkey</b> <b>puzzle</b> forests, directly through a reduction of seed availability and seedling survival, and indirectly through the disruption of dispersal processes. Our results show how strategies based on protecting areas may assure the survival of individuals of this long-lived (up to 1300 yr) tree species. However, forest regeneration and the community of native seed-predators and related ecological processes further depend on the proper management of exotic mammal invasions...|$|R

Most of these were visited and recorded personally, a process which caused Elwes to wear out two cars. In addition, Elwes undertook numerous journeys abroad to study the trees in the wild, even visiting Chile to see <b>Monkey</b> <b>Puzzle</b> <b>trees</b> (Araucaria araucana).

50|$|The {{southern}} tip of Nova Scotia is mainly considered to possess an Oceanic climate, and this includes Cape Sable Island. The winters are among the mildest found anywhere in Canada, warm enough to support Araucaria araucana (<b>Monkey</b> <b>Puzzle</b> <b>Trees)</b> and Trachycarpus fortunei (Japanese Fan Palm Trees). Winters are also quite windy, wet and stormy. Snowfall, while significant, especially in January, is still much less than most other locations in Atlantic Canada, which commonly average over 100 inches of snow per winter season (for example, Sydney, Nova Scotia and St. John's, Newfoundland). Summers on Cape Sable Island are cool with much more stable weather when compared to winter. Due to surrounding cool ocean waters, summer thunderstorms are very rare, but low clouds and fog are common. The strong influence of the Atlantic Ocean also produces exceptionally strong seasonal lag. On average, the coldest month is February, while the warmest month is actually September, coming in slightly warmer than August. Excepting San Francisco, California, virtually no other Northern Hemisphere location has September as the warmest month on average. At Cape Sable Island, October actually is slightly warmer than June.|$|R
