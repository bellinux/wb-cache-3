5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human hair with a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Gordon informs Batman {{that the}} {{patients}} of Arkham Asylum {{have taken over}} the facility, threatening to murder the staff unless Batman agrees to meet with them. Among the hostages are Dr. Charles Cavendish, Arkham's administrator, and Dr. Ruth Adams, a therapist. The patients are led by the Joker, who threatens to kill a young girl to spur Batman {{to come to the}} asylum. Meanwhile, Two-Face's <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E

5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good physical and <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> {{for most of}} the last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E
5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E

Furthermore, Booker was subject to the social stigma that affected people who used illicit drugs and who experienced mental health issues during this era of American history.|$|E

During her trial in federal court, her defense attorneys, led by Frederick Duchardt, asserted that she suffered from pseudocyesis, a <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> that causes a woman to falsely believe she is pregnant and exhibit outward signs of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|A {{report of}} Gage's {{physical}} and <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> {{shortly before his}} death implies that his most serious mental changes were temporary, so that in later life he was far more functional, and socially far better adapted, than in the years immediately following his accident. A social recovery hypothesis suggests that Gage's work as a stagecoach driver in Chile fostered this recovery by providing daily structure which allowed him to regain lost social and personal skills.|$|E

25|$|Survivor guilt (or {{survivor}}'s guilt; {{also called}} survivor syndrome or survivor's syndrome) is a <b>mental</b> <b>condition</b> {{that occurs when}} a person perceives themselves to have done wrong by surviving a traumatic event when others did not.

25|$|He {{served two}} years in the 64th Coast Artillery (United States), at Fort Shafter, in Hawaii, and shortly {{afterwards}} re-enlisted at Fort Barrancas, Florida. Although Parker had served honorably before, he went AWOL this time and was charged with desertion. He was punished with solitary confinement, from which he emerged with a psychosis that led to two months in a mental hospital, and he was discharged from the Army because of his <b>mental</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1905 Boltzmann corresponded {{extensively}} {{with the}} Austro-German philosopher Franz Brentano {{with the hope}} of gaining a better mastery of philosophy, apparently, so that he could better refute its relevancy in science, but he became discouraged about this approach as well.

25|$|Most {{studies in}} {{neurology}} have too few test subjects to be scientifically sure.

The only diagnoses that can be validated through large enough brain studies are those on serious brain damages and neurodegenerative diseases that destroy most of the brain.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{approaches to}} assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical and/or medical perspectives. Early examples of such physicians included Patañjali, Padmasambhava, Rhazes, Avicenna, and Rumi. In the early 19th century, one approach to study <b>mental</b> <b>conditions</b> and behavior was using phrenology, the study of personality by examining {{the shape of the}} skull. Other popular treatments at that time included the study of the shape of the face (physiognomy) and Mesmer's treatment for <b>mental</b> <b>conditions</b> using magnets (mesmerism).
