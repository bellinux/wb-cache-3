40|$|Five {{parasitoid}} {{and five}} predator species were registered on P. pentagona on 12 localities in Serbia and 27 {{in the area}} of Belgrade during 1997 - 2000. The parasitoid species registered were: Prospaltella berlesei (Howard), Aphytis proclia (Walker), Zaomma lambinus (Walker), Azotus perspeciosus (Girault) and Oomyzus scaposus (Thomson), and the first three species were primary parasitoids of <b>mulberry</b> <b>scale.</b> P. berlesei and A. proclia were found {{to be the most important}} regulators of P. pentagona population density with parasitism mounting to 60, even 64 %. The predator species determined were Chilocorus renipustulatus Scriba,Chilocorus bipustulatus L., Cybocephalus fodori Endrody-Younga, Chrysopa carnea Stephens and Deraeocoris ruber Linnaeus. The species C. fodori and C. carnea were found on mulberrry scale in Serbia for the first time. Until now D. ruber was unknown as P. pentagona predator in both domestic and international literature...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{creation}} of Thai rice snack with health benefits for higher potential in commercial <b>scale,</b> <b>mulberry</b> leaf was {{applied in the}} production of extruded snack product. Mulberry leaf in dried powder was mixed with rice, corn, soy, sugar, oil, vitamins and minerals to investigate the operating conditions with twin-screw extruder at varying mulberry content (5, 7. 5 and 10 %), screw speed (300 and 350 rpm) and feed moisture (13, 15 and 17 %) in the 3 × 2 × 3 factorial experiment. The extrudates were examined of functional properties (antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds) and some physical characteristics (expansion ratio, bulk density, texture measurement and organoleptic test). The results had shown that at higher mulberry content (10 %), the product was difficult to operate, unsmooth shape and less expand. While lower screw speed (300 rpm) and moderate moisture content (15 %) had trends for suitable expansion and bulk density with better preference in appearance including still have antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds which corresponded to the optimum operating condition (5 % mulberry content, 300 rpm and 15 % feed moisture) from the statistical analysis. Finally, the finished product was evaluated in the pattern of nutrition labeling, microbiological test and packed in metallize bag to examine for moisture content, aw, colour, TBA number, antioxidant activity and sensory test during storage time (0 - 4 months) at room temperature...|$|R
