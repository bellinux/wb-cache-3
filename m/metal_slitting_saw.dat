The influences of notch shape (radial, rectangular, or angular-shaped and variety of thicknesses), pre-cracking method, chip removing or non-chip removing, and the contact or non-contact methods on the results obtained in fracture toughness tests were investigated. The results were analyzed by two methods, quantitatively and qualitatively, by comparing the obtained Kc results and studying the SEM and optical microscopy images, respectively. The {{results indicated that the}} different conditions of a produced pre-crack including; geometry of pre-crack due to geometry of tools, residual stress due to pre-crack creation, heat affected zone, damage of crack tip, and producing crazing around the crack tip could affect the fracture toughness. The maximum difference resulted from different pre-cracking methods was equal to 0. 24 MPa. m 0. 5 and the lowest value of fracture toughness Kc, 2. 53 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the scoring method but the highest value, 2. 77 MPa. m 0. 5, belonged to the <b>metal</b> <b>slitting</b> <b>saw</b> method.

40|$|Graphene is a {{monolayer}} {{of carbon}} atoms constructing a two-dimensional honeycomb structure, {{and it has}} an excellent carrier mobility and a very high thermal conductivity. Remarkably, it has been experimentally demonstrated that a monolayer graphene exhibits an exotic optical properties. To be specific, the plasmonic dispersion relation of a transverse magnetic graphene plasmon is electronically tunable by adjusting carrier density in graphene with external gate bias, and graphene plasmonic nano cavities have been utilized to modulate mid-infrared light. In this thesis, we present how to efficiently modulate mid-infrared light by combining graphene plasmonic ribbons with noble metal plasmonic structures. First, we propose and demonstrate electronically tunable resonant perfect absorption in graphene plasmonic metasurface enhanced by noble metal plasmonic effect, which results in modulating reflecting light. In this device, we improve coupling efficiency of free-space photons into graphene plasmons by reducing wavevector mismatching with a low permittivity substrate. In addition, the graphene plasmonic resonance is significantly enhanced by plasmonic light focusing effect of the coupled subwavelength metallic slit structure, which results in strongly fortifying resonance absorption in the graphene plasmonic metasurface. In the proposed device, theoretical calculation expects that perfect absorption in the graphene plasmonic metasurface is achievable with low graphene carrier mobility. We also present an analytical model based on surface admittance in order to fully understand how this enhancement occurs. In the second device, we propose and demonstrate a transmission type light modulator by combining graphene plasmonic ribbons with subwavelength <b>metal</b> <b>slit</b> arrays. In this device, extraordinary optical transmission resonance is coupled to graphene plasmonic ribbons to create electrostatic modulation of mid-infrared light. Absorption in graphene plasmonic ribbons situated inside metallic slits can efficiently block the coupling channel for resonant transmission, leading to a suppression of transmission. This phenomenon is also interpreted by anti-crossing between the graphene plasmonic resonance in the ribbons and the noble metal plasmonic resonance in the subwavelength <b>metal</b> <b>slit</b> arrays. Finally, we devise a platform to demonstrate graphene plasmonic resonance energy transport along graphene plasmonic ribbons. In this device, two metal-insulator-metal waveguides are connected by a subwavelength <b>metal</b> <b>slit,</b> and graphene plasmonic ribbons are located inside this slit. Due to the large impedance mismatch at the junction, light coupling efficiency across the junction is poor. If the graphene plasmonic ribbons are tuned to support strong graphene plasmonic resonances, the light energy can be transferred via graphene plasmons along the ribbons, and it leads to significant improvement in the light coupling efficiency across the junction. In addition to enhanced light coupling efficiency, we also present how to totally suppress the transmission by inducing a Fano resonance between a non-resonant propagation mode across the junction and a resonant graphene plasmonic transport mode, which can be utilized to efficiently modulate light in a noble metal plasmonic waveguide with the graphene plasmon resonance energy transfer. </p...|$|R

The rays were sharpened to a beam by two <b>metal</b> <b>slits</b> – the first of these slits doubled as the anode, the second was connected to the earth. The beam then passed between two parallel aluminium plates, which produced an electric field between them when they were connected to a battery. The end of the tube was a large sphere where the beam would impact on the glass, created a glowing patch. Thomson pasted a scale to the surface of this sphere to measure the deflection of the beam. Note that any electron beam would collide with some residual gas atoms within the Crookes tube, thereby ionizing them and producing electrons and ions in the tube (space charge); in previous experiments this space charge electrically screened the externally applied electric field. However, in Thomson's Crookes tube the density of residual atoms was so low that the space charge from the electrons and ions was insufficient to electrically screen the externally applied electric field, which permitted Thomson to successfully observe electrical deflection.|$|R

There is an inventory of activated scrap metal in the 105 -L Disassembly Basin. Approximately 1, 600 ft 3 of the material is characterized as ''No Dose/Low Dose'' and consists mainly of activated aluminum and aluminum alloy pieces and parts and no stainless steel with a dose rate less than 200 mR per hr. Contaminants in the activated metal will leach more slowly than will contaminants in generic waste. The change in the leach rate will affect analyses for the groundwater pathway and intruder scenarios. For this evaluation, the slower leach rate from the activated metal waste will be neglected for the groundwater pathway, which is conservative because the higher leach rate used tends to produce higher groundwater concentrations and lower inventory limits. For this evaluation, the leach rate was set to zero for intruder scenarios, which is conservative for the inadvertent intruder because a slower leach rate will result in higher levels of radionuclides in the waste zone.

At a quarter to six the long <b>metal</b> <b>slit</b> suddenly opened up like a gaping mouth, into which a harlequin could have leaped easily. Through it Aspel could look--over the heads of the public--and see the officials inside dragging away great baskets full of letters to be manipulated in the mysterious realms inside. At five minutes to six the rush towards this mouth was incessant, and the operations at the newspaper-tomb were pretty much repeated, though, of course, the contents of bags and baskets were not quite so ponderous. At one side of the mouth stood an official in a red coat, at the other a policeman. These assisted the public to empty their baskets and trays, gave information, sometimes advice, and kept people moving on. Little boys there, as elsewhere, had a strong tendency to skylark and gaze at the busy officials inside, to the obstruction of the way. The policeman checked their propensities. A stout elderly female panted towards the mouth with a letter {{in one hand and a}} paper in the other. She had full two minutes and a half to spare, but felt convinced she was too late. The red-coated official posted her letter, and pointed out the proper place for the newspaper. At two minutes to six anxious people began to run while yet in the street. Cool personages, seeing the clock, and feeling safe, affected an easy nonchalance, but did not loiter. One minute to six--eager looks were on the faces of those who, from all sides, converged towards the great receiving-box. The active sprang up the wide stairs at a bound, heaved in their bundles, or packets, or single missives, and heaved sighs of relief after them; the timid stumbled on the stairs and blundered up to the mouth; while the hasty almost plunged into it bodily. Even at this critical moment there were lulls in the rush. Once there was almost a dead pause, and at that moment an exquisite sauntered towards the mouth, dropped a solitary little letter down the slope where whole cataracts had been flowing, and turned away. He was almost carried off his legs by two youths from a lawyer's office, who rushed up just as the first stroke of six o'clock rang out on the night air. Slowly and grandly it tolled from St. Paul's, whose mighty dome was visible above the house-tops from the colonnade. During these fleeting moments a few dozens of late ones posted some hundreds of letters. With kindly consideration the authorities of St. Martin's-le-Grand have set their timepieces one minute slow. Aware of this, a clerk, gasping and with a pen behind his ear, leaped up the steps at the last stroke, and hurled in a bundle of letters. Next moment, like inexorable fate, the mouth closed, and nothing short of the demolition of the British Constitution could have induced that mouth to convey another letter to the eight o'clock mails.|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringTension or {{compression}} fracture behavior {{studies are}} normally initiated with open hole tension or compression tests {{performed at the}} laminate level. While these test data serve as an excellent starting point in residual strength studies in small notch sizes, the need to evaluate and verify the residual strength for larger structures and at larger notch sizes region is still there. An experimental study was performed with the focus on large notch sizes of circular hole and narrow slit flaw configurations on laminates fabricated with a carbon/epoxy oven-cure capable prepreg material system. The current {{part of the study}} focused on uniaxial tension loading with a constant width and height to flaw dimension ratio. Experimental test data were then combined with lamina and laminate level data for residual strength curves generation and the curves were validated against Whitney-Nuismer and Mar-Lin fracture mechanics models. The effects of flaw sizes and the flaw type towards the residual strength capability of a laminate turn out to be substantial as the notch size gets larger than one inch. Test results showed that a narrow <b>slit</b> or <b>saw</b> cut damage is far more critical than a circular hole cut-out. The notch sensitivity order of a saw cut flaw is also roughly three times more than that of a circular hole. Analytical studies were also performed to evaluate several finite element method variable effects on residual strength prediction and to discover the best practice in stress analyses of notched composite laminates. Point Stress failure criterion was used in the analyses and predicted failure loads were compared to the experimental data. Good agreements and correlations were found between the analytical predictions and the experimental data. It can be concluded that the residual strength of a notched laminated composite can be reasonably predicted from finite element analyses...|$|R

It is caused by damage to postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic innervation of the eye, usually by a viral or bacterial infection. Adie’s syndrome includes diminished deep tendon reflexes. Outline of Cases. We report data of a 59 -year-old female with unequal pupil sizes. She complained of blurred vision and headache mainly while reading. She had a 35 -year history of hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. On exam, left pupil was mydriatic {{and there was no}} response to light and at <b>slit</b> lamp we <b>saw</b> segments of the sphincter constrict. We performed 0. 125 % pilocarpine test and there was a remarkable reduction of size in the left pupil. The second case is a 55 -year-old female who was referred to the University Eye Clinic because of a headache and mydriatic left pupil. She had diabetes mellitus type 2, as well as hepatitis A virus 20 years earlier. On exam, the left pupil was mydriatic, with no response to light. Test with diluted pilocarpine was positive. Neurological examinations revealed no abnormality in either case so we excluded Adie’s syndrome. Conclusion. Adie’s tonic pupil is benign neuro-ophthalmological disorder of unknown etiology.

40|$|The trim-loss, {{or cutting}} stock, problem arises {{whenever}} material manufactured continuously or in large pieces {{has to be}} cut into pieces of sizes ordered by customers. The problem is so to organize the cutting as to minimize {{the amount of waste}} (trim-loss) resulting from it. Brown (1971) remarks that no practical solution method has been found for the generalized 2 -dimensional trim-loss problem. This thesis discusses the applicability of heuristic search methods as solution techniques for this and other problems. Chapter 2 describes three types of combinatorial search method, state-space search, problem reduction, and branch-and-bound. There is a discussion {{of the ways in which}} heuristic information can be incorporated into these methods, and descriptions of the versions of the methods used in the work described in succeeding chapters. In the 1 -dimensional trim-loss problem order lengths of some material such as steel bars must be cut from stock lengths held by the supplier. Gilmore and Gomory (1961, 1963) have formulated a mathematical programming solution of this problem, which also arises with the slitting of steel rolls, cutting of <b>metal</b> pipe and <b>slitting</b> of cellophane rolls. Their approach has been developed by Haessler (1971, 1975) who is particularly concerned with problems arising in the paper industry. In the 1 ½-dimensional case the material is manufactured as a continuous sheet of constant width and it is required to minimize the length produced to satisfy orders for rectangular pieces. In the 2 -dimensional case the orders are again for rectangular pieces, but here the stock is held as large rectangular sheets. In both cases there may be restrictions as to the way in which the material may be cut; the generalized problem in each case occurs when no such restrictions exist. The 1 ½-dimensional problem appears to be easier of solution than the 2 -dimensional case since in the latter it is necessary not only to determine the relative positions of the required pieces in a cutting pattern, but also to partition the pieces into sets to be cut from separate stock sheets. A solution method for the easier problem might provide some insight into possible methods of solution of the more difficult. In chapter 3, a state-space search method for the solution of generalized 1 ½-dimensional problems where the number of pieces in the order list is fairly small and the dimensions are small integers is described. This method can be developed to solve 2 -dimensional problems in which the order list is fairly small and the size of stock sheets variable but affecting the cost of the material. This development is described in chapter 4. A similarly structured state-space search can be used for finding solutions to optimal network problems. Such searches do not prove the solutions they find to be optimal, so it is of interest also to develop a method for finding solutions to the problems that proves them to be optimal. In chapter 5 the state-space search method is compared with one using branch-and-bound. problems change when large numbers of identical pieces are ordered, so a solution method with a different structure is required. Chapter 6 describes a problem reduction method for generalized 2 -dimensional problems in which the order lists are large and the dimensions are small integers. Even when there are restrictions on the way in which the material may be cut, the presence of other constraints may make a mathematical formulation of the 2 -dimensional trim-loss problem intractable, so again a heuristic solution method may be desirable. In a problem where there are sequencing constraints on the design of successive cutting patterns, problem reduction is again found to provide a useful solution method. This is described in chapter 7. Some conclusions about the efficacy and potential of the methods used are drawn in chapter 8. The remainder of the present chapter is concerned with setting the work described in this thesis in the context of other work on the same and related problems...|$|R
