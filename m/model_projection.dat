To this end we use <b>model</b> <b>projections</b> from the UK Climate Projections 09 (UKCP 09) programme. We use a medium emissions scenario ensemble from the HadCM 3 climate model sensitivity tests. A continental shelf model (CS 3) with ~ 12 km resolution was used to separately simulate the waves and the surge. The models are forced by hourly wind and pressure data from the Met Office (Hadley Centre) regional climate model (RCM). Swell wave boundary conditions are generated over the full Atlantic using global climate model (GCM) winds. Analysis of {{significant changes in the}} statistics over time shows that there is little change in extreme wave and surge conditions in Liverpool Bay. Although there is a slight increase in the severity of the most extreme events, the frequency of extreme wind and wave events is slightly reduced, while the frequency of extreme surge events slightly increases over the 140 -year period. From the <b>model</b> <b>projections,</b> we find that the trends in the local wind are directly reflected in the wave field within Liverpool Bay.

Standard results in compressive sensing show {{that it is possible}} to exactly recover the signal x from only m [...] . measurements for certain types of matrices. Model-based compressive sensing reduces the number of measurements even further by limiting the supports of x to a subset of the [...] . possible supports. Such a family of supports is called a structured sparsity model. In this thesis, we introduce a structured sparsity model for two-dimensional signals that have similar support in neighboring columns. We quantify the change in support between neighboring columns with the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which measures both how many elements of the support change and how far the supported elements move. We prove that for a reasonable limit on the EMD between adjacent columns, we can recover signals in our model from only [...] . measurements, where w is the width of the signal. This is an asymptotic improvement over the [...] . bound in standard compressive sensing. While developing the algorithmic tools for our proposed structured sparsity model, we also extend the model-based compressed sensing framework. In order to use a structured sparsity model in compressive sensing, we need a <b>model</b> <b>projection</b> algorithm that, given an arbitrary signal x, returns the best approximation in the model. We relax this constraint and develop a variant of IHT, an existing sparse recovery algorithm, that works with approximate <b>model</b> <b>projection</b> algorithms. by Ludwig Schmidt. Thesis (S. M.)
