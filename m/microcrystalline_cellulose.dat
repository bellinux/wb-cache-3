Therefore, {{the purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effect of disintegrant type on the characteristics of FDTs. In this research, the tablets were fabricated by direct compression with the compression force of 1. 5 tons and using the different disintegrants components (chitin, chitosan, xylitol, <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>celluloses,</b> white bentonite and magnabite F). The physical properties of these tablets were determined. The xylitol tablets were rapidly disintegrated within 7 + 1 s, whereas that of the others was longer than 30 mins. The tablets containing the mixture of xylitol and other materials were subsequently fabricated since the hardness of the xylitol tablet was very poor. The disintegration time and wetting time of tablets containing 9 : 1 xylitol:Avicel PH 101 was shorter than that of the others. The contact angle of tablets containing xylitol and Avicel PH 101 at the ratio of 9 : 1 was lowest and surface free energy (SFE) of them was highest compared with the other formula.

Cellulose II samples were also spheronized in a Fuji Paudal spheronizer for 10 min at 1000 rpm. Products were analyzed for water sorption on a VTI ® symmetrical gravimetric analyzer in triplicates. The Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB), Hailwood-Horrobin (HH), Generalized D’Arcy and Watt (GDW) and Young and Nelson (YN) models were employed for the data analysis. Most of the sorption isotherms exhibited a type II sigmoid shape.

Melanoidins are multifunctional and biochemically active polymers which are formed in large extent during coffee roasting. Model systems composed of ACR (elimination studies) or glucose-asparagine (ACR formation/elimination studies) with/without melanoidins was heated at 180  °C. Washed sea sand and <b>cellulose</b> <b>microcrystalline</b> were used as matrix. Coffee melanoidins had a direct influence on the fate of ACR under heating, while the effect was not observed at room temperature. In addition, ACR decrease was also related to the reaction time and the initial amount of melanoidins in the media, where clearly a dose-response was observed. In contrast, pH (from 3. 5 to 7. 0) had no significant effect on ACR reactivity towards melanoidins. It is hypothesized that nucleophilic amino groups of amino acids from the proteinaceous backbone of melanoidins react via the Michael addition reaction with ACR, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Then, melanoidins could modulate the reaction pathways of ACR formation and elimination during coffee roasting and serve as acrylamide-mitigation substance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
