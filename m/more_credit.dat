5|$|Texas won {{the game}} 52–17 and moved into {{first place in the}} Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings {{for the first time since}} they were {{implemented}} in 1998. The BCS formula took into account strength of schedule so that teams received <b>more</b> <b>credit</b> for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while University of Southern California, who previously held the numberone spot, beat Washington, a 1–6 team.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives <b>more</b> <b>credit</b> to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved <b>more</b> <b>credit.</b> The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E

5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers <b>more</b> <b>credit</b> than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E

25|$|Equity co-ops are {{buildings}} {{in which individuals}} purchase a percentage share {{of the building and}} the land on which it is built tied to the square footage of their unit; all owners own the building collectively, with exclusive rights to occupy their own unit. <b>More</b> <b>credit</b> unions will offer financing against them than against co-ownerships. They are a relatively new form of construction, designed to encourage owner occupancy by having the building's corporation hold back a percentage of the unit's share equity to ensure owner occupancy. This legal structure is used as an alternative to condominium registration, either when the government will not allow conversion of an existing apartment building to a condominium, or to avoid the expense and difficulty of doing so.|$|E

DnC would delete part of the debt, and additional capital would be granted from Kosmos-owned Norsk Air. This was not sufficient, and on 29 April Coast Aero Center filed for bankruptcy.

[...] The reasons for their conflict were both personal (both men married dancer Jeanne Coyne) and professional (Donen always felt that Kelly did not treat him as an equal).

Tooze further contends that an insufficiently challenged Speer [...] "mythology" [...] (partly fostered by Speer himself through politically motivated, tendentious use of statistics and other propaganda) had led many historians to assign Speer far <b>more</b> <b>credit</b> for the increases in armaments production than was warranted and give insufficient consideration to the [...] "highly political" [...] function of the so-called armaments miracle.|$|E
500|$|Harding has {{traditionally}} been ranked {{as one of the}} worst presidents. In a 1948 poll conducted by Harvard University, historian Arthur M.

He has also been last in other polls since, which Ferrell attributes to scholars reading little but sensational accounts of Harding. Murray argued that Harding deserves <b>more</b> <b>credit</b> than historians have given: [...] "He was certainly the equal of a Franklin Pierce, an Andrew Johnson, a Benjamin Harrison, or even a Calvin Coolidge. In concrete accomplishments, his administration was superior to a sizable portion of those in the nation's history."
