50|$|When Stofor was born, Fenwood {{employed}} {{about six}} staff but this grew rapidly until there were forty eight, covering all aspects such design, procurement, production, software writing, sales and customer support. Sadly, {{with the rapid}} growth of fax and then the advent of email, demand for <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> such as Stofor died away and Fenwood moved into other markets, finally being wound up in the late 1990s. During their 'lives' Fenwood and Stofor were based in Farncombe, Godalming, Guildford; all in Surrey, UK and in Aldershot, Hampshire, UK.|$|R
50|$|Stofor {{was aimed}} {{squarely}} {{at the bottom}} end {{of the market and}} its competitors were from companies such as Chernikeeff (now John Lilley and Gillie Ltd) and Racal but Stofor was soon outselling both with ease. The Stofor range was based on a 4 MHz Zilog Z80 processor with 64K RAM and provided from 4 to 64 ports. Early models, and some later ones, were floppy disk based but later and larger versions had 10Mb Winchester technology hard disks for storage. Stofor was the only <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> of its size to boast a custom text editor designed by Fenwood with the needs of the telex user in mind. Its main workload was in the sending and receiving of telex messages but it was also put to work {{in a wide range of}} other communications areas including fax.|$|E

50|$|NetSys {{was founded}} {{for the purpose}} of {{developing}} network communications equipment and automatic <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems.</b> The first customer was the South African Defence Force which ordered a logistics network comprising some 50 nodes of proprietary networking devices. The experience gained during this deployment was instrumental in entering into the international market. In 1988, NetSys was awarded a contract by the American computer company, Control Data Corporation, to develop a meteorological message-switching system {{on the back of the}} NetSys network devices. This development and subsequent investment in aviation related product development enabled NetSys to become a major solutions supplier in the Meteorological and Aviation industries.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> was the {{precursor}} of packet <b>switching,</b> where <b>messages</b> were routed in their entirety, one hop at a time. It was first built by Collins Radio Company, Newport Beach, California, {{during the period}} 1959-1963 for sale to large airlines, banks and railroads. <b>Message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> are nowadays mostly implemented over packet-switched or circuit-switched data networks. Each message is treated as a separate entity. Each message contains addressing information, and at each switch this information is read and the transfer path to the next switch is decided. Depending on network conditions, a conversation of several messages may not be transferred over the same path. Each message is stored (usually on hard drive due to RAM limitations) before being transmitted to the next switch. Because of this it {{is also known as}} a 'store-and-forward' network. Email is a common application for <b>message</b> <b>switching.</b> A delay in delivering email is allowed, unlike real-time data transfer between two computers.|$|R

40|$|Modula {{is a new}} {{programming}} language for implementing dedicated, parallel systems. Following a systematic design technique, this paper illustrates the use of Modula {{for the design of}} a message switching communication system. A <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> poses a number of interesting problems: a high degree of concurrent activity exists, a variety of IO devices need to be controlled, messages can have multiple destinations, and messages can be preempted. The strengths and weaknesses of Modula with respect to these specific problems and its utility as a general purpose language are evaluated. Key Words and Phrases: structured multiprogramming, concurrent systems, Modula, message switching, software design, processes, monitors, modular design. CR Categories: 3. 81, 4. 2, 4. 21, 4. ...|$|E

Systemware allows the ready design or emulation of digital communication equipmnnt (e. g. <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system),</b> process controllers, peripheral controllers, digital computers, digital interfaces, equipment testers and exercisers etc. The paper describes a virgin (i. e. unprogrammed) systemware device known as LSP (Logical Signal Processor), and describes the corresponding process of system architecture using this device...|$|E
40|$|Delay {{tolerant}} network (DTN) is opportunistic network {{where each}} node searches best opportunity {{to deliver the}} message called bundle to the destination. DTN implements a store and forward <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> by simply introducing another new protocol layer called the Bundle Layer {{on top of the}} transport layer. The bundle layer is responsible for storing and forwarding entire message in message segments called bundles between source node and destination node. This paper evaluates the performance of delay tolerant network layer in heterogeneous highly dense mobile node environment. The heterogeneous network is created with the help of stationary wired node and Base Station node by introducing dynamic dense Mobile node network. Mobile nodes are assigned with continuous mobility. Three parameters are suggested Δ, Θ and λ to correlate the results obtained using rigorous simulation. Results show that after some threshold values, dense feature about mobile node does not pretend the delay cause for delay tolerant network packets. Also, increase in number of mobile node and number of File Transfer connection rarely change the overall performance of the delay tolerant network. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, 16 table...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Nascom systems for ground communications began in 1958 with Project Vanguard. The low-speed systems (rates less than 9. 6 Kbs) were developed following existing standards; but, {{there were no}} comparable standards for high-speed systems. As a result, these systems were developed using custom protocols and custom hardware. Technology has made enormous strides since the ground support systems were implemented. Standards for computer equipment, software, and high-speed communications exist {{and the performance of}} current workstations exceeds that of the mainframes used in the {{development of}} the ground systems. Nascom is in the process of upgrading its ground support systems and providing additional services. The <b>Message</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>System</b> (MSS), Communications Address Processor (CAP), and Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM) Automated Control System (MACS) are all examples of Nascom systems developed using standards such as, X-windows, Motif, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Also, the Earth Observing System (EOS) Communications (Ecom) project is stressing standards as an integral part of its network. The move towards standards has produced a reduction in development, maintenance, and interoperability costs, while providing operational quality improvement. The Facility and Resource Manager (FARM) project has been established to integrate the Nascom networks and systems into a common network management architecture. The maximization of standards and implementation of computer automation in the architecture will lead to continued cost reductions and increased operational efficiency. The first step has been to derive overall Nascom requirements and identify the functionality common to all the current management systems. The identification of these common functions will enable the reuse of processes in the management architecture and promote increased use of automation throughout the Nascom network. The MSS, CAP, MACS, and Ecom projects have indicated the potential value of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and standards through reduced cost and high quality. The FARM will allow the application of the lessons learned from these projects to all future Nascom systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{switching}} technique called virtual cut-through is proposed and its performance is analyzed. This <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> {{is very similar}} to <b>message</b> <b>switching,</b> with the difference that when a message arrives in an intermediate node and its selected outgoing channel is free (just after the reception of the header), then, in contrast o <b>message</b> <b>switching,</b> the <b>message</b> is sent out to the adjacent node towards its destination before it is received completely at the node; only if the message isblocked due to a busy output channel is a message buffered in an intermediate node. Therefore, the delay due to unnecessary buffering in front of an idle channel is avoided. We analyze and compare the performance of this new switching technique with that of mes-sage switching with respect to three measures: network delay, traffic gain and buffer storage requirement. Our analysis hows that cut-through switching is superior (and at worst identical) to <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> with respect o the above three performance measures...|$|R
