40|$|We {{explored}} the cortical dynamics during movements of an unaffected body part in tetraplegic subjects with chronic {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). The aims were {{to find out whether}} the intact movements were associated with a physiological time-varying pattern of activity in the motor-related cortical areas and whether the primary motor area (<b>MI)</b> <b>activation</b> followed a somatotopic distribution. Event-related potentials to self-initiated lip movements were analyzed by means of cortical source imaging of EEG recorded from seven tetraplegic subjects and seven control subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected on individual MRI and the time-varying electrophysiologic activity (cortical current density, CCD) was estimated on these ROIs and subjected to across-subject analysis. A significant, bilateral movement-related pattern of <b>MI</b> <b>activation</b> was detected during motor task execution in SCI patients as well as in controls. The site of local maxima activation displayed a symmetrical discrete distribution within MI, consistently with a putative somatotopic lip representation, in all the subjects. The supplementary motor area proper (SMAp) was always coactivated with MI and coactivation was characterized by a time course with typical premotion and motion phases over both motor areas. A clear-cut temporal delay between the SMAp and <b>MI</b> <b>activation</b> did not occur either in SCI patients or in controls. These findings obtained with noninvasive neuroelectrical source imaging document that in chronic SCI subjects "executive" motor areas are engaged with a preserved temporal and spatial pattern during preparation and execution of intact movements...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPurposeTimely trauma care is crucial, {{especially}} for severely injured patients. We developed {{a set of}} criteria based on physiological changes, anatomic regions injured, and trauma mechanisms in our hospital to identify these patients. This study was performed to examine whether or not our revised activation protocol was strictly followed, and to identify areas of deficiency for ongoing quality improvement. The impact of the activation protocol on clinical outcome was also examined. MethodsWe reviewed demographic data, mechanisms of injury, trauma scores, and outcome for all trauma patients admitted to a Level I trauma center in southern Taiwan between October 2010 and October 2011. All trauma protocol activation (TPA) decisions were subjected to careful scrutiny. Clinical outcomes for TPA patients and for non-TPA patients who fulfilled the <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> were compared. We also analyzed data for patients who did not meet our <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> but were found on subsequent work-up to have an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16. ResultsDuring Phase I of the study there were 2988 trauma admissions. The overall accuracy for TPA was 95. 9 %. Among 281 TPA patients, only 181 (64. 4 %) fulfilled the <b>activation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Among 204 patients who met the <b>activation</b> <b>criteria,</b> the protocol was not activated for 23 (11. 3 %). After we redesigned the computer program to prompt triage nurses and re-educated healthcare personnel, the false TPA and non-TPA rates improved to 14. 6 % and 2. 8 %, respectively, during Phase II of the study. There were 187 patients who did not meet our <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> and had ISS ≥ 16. TPA patients had a significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score {{and were more likely}} to be admitted to the intensive care unit than non-TPA patients. However, there were no significant differences in ISS, mortality, or admission days. Some 120 patients had a significant brain injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale–Head ≥ 2) and only 76 % of them presented with signs or symptoms suggesting head trauma. These patients were older and had a lower ISS compared to brain-injured TPA patients. ConclusionThe study shows that our TPA criteria are easy to follow and have a high accuracy rate. For patients with ISS ≥ 16 who did not meet our TPA criteria, escape was mainly due to head trauma. Additional factors besides GCS scores should be incorporated in the protocol to identify patients with significant head trauma...|$|R
40|$|Problem investigated: The {{activation}} {{and implementation}} of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) system. Procedures followed: The ability of the objective <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> to accurately identify patients at risk of three serious adverse events (cardiac arrest, unexpected death and unplanned intensive care admission) was assessed using a nested, matched case-control study. Sensitivity, specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were performed. The MET implementation process was studied using two convenience sample surveys of the nursing staff from the general wards of twelve intervention hospitals. These surveys measured the awareness and understanding of the MET system, level of attendance at MET education sessions, knowledge of the <b>activation</b> <b>criteria,</b> level of intention to call the MET and overall attitude to the MET system, and the hospital level of support for change, hospital capability and hospital culture. The association of these measures with the intention to call the MET and the level of MET utilisation was assessed using nonparametric correlation. Results obtained: The respiratory rate was missing in 20 % of subjects. Using listwise deletion, the set of objective <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> investigated predicted an adverse event within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 55. 4 % (50. 6 - 60. 0 %) and specificity of 93. 7 % (91. 2 - 95. 6 %). An analysis approach that assumed the missing values would not have resulted in MET activation provided a sensitivity of 50. 4 % (45. 7 - 55. 2 %) and specificity of 93. 3 % (90. 8 - 95. 3 %). Alternative models with modified cut-off values provided different results. The MET system was implemented with variable success during the MERIT study. Knowledge and understanding of the system, hospital readiness, and a positive attitude were all significantly positively associated with MET system utilisation, while defensive hospital cultures were negatively associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Major conclusions: The objective <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> studied have acceptable accuracy, but modification of the criteria may be considered. A satisfactory trade-off between the identification of patients at risk and workload requirements may be difficult to achieve. Measures of effectiveness of the implementation process may be associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Trials of the MET system should ensure good knowledge and understanding of the system, particularly amongst nursing staff...|$|R
40|$|The Microphthalmia basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-Leucine Zipper (bHLH-LZ) {{transcription}} factor (Mi) plays {{a crucial role}} in the genesis of melanocytes; mice deficient for a functional (Microphthalmia) gene product lack all pigment cells. We show here that the <b>Mi</b> <b>activation</b> domain resides N-terminal to the DNA-binding domain and that as little as 18 amino acids are sufficient to mediate transcription activation. The minimal <b>activation</b> region of <b>Mi</b> is highly conserved in the related {{transcription factor}} TFE 3 and is predicted to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. This region of Mi is also highly conserved with a region of E 1 A known to be essential for binding the CBP/p 300 transcription cofactor. Consistent with these observations, the <b>Mi</b> <b>activation</b> domain can interact in vitro with CBP specifically through a region of CBP required for complex formation with E 1 A, P/CAF and c-Fos, and anti p 300 antibodies can co-immunoprecipitate Mi from both melanocyte and melanoma cell lines. In addition, co-transfection of a vector expressing CBP 2 (aas 1621 - 1891) fused to the VP 16 activation domain potentiated the ability of Mi to activate transcription, confirming the significance of the CBP-Mi interaction observed in vitro.

In order to clarify the difference between the test temperature and real contact temperature, and to determine the effect of the real contact temperature for these reactions, we have calculated the contact temperatures using two well-known models and compare them with results of tribological experiments and some state-of-the-art analyses of wornsurfaces. The results suggest that the actual surface temperatures are 100 - 130 °C higher than the test temperatures. A contact temperature of about 250 - 260 °C was found to be the required key <b>activation</b> <b>criterion</b> for chemical reactions between the dialkyl dithiophosphate extreme-pressure (EP) additive and the DLC coating. Gradual formation of a tribochemical protective film from phosphates and organic sulphur/sulphates suggests a lower chemical reactivity and slower formation of the optimal tribochemical protective layer on DLC coatings than on steels. No tribological effect of anti-wear (AW) or EP additives could be found on the DLC coatings when the surface temperatures were below 120 - 140 °C. The temperature-induced graphitisation of the DLC that occurred in the contacts with the base oils, however, require about 250 °C of contact temperature.

If the vibrated hand has skin contact with the other hand, it is perceived as both hands bending. Using fMRI and TMS, we show that the <b>activation</b> in <b>MI</b> controlling the nonvibrated hand is compulsory for the somatic perception of the hand movement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between rapid response team (RRT) or cardiac arrest team (CAT) activation within 72  h of emergency admission and (i) physiological status in the emergency department (ED) and (ii) risk for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted in three hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. The exposed cohort (n= 660) included randomly selected adults admitted to the medical or surgical ward through the ED who had RRT or CAT activation within 72  h of admission. Unexposed matched controls (n= 1320) did not have RRT or CAT activation. RESULTS: The exposed cohort was more likely to have physiological abnormalities fulfilling hospital RRT <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> during ED care (36. 7 vs. 23. 8 %, P< 0. 001). After adjusting for confounders, tachypnoea (adjusted odds ratio= 1. 92, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 38 - 2. 67) or hypotension (AOR= 1. 43, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 00 - 2. 03), fulfilling RRT <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> during ED care, was associated with RRT or CAT activation within 72  h of admission. The exposed cohort had more in-hospital deaths (16. 5 vs. 3. 6 %, P< 0. 001), more unexpected in-hospital deaths (2. 05 vs. 0. 2 %, P< 0. 001), more ICU admissions (11. 8 vs. 0. 7 %, P< 0. 001) and longer lengths of hospital stay (median= 8 vs. 5 days, P< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: CAT/RRT activations within 72  h of emergency admission are associated with higher mortality and increased length of stay. Factors associated with CAT/RRT activation in the wards are often identifiable when patients are in the ED. Further studies are required to determine whether early identification and intervention in patients at risk for RRT or CAT activation can improve their eventual outcomes...|$|R
30|$|Our {{study had}} some {{limitations}} {{to take into}} consideration. First, in our study a single parameter track and trigger warning system was used. This system is comparable with the MET <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> studied by Cretikos et al., which have a positive predictive value of 10 % and a sensitivity of 50 % [30], implicating that the system would often trigger MET activation while the patient is not at risk for an adverse event. This may have been of influence on the adherence of the ward staff to the system. Second, in the medical records of SAE patients, often no exact time indication was recorded along with observed abnormal EWS. Therefore, timelines were defined in days on which ward physicians and MET were called following an abnormal EWS observation.|$|R
30|$|An {{experiment}} {{based on}} a driving simulator that was realized within a research project, namely ADVISORS, aimed at evaluating the effects of different <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> (different TTC thresholds) for a frontal collision warning system [5]. As time activation criteria, 4 s and 6  s were used alternatively for TTC, according to the deceleration rate accepted by the driver. For a warning before dangerous turns {{the majority of the}} drivers preferred to get a premature warning (that requires braking with a deceleration of 2  m/s 2). On the contrary, for warnings in relation to a leading vehicle, the criterion TTC[*]<[*] 6  s. and a maximum acceptable deceleration of 4  m/s 2 were favored. Summarizing, most drivers preferred to be warned rather earlier, however there were big variations in the preferences among drivers, suggesting the need for personalization of the warning system.|$|R
30|$|Many frontal {{collision}} avoidance systems use as <b>activation</b> <b>criterion</b> just the Time Headway (T_headway) or the Time to Collision (TTC). Both values are calculated by the vehicle electronic system, using the data (speed and {{distance to the}} leading vehicle) measured by the vehicle sensors. When TTC or T_headway becomes less than a predefined value (TTClimit or T_headwaylimit), the system warns the driver. Furthermore, there are systems that use different TTC warning thresholds for different types of warnings/actions (e.g. TTClimit[*]≤[*] 4  s. for a simple optical warning; TTClimit[*]≤[*] 2.5  s. for acoustical warning; TTClimit[*]≤[*] 1.5  s. for automatic vehicle braking, etc. [9]. However, adopting a common TTClimit or T_headwaylimit for all drivers is erroneous and may be proven disturbing (for drivers used to drive nearer to the leading vehicle) and even dangerous (for a very slow driver).|$|R

40|$|Background: To our knowledge, {{detection}} of cardiorespiratory instability using noninvasive monitoring via electronic integrated monitoring systems (IMSs) in intermediate or step-down units (SDUs) {{has not been}} described. We undertook this study to characterize respiratory status in an SDU population, to define features of cardiorespiratory instability, and to evaluate an IMS index value that should trigger medical emergency team (MET) activation. Methods: This descriptive, prospective, single-blinded, observational study evaluated all patients in a 24 -bed SDU in a university medical center during 8 weeks from November 16, 2006, to January 11, 2007. An IMS (BioSign; OBS Medical, Carmel, Indiana) was inserted into the standard noninvasive hardwired monitoring system and used heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry to develop a single neural networked signal, or BioSign Index (BSI). Data were analyzed for cardiorespiratory instability according to BSI trigger value and local MET <b>activation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Staff were blinded to BSI data collected in 326 patients (total census). Results: Data for 18 248 hours of continuous monitoring were captured. Data for peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry were absent in 30 % of monitored hours despite being a standard of care. Cardiorespiratory status in most patients (243 of 326 [74. 5 %]) was stable throughout their SDU stay, and instability in the remaining patients (83 of 326 [25 %]) was exhibited infrequently. We recorded 111 MET <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> events caused by cardiorespiratory instability in 59 patients, but MET activation for this cause occurred in only 7 patients. All MET events were detected by BSI in advance (mean, 6. 3 hours) in a bimodal distribution (> 6 hours and ≤ 45 minutes).

40|$|Microphthalmia (Mi) is a bHLHZip {{transcription}} factor {{that is essential}} for melanocyte development and postnatal function. It is thought to regulate both differentiated features of melanocytes such as pigmentation as well as proliferation/survival, based on phenotypes of mutant mouse alleles. Mi activity is controlled by at least two signaling pathways. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) promotes transcription of the Mi gene through cAMP elevation, resulting in sustained Mi up-regulation over many hours. c-Kit signaling up-regulates Mi function through MAP kinase phosphorylation of Mi, thereby recruiting the p 300 transcriptional coactivator. The current study reveals that c-Kit signaling triggers two phosphorylation events on Mi, which up-regulate transactivation potential yet simultaneously target Mi for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The specific activation/degradation signals derive from MAPK/ERK targeting of serine 73, whereas serine 409 serves as a substrate for p 90 Rsk- 1. An unphosphorylatable double mutant at these two residues is at once profoundly stable and transcriptionally inert. These c-Kit-induced phosphorylations couple transactivation to proteasome-mediated degradation. c-Kit signaling thus triggers short-lived <b>Mi</b> <b>activation</b> and net <b>Mi</b> degradation, {{in contrast to the}} profoundly increased Mi expression after MSH signaling, potentially explaining the functional diversity of this {{transcription factor}} in regulating proliferation, survival, and differentiation in melanocytes...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, system {{architecture}} of the fifth generation (5 G) cellular system is becoming of increasing interest. To reach the ambitious 5 G targets, a dense base station (BS) deployment paradigm is being considered. In this case, the conventional always-on service approach may not be suitable due to the linear energy/density relationship when the BSs are always kept on. This suggests a dynamic on/off BS operation to reduce the energy consumption. However, this approach may create coverage holes and the BS activation delay in terms of hardware transition latency and software reloading could result in service disruption. To tackle these issues, we propose a predictive BS activation scheme under the control/data separation architecture (CDSA). The proposed scheme exploits user context information, network parameters, BS sleep depth and measurement databases to send timely predictive activation requests in advance before the connection is switched to the sleeping BS. An analytical model is developed and closed-form expressions are provided for the predictive <b>activation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Analytical and simulation {{results show that the}} proposed scheme achieves a high BS activation accuracy with low errors w. r. t. the optimum activation time...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} points toward activated fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts, as one of the leading mediators in several major human pathologies including proliferative fibrotic disorders, invasive tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. Niemann-Pick Type C 2 (NPC 2) protein has been recently identified as a product of the second gene in NPC disease. It encodes ubiquitous, highly conserved, secretory protein with the poorly defined function. Here we show that NPC 2 deficiency in human fibroblasts confers their activation. The activation phenomenon was not limited to fibroblasts as it was also observed in aortic smooth muscle cells upon silencing NPC 2 gene by siRNA. More importantly, activated synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were also identified as NPC 2 -deficient at both the NPC 2 mRNA and protein levels. The molecular mechanism responsible for activation of NPC 2 -null cells was shown to be a sustained phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which fulfills both the sufficient and necessary fibroblast <b>activation</b> <b>criteria.</b> All of these findings highlight a novel mechanism where NPC 2 by negatively regulating ERK 1 / 2 MAPK phosphorylation may efficiently suppress development of maladaptive tissue remodeling and inflammation...|$|R

Data were collected from the records of 200 randomly selected adults with presenting complaints of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain and febrile illness from 1 January to 31 December 2014 at a 22 bed emergency department in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: When controlled for length of stay, heart rate was the most frequently assessed vital sign per hour (median= 0. 9) whilst Glasgow Coma Score was the least frequently assessed vital sign per hour (median= 0. 5). Clinical deterioration (one or more vital signs fulfilling hospital medical emergency team <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> during emergency department care) occurred in 14. 5 % of patients. Of the 5466 vital sign measures, 19. 6 % were abnormal, 1. 9 % indicated clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical deterioration occurred in one in seven patients, and one in five vital signs documented were outside of accepted normal ranges. Thus, emergency department physiological status has implications for patient safety and nursing practice, in particular clinical handover for patients requiring hospital admission...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMortality and {{morbidity}} in trauma {{remain a}} major problem in developing countries. Organized emergency response systems for transfer of trauma patients to hospitals are absent and the consequent delays could cause significant complications. AimsThis study assessed the outcomes as a result of hospital transfer and delays in trauma patients. MethodsThe study was based on trauma patients presenting to the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan from 1998 to 2005, meeting the trauma team <b>activation</b> <b>criteria.</b> Data were collected and entered in a Trauma Registry. The study focused on analyzing the outcomes of injury to delay in definitive treatment and survival. ResultsOut of 978 patients, only 303 (30. 9 %) patients reached the emergency room (ER) within an hour. The mean time from injury occurrence to arrival in the ER was 4. 7 h. There {{was no significant difference in}} mortality between all patients presenting early and those with more than 1 h delay (OR= 0. 9, 95 % CI: 0. 6, 1. 5). ConclusionsTransfer and delay in admission to a tertiary care center does not affect in-hospital mortality of trauma patients in a setting with no emergency response system. This may be due to self selection of patients who survive long enough to reach the hospital...|$|R
40|$|The Thick Level Set (TLS) {{approach}} {{applied to}} damage models {{allows for a}} nonlocal treatment that prevents from spurious localization problems. In previous works, isotropic damage models with a single scalar parameter were adopted. Under these conditions, a single level set was used to separate the undamaged zone from the damaged zone, and damage growth was expressed as a level set propagation. Schematically, in the damaged zone, the damage variable directly depended on the level set through an explicit function. Beyond a critical length, material was assumed as fully damaged, thus allowing for a natural transition from damage to localized cracking (i. e., strain localization). In this paper, {{a first step toward}} the extension of the TLS approach to “bi-dissipative” isotropic damage models is presented. In the adopted formulation, degradation of material properties under prevailing compressive/tensile loading conditions is separately treated. Two distinct damage variables and <b>activation</b> <b>criteria</b> are used. This allows taking into account the degradation of material properties in tension due to compressive damage (for the moment, no unilateral effect is accounted for). In the article, the local damage model and its mathematical properties are discussed first. A strategy for dealing with bi-dissipative damage in the framework of a TLS approach is then presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{skeletal muscle}} raises {{a number of}} philosophical questions, particularly {{in the realm of}} the relationship between different possible levels of representation and explanation. After a brief incursion into this area, a list of desiderata is proposed as a guiding principle for the construction of a viable model, including: comprehensiveness, soundness, experimental consistency, predictive ability and refinability. Each of these principles is illustrated by means of simple examples. The presence of internal constraints, such as incompressibility, may lead to counterintuitive results. A one-panel example is exploited to advocate the use of the principle of virtual work as the ideal tool to deal with these situations. The question of stability in the descending limb of the force-length relation is addressed and a purely mechanical analogue is suggested. New experimental results confirm the assumption that fibre stiffness is positive even in the descending limb. The indeterminacy of the force-sharing problem is traditionally resolved by optimizing a, presumably, physically meaningful target function. After presenting some new results in this area, based on a separation theorem, it is suggested that a more fundamental approach to the problem is the abandoning of optimization criteria in favour of an explicit implementation of <b>activation</b> <b>criteria...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractParametric resonance, as a {{resonant}} amplification phenomenon, is {{a superior}} mechanical amplifier than direct resonance {{and has already}} been demonstrated to possess the potential to offer over {{an order of magnitude}} higher power output for vibration energy harvesting than the conventional direct excitation. However, unlike directly excited systems, parametric resonance has a minimum threshold amplitude that must be attained prior to its activation. The authors have previously presented the addition of initial spring designs to minimise this threshold, through non-resonant direct amplification of the base excitation that is subsequently fed into the parametric resonator. This paper explores the integration of auto-parametric resonance, as a form of resonant amplification of the base excitation, to further minimise this <b>activation</b> <b>criterion</b> and realise the profitable regions of parametric resonance at even lower input acceleration levels. Numerical and experimental results have demonstrated in excess of an order of magnitude reduction in the initiation threshold amplitude for an auto-parametric resonator (∼ 0. 6 ms− 2) as well as several folds lower for a parametric resonator with a non-resonant base amplifier (∼ 4. 0 ms− 2), as oppose to a sole parametric resonator without any threshold reduction mechanisms (10 's ms− 2). Therefore, the superior power performance of parametric resonance over direct resonance has been activated and demonstrated at much lower input levels...|$|R
