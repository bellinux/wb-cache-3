Because magnetic field sensing is distributed around circumference, it is unaffected by stray magnetic fields, {{and there is no}} need for magnetic centering. It also does not need recalibration after installation or during its service life. [...] Because the optical fiber is inherently insulating, electrical isolation is easier to maintain.|$|E

However, the entire structure of the cathode, deflection yokes, anode and overall vacuum tube size is much larger, therefore made out of steel, not glass, with the main central open midsection of the vacuum tube hollow, leaving room for the scan table and object or person to lie while the scan is performed.|$|R
40|$|Soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>yokes,</b> cores, and poles, {{as well as}} {{permanent}} magnets are the potential magnetic components of an electromagnetic microactuator system. Depending on {{the requirements of the}} actuator, soft magnetic materials, hard magnetic materials or a combination of both have to be applied. Their design and fabrication as well as their integration into coil systems is one aspect of the Collaborate Research Center Design and Fabrication of Active Microsystems (Sonderforschungsbereich 516). The investigations presented in this paper cover alternative technologies for depositing various magnetic materials as well as their capability of being utilized for fabricating electromagnetic Microsystems. In the area of soft magnetic materials, the application of NiFe (Permalloy) in various compositions was investigated. Technologies utilized for their deposition were electroplating, sputtering, and gas flow sputtering. For fabricating rather thick soft magnetic micro structures with heights of up to 70 m, electroplating is particularly well suited. In the area of hard magnetic materials, sputtering was applied for depositing Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo). Hereby, layers with a thickness of up to 50 m with very good hard magnetic properties were deposited and patterned using wet chemical etching. This work was sponsored in part by the German Research Foundation as part of their support for the collaborative research center Design and Fabrication of Active Microsystems...|$|R

The necessity to consider higher space harmonic waves of a current layer, <b>magnetic</b> induction and <b>yoke</b> flux is shownin case of feeding by unbalanced stator voltages. The attention is paid especially to the third space harmonics that may negativelly influence properties of the five-phase machine in this case...|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> is a {{hand-held}} device that induces {{a magnetic field}} between two poles. Common applications are for outdoor use, remote locations, and weld inspection. The draw back of magnetic yokes is that they only induce a magnetic field between the poles, so large-scale inspections using the device can be time-consuming. For proper inspection the yoke needs to be rotated 90 degrees for every inspection area to detect horizontal and vertical discontinuities. Subsurface detection using a yoke is limited. These systems used dry magnetic powders, wet powders, or aerosols.|$|E
5000|$|The linear {{eddy current}} brake {{consists}} of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> with electrical coils positioned along the rail, which are being magnetized alternating as south and north magnetic poles. This magnet does not touch the rail, but is held at a constant small distance from the rail of approximately 7 mm (the {{eddy current brake}} {{should not be confused}} with another device, the magnetic brake, in wide use in railways, which exerts its braking force by friction of a brake shoe with the rail). It works the same as a disk eddy current brake, by inducing closed loops of eddy current in the conductive rail, which generate counter magnetic fields which oppose the motion of the train.|$|E
50|$|The DPS employs two linear {{actuators}} and a central pivoting armature {{that holds the}} iris. The two parallel {{linear actuators}} have coordinated motion {{in such a way}} as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.|$|E

Voltages induced in the loops during discharge of the solenoid will be sampled on-line during the entire discharge and integrated off-line to provide a measurement of the initial magnetic flux density in steel at the maximum field to an accuracy of a few percent. Although the discharge of the solenoid is rather slow (190 s time constant), the influence of eddy currents induced in the yoke elements should be estimated. The calculation of eddy currents is performed with Vector Fields program ELEKTRA. The results of calculations are reported...|$|R

As a result the scanning system for the sup 8 sup 4 Kr sup 1 sup 5 sup + ion beam extracted from the cyclotron IC- 100 has been chosen and worked up. It consists of two deflecting yokes creating horizontal and vertical <b>magnetic</b> fields. The <b>yokes</b> are supplied by generators of saw-tooth current having the definitely fixed frequencies. When both generators work synchronously the centre of mass of the ion beam 'draws' a pattern on the target. The dimensions of the pattern cells {{are determined by the}} ratio of these frequencies. The correlation between the generator frequencies when heterogeneity of the particle density distribution does not exceed the required value of +- 5 % is obtained. It has been shown that for the moving target the chosen scanning scheme allows one to obtain its uniform density distribution. For the slow target velocities (20 - 50 cm/s) this scheme also allows one to compensate the collapse in the particle density distribution on the target when the protective beam interruption occurs on time up to 0. 3 s. The short description of the deflection yokes construction, their parameters, the scheme of the scanning generators and first results of their stand tests are presented...|$|R
40|$|Many {{experiments}} in nuclear and neutron physics {{are confronted with}} the problem that they use a superconducting magnetic spectrometer which potentially affects other experiments by their stray magnetic field. The retardation spectrometer aSPECT consists, inter alia, of a superconducting magnet system that produces a strong longitudinal magnetic field of up to 6. 2 T. In order not to disturb other {{experiments in}} the vicinity of aSPECT, we had to develop a <b>magnetic</b> field return <b>yoke</b> for the magnet system. While the return yoke must reduce the stray magnetic field, the internal magnetic field and its homogeneity should not be affected. As in many cases, the magnetic shielding for aSPECT must manage with limited space. In addition, we must ensure that the additional magnetic forces on the magnet coils are not destructive. In order to determine the most suitable geometry for the magnetic shielding for aSPECT, we simulated a variety of possible geometries and combinations of shielding materials of non-linear permeability. The results of our simulations were checked through magnetic field measurements both with Hall and nuclear magnetic resonance probes. The experimental data are in good agreement with the simulated values: The mean deviation from the simulated exterior magnetic field is (- 1. 7 +/- 4. 8) %. However, in the two critical regions, the internal magnetic field deviates by 0. 2 % respectively < 1 E- 4 from the simulated values...|$|R

The precise fieldmapper measurements are done in 33840 points inside a cylinder of 1. 724 m radius and 7 m long at central fields of 2, 3, 3. 5, 3. 8, and 4 T. Three components of the magnetic flux density at the CMS coil maximum excitation and the remanent fields on the steel-air interface after discharge of the coil are measured in check-points with 95 3 -D B-sensors located near the <b>magnetic</b> flux return <b>yoke</b> elements.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} Barkhausen Noise {{technique is}} a well suited method for the characterization of ferromagnetic materials. Most sensors are composed of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> that excites the electromagnetic field in the material, and a coil or Hall-Element, which is located between both feet of the yoke to record the Barkhausen Noise. Due to both factors, the overall size of the sensors and the spot size at the material are relatively large. For some applications, Barkhausen Noise Sensors for miniaturized samples with complex geometries are needed, for example for small mass-production components or measurements inside of boreholes. Therefore, a new design for a Barkhausen Noise sensor was developed. The principle of exciting the Magnetic Field changes from a <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> to a thin tip. The alternating current flows through the tip into the material and induces a magnetic field, which in turn generates the Barkhausen Noise. A small coil wounded around the tip, records the Barkhausen Noise signal. With this design, the contact point between sensor and material is very small {{and it is possible}} to apply the sensor to very small samples or inside boreholes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The Barkhausen {{effect is}} a {{response}} of a ferromagnetic material, that is its magnetic domains, to an imposed external alternating magnetic field. A sensor unit {{makes it possible to}} capture the so-called voltage signal of the magnetic Barkhausen noise that represents mapping of the individual characteristics of the material microstructure. The paper gives a comparison of a classical sensor unit having the magnetising and detecting sections separated and a compact sensor unit. The aim was to reduce the volume of the passive sensor unit and possibly increase the accuracy, sensibility and reliability of calibration curves. To this end two compact sensor units were developed. The first one consists of a detection coil integrated into a gap of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke.</b> A comparison was made of the results obtained with a compact sensor unit having an additional ferrite core and a detection section integrated as well in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke.</b> The sensor units were tested using the so-called calibration curves showing the dependence between an individual parameter searched for and a degree of cold deformation known in advance. The reference curves of calibration of cold deformation of the material plotted as functions of the calculated power of the voltage signal, the variance, the Vrms of the voltage signal, and other estimators will be shown {{as a starting point for}} practical applications in the industrial environment. The magnetic method based on the Barkhausen noise thus permits a direct, that is non-destructive...|$|E

Finite element modelling was used to simulate the magnetic performance of the newly developed yoke, which was found to agree well with the experimental measurement. With the developed MR polishing apparatus, the effects of trough speed, work and excitation gap width, particle concentration within the MR fluid and workpiece size on the material removal rate were systematically investigated. Final tests were performed on glass specimens to examine the polishing performance. The polishing area in the developed process was much larger than that of the conventional MR finishing process with a carrier wheel and ultra-smooth surface of 1 nm in R-a was achieved.

A fast system of only 250 s pulse duration has therefore been developed, using a half-sine excitation pulse with a superimposed third harmonic. The short pulse duration requires very thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke</b> laminations, which can not easily be stamped and stacked. Profiting from a development for the LHC beam dump kicker magnets, the yoke is therefore built-up from tapewound cylindrical cores, employing 50 m thick Si-steel tape.

40|$|Team problem 2 D is {{specially}} {{challenging to}} many field theory codes {{in that it}} seeks to determine the force on a highly saturated rod which is centered inside a <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke.</b> The magnetic fields near the edges of this rod are nearly singular in nature: any attempt to predict the forces using the magnetic fields around the rod, for example, with Maxwell stress tensor, would most likely meet with failure. Most finite element codes approach the calculation of force using the Coulomb energy technique [1], wherein the necessary derivatives on the magnetic field energy are taken inside the variational integrals.

An {{inhomogeneous magnetic field}} {{gives rise to a}} reversible actuation effect, which {{is the result of the}} competition between magnetic and elastic forces in the material. MRE are capable to perform more sophisticated deformations than known rigid actuator materials. In this connection, the actuation behavior of MRE ring-shaped bodies in a valve-type device for the control of an air flow is demonstrated. For this purpose, MRE rings with different hardness were prepared and used in the valve. Additionally, the actuation of anisotropic MRE was compared with that of isotropic samples. The inhomogeneity of the magnetic field at the MRE material which is required for the actuation could be strongly influenced by the shape of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke.</b> In the study, the closing characteristics of the valve with different yoke shapes and MRE materials were evaluated by measuring the dependence of the air flow rate on the magnetic field strength.

The motor is a polyphase multipole square-wave PM motor, {{which can be}} classified {{as a kind of}} PM brushless dc motor. The distinct features of the proposed motor as compared with that of the conventional PM brushless dc motor lie in that: firstly, the multipole magnetic circuit arrangement enables the minimization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>yoke,</b> resulting in the reduction of motor volume and weight; secondly, the coil span is purposely designed to be equal to one slot pitch, thus saving in copper used; thirdly, by using fractional number of slots per pole per phase the arrangement of numbers of poles and slots is so unique that the magnetic force between stator and rotor at any rotating position is uniform, hence eliminating the cogging torque which usually occurs in PM motors; finally, the motor can be controlled to operate at constant torque region and constant power region with field weakening, thus both high starting torque and high cruising speed can be achieved. Therefore, as the proposed motor drive possesses distinct advantages of high power density, high efficiency and superior dynamic performance, it is very suitable for EV applications.
