50|$|Inelastic {{electron}} tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is {{an experimental}} tool {{for studying the}} vibrations of molecular adsorbates on metal oxides. It yields vibrational spectra of the adsorbates with high resolution (< 0.5 meV) and high sensitivity (< 1013 molecules are required to provide a spectrum). An additional advantage {{is the fact that}} optically forbidden transitions may be observed as well. Within IETS, an oxide layer with molecules adsorbed on it is put between two metal plates. A bias voltage is applied between the two contacts. An energy diagram of the <b>metal-oxide-metal</b> device under bias is shown in the top figure. The metal contacts are characterized by a constant density of states, filled up to the Fermi energy. The metals are assumed to be equal. The adsorbates are situated on the oxide material.

If the insulator is thin enough, there is a finite probability that the incident electron tunnels through the barrier. Since the energy of the electron is not changed by this process, it is an elastic process. This is shown in the left figure.|$|E

A great challenge for the RRAM production is todevelop a well-performing RS device compatible with a highly scalable CMOS technology. Among the group IV metal oxides, ZrO 2 is of interest for RRAM because of its chemicalsimilarity to HfO 2 (exploited for high-k gate and RRAM applications) {{and because it is}} a fastion conducting material.

30|$|Conventional flash {{memories}} are facing their physical and practical limits, so searching of new possible candidates for non-volatile memory applications {{has become very}} much necessary. Regarding this, several new memory types have been suggested as the next-generation non-volatile memory candidates [1, 2]. Among these, {{resistive random access memory}} (RRAM) is being considered as the best candidate for the replacement of conventional memories due to its unique features such as high scaling capability, long memory holding time, smaller device size, fast switching speed, low energy utilization, non-volatility, and simple structure [3]. The memory cell of RRAM is a capacitor-like, <b>metal-oxide-metal</b> (MOM) structure. The bipolar resistive switching (BRS) and unipolar RS (URS) behaviors between two resistance states, i.e., low resistance state (LRS) and high resistance state (HRS) of a resistor film, can be achieved by applying external voltage with appropriate magnitude and polarities [4 – 6].|$|E

Pt/ZrO 2 /Ti/Pt devices show unipolar RS for oxide thicknesses of 11 – 18 [*]nm. The devices with O 3 grown ZrO 2 show higher yield {{in comparison to the}} ones with H 2 O processed oxide. The switching polarity of the Pt/ZrO 2 /Ti/Pt cells depends on the thickness of the Ti electrode layer. The increase of the Ti layer thickness leads to a change in switching polarity from unipolar to bipolar.

40|$|Stationary {{contacts}} {{of practical}} applications under nominal current operation may exhibit nonlinear behaviour. This {{may be attributed}} to the microstructures metal-isolator-metal, <b>metal-oxide-metal</b> and metal-gas-metal which are formed on the apparent contacting area, as oxides and other chemical compounds create interfacial layers. Work function changes of the contacting metals can modulate the effective barrier height and width, resulting in a significant change of the crossing resistance in contacts, even during a time interval of the period. Nonlinear behaviour is developed beyond a threshold field value determinated by the voltage drop at the contact. According to the experimental results it becomes evident that at the stage of moderate degradation, tunnelling occurs. An equivalent circuit is proposed which is valid for stationary contacts of practical applications. The theoretic investigation is based upon commonly accepted relations concerning quantum mechanical tunnelling.

40|$|Resistive {{switching}} heterojunctions, {{which are}} promising for nonvolatile memory applications, usually share a capacitorlike <b>metal-oxide-metal</b> configuration. Here, {{we report on}} the nonvolatile resistive switching in Pt/LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 heterostructures, where the conducting layer near the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface serves as the "unconventional"bottom electrode although both oxides are band insulators. Interestingly, the switching between low-resistance and high-resistance states is accompanied by reversible transitions between tunneling and Ohmic characteristics in the current transport perpendicular to the planes of the heterojunctions. We propose that the observed resistive switching is likely caused by the electric-field-induced drift of charged oxygen vacancies across the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface and the creation of defect-induced gap states within the ultrathin LaAlO 3 layer. These metal-oxide-oxide heterojunctions with atomically smooth interfaces and defect-controlled transport provide a platform for the development of nonvolatile oxide nanoelectronics that integrate logic and memory devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a <b>metal-oxide-metal</b> (MOM) tunnel diode made of nickel, nickel-oxide, and gold, designed and fabricated by standard integrated circuit technology for use in FIR rectennas, are presented. The MOM tunnel diode was formed by overlapping a 0. 8 -micron-wide layer of 1000 -A of nickel, which was oxidized to form {{a thin layer of}} nickel oxide, with a 1500 A-thick layer of gold. The dc current-voltage {{characteristics of}} the MOM diode showed that the current dependence on voltage was linear about zero bias up to a bias of about 70 mV. The maximum detection of a low-level signal (10 -mV ac) was determined to be at a dc voltage of 70 mV across the MOM diode. The rectified output signal due to a chopped 10. 6 -micron CO 2 laser incident upon the rectenna device was found to increase with dc bias, with a maximum value of 1000 nV for a junction bias of 100 mV at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|A {{peak in the}} UV {{region of}} the {{spectrum}} of light emitted from <b>metal-oxide-metal</b> (MOM) tunnel junctions has been observed at room temperature. Both the amplitude and wavelength of the peak are sensitive to applied junction bias. The UV peak corresponds to the normal or radiative surface plasmon mode while a visible peak, also present in the present spectra and reported in past MOM literature, {{is due to the}} tangential or nonradiative mode. The radiative mode requires no surface roughness or gratings for photon coupling. The results show {{that it is possible to}} obtain radiative surface plasmon production followed by a direct decay into photons with MOM tunnel diodes. A MOM diode with a double anode structure is found to emit light associated only with the nonradiative mode. The thickness dependence of the UV peak, along with the experimental results of the double anode MOM diode and the ratio of the UV peak to visible peak, support the contention that the UV light emission is indeed due to the radiative surface plasmon...|$|E

40|$|<b>Metal-Oxide-Metal</b> diodes {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of directly rectifying infrared radiation. To be effective for sensing or energy harvesting they must be coupled to an antenna which produces intense fields at the diode. While antennas significantly increase the effective capture area of the MOM diode, it is still limited and maximizing the captured energy is still a challenging goal. In this work we investigate integrating MOM diodes with a slot antenna Frequency Selective Surface (FSS). This maximizes the electromagnetic capture area while minimizing the transmission line length which helps reduce losses because metal losses are much lower at DC than at infrared frequencies. Our design takes advantage of a single self-aligned patterning step using shadow evaporation. The structure is optimized at 10. 6 µm to have less than 2 % reflection (polarization sensitive) and simulations predict that 70 % of the incident energy is dissipated into the oxide layer.
