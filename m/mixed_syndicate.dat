50|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Jean Hamon, {{who had made}} his fortune in property development, and his gift to the Conseil général of Hauts-de-Seine of nearly 200 paintings and sculptures with a total value of 7.5 million Euros, stored at Hamon's castle at Bullion (Yvelines). That Conseil général was then presided over by Charles Pasqua. A <b>mixed</b> <b>syndicate,</b> with Charles Pasqua and André Santini (UDF deputy mayor of Issy-les-Moulineaux) as co-presidents, was created in 2000. In 2003, a judge in Versailles {{was surprised to see}} the département invest (without control over the funds) 800,000 Euros for the storage and conservation of the works. Charles Pasqua and André Santini, as well as many other civil servants, were indicted in the case in mid-2003. Also, Nicolas Sarkozy could also be involved in the affair, according to Libération, since the Conseil général continued to make such payments to Hamon for a year after Sarkozy became its president. The <b>mixed</b> <b>syndicate</b> has to pay expenses to Hamon until 2011. The foundation collapsed and its construction permit was cancelled after an appeal launched by ecologists and local residents.|$|E

50|$|The kind of {{economic}} order envisaged by the early distributist thinkers would involve the return {{to some sort of}} guild system. The present existence of labor unions does not constitute a realization of this facet of distributist economic order, as labour unions are organized along class lines to promote class interests and frequently class struggle, whereas guilds are <b>mixed</b> class <b>syndicates</b> composed of both employers and employees cooperating for mutual benefit, thereby promoting class collaboration.|$|R

50|$|Despite being a major network, in {{addition}} to not carrying national morning and evening newscasts, Fox also does not air any network daytime programming (such as soap operas, game shows or talk shows). Because of this, the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates handle the responsibility of programming daytime hours with syndicated or locally produced programming (corporate sister 20th Television distributes several syndicated daytime programs carried by many Fox stations, such as Divorce Court and The Wendy Williams Show; Fox Television Stations also test markets certain series from 20th Television and other syndicators such as Warner Bros. Television Distribution that are proposed for national distribution on some of its stations). The network also does not carry network-supplied children's programming on Saturday mornings or late-night programming on Monday through Friday nights. Local affiliates either produce their own programming or run syndicated programs during these time periods. Because of the erratic scheduling of the network's sports programming, many Fox stations choose to run a <b>mix</b> of <b>syndicated</b> programming, infomercials and especially movies to fill weekend afternoon timeslots when a sports event is not scheduled to air.|$|R

50|$|The UHF channel 33 {{allocation}} in Dallas-Fort Worth {{has been}} licensed to {{and operated by}} several companies over five decades of operation. The first television station to occupy the channel was KMEC, an independent station that signed on the air on October 1, 1967; {{it was the second}} UHF television station to sign on in the market, after KFWT-TV (channel 21, allocation now occupied by independent station KTXA), which debuted two weeks earlier on September 19. Founded by Maxwell Electronics Corporation (owned by Carroll Maxwell, who also served as its general manager), the station aired a <b>mix</b> of <b>syndicated</b> and locally produced programming, among which included the public affairs program Dallas Speaks (hosted by Jim Underwood, who previously worked at CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (channel 4, now KDFW) as a reporter), and children's programs Bozo's Big Top (a localized version of the Bozo the Clown franchise, which would eventually become synonymous with the version aired by KDAF's present-day Chicago sister station WGN-TV from 1966 to 2001 after it became a national superstation) and Colonel Pembroke's Funtime. Due to financial losses incurred on the venture, the station ceased operations on October 25, 1968.|$|R
50|$|WKBS' {{schedule}} {{was typical of}} most independent stations of the time, with a <b>mix</b> of off-network <b>syndicated</b> programs, children's programs, movies, and local-interest shows, including a dance show hosted by local radio personality Hy Lit, which also aired on {{at least three of}} Kaiser's other stations: WKBD-TV in Detroit, WKBG-TV in Boston and WKBF-TV in Cleveland. In addition, WKBS aired shows produced by other Kaiser stations, such as The Lou Gordon Program from WKBD. In a controversial 1972 episode, then-Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo, frustrated with Gordon's line of questioning, walked out of the interview. In the mid-1970s, WKBS also aired ABC shows that WPVI-TV (channel 6) preempted in favor of local programming, and during the 1976-77 season, it aired NBC shows preempted by KYW-TV (channel 3).|$|R

50|$|As of January 1, 1990, ABC Radio Networks {{contracted}} with Hot Mix Productions to market, distribute, and sell Hot Mix in the United States. The first mix was called “Mix of the Decade 1989-90” and was distributed on vinyl disc to all radio stations {{signed up to}} play the program. By 1989 there were 35 stations in the U.S. In July 1990, ABC began producing programs on cd which made Hot Mix {{the first and only}} show of its kind worldwide to distributed weekly on Compact Disc. In 1991, Hot <b>Mix</b> was being <b>syndicated</b> by ABC Radio Network and was being heard on over 175 stations weekly worldwide.

50|$|Until January 25, 2010, WOIC was in {{a unique}} {{position}} because of the nationally syndicated liberal shows (Air America) that contrasted with the local population. Even though Columbia, South Carolina is relatively progressive compared to the rest of South Carolina the state is viewed as the 'reddest state' and generally conservative to paleo-conservative with small enclaves of progressives. WOIC's programming was a <b>mix</b> of liberal(progressive)nationally <b>syndicated</b> Air America shows and locally produced public interest shows. The weekend show lineup was mostly local programming and helped balance the nationally syndicated overall flavor of the station. There were a number of daily center-left local programs that were heard Monday through Friday. WOIC's line-up served the people of Columbia, better than most, because of the amount of local programming and the ability of listeners to be able to interact with the local show hosts. Especially on the weekends WOIC is 'Friends and Neighbors' radio.|$|R
5000|$|KFMB-DT2 added {{programming}} from The CW on May 31, 2017 (XETV transferred {{its existing}} affiliation with co-owned Canal 5 from its decommissioned 6.2 subchannel to its main feed upon losing the CW affiliation). The subchannel - which was rebranded as [...] "The CW San Diego" [...] - concurrently adopted a general entertainment schedule featuring a <b>mix</b> of <b>syndicated</b> shows not carried by other San Diego stations, repeat airings of certain programs seen on KFMB's main channel, and many first-run and off-network syndicated programs (including {{talk shows and}} sitcoms) that previously aired on XETV prior to the switch to fill timeslots not occupied by CW network programs. It also launched a two-hour extension of KFMB's weekday morning newscast, along with separate, weeknight-only 7:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts produced for KFMB-DT2 (the newscasts shown on the subchannel are branded as News 8 on The CW San Diego, omitting all references to the CBS name included in KFMB's main news titling). The subchannel also took over XETV's slot on channel 6 on Cox Communications, Charter Spectrum and AT&T U-verse (those providers as well as DirecTV - which opted to carry KFMB-DT2 on channel 9, transmitting temporarily in standard definition only in the days immediately following the switch - and Dish Network dropped XETV from their lineups upon its switch to Canal 5, with the station's availability in the market becoming limited to its existing over-the-air signal coverage).|$|R
5000|$|On March 15, 2010, at 10 am, {{after playing}} [...] "Carry Out" [...] by Timbaland, KXJM relaunched its Rhythmic CHR format as [...] "WiLD 107.5" [...] and adopted the slogan [...] "Portland's Party Hits." [...] Although the KXJM call letters remained, a new logo was {{patterned}} after its sister station in San Francisco, KYLD. KXJM's first song as [...] "WiLD 107.5" [...] was [...] "La La La" [...] by LMFAO. The changes reflected the station's {{shift away from}} {{what had been a}} Hip-Hop/R&B-leaning direction to a broader Rhythmic approach that includes Dance-pop tracks, a move that took place at other Rhythmic outlets in the United States. All <b>mix</b> shows and <b>syndicated</b> shows except for Baka Boyz' Hip Hop Master Mix and Slow Jams with R. Dub were temporarily removed for a few weeks, but were later restored (both Baka Boyz and R. Dub have been dropped, though both would return with the rebranding to [...] "JAM'N" [...] in 2014).|$|R
5000|$|On October 25, 2004, at Midnight, {{the station}} flipped to {{progressive}} talk and changed call letters to KPTK days later. During its tenure as [...] "Seattle's Progressive Talk," [...] KPTK broadcast syndicated progressive/liberal talk programs hosted by personalities such as Ed Schultz, Mike Malloy, Randi Rhodes, Thom Hartmann, Norman Goldman, Rachel Maddow, Stephanie Miller, Leslie Marshall, and Bill Press. KPTK {{was also the}} flagship station of Air America Radio's Ron Reagan Show. Beginning in 2011, KPTK became the flagship station of Seattle Storm and Seattle Thunderbirds broadcasts, though it was met with some controversy. The station's weekend programming included a <b>mix</b> of specialty <b>syndicated</b> and local programs, such as [...] "The Ric Edelman Show" [...] (a financial advice show), [...] "Ring of Fire", [...] "Democracy Now", [...] "Swirl Radio" [...] (a show targeting the LGBT community), [...] "Community Matters" [...] with CBS Seattle's director of public affairs and morning traffic reporter Lee Callahan, [...] "Gardening In the Northwest with Scott Conner", [...] "The Tina and Drew Show", and [...] "Crash Talk with Mike Harber".|$|R
50|$|Ion's current {{method of}} running predominately {{syndicated}} programming {{is very similar}} to the international model of broadcasting used in Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia and Australia, which <b>mixes</b> imported and <b>syndicated</b> shows with original programming - a model used only in United States broadcast television by digital multicast services (particularly those that specialize in acquired programs such as MeTV), smaller English language entertainment-based networks (such as America One) and networks broadcasting in languages other than English (such as Univision and Telemundo). The major commercial broadcast networks in the U.S. - ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW - carry first-run programs produced for the network, while leaving the responsibility of acquiring shows from the syndication market to their owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to fill time not allotted to network and, where applicable, locally produced programs (MyNetworkTV, which is somewhat similar to Ion Television in its format, mixes elements of both models as acquired programs are supplied both during prime time by the service and by its stations at all other times). A limited number of non-Ion-owned stations that are merely affiliated with the network (such as Louisville outlet WBNA) do carry additional local or syndicated programming that, in some instances, pre-empts certain programs within the Ion master schedule.|$|R
50|$|In {{its early}} days, KITV and its {{predecessors}} aired {{most of the}} ABC offerings on a one-week delay due to Hawaii's geographical location and at times would receive most of the network shows via air mail. Because of this, the station would program ABC daytime shows from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. in incorrect order (with movies rounding out most the schedule) and ABC primetime shows from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m., again out of pattern (and at times, delayed to weekends) and <b>mixed</b> in with <b>syndicated</b> programs {{to fill in the}} slots. Like most of the Honolulu stations, the network newscast would be delayed as late as midnight as the broadcasts were flown in from the mainland after their airings on the East Coast. This began to change on November 19, 1966, when channel 4 KHVH began broadcasting the first live network satellite telecast from the U.S. mainland to Hawaii as ABC fed a football game between Notre Dame and Michigan State to the station via the Lani Bird satellite. Today, KITV receives ABC shows on the same day {{as the rest of the}} United States, including live news, sports coverage and special events. On February 28, 2016, KITV began airing the Academy Awards live for the first time after delaying the telecast for decades, citing the impact of social media reporting the winners in real time, making it difficult to delay the broadcast for Hawaiian viewers. On February 27, 2017, the station aired that year's ceremony on a tape-delay once again. KITV clears the entire ABC network programming schedule. The only recent exception was for Power Rangers, which was part of the now-defunct ABC Kids block until August 28, 2010. Most (if not all) ABC affiliates owned by Hearst Television (which once owned KITV) refused to clear the show due to its lack of educational and informational content. In the past, KITV also pre-empted some of ABC's daytime programming, which instead aired on then-independent station KAAH-TV.|$|R
