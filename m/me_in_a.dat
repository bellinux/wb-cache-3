5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor â€“ who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> terrible state {{and asked me to}} go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game, when {{the guy at}} bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, {{so by the time}} I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|John Buck, an English athlete, {{said this}} about his reason for {{attending}} the games: [...] "I {{had been in}} Perth {{during the war years}} serving as an engine room artificer on H.M. submarine Thule and had the misfortune to pick up one of those endearing Australian bugs which left <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rather poor state [...] of health (e.g. a paraplegic)". He {{wanted to go back to}} Perth to see the Stitt family who looked after him in Perth.|$|E
500|$|Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor {{and thanked}} Oliver Stone for [...] "casting <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> part that almost nobody thought I could play". However, Daryl Hannah's {{performance}} {{was not as}} well received and earned her a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress, thus making this the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. The [...] "quintessential financial high-roller's attire" [...] of Michael Douglas in the movie, designed by Alan Flusser, was emulated in the 1980s by yuppies.|$|E

500|$|The song's opening lyric {{was taken}} from the title of [...] "Something in the Way She Moves", a track by Harrison's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor.

Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> creative mode and when I finished the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E

500|$|Veronica Mars was one {{of roughly}} five series being {{considered}} for cancellation by the network in 2007. At The CW's upfront conference, critic Michael Ausiello asked Ostroff {{about the fate of}} the show. She responded that Thomas and Bell could work together on another show for the network, but she thought that this possibility was unlikely. She said that [...] "it could come back in some form, but I don't know what form that would be". Thomas responded, [...] "I assume that anything Dawn would be talking about in the realm of a Robâ€“Kristen project would involve a new from-scratch pilot as they don't have <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deal, and they'll lose Kristen in a couple of weeks." ...|$|E

500|$|Beahan {{had been}} {{thinking}} of releasing a tribute record through his company for a long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute came to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream last fall, and I immediately started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by David LaChapelle and shot on March 13 and 14, 2004, in Los Angeles. The lighting was described as [...] "saturated, but low and naturalistic" [...] to give the video a cinematic feel, referencing the 1995 film Leaving Las Vegas. It premiered on TRL on April 12, 2004. Spears called the show and explained the video explored reincarnation. She added, [...] "It's more like a movie. It's different than anything I've ever done. It's dark, and it shows <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different light. Of course, I'm {{going to go back}} and do dance videos, but I wanted to be inspired and challenged." [...] An alternate version of the video which features Spears singing in the white hallway scenes was released on the 2004 DVD [...]|$|E
