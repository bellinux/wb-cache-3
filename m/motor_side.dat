50|$|Unlike {{most current}} antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine, lumateperone does not disrupt striatal {{dopamine}} signaling, a property {{which is likely}} due to partial agonism of presynaptic D2 receptors.

Case No. 1 uses an integrated flywheel as a short-term energy source instead of batteries to allow time for external, electrically coupled gensets to start and be brought online.

5000|$|Again in {{the days}} of direct current mains, power {{stations}} often had large lead-acid batteries for load balancing. These supplemented the steam-powered generators during peak periods and were re-charged off-peak. Sometimes one cell in the battery would become [...] "sick" [...] (faulty, reduced capacity) and a [...] "milking booster" [...] would be used to give it an additional charge and restore it to health. The milking booster was so-called because it [...] "milked" [...] the healthy cells in the battery to give an extra charge to the faulty one. The <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> of the booster was connected across the whole battery but the generator side was connected only across the faulty cell.

The DIII-D tokamak at General Atomics, the Princeton Large Torus (PLT) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and the Nimrod synchrotron at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory each used large flywheels on multiple motor-generator rigs to level the load imposed on the electrical system: the <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> slowly accelerated a large flywheel to store energy, which was consumed rapidly during a fusion experiment as the generator side acted as a brake on the flywheel. Similarly, the next generation U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will use a flywheel motor-generator rig to supply power instantaneously for aircraft launches at greater than the ship's installed generator capacity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating on line the nonlinear stiffness of flexible transmissions in robot joints, with special reference to actuation devices with adjustable stiffness in serial configuration. These joints are characterized by a principal motor for controlling the link motion and secondary motor for adjusting the stiffness. In this actuation configuration, the flexible transmission undergoes relatively small deforma-tions and the stiffness estimation problem is more challenging due to poor excitation conditions. We improve our previous general approach, combining a residual-based flexibility torque estimator that uses also a kinematic Kalman filter to handle discretization and quantization errors with an enhanced recur-sive least squares algorithm that does not suffer from lack of persistent excitation. As a result, stiffness is estimated in a more robust way using only position measurements on the <b>motor</b> <b>sides</b> and <b>motor</b> dynamic parameters. The performance of the proposed estimation method is illustrated through simulations and experiments on the AwAS joint developed at IIT. I...|$|R

40|$|A {{test and}} {{analysis}} program performed on four complete propulsion systems for an {{urban electric vehicle}} (EV) is described and results given. A dc series motor and a permanent magnet (PM) motor were tested, each powered by an EV battery pack and controlled by (1) a series/parallel voltage-switching (V-switch) system; and (2) a system using a pulse width modulation, 400 Hz transistorized chopper. Dynamometer tests were first performed, followed by eV performance predictions and data correlating road tests. During dynamometer tests using chopper control; current, voltage, and power were measured on both the battery and <b>motor</b> <b>sides</b> of the chopper, using three types of instrumentation. Conventional dc instruments provided adequate accuracy for eV power and energy measurements, when used on the battery side of the controller. When using the chopper controller, {{the addition of a}} small choke inductor improved system efficiency in the lower duty cycle range (some 8 % increase at 50 % duty cycle) with both types of motors. Overall system efficiency rankings during road tests were: (1) series motor with V-switch; (2) PM motor with V-switch; (3) series motor with chopper; and (4) PM motor with chopper.

50|$|Prosthetics {{designers}} should {{carefully consider}} {{the nature of}} dimensionality alteration of sensorimotor signaling from and to the CNS when designing prothesitic devices. As reported in literatures, neural signaling from the CNS to the motors is organized {{in a way that}} the dimensionalities of the signals are gradually increased as you approach the muscles, also called muscle synergies. In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption.

50|$|Unlike many {{antipsychotics}} {{that are}} D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, cariprazine is a D2 and D3 partial agonist. It {{also has a}} higher affinity for D3 receptors. The D2 and D3 receptors are important targets {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia, because the overstimulation of dopamine receptors has been implicated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. Cariprazine acts to inhibit overstimulated dopamine receptors (acting as an antagonist) and stimulate the same receptors when the endogenous dopamine levels are low. Cariprazine’s high selectivity towards D3 receptors could prove to reduce side effects associated with the other antipsychotic drugs, because D3 receptors are mainly located in the ventral striatum and would not incur the same <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects (extrapyramidal symptoms) as drugs that act on dorsal striatum dopamine receptors. Cariprazine also acts on 5-HT1A receptors, though the affinity is considerably lower than the affinity to dopamine receptors (seen in monkey and rat brain studies). In the same studies, cariprazine has been noted to produce pro-cognitive effects, the mechanisms of which are currently under investigation. An example of pro-cognitive effects occurred in pre-clinical trials with rats: rats with cariprazine performed better in a scopolamine-induced learning impairment paradigm in a water labyrinth test. This {{may be due to the}} selective antagonist nature of D3 receptors, though further studies need to be conducted. This result could be very useful for schizophrenia, as one of the symptoms includes cognitive deficits.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{neuroleptic}} {{drugs are}} thought to derive their anti-psychotic efficacy through influ-ences on the mesolimbic dopa-mine (DA) system. In contrast, <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects of these drugs are suggested to follow from in-fluences on the nigrostriatal DA system. This conceptualization {{is based on the}} assumption that be-haviors mediated by the meso-limbic DA system are involved in schizophrenia while behaviors controlled by the nigrostriatal system are not. In this article, it is argued that although assump-tions about mesolimbic activities may indeed be correct, those concerning the nigrostriatal sys-tem certainly are not. This being the case, drugs with mesolimbic-specific activity may not have significant antipsychotic potency and probably will not be free of <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects. The current thrust of neuropharmacology, which emphasizes development of drugs with pharmacological specificity rather than anatomical selectivity, is more likely to gen-erate new antipsychotic agents with a reduced risk of <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHaloperidol is {{the most}} widely used {{antipsychotic}} drug in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Despite its satisfactory therapeutic effect, its chronic use is related to severe <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects. Here, we investigate the incidence of <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects of haloperidol-loaded nanocapsules when compared to free haloperidol and the relation with oxidative stress (OS) development. Both vehicle (B-NcFO) and haloperidol loaded polysorbate-coated nanocapsules suspension (H-NcFO) prepared with fish oil as core showed uniform and rounded particles, nanometric size, negative zeta potential, low polydispersity indices and high encapsulation efficiency. Wistar rats received a single dose of free haloperidol (FH), B-NcFO or H-NcFO (0. 2 mg/kg ip) and were submitted to acute <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects evaluation 1 h after the injection. Lower catalepsy time and oral dyskinesia were observed in H-NcFO-treated group than in FH group; however, both formulations decreased animals’ locomotor activity. In a experiment performed subchronically, rats injected daily with H-NcFO (0. 2 mg/kg-ip) for 28 days showed decreased oral dyskinesia frequency and catalepsy time and no impairment on locomotor activity as compared to FH group (0. 2 mg/kg-ip). FH group showed higher OS, as observed by increased lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione levels and catalase activity in extrapyramidal region. Our findings showed that nanocapsules may be an efficient form to prevent or minimize haloperidol <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects, which are related to OS development, ameliorating psychiatric patients’ quality of life...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} way to {{evaluate}} the conducted electromagnetic compatibility performance of variable speed drive systems. It is considered that the measured noise level is determined by two factors, {{the level of the}} noise source and the conversion efficiency of the propagation path from the source to the measurement equipments. They are corresponding to the two roles played by the converter. On the one hand, a converter provides the noise source and generates the noise current and voltage on the <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> with the cable and the motor. On the other hand, it acts as the propagation path with the DC bus and the rectifier to spread the noise generated on the <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> to the line side. The transfer ratio is defined as the ratio between the CM current on the <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> and the CM current on the line side. It can be used to evaluate the EMC design of a converter because it is independent of the cable and the motor. A simplified model is used to explain this characteristic. It can be measured when the converter is powered off. Verification is carried out by experimental results obtained from a 12 -kVA laboratory system. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: While {{side effects}} of {{stimulant}} medication used to treat children for {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} have been clinically described as mild but variable, {{there is little or no}} research or understanding of biological mechanisms involved. Method: The present short review extends the 'tonic-phasic' dopamine hypothesis in terms of prefrontal and subcortical dopamine receptor (D 1 /D 2) imbalance. Results: The minor allele of the dopamine D 1 receptor predicts the 'zombie-like' <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effect clinically described in some children treated with stimulant medications. Conclusion: Stimulant side effects may be best understood as reflecting imbalance in parallel cortico-thalamicstriatal circuits, and <b>motor</b> <b>side</b> effects as a result of prefrontal D 1 /D 2 imbalance allowing greater motor inhibitory effects at subcortical D 2 receptors. This is a variation of the 'tonic-phasic' hypothesis, which takes D 1 allelic variation into account. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2014...|$|E
