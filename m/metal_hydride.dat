5|$|One might {{believe that}} sodium or {{potassium}} hydride {{would be the}} ideal base for deprotonating these precursor salts. The hydride should react irreversibly {{with the loss of}} hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products and excess hydride being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> could also destroy non-aromatic salts.|$|E

40|$|Light <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> {{have enjoyed}} several decades of {{attention}} {{in the field of}} hydrogen storage, but their applications have recently begun to diversify more and more into the broader field of energy storage. For example, light <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> have shown great promise as battery materials, in sensors and as efficient catalysts for ammonia decomposition, which could enable ammonia to be used for indirect hydrogen storage. Additionally, Li-based compounds have demonstrated prowess as ammonia synthesis catalysts while NaAlH 4 shows the ability to perform hydrogenations of C-C multiple bonds, both in conjunction with transition metals. Although these topics seem to be very different they all depend on similar physical phenomena. The bulk or macrocrystalline <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> are usually not very active in most of these applications. However, nanostructuring {{has been shown to be}} effective in improving the properties of <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides.</b> With this reasoning the nano-sizing and confinement of light <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> to the pores of a scaffold (carbon being the most favoured due to its relative inertness) can yield significant improvements in their performance for a range of applications. For example, smaller particles display faster kinetics of hydrogen sorption compared to larger particles as they have shorter hydrogen diffusion distances, this also means a higher active surface area for catalysis. It may also be necessary for the hydrogen release and uptake from the <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> to be reversible for the material to behave catalytically and nanoconfinement is a very effective way of achieving this reversibility. This thesis describes the use of nano-confinement as an approach to improve the properties of light <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> in reversible hydrogen storage applications and catalysis. The focus is on the preparation of nanocomposites of sodium and lithium based hydrides, specifically NaAlH 4 and the Li-N-H system confined in carbon nanoscaffolds, and unravelling the effects of nanoconfinement on their ability to reversibly store hydrogen and/or catalyse different hydrogenation reactions...|$|R

The aims of the work described in this thesis have been to characterise new <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides,</b> investigate how the properties of known <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> can be improved and understand how their structure influences these properties. <b>Metal</b> <b>hydrides,</b> in most cases synthesised via high-temperature techniques, were structurally characterised using X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray single crystal diffraction and neutron powder diffraction and their thermodynamic and kinetic properties by in-situ X-ray powder diffraction, thermal desorption spectroscopy and pressure-composition-temperature measurements. The investigations showed that: the storage capacity of the hexagonal Laves phase Sc(Al 1 -xNix) 2 decreases with increasing Al content. There is a significant decrease in the stability of the hydrides and faster reaction kinetics when Zr content is increased in the cubic Laves phase Sc 1 -xZrx(Co 1 -xNix) 2. Nb 4 M 0. 9 Si 1. 1 (M=Co, Ni) form very stable interstitial hydrides which have very slow sorption kinetics. MgH 2 mixed with 10 mol% ScH 2 reaches full activation after only one cycle at 673 K while it takes at least four cycles at 593 K. LnGa (Ln=Nd, Gd) absorb hydrogen in two steps, it is very likely that the first step is interstitial solution of hydride ions into Ln 4 tetrahedra and the second step places hydrogen atoms in Ln 3 Ga tetrahedra. The nature of the Ga-H bond is still unclear...|$|R
