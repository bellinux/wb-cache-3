25|$|The Battle of Midway is {{generally}} considered to be the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Before Midway, a small and fractional U.S. Navy faced an overwhelmingly larger and battle-hardened Japanese Combined Fleet. After Midway, although the Japanese still held a temporary advantage in vessels and planes, the U.S. Navy and the nation gained confidence and, most critically, time. The setback in the Japanese timetable to encircle the Pacific gave the U.S. industrial <b>machine</b> <b>time</b> to crank up war production, and ultimately, to turn the advantage on Japan in the production of ships, planes, guns, and all the other matériel of war. The Battle of Midway infused the U.S. Pacific Navy with confidence. And with this battle the American forces gained, and afterwards continued to gain, hard combat experience; so the Japanese lost that crucial advantage as well.|$|E

Level speed tool wear is one of the factors that influence the <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> Because if drill quickly wear out the drill will often be replaced so that the use of drill costs will be higher, and the cost of production of a certain condition is not cheap, but will be more expensive.

In this project, two type of end mill tool have been used which are ball nose end mill and bull nose end mill and two type of tool path have been selected which are one way next and zigzag tool path {{in order to determine}} the effects of both tool and tool path toward machining performances of surface roughness and <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> The cutting parameter in this project are spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The machine used in this project is Makino KE 55 CNC milling machine. The impact of end mill tool geometry on the surface roughness was determined by the testing the workpiece using Surface Roughness Tester. The <b>machining</b> <b>time</b> was determined by the CATIA V 5 software and by the real <b>machining</b> <b>time.</b> Measurement of surface roughness has indicated that the bull nose end mill gives lower surface roughness compare to ball nose end mill when machine an incline surface.

5000|$|MRP is {{concerned}} primarily with manufacturing materials while MRPII {{is concerned}} with the coordination of the entire manufacturing production, including materials, finance, and human relations. The goal of MRPII is to provide consistent data to all members in the manufacturing process as the product moves through the production line. Paper-based information systems and non-integrated computer systems that provide paper or disk outputs result in many information errors, including missing data, redundant data, numerical errors that result from being incorrectly keyed into the system, incorrect calculations based on numerical errors, and bad decisions based on incorrect or old data. In addition, some data is unreliable in non-integrated systems because the same data is categorized differently in the individual databases used by different functional areas. [...] MRPII systems begin with MRP, material requirements planning. MRP allows for the input of sales forecasts from sales and marketing, or of actual sales demand in the form of customers orders. These demands determine the raw materials demand. MRP and MRPII systems draw on a master production schedule, the breakdown of specific plans for each product on a line. While MRP allows for the coordination of raw materials purchasing, MRPII facilitates the development of a detailed production schedule that accounts for machine and labor capacity, scheduling the production runs according to the arrival of materials. An MRPII output is a final labor and machine schedule. Data about the cost of production, including <b>machine</b> <b>time,</b> labor time and materials used, as well as final production numbers, is provided from the MRPII system to accounting and finance.|$|E
