5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} {{has occurred}} in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the edible A.caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E

50|$|While many of al-Jazari's inventions <b>may</b> now <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trivial, {{the most}} {{significant}} aspect of al-Jazari's machines are the mechanisms, components, ideas, methods, and design features which they employ.|$|R
25|$|In December 2008, <b>Mays</b> began <b>appearing</b> in ads for ESPN's online service, ESPN360. These ads were {{a slight}} {{departure}} for Mays as they <b>were</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> parodies {{of his and}} other infomercial cliches with <b>Mays</b> <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing a parody of himself. He also made a live appearance during the 2008 Champs Sports Bowl promoting ESPN's and ABC's January 1, 2009, bowl games. Prior to his death, Mays had signed a deal with Taco Bell to film infomercial-style commercials for the chain. Shooting <b>was</b> scheduled <b>to</b> begin in August 2009.|$|R
25|$|Some {{calculus}} books {{do not use}} general tagged partitions, but limit {{themselves to}} specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> integrable.|$|E
25|$|A dustpan is a {{cleaning}} utensil {{commonly used in}} combination with a broom. The dustpan <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a type of flat scoop. The dustpan was invented and patented (U.S. patent #20,811) by the American inventor T.E. McNeill in 1858.|$|E
25|$|Facial nerve paralysis* is most {{commonly}} caused in dogs by trauma, otitis media, {{or as an}} idiopathic condition. Signs include an inability to blink, drooping of the ear, and drooping of the lips on the affected side, although in chronic conditions fibrosis occurs and the ear and lips <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in an abnormal position.|$|E

25|$|In jaguars, the melanism allele is dominant. Consequently, black jaguars {{may produce}} either black or spotted cubs, but {{a pair of}} spotted jaguars can only produce spotted cubs. Individuals with two copies of the allele are darker (the black {{background}} colour is more dense) than ones with just one copy, whose background colour <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dark charcoal rather than black.|$|E
25|$|One example: {{oriented}} (i.e., reflections not included) elliptic geometry (i.e., {{the surface}} of an n-sphere with opposite points identified) and oriented spherical geometry (the same non-Euclidean geometry, but with opposite points not identified) have isomorphic automorphism group, SO(n+1) for even n. These <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, {{in a way that}} can be made precise.|$|E
25|$|While {{this station}} <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> underground, {{it and the}} {{adjacent}} yard are actually at-grade. The Esplanade Gardens apartment complex exists between 147th and 149th streets while Frederick Douglass Academy High School sits between 149th and 150th Streets; both structures rest on pilotis above the station and yard. Unlike other at-grade stations, however, 148th Street is not ADA-accessible {{because there is a}} staircase down to platform level.|$|E
50|$|Annelids only possess one nuchal organ, {{although}} {{the nature of}} the grooving <b>may</b> make it <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pair of organs.|$|R
50|$|It {{had been}} {{suggested}} that while the Raiders <b>may</b> have <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most likely candidate due to their lack of prospects in comparison with teams like the Chargers, their need for a solution may have actually <b>been</b> too urgent <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a viable option for London.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, however, with verbs such as dejar ("to let"), which {{generally}} takes a direct object {{as well as}} a subsequent verb as a further grammatical argument, objects of two different verbs will appear together with only one of them and <b>may</b> thus <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> objects of the same verb: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin {{is seen to}} produce food calls both in the presence and absence of group members. Additionally, response to food calls are directed back to an original caller independent of visual confirmation of a food source. While this <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a result from a very primitive form of communication, Roush and Snowdon (2005) maintain that the food-calling behavior confers some mentally representable information about food to recipient tamarins.|$|E
25|$|Distortions {{in visual}} {{perception}} during a temporal lobe seizure may include size distortion (micropsia or macropsia), distorted perception of movement (where moving objects <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving very slowly {{or to be}} perfectly still), a sense that surfaces such as ceilings and even entire horizons are moving farther away in a fashion similar to the dolly zoom effect, and other illusions. Even when consciousness is impaired, insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved.|$|E
25|$|As the Sun {{crosses the}} sky, it <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> red, orange, yellow or white, {{depending}} on its position. The changing {{color of the}} Sun {{over the course of}} the day is mainly a result of the scattering of light and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. The blue color of the sky is caused by Rayleigh scattering of the sunlight by the atmosphere, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.|$|E
30|$|Gap also {{described}} findings from evaluations of its SR programs by Social Accountability International and Verité, including praise {{for their efforts}} and suggestions for improvements. Because the evaluations were conducted by outside organizations, the results <b>may</b> have <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more objective <b>to</b> stakeholders, thus adding to the credibility of Gap’s reporting.|$|R
50|$|Prosopagnosia in {{children}} may be overlooked; they <b>may</b> just <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very shy or slightly odd due to their inability to recognize faces. They may also {{have a hard time}} making friends, as they may not recognize their classmates. They often make friends with children who have very clear, distinguishing features.|$|R
5000|$|Mammary gland {{tumors are}} the third {{common type of}} cancer in older female cats, with the most common symptom manifesting as a [...] in the breast tissue. The tumor is {{typically}} firm and nodular, and adheres to the overlying skin. Nipples <b>may</b> also <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> red and swollen, oozing yellowish fluid.|$|R
25|$|Mimicry and {{camouflage}} enable {{animals to}} appear to be other than they are. Prey animals may appear as predators, or vice versa; both predators and prey may be hard to see (crypsis), or may be mistaken for other objects (mimesis). In Batesian mimicry, harmless animals <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distasteful or poisonous. In automimicry, animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.|$|E
25|$|When {{the flag}} is {{affixed to the}} right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any {{physical}} object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.|$|E
25|$|The dog or cat {{may show}} {{a great variety}} of signs that may be very subtle in the early stages. Early signs include lethargy, loss of appetite, {{apparent}} groaning when lifted, altered voice (bark/meow), noisy panting, coughing, drooling of saliva, gagging, regurgitation (dogs) and enlarged pupils (cats). Occasionally a single limb <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> weak or lame. A tick attached {{to the side of the}} face may cause loss of blink reflex, corneal ulceration and an ocular discharge. A tick attached near the anus can cause anal incontinence.|$|E

50|$|According to this hypothesis, {{homicide}} <b>is</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a mistake}} or over-reaction. Normal psychological mechanisms {{for control of}} property, partner or personal safety <b>may</b> not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient under certain stressful circumstances and abnormal mechanisms develop. Particularly extreme expressions of this may occur leading to homicide where in the normal state the perpetrator would not behave in this manner.|$|R
