5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience <b>Menorrhagia</b> are more susceptible to iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with {{intervals}} of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular menstruation {{is known as}} metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed <b>menorrhagia.</b> Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. Amenorrhea refers to more than {{three to six months}} without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menorrhagia</b> is a menstrual {{period with}} {{excessively}} heavy flow and {{falls under the}} larger category of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).|$|E
25|$|Levonorgestrel intrauterine {{devices are}} highly {{effective}} at controlling {{dysfunctional uterine bleeding}} (DUB) or <b>menorrhagia</b> and should be considered before any surgery.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraception}} {{is primarily}} {{used for the}} prevention of pregnancy, but is also prescribed for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea and <b>menorrhagia,</b> and hirsutism.|$|E
25|$|Complications of <b>Menorrhagia</b> {{could also}} be the initial symptoms. Excessive {{bleeding}} can lead to anemia which presents as fatigue, shortness of breath, and weakness. Anemia can be diagnosed with a blood test.|$|E
25|$|Trouble may, however, {{arise in}} some {{patients}} {{in the form of}} bleeding following surgery (including dental procedures), noticeable easy bruising, or <b>menorrhagia</b> (heavy menstrual periods). The minority of cases of type 1 may present with severe hemorrhagic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{contraceptives}} are prescribed in {{the treatment}} of <b>menorrhagia</b> to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The hormonal IUD (Mirena) releases levonorgestrel which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medication}} like NSAIDs {{may also}} be used. NSAIDs are the first-line medications in ovulatory <b>menorrhagia,</b> resulting in an average reduction of 20-46% in menstrual blood flow. For this purpose, NSAIDs are ingested for only 5 days of the menstrual cycle, limiting their most common adverse effect of dyspepsia.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{the use of}} {{hysterectomy}} for <b>menorrhagia</b> {{has been}} almost halved between 1989 and 2003. This {{has a number of}} causes: better medical management, endometrial ablation and particularly the introduction of IUS which may be inserted in the community and avoid the need for specialist referral; in one study up to 64% of women cancelled surgery.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} heavy menstrual bleeding, estrogen-containing oral {{contraceptive}} medications {{are effective in}} reducing the frequency and duration of the menstrual periods. Estrogen and progesterone compounds available {{for use in the}} correction of <b>menorrhagia</b> are ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel (Levona, Nordette, Lutera, Trivora). Administration of ethinylestradiol diminishes the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary, leading to stabilization of the endometrial surface of the uterus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menorrhagia</b> (heavy or {{abnormal}} menstrual bleeding) {{may also}} be treated with the less invasive endometrial ablation which is an outpatient procedure in which {{the lining of the}} uterus is destroyed with heat, mechanically or by radio frequency ablation. Endometrial ablation greatly reduces or entirely eliminates monthly bleeding in ninety percent of patients with DUB. It is not effective for patients with very thick uterine lining or uterine fibroids.|$|E
25|$|Signs {{include the}} {{spontaneous}} formation of bruises (purpura) and petechiae (tiny bruises), {{especially on the}} extremities, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, and <b>menorrhagia</b> (excessive menstrual bleeding), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per μl. A very low count (<10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans used {{black cohosh}} to treat {{gynecological}} and other disorders, including sore throat, kidney problems, and depression. Following {{the arrival of}} European settlers in the U.S. who continued the medicinal usage of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia in 1830 under the name “black snakeroot”. In 1844 A. racemosa gained popularity when John King, an eclectic physician, used it to treat rheumatism and nervous disorders. Other eclectic physicians of the mid-nineteenth century used black cohosh {{for a variety of}} maladies, including endometritis, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, <b>menorrhagia,</b> sterility, severe after-birth pains, and for increased breast milk production.|$|E
25|$|Hereditary or {{acquired}} defects of vWF lead to von Willebrand disease (vWD), {{a bleeding}} diathesis {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, causing nosebleeds, <b>menorrhagia,</b> and gastrointestinal bleeding. The {{point at which the}} mutation occurs determines the severity of the bleeding diathesis. There are three types (I, II and III), and type II is further divided in several subtypes. Treatment depends {{on the nature of the}} abnormality and the severity of the symptoms. Most cases of vWD are hereditary, but abnormalities of vWF may be acquired; aortic valve stenosis, for instance, has been linked to vWD type IIA, causing gastrointestinal bleeding - an association known as Heyde's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In women, menstrual {{disturbances}} {{are common}} during spironolactone treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses {{and almost all}} experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular, anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and <b>menorrhagia</b> (or menometrorrhagia) in {{a large percentage of}} women. It has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.|$|E
500|$|The dried bark, however, {{is still}} an {{officinal}} drug and is listed in the modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi (...) , meaning [...] "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark {{is said to have}} cooling and astringent properties and is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, <b>menorrhagia</b> and spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and saponin, while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known antimalarial agent. It is available in most shops dealing in Chinese traditional medicine. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy.|$|E

2500|$|... vWF {{is named}} after Dr. Erik von Willebrand (1870–1949), a Finnish doctor who in 1924 first {{described}} a hereditary bleeding disorder in families from the Åland islands, who had a tendency for cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, including <b>menorrhagia.</b> Although von Willebrand could not identify the definite cause, he distinguished von Willebrand disease (vWD) from hemophilia {{and other forms of}} bleeding diathesis.|$|E
2500|$|A normal {{menstrual cycle}} is [...] 21–35 days in duration, with {{bleeding}} lasting {{an average of}} 5 days and total blood flow between 25 and 80 mL. <b>Menorrhagia</b> is defined as total menstrual flow >80ml per cycle, or soaking a pad/tampon every 2 hours or less. Deviations in terms of frequency of menses, duration of menses, or volume of menses qualifies as abnormal uterine bleeding. Bleeding in between menses is also abnormal uterine bleeding and thus requires further evaluation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} <b>menorrhagia</b> is to perform hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). The {{risks of the}} procedure have been reduced with measures {{to reduce the risk}} of deep vein thrombosis after surgery, and the switch from the front abdominal to vaginal approach greatly minimizing the discomfort and recuperation time for the patient; however extensive fibroids may make the womb too large for removal by the vaginal approach. [...] Small fibroids may be dealt with by local removal (myomectomy). [...] A further surgical technique is endometrial ablation (destruction) by the use of applied heat (thermoablation).|$|E
2500|$|NET {{is used as}} a {{hormonal}} contraceptive in combination with an estrogen – usually ethinylestradiol (EE) – in combined oral contraceptive pills and alone in progestogen-only pills. NET has also been proven to be effective in inhibiting LH and FSH levels in men as well. Without these hormones, mature sperm cannot survive in the testes. This means that NET could also be an effective male {{hormonal contraceptive}}. Aside from its use as a contraceptive, NET can be used to treat premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, <b>menorrhagia,</b> irregular menstruation, menopausal symptoms (in combination with estrogen), or to postpone a period. It is also commonly used to help prevent uterine hemorrhage in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical gynecologic cases and in treating non responsive cyclical mastalgia.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{menstruation}} between puberty and 19 {{years of}} age is called puberty <b>menorrhagia.</b> Excessive menstruation is defined as bleeding over 80 ml per menstrual period or lasting more than 7 days. The most common cause for puberty <b>menorrhagia</b> is dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The other reasons are idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hypothyroidism, genital tuberculosis, polycystic ovarian disease, leukemia and coagulation disorders. The most common physiological reason for puberty <b>menorrhagia</b> is the immaturity of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to inadequate positive feedback and sustained high estrogen levels. Most patients present with anemia due to excessive blood loss.|$|E

Although not currently a standard treatment for <b>menorrhagia,</b> danazol demonstrated significant relief in young women with <b>menorrhagia</b> in a study, and, {{because of a lack of}} a significant adverse effects, it was proposed as an alternative treatment. Low-dose danazol has also been investigated in the treatment of diabetic macular edema in a phase III clinical trial.
