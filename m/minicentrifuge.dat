40|$|The {{presence}} of veterinary drug residues in food, especially of pesticides used for cattle disease control, can affect {{public health and}} international trading of food products if maximum residue levels are above those stipulated by FAO and WHO. Milk {{is one of the}} most complete food for humans, because it contains nutrients required for growth and development of newborns. However, milk quality can be endangered due to the {{presence of}} contaminants, especially of cypermethrin pesticide, which is widely used in Brazil to treat lactating dairy cows, mainly against ticks, flies, lice and dermatobia. Methods for monitoring veterinary drugs, for example pesticide residues, should be rapid, have small number of analytical steps, use few reagents in small amounts, be specific, and be sensitive enough to enable detection at very low levels. Anastassiades et al. [1] developed an approach which they dubbed quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS). The method involves extraction of the analyte with MeCN partitioned from an aqueous matrix using anhydrous MgSO 4 and NaCl, followed by a dispersive-SPE cleanup with MgSO 4 and primary secondary amine (PSA). The aim of this study was to evaluate QuEChERS method in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of cypermethrin residue in bovine milk. The following steps were undertaken: (1) weigh a 10 g milk sample into a centrifuge tube; (2) add cypermethrin; (3) add 10 mL of MeCN, 4 g of MgSO 4 and 1 g of NaCl in each tube, and centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 1 min; (4) transfer 1 mL of MeCN extract to a 1. 5 mL <b>minicentrifuge</b> tube for dispersive SPE using 50 mg of PSA + 50 mg of C 18 + 150 mg of MgSO 4; (5) mix the extract, and centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 1 min; (6) transfer 0. 5 mL of the supernatant to an autosampler vial for analysis by GC?MS. The volume analyzed was 1 ?L and the oven temperature program was set at 150 °C - 15 °C min- 1 - 270 °C (7 min). The mass spectrometry was operated in the SIM mode. The method resulted in extracts that contained the target analyte, with recovery values within the ANVISA [2] requeriments, from 70 % to 120 %, with relative standard deviations below 20 %. Detection and quantification limits were 0. 025 and 0. 075 mg kg- 1, respectively. It is possible to analyze cypermethrin in milk below the maximum residue limit of 0. 10 mg kg- 1. The proposed method is rapid and inexpensive, and reduces consumption of organic solvents, which are toxic to health and to the environment. The method may be used as a screening procedure for analysis of cypermethrin residue in milk. 200...|$|E

The protocol {{is based on the}} insight that 1) agents for cell fusion can act as potent mediators of oocyte activation by compromising maintaining plasma membrane integrity; minimizing the concentration at which they are used, and at least transiently remove calcium from the medium can improve developmental potential. 2) and on the insight that an efficient stimulus for oocyte activation is required; 3) and that histone deacetylase inhibitors facilitate reprogramming after nuclear transfer. A realistic expectation is that this protocol will result in about 10 % of the oocytes developing to the blastocyst stage, most of which will be suitable for stem cell derivation. While most aspects of the protocol can be well controlled, variation in developmental efficiency when using oocytes of different donors should be expected. Note: this protocol is a guideline that allows ES cell derivation after somatic cell nuclear transfer. The author strongly discourages the use of this protocol or aspects of it in attempts for human reproductive cloning. ### Introduction The derivation of embryonic stem cell lines by somatic cell nuclear transfer yields stem cells that are genetically identical to the donor of the somatic cell nucleus. In the late ’ 90 s, it was proposed that such cells might be useful to generate replacement cells and tissues, a concept referred to as ‘therapeutic cloning’ [1, 2]. Although nuclear transfer in many animal species had been successful for several years [3], establishing a nuclear transfer protocol in human eggs proved to be more challenging. One aspect impeding progress was the ability to procure high-quality human oocytes. Only few groups had access to oocytes for stem cell research. The publication of guidelines on oocyte donation for research by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) [4, 5], by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) [6], and by the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority in the UK 7, as well as the demonstration that recruitment of oocyte donors without any form of compensation was not practical [8], paved the way for compensated oocyte donation programs in both the United States [9, 10] and in Britain [11]. Besides the logistical limitations to obtain good quality oocytes, several lines of evidence suggested that protocols resulting in efficient development to the blastocyst stage in various mammalian species were either not efficient or failed entirely when applied to human oocytes. Researchers working with Advanced Cell Technology reported developmental arrest at the cleavage stage after somatic cell nuclear transfer [12 - 14], and though parthenogenetic blastocysts could be obtained, they were of poor quality and did not result in embryonic stem cell lines [15]. Another group at Seoul National University in South Korea also had access to a significant number of high-quality human oocytes, and was able to derive a parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell line. Originally reported as a nuclear transfer ES cell line, others discovered that the cell line was of parthenogenetic origin [16]. Apparently, oocyte enucleation followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer did not result in development that would allow ES cell derivation. Other groups similarly reported difficulties in obtaining development beyond the cleavage stage following somatic cell nuclear transfer, though not all had access to high quality human oocytes [9, 17 - 21], and few used stringent standards to genotype the embryos obtained. The protocols used for nuclear transfer were all reminiscent of protocols that had been established using sheep or cow oocytes [22]: the use of somatic cell fusion by an electrical pulse, followed by oocyte activation with a calcium ionophore and the kinase inhibitor 6 -dimethylaminopurine (6 -DMAP) had been successful in sheep and in bovine [22, 23], but was apparently very inefficient with human oocytes. And even modifications that had resulted in rhesus macaque nuclear transfer ES cell lines [24], including the use of spindle birefringence instead of Hoechst and UV for oocyte enucleation [25], did not significantly improve development after human somatic cell nuclear transfer [9]. Initially shown to increase developmental potential after nuclear transfer in mouse oocytes [26, 27], histone deacetylase inhibitors also appeared to improve development after somatic cell nuclear transfer in human oocytes [28]. Further improvement in developmental potential was observed when calcium ionophore used for oocyte activation was substituted with an electrical pulse, resulting in the derivation of diploid ES cell lines after nuclear transfer of fetal (embryonic) fibroblasts [29]. Here {{we describe}} methods that allowed the derivation of nuclear transfer ES cell lines from fibroblasts of a newborn and of an adult type 1 diabetic. ### Materials 1.

Allow somatic cells to reach confluence. Change medium every 2 - 3 days. The cells will be confluent about 5 days before the experiment and less than 0. 5 % should be in S-phase {{at the time of the}} nuclear transfer experiment. The number of S-phase cells can be determined by EdU staining. **Media Preparation** Media Preparation is as described in Reference [30] and provided here for convenience. Preparation of master salts: Begin with 980 mL ultrapure H 2 O in sterile 1 L bottle. Add dry components: NaCl 4760 mg (81 mM) Sigma S- 5886, KCl 360 mg (5 mM) Sigma P- 5405, MgSO 4 • 7 H 2 O 290 mg (1. 18 mM) Sigma M- 2773, KH 2 PO 4 160 mg (1. 17 mM) Sigma P- 5655, EDTA 2 NA 40 mg (0. 1 mM) Sigma E- 6635, Glucose (D) 1000 mg (5. 5 mM) Sigma G- 6152. Add liquid Components: Na-lactate (lactic acid) 5. 3 mL Sigma 44263, Pen’Strep 10 mL Gibco 15140 - 122. For preparation of calcium-free HCZB: Start with 500 mL master salts. Add 50 mg polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (cold-soluble; Sigma P- 8136). Stir for 30 - 60 min and sterile filter. Use 99 ml of this mixture to add Hepes-Na 520 mg Sigma H- 3784 and NaHCO 3 42 mg Sigma S- 5761. Swirl until dissolved. Adjust pH to 7. 5 with 1 N HCl. Add 1 ml of HSA solution. Sterile filter. For preparation of calcium-free mCZB: To 99 ml master salts, add NaHCO 3 211 mg Sigma S- 5761, Na-pyruvate (pyruvic acid) 3 mg Sigma P- 4562, L-Glutamine 15 mg Sigma G- 8540, add 1 ml HSA solution, Swirl until all components are dissolved. Sterile filter. Check pH after equilibrating in CO 2 atmosphere. **Oocyte manipulations** 1. Retrieval: Oocytes are retrieved 35 hours post induction of ovulation. Oocyte handling and preparation, including removal of cumulus cells, is best done according to established practice at your IVF center. - Transport: If manipulation occurs in a different facility than oocyte retrieval, oocytes can be transported (e. g. by car or train) in a portable incubator heated to 37 °C. The incubator is turned on 1 h before retrieval, with the tubes loaded in the incubator, so it has at least 1 hour to equilibrate temperature. Tubes inside the incubator may be ThermoScientific CryoTube vials loaded with 1 ml- 1. 5 ml of G-MOPS PLUS. Caffeine at 1 mM may be added to this medium. Quality controls of the temperature of the incubator should be confirmed prior to the experiment with a temperature probe. A quality control run with mouse oocytes is also highly recommended. Our transport time was between 20 and 30 minutes. If oocytes are transported, two people are required to carry out the experiment. One person picks up the oocytes, while the other prepares the micromanipulator. - Preparations: set up 4 - 6 4 -well Dishes containing 0. 75 ml Global medium each well the night before the experiment to equilibrate in the incubator at 37 degree Celsius, 5 - 6 % CO 2. Dishes are used for washes, and temporary storage during the manipulation. In the early morning, the micromanipulator is prepared, with humagen needles attached and oosight system started and a background image taken. Prepare approximately 10 capillaries by pulling them over a Bunsen burner, then cut the capillaries with the engraving pen (See Movie). These should be changed frequently during the manipulations to avoid medium carry over and stickiness. Manipulation dishes (Matek glass dishes) are set up by adding 1) one drop of PVP, where the manipulation needles can be lubricated, 2) three drops of Globaltotal w Hepes medium containing 5 μg/ml cytochalasinB, 3) one drop of Sendai virus diluted in suspension buffer 1 : 10 to 1 : 20, and 4) three drops of calcium-free HCZB (Figure 1). The cytochalasinB (CytoB) containing medium is used for oocyte enucleation, the CytoB free medium for nuclear transfer. Caffeine at 1 mM may be added to both enucleation and transfer solutions. Warm up the up the dishes on the heated stage before placing oocytes in them. PVP is used to lubricate the pipettes. Aspirate a small amount of PVP and expel it again. There should be little PVP left in the pipette. When the pipette gets sticky during manipulation, repeat this process, or exchange the pipette. Confluent somatic cells are trypsinized using TrypLE resuspended in medium containing DMEM, 10 % Standard FBS, spun down and placed on ice in about 50 μl of medium. - Manipulation: Upon arrival, take oocytes out of the vials using a 1 ml tips on a Gilson pipette, and placed in a 30 mm dish on the heated stage of a Stereomicroscope. Oocytes are then placed in the equilibrated medium of the 4 -well dishes and placed in the incubator at 37 degree Celsius and 5 % CO 2 (or 6 % CO 2, 89 % N 2, 5 % O 2). 2 - 3 oocytes are placed on the stage heated to 37 degree Celsius, in cytochalasinB free medium and the zona is drilled using the Lykos laser near the spindle visualized by birefringence (25). Drilling is performed at low laser power, of 200 μs, 90 % power. The drilling in the absence of cytochalasinB serves to prevent oocyte leakage. Two small openings in the zona pellucida are made 90 - 180 degrees apart from each other. The first polar body may be ablated using 2 - 3 direct laser pulses or removed at this point to avoid later confusion with the somatic cell to be transferred. The oocyte is then transferred into cytochalasinB containing medium (5 μg/ml), turned until a spindle can be visualized using microtubule birefringence (Oosight), the zona is again drilled with the laser to gain access to the spindle. Be careful to have the spindle, the focus of the laser on the zona and the enucleation pipette all in the same plane of focus. If this is not the case, the spindle cannot be removed or seems to be moving away from the pipette when trying to aspirate it. After enucleation, oocytes are allowed to recover for 5 - 10 minutes from the cytochalasinB prior to fusion. CytochalasinB makes the cytoplasm look uneven, but is reversible within a few minutes. They may be washed in Global medium and returned to the incubator, or left on the heated stage the drops without cytochalasinB. While recovering from cytochalasinB, a new batch of 2 - 3 oocytes is enucleated. Nuclear transfer is performed as follows: a small drop of somatic cells is placed in one of the cytochalasinB free drops. Enucleated oocytes are placed in calcium-free medium. One somatic cell is aspirated into the pipette, and exposed to the virus for 10 - 20 s (Figure 2 a). There is no need to expel the somatic cell entirely. They become very sticky and more difficult to handle if they are expelled entirely. Fusogenic agents like Sendai virus act by affecting the integrity of the plasma membrane, and therefore increase permeability to ions contained in the culture medium. The membrane of a cell becomes more fragile when exposed to Sendai virus and the cell is prone to undergo lysis. This adverse effect of the virus lasts longer than the immediate time of incubation with the virus. Therefore, the minimal amount of fusogenic agent required to achieve fusion is recommended, to preserve integrity of the plasma membrane of the oocyte as much as possible, while still achieving fusion. To minimize exposure of the egg to the virus, do not expose the holding pipette to the virus and on the way back to the drop containing the oocytes, pass through another drop to get rid of excess virus. Drill the zona and make a very small opening (Figure 2 b), insert the somatic cell with the side exposed to the virus facing the plasma membrane, and ensure that the zona pellucida presses on the somatic cell to ensure contact between the somatic plasma membrane and the oocyte plasma membrane. If the somatic cell is GFP positive, fusion can usually be confirmed within 5 minutes by briefly checking the fluorescence in the oocyte. The oocyte is returned to the incubator in calcium-free medium for up to 1 h. Checkpoint: the investigator may want to fix a few oocytes to determine chromosome condensation. Before activation, the oocyte is returned to Global total for at least 10 minutes. - Activation: activate oocytes within approximately an hour or two post-transfer using an electrical pulse as described (29). Before delivering the pulse, wash the oocytes through two drops of fusion medium containing d-sorbitol (0. 25 M), 0. 1 mM calcium acetate, 0. 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0. 5 mM HEPES, and 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A 7030). They are ready for the electrical pulse when they sink to the bottom of the drop containing fusion medium. The presence of several zona openings avoids leaking out of the oocytes and possible loss. Oocytes are pulsed using an LF 201 pulser (Nepagene) set to deliver two times 2 pulses of 50 μs width at 2. 7 kV/cm in a CUY 5000 P 1 fusion chamber (time between pulses, 1 s). The Thereafter oocytes are washed in Global total and cultured in Global total containing 10 μM puromycin, 2 mM 6 -DMAP, as well as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors scriptaid (250 nM, Sigma S 7817) and nch- 51 (1 μM, Tocris Bioscience 3747) (trichostatin A at 10 nM may likely be used instead of the former two), for 3. 5 - 4 hours. Formation of small pronuclei should be apparent at 4 hours. Wash oocytes through 2 wells of medium to eliminate compounds used for oocyte activation. - Culture: culture activated constructs in HDAC inhibitor for an additional 10 - 14 hours, followed by culture in Global total medium until day 1. On day 1 in the early morning, pronuclei are monitored again. New 4 -well dishes are set up for equilibration containing Global medium containing 10 % FBS (quality controlled by the investigator for compatibility with clonal human ES cell growth). Cleaved oocytes are transferred into this new medium. On day 3, cleaved oocytes are again transferred to fresh medium. Developmental progression may be monitored every day, by briefly placing dishes on the heated stage of the microscope. Avoid evaporation of the medium while viewing. - Derivation: Derive in the evening of day 6 or in the morning of day 7 after nuclear transfer. About 70, 000 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) per well of a 4 -well dish are seeded 3 - 4 hours before derivation in warm fibroblast medium on a surface that had been coated for approximately 10 minutes with 0. 1 % gelatin. Time before derivation is just sufficient for the MEFs to attach to the bottom of a 4 -well dish and spread out. The MEF layer should cover all plastic, but should not be dense. The timing of derivation from blastocysts should be on day two after blastulation is first observed. Trophectoderm cells are ablated with laser pulses at 400 μs pulses, 90 % power, as described (31). No more than one pulse per cell is applied, and not all trophectoderm cells need to be ablated. If the blastocyst did not hatch from the zona pellucida on its own, laser pulses may be used to ablate the zona pellucida with gentle pipetting to remove remaining pieces. Plating is conducted in medium containing KnockOut DMEM/F 12 supplemented with 10 % Knockout-SR and 10 % quality-tested FBS, 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y- 27632, 2 μM thiazovivin, non-essential amino acids (1 %), 10 ng/ml bFGF, Glutamax (1 %), PennStrep (1 %), and 1 × 2 -mercaptoethanol. Two days after plating, remaining trophectoderm cells are ablated using laser pulses at 400 μs pulses, 90 % power, which may be repeated until most trophectoderm cells are gone (see Extended Data Figure 5 of Reference [32]. Trophectoderm cells are rather flat and large and may inhibit growth of inner cell mass (ICM) cells. If the investigator cannot see ICM cells, or cannot distinguish them from trophectoderm, wait another day and check again. Outgrowths can be apparent as soon as 3 - 4 days after plating, but may take up to two and a half weeks to be fully-grown and ready for picking. Medium changes are partial every 1 - 2 days. Once an outgrowth is apparent, partial medium changes should be conducted without Y- 27632 or thiazovivin. Picking is done when colonies reach a size of about 1 mm in diameter and colony fragments are plated into 2 - 3 wells of a 4 -well dish coated with MEFs. MEFs must be fresh, meaning no older than 12 hours. If colonies emerge in several wells, enzymatic passaging may begin after just one manual passage. FBS-containing medium is gradually replaced by using standard ES cell medium (substituting FBS with Knockout-SR and DMEM/F 12 with Knockout-DMEM). Enzymatic passaging is done using 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y- 27632 for the first day after plating. - Verification: Quality control the cell lines derived, by analysis of pluripotency markers and differentiation potential. Protocols for performing such analysis are provided elsewhere. In addition, analyze the karyotype and the short tandem repeats of the nuclear transfer ES cell lines. There are commercially available services for doing that, such as at Cell Line Genetics in Madison, Wisconsin. The karyotype should be diploid. Short tandem repeats (STR) are unique genetic features that provide an identifier of the cell lines derived. For instance, in the associated Nature paper, in Extended Data Table 2, we provide the STR genotypes of all nuclear transfer ES cell lines. These were found to be an exact match to the STR genotype made on the somatic cells prior to nuclear transfer. An example, the somatic cells prior to nuclear transfer (ID 1018) is given here and as an attachment: Amelogenin X; vWA 16, 17; D 8 S 1179 10, 15; TPOX 8; FGA 25, 27; D 3 S 1358 15, 18; THO 1 9. 3; D 21 S 11 28, 30; D 18 S 51 13, 15; PentaE 12, 14; D 5 S 818 11, 13; D 13 S 317...|$|E
