Cruise had already left the show, when German comedian Michael Mittermeier said: [...] "In an interview, Tom Cruise claimed {{that he would have}} killed Hitler, too. To <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be sufficient if he had killed the Führer of Scientology." [...] Prior to the show, members of the Christian Democratic Junge Union protested against the broadcaster for being uncritical about Scientology.|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} {{created by the}} {{developer}} was Remember <b>Me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> at first be a PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game, but was dropped by the publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2011 on account of cuts in funding. The project was presented at Gamescom in 2011 {{with the intention of}} attracting another publishing deal. It was acquired by Capcom the following year and reimagined as an action-adventure game, released on multiple platforms to mixed reviews and mediocre sales. On 31 January 2014, French media outlets reported that Dontnod was filing for bankruptcy {{as a result of the}} poor sales of Remember Me. Dontnod responded to these reports explaining that the developer was in the process of [...] "judicial reorganisation". The company turned to public funding to finance a new intellectual property (IP) as a result of this. On 5 June 2014, Dontnod announced that they were working on a new game with publisher Square Enix to be distributed digitally. The game was announced to be Life Is Strange, and was released in 2015 over the course of five instalments. It was initially thought of as a full-length title that Dontnod would self-publish, but became an episodic title after Square Enix suggested it. The game received generally favourable reviews, over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings and as of May 2017, had sold in excess of three million copies. The financial and commercial success of Life Is Strange marked a change in how the studio was perceived in the industry. Following its release, Dontnod started being solicited by publishers, whereas they previously had to pursue publishers themselves.|$|E

But this fact affected <b>me</b> little. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> not bring <b>me</b> Bertha. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> not bring <b>me</b> any message from her. It was an ordinary vessel of traffic. I took no great interest in it, one way or the other.|$|R

2500|$|Seeing no {{alternative}} to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the federation. The Parliament of Malaysia voted 126-0, with all Singaporean MPs boycotting the vote, in favour of the expulsion on 9 August 1965. On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced on a televised press conference that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he uttered that: [...] "I mean for <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a moment of anguish because all my life….you see the whole of my adult life…. I have believed in Merger and {{the unity of the}} two territories. You know it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship..." [...] The new state became the Republic of Singapore.|$|E
