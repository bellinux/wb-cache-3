5|$|The main <b>muscular</b> <b>system</b> in {{bivalves}} is {{the posterior}} and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|The <b>muscular</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as {{is seen in}} most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>muscular</b> <b>system</b> {{of insects}} ranges {{from a few}} hundred muscles to a few thousand. Unlike {{vertebrates}} that have both smooth and striated muscles, insects have only striated muscles. Muscle cells are amassed into muscle fibers {{and then into the}} functional unit, the muscle. Muscles are attached to the body wall, with attachment fibers running through the cuticle and to the epicuticle, where they can move different parts of the body including appendages such as wings.|$|E

Steno was invited {{to live in the}} Palazzo Vecchio; in return he had to gather a cabinet of curiosities. Steno went to Rome and met Pope Alexander VII and Marcello Malpighi, whom he admired. On his way back he watched a Corpus Christi procession in Livorno and wondered if he had the right belief. In Florence Steno focused on the <b>muscular</b> <b>system</b> and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steno proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.|$|E

500|$|In February 2016, a {{commercial}} for Coca-Cola mini cans aired during Super Bowl 50. A Mini Marvel was created by Wieden+Kennedy for Coca-Cola through a partnership with Marvel, and was directed by the Russo brothers. In the ad, Ant-Man (voiced by Paul Rudd, reprising his role) and the Hulk first fight, and then bond, over a Coke mini can. Luma Pictures provided visual effects for the spot, having worked previously with the two characters in MCU films. For the Hulk, Luma redefined its previous <b>muscular</b> <b>system</b> and simulation process to create and render the character, while Ant-Man received new motion capture. The Super Bowl campaign extended to [...] "limited-edition Coke mini cans [...] that are emblazoned with images of Marvel characters, including Hulk, Ant-Man, Black Widow, [...] and Captain America." [...] Consumers {{had the opportunity to}} purchase the cans by finding hidden clues in the commercial, though [...] "if the program goes well, Coke will consider making the cans available in stores."

2500|$|In humans, {{adipose tissue}} is located {{beneath the skin}} (subcutaneous fat), around {{internal}} organs (visceral fat), in bone marrow (yellow bone marrow), intermuscular (<b>Muscular</b> <b>system)</b> and in the breast tissue. [...] Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which {{are referred to as}} adipose depots. Apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose tissue, other cell types are present, collectively termed stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells. SVF includes preadipocytes, fibroblasts, adipose tissue macrophages, and endothelial cells. Adipose tissue contains many small blood vessels. In the integumentary system, which includes the skin, it accumulates in the deepest level, the subcutaneous layer, providing insulation from heat and cold. [...] Around organs, it provides protective padding. However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be oxidised to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess glucose by storing triglycerides produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence suggests that most lipid synthesis from carbohydrates occurs in the adipose tissue itself. Adipose depots {{in different parts of the}} body have different biochemical profiles. Under normal conditions, it provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain.|$|E
