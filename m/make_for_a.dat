5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

5|$|Gone to Coney Island and Booming Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} {{together on a}} single film reel on July 5, 1910. Gone to Coney Island is a comedy that features Coney Island, which the mere subject would <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> successful film. Booming Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored Gone to Coney Island, but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because Coney Island subjects were deemed self-explanatory. Booming Business received one detailed review in The New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Argentina {{is a complex}} subject: the vast size {{of the country and}} {{considerable}} variation in altitude <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide range of climate types. Argentina has four seasons: winter (June–August), spring (September–November), summer (December–February) and autumn (March–May), all featuring different weather conditions. Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season. Winters are normally mild in the north, cool in the center and cold in the southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow. Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans, the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, Prinz Eugen rendezvoused {{with the}} supply ship Spichern to refill her nearly empty fuel tanks. She had by then only some 160 tons fuel left, {{enough for a}} day. Afterwards the ship {{continued}} further south on a mission against shipping lines. However, before any merchant ship was found, defects in her engines showed and on 27 May, the day Bismarck herself was sunk, she was ordered {{to give up her}} mission and <b>make</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> port in occupied France. On 28 May Prinz Eugen refuelled from the tanker Esso Hamburg. The same day more engine problems showed up, including trouble with the port engine turbine, the cooling of the middle engine and problems with the starboard screw, reducing her speed to maximum 28 knots. The screw problems could only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus Brest, with its large docks and repair facilities, was chosen as destination. Despite the many British warships and several convoys in the area, at least 104 units were identified on the 29th by the ship's radio crew, Prinz Eugen reached the Bay of Biscay undiscovered, and on 1 June the ship was joined by German destroyers and aircraft off the coast of France south of Brest; and escorted to Brest, which she reached late on 1 June where she immediately entered dock.|$|E
