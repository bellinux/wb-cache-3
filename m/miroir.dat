25|$|Painted {{during the}} spring of 1916, Femme au <b>miroir</b> formed part of the {{collection}} of Léonce Rosenberg, and was probably exhibited at Galerie de L'Effort Moderne in Paris. In 1918, the painting was shipped to New York City for the occasion of the Léonce Rosenberg collection auction. For the same occasion, Femme au <b>miroir</b> was reproduced in The Sun, New York, Sunday 28 April 1918. The painting was purchased in New York City (at the auction or afterwards) by the American art collector John Quinn, and formed part of his collection until 1927.|$|E
25|$|Her only son, Jean, {{was born}} in Blois on 7 July 1530, when Marguerite was thirty-eight, an age {{considered}} old by sixteenth century standards. The child died on Christmas Day the same year. Scholars believe that her grief motivated Marguerite to write her most controversial work, <b>Miroir</b> de l'âme pécheresse, in 1531.|$|E
25|$|In 1918 Femme au <b>miroir</b> was {{included}} in the exhibition and sale in New York of the Léonce Rosenberg collection. In the catalogue the painting (No. 97) is titled Lady at her Dressing Table, signed Metzinger and dated April 1916 on the back. The dimensions given are 36 1/2 x 25 1/2 inches. For the occasion of the Léonce Rosenberg sale, Lady at her Dressing Table was reproduced in an article published in The Sun (New York, N.Y.).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Miroirs</b> (French for [...] "Mirrors") is a five-movement suite for solo piano {{written by}} French {{composer}} Maurice Ravel between 1904 and 1905. First performed by Ricardo Viñes in 1906, <b>Miroirs</b> contains five movements, each {{dedicated to a}} fellow member of the French avant-garde artist group Les Apaches.|$|R

25|$|Marguerite wrote many {{poems and}} plays. Her most notable works are a classic {{collection}} of short stories, the Heptameron, and a remarkably intense religious poem, <b>Miroir</b> de l'âme pécheresse (Mirror of the Sinful Soul). This poem is a first-person, mystical narrative of the soul as a yearning woman calling out to Christ as her father-brother-lover. Her work was passed to the royal court of England, suggesting that Marguerite had influence on the Protestant Reformation in England.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, L'Auto was closed– {{its doors}} nailed shut– and its belongings, {{including}} the Tour, sequestrated {{by the state}} for publishing articles {{too close to the}} Germans. Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, L'Équipe, but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of Sports and <b>Miroir</b> Sprint. Each organised a candidate race. L'Équipe and Le Parisien Libéré had La Course du Tour de France and Sports and <b>Miroir</b> Sprint had La Ronde de France. Both were five stages, the longest the government would allow because of shortages. L'Équipes race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. L'Équipe was given the right to organise the 1947 Tour de France. However, L'Équipes finances were never sound and Goddet accepted an advance by Émilion Amaury, who had supported his bid to run the post-war Tour. Amaury was a newspaper magnate whose condition was that his sports editor, Félix Lévitan should join Goddet for the Tour. The two worked together, Goddet running the sporting side and Lévitan the financial.|$|E
25|$|Kobayashi's output did not slow {{in later}} years. He {{directed}} Roman Porno Queen Junko Miyashita in her film debut in I Lost Control of Myself Like This (1971). From 1972 until 1983 he made pink films for the Shochiku subsidiary, Tōkatsu. L'ambition dans le <b>miroir</b> (1972), his first film for the studio, {{was one of}} Kobayashi's largest productions. Other titles Kobayashi made for Tōkatsu include Pervert's Pitfall and The High School Girl Who Likes to Be Watched (both 1976), Peeping Assault (1977) and Looking from Below (1981).|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Gris and Metzinger painted {{during the war}} employ {{transparencies}} that blur {{the distinction between the}} background and the figure. Rather than gradients of tone or color, these works are painted with flat, uniform sections of tone and color. Albeit, in Femme au <b>miroir</b> Metzinger uses a textured surface in the lighter blue areas. Some minimal brushstrokes remain visible throughout these paintings. Each represents objects or elements of the real world; such as perfume bottles, moulding of the walls, an ear ring; and human figures. Most outstanding of all, however, is the angular juxtaposition of the surface planes, which the works hold in common.|$|E
25|$|Femme au <b>miroir</b> (en. Woman with a Mirror), Femme à sa toilette or Lady at her Dressing Table, is a {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less surface activity, with {{a strong emphasis on}} larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying geometric configuration, rooted in the abstract, controls nearly every element of the composition. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The work of Juan Gris from the summer of 1916 to late 1918 bares much in common with that of Metzinger's late 1915, early 1916 paintings.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Société des Amis des Livres, which he found too {{conservative}} and too {{concerned with the}} reissue of old works, he started two new bibliographic societies, the Société des Bibliophiles Contemporaines (1889–1894) and the Societé des Bibliophiles Indépendants (1896–1901). The first consisted of 160 people, including the writers Jules Claretie and Jean Richepin, the artists Albert Robida and Paul Avril, and the journalist and critic Francisque Sarcey. Uzanne also edited two magazines, Conseiller du bibliophile (literally, Adviser of bibliophile, 1876–1877) and Les miscellanées bibliographiques (The Bibliographical Miscellany, 1878–1880), and then ran three consecutive bibliophilic magazines: Le livre : bibliographie moderne (literally, The Book: Modern Bibliography, 1880–1889), Le livre moderne : revue du monde littéraire et des bibliophiles contemporaines (literally, The Modern Book: Journal of the Literary World and Contemporary Bibliophiles, 1890–1891), and L'Art et l'Idée : revue contemporaine du dilettantisme l'littéraire et de la curiosité (Art and Ideas: Contemporary Journal of the Literary Dilettantism and Curiosity, 1892–1893). In the early 1890s, he {{was considered to be}} [...] "...the best authority that book lovers know on subjects specially interesting to book lovers". Nevertheless, such books as Le <b>Miroir</b> du Monde (The Mirror of the World) or L'ombrelle – le gant – le manchon (The Sunshade, Muff, and Glove) received negative reviews from some newspapers for Avril's illustrations.|$|E

2500|$|It is conjectured that Marguerite gave Anne the {{original}} manuscript of <b>Miroir</b> de l'âme pécheresse at some point. It {{is certain that}} in 1544, nine years after Anne Boleyn's execution by her husband Henry VIII, that Anne's daughter, who would become Elizabeth I (1533–1603), translated this very same poem by Marguerite into English prose as The <b>Miroir</b> or Glasse of the Synneful Soul when she was eleven years old and presented it, written in her own hand, to her then-stepmother, the English queen Katherine Parr. [...] This literary connection among Marguerite, Anne, Katherine Parr, and the future Queen Elizabeth I suggests a direct mentoring link between the legacy of reformist religious convictions and Marguerite.|$|E
2500|$|Metzinger's {{evolution}} toward synthesis has {{its origins}} in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a [...] "new perspective" [...] {{in accord with the}} [...] "laws of displacement". In the case of Le Fumeur Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in Au Vélodrome. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards Femme au <b>miroir,</b> {{and a host of other}} works created before and after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as L'infirmière (The Nurse) location unknown; Soldier at a Game of Chess (1914–15) Smart Museum of Art; Landscape with Open Window (1915) Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes; Femme à la dentelle (1916) Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Summer (1916) Statens Museum for Kunst; Le goûter (1917) Galerie Malingue, Paris; Tête de femme (1916–17) private collection; and two works very closely related to Femme au miroir: Femme devant le <b>miroir</b> (c. 1914) private collection; Femme au <b>miroir</b> (1916–17) Donn Shapiro collection.|$|E
