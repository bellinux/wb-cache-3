40|$|This paper {{studies the}} fading {{behavior}} of narrowband mobile-to-mobile (M 2 M) fading channels in dual-hop distributed cooperative multi-relay systems under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation conditions. M 2 M fading channels considered here {{are associated with}} amplify-and-forward relay networks, where K mobile relays are connected in parallel between the source <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> and the destination <b>mobile</b> <b>station.</b> Such <b>M</b> 2 M fading channels {{are referred to as}} K-parallel dual-hop relay M 2 M fading channels. We study the fading behavior of these channels by analyzing the level-crossing rate (LCR) and the average duration of fades (ADF) of the received signal envelope. We derive analytical integral expressions of the aforementioned quantities along with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the envelope. These statistical quantities are derived assuming that the underlying stochastic processes are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. In addition, the statistical analysis pertaining to the special case of independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) processes is also presented in this paper. The validity of the presented expressions is confirmed by simulations. Our results are very beneficial for future performance analysis of overall dual-hop distributed cooperative multi-relay systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{mobility}} {{management is}} one of the most critical issues in mobile wireless systems. The quest to support delay-stringent multimedia applications challenges most existing solutions to the mobility management problem. We propose a mobility management scheme, called Mobile AP, to support station mobility efficiently. In Mobile AP mobility support system, the context of each <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is defined by the association states between the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> and the wireless communication infrastructure. When the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> roams in <b>Mobile</b> AP systems, the context of the association follows the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> from one physical access point to another, thus eliminating the need for the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> to re-associate with new access points.
