5000|$|Based on the {{macroscopic}} {{theory of}} ideal (free) diffusion the impulse response of a unicast molecular communication channel {{was reported in}} a paper that identified that the impulse response of the ideal diffusion based molecular communication channel experiences temporal spreading. Such temporal spreading has a deep impact {{in the performance of}} the system e.g. in creating the intersymbol interference (ISI) at the receiving nanomachine. In order to detect the concentration-encoded <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> two detection methods named sampling-based detection (SD) and energy-based detection (ED) have been proposed. While the SD approach is based on the concentration amplitude of only one sample taken at a suitable time instant during the symbol duration, the ED approach is based on the total accumulated number of molecules received during the entire symbol duration. In order to reduce the impact of ISI a controlled pulse-width based molecular communication scheme has been analysed.

5000|$|The {{systemic}} acquired resistance (SAR) is a [...] "whole-plant" [...] resistance {{response that}} occurs following an earlier localized exposure to a pathogen. SAR {{is analogous to the}} innate immune system found in animals, and there is evidence that SAR in plants and innate immunity in animals may be evolutionarily conserved. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures were identified in rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. SAR is important for plants to resist disease, as well as to recover from disease once formed. SAR can be induced by a wide range of pathogens, especially (but not only) those that cause tissue necrosis, and the resistance observed following induction of SAR is effective against a wide range of pathogens, which is why SAR resistance is sometimes called [...] "broad spectrum." [...] SAR is associated with the induction {{of a wide range of}} genes (so called PR or [...] "pathogenesis-related" [...] genes), and the activation of SAR requires the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). The pathogen-induced SA signal activates a <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathway that is identified by a gene called NIM1, NPR1 or SAI1 (three names for the same gene) in the model genetic system Arabidopsis thaliana. SAR has been observed in a wide range of flowering plants, including dicotyledon and monocotyledon species. SAR can be activated in corn, however, widely adapted commercial like Benzothiadiazole may not be efficient against P. sorghi causing common rust.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{uncertainties}} for climate change {{is the importance of}} aerosol direct and indirect effects. The uncertainties were stressed in the 4th Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). The large diversity of aerosol optical properties, including their sources and the meteorological processes they are subjected to, requires vertically resolved measurements, which can only be performed with routine lidar observations. Networks of aerosol lidars such as the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) [...] were established to investigate aerosol properties, along with transport and modification phenomena, in a coherent way on a regional to continental scale. As of 2015, EARLINET consists of 27 lidar stations hosting more than 44000 profiles.Elastic-backscatter lidars (EBL) have been used extensively to investigate clouds and aerosol layers since the 1960s. EBLs detect the total backscattered signal (particle and molecular contributions). Profiles of the extinction coefficient have to be estimated using the <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> and the assumption of a conditionally “constant” (roughly speaking) aerosol extinction to backscatter ratio, called the lidar ratio. The main equation involved, known as the lidar equation is:where P(r) is the power of the backscattered radiation received by the lidar telescope in distance r, E is transmitted laser-pulse energy, L is the lidar constant summarizing its optical and detection characteristics, O(r) is the overlap function, and [...] and [...] are the aerosol/molecular backscatter- and extinction coefficient respectively. Molecular backscatter and extinction can be derived by meteorological data, therefore the only unknowns in the lidar equation are [...] and [...] However the lidar ratio, as an intensive aerosol property, strongly depends on the size, morphology and chemical composition of the particles and is highly variable with respect to height, which often risks the extinction profile credibility. The process for calculating backscatter- and extinction coefficient profiles from EBL returns is widely known as the Klett method [...] and was originally formalised by Hitschfeld and Bordan in 1954. [...] The aforementioned defect on estimating extinction profiles is overcome by the Raman (inelastic) backscatter lidar by additionally measuring the inelastic backscatter by nitrogen and/or oxygen molecules. This technique provides a direct calculation of the extinction coefficient, eliminating the need for a lidar ratio assumption since any additional terms involved (e.g. the molecular extinction coefficient) are handled by meteorological (e.g. radiosoundings) and standard-atmosphere data. After some mathematical manipulations of the lidar equation the extinction-related equation reads:where the subscripts “inc” and “sca” refer to the incident laser light and the shifted backscattered light respectively, N is the nitrogen / oxygen molecule number density and [...] is the Ångström exponent. A drawback of this method is the presence of a derivative in the resulting extinction coefficient formula (...) which results in potential numerical instability, introducing an active field of research.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{human cells}} in culture enter replicative {{senescence}} after {{a finite number}} of population doublings. The exact molecular mechanisms triggering the growth arrest are poorly understood. A recent report on the disappearance of the G-rich 3 ′ telomeric overhang in senescent cells led to the hypothesis that loss of the 3 ′ G-rich overhang is the <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> that triggers senescence. Here, we describe a quantitative assay to measure the length of the G-rich 3 ′ telomeric overhangs from cultured cells. Using both this assay and the conventional nondenaturing hybridization assay for measuring G-rich overhangs, we show that normal human fibroblasts can maintain their overhangs at senescence. Furthermore, cells do not lose their overhangs when they bypass senescence after the inactivation of p 53 and Rb. We thus conclude that a global reduction in overhang length is not the <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> that triggers replicative senescence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As system sizes shrink, {{the usual}} {{macroscopic}} meth-ods of communication using electromagnetic and acoustic waves become increasingly less efficient owing to mismatches between realizable antenna sizes and the propagation {{characteristics of the}} medium.

During cytokinesis a cleavage furrow is formed and ingresses between the two future daughter cells.

40|$|To {{communicate}} at the nanoscale, {{researchers have}} proposed molecular communication as an energy-efficient solution. The drawback to this solution {{is that the}} histogram of the molecules' hitting times, which constitute the <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing {{the effects of this}} heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), {{has been the focus of}} most prior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a counting region on the spherical receiver's surface facing towards the transmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that the molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be coming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this idea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and time is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is approximated for the proposed system, i. e., the partially counting absorbing spherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the characteristics of the <b>molecular</b> <b>signal</b> are investigated and improved performance is presented. Moreover, the optimal counting region in terms of bit error rate is found analytically. Comment: submitted to Transactions on Communication...|$|E
