500|$|A {{real estate}} boom {{occurred}} in the U.S. {{after the end of}} the First World War, with a particular surge in the construction of new skyscrapers between 1925 and 1931. In New York, a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931, with [...] of new office space added between 1925 and 1929 alone. In Chicago, limited wartime construction created supply shortages, and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924. This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city. The boom inflated prices in the real estate market, leading to speculative financing and building projects, including the introduction of 100 percent mortgages for new builds. An early edition of the Fortune magazine commented wryly that [...] "all a man needs to own a skyscraper is the money and the land. And he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along without the money." ...|$|E

2500|$|Punitive or {{exemplary}} damages {{are used to}} punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award. [...] Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions. [...] In the UK, {{exemplary damages}} are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud. [...] Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> exemplary damages.|$|E

2500|$|According to Hauerwas, a â€œgood {{death is}} a death that we can prepare for through living because {{we are able to}} see that death is but a {{necessary}} correlative to a good life." [...] A long life may give a person more of a chance to have a good death because he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring for us to see that they are sustaining us.|$|E

We wish to bring the syndrome {{to the attention of}} others who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> elucidate the etiology further. Because hematological examinations are frequently not done on calves, this condition <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more common than reports suggest. Perhaps others who observe this syndrome in calves <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> investigate the role of other agents such as viruses or mycotoxins.
