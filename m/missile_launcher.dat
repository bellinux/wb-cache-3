5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear <b>missile</b> <b>launcher</b> and a surface-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>launcher.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wanat {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the bloodiest Taliban attacks of the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts. In contrast to previous roadside bombings and haphazard attacks and ambushes, this attack was well-coordinated with fighters from many insurgent groups with an effort that was disciplined and sustained which was able to precisely target key equipment such as a wire-guided <b>missile</b> <b>launcher.</b>|$|E
5|$|Surface-to-surface missile battalions {{were divided}} into three or four batteries, each {{equipped}} with one <b>missile</b> <b>launcher.</b> They operated thirty FROG-3 and eighteen SCUD missile launchers. The FROG-3, a tactical missile first introduced in 1960, was being replaced in other non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, FROG and SCUD missiles would be ineffective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles.|$|E
50|$|The Safeguard system {{consisted}} of several primary components, the Perimeter Acquisition Radar, the Missile Site Radar, the Spartan <b>missile</b> <b>launchers,</b> co-located Sprint <b>missile</b> <b>launchers,</b> and Remote Sprint <b>missile</b> <b>launchers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The initial attack hit {{the forward}} {{operating}} base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW <b>missile</b> <b>launcher</b> inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and TOW launcher which were {{to provide the}} heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers. The explosion of the mortar shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesian {{air traffic}} was not seriously {{threatened}} until about 1977, {{in the latter}} stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>launcher,</b> supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s {{as part of the}} Warsaw Pact's materiel support. By September 1978, there had been 20reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar <b>missile</b> <b>launcher,</b> and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E

5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>launcher</b> to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in Camp Doha, Kuwait.

50|$|Nevertheless, the CGN-38-class cruisers, {{with their}} missile {{magazines}} and Mk-26 <b>missile</b> <b>launchers,</b> were incapable of carrying the SM-2ER long-range surface-to-air missile, being {{restricted to the}} SM-2MR medium-range surface-to-air missile. This was a significant limitation in their capabilities. Another weakness was the loss of LAMPS helicopters, due to the installation of Tomahawk cruise <b>missile</b> <b>launchers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Bell AH-1Z Viper {{features}} several design changes. The AH-1Z's two redesigned wing stubs {{are longer}} with each adding a wingtip station for a missile {{such as the}} AIM-9 Sidewinder. Each wing has two other stations for 70mm (2.75in) Hydra rocket pods, or AGM-114 Hellfire quad <b>missile</b> <b>launcher.</b> The Longbow radar can be mounted on a wingtip station. The AH-1W version will be phased out of the Marine Corps by 2020.|$|E
25|$|As {{a guided}} missile destroyer, Brisbanes main {{armament}} {{consisted of a}} Mark 13 <b>missile</b> <b>launcher</b> firing Tartar missiles and two Ikara anti-submarine missile launchers. This was supplemented by two 5"/54 calibre Mark 42 guns and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets. Over {{the course of the}} ship's career, the Mark 13 launcher was modified to fire Standard missiles, two Phalanx CIWS units were installed in 1990, and the Ikara launchers were removed in 1991.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the most}} heavily armed IFVs, the BMD-4 {{possesses}} multiple secondary armaments.
