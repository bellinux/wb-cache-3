5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong had {{recovered}} from severe heart {{problems in the}} late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him {{in the event of}} his death.

5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E

5|$|The German Church of Scientology has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The {{court ruled that the}} use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{support of}} the Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (who was also Prime Minister of the United Kingdom then), for an Anglican King's College London and the Roman Catholic Relief Act, which was {{to lead to the}} granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea, in early 1829. Winchilsea and his supporters wished for King's to be subject to the Test Acts, like the universities of Oxford, where only <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of England could matriculate, and Cambridge, where non-Anglicans could matriculate but not graduate, but this was not Wellington's intent.|$|E
5|$|About 70% {{of student}} tuition {{is funded by}} LDS Church tithing funds, making tuition less {{expensive}} for church members than at similar private universities.

For the 2014-2015 school year, Marriott School tuition for full-time LDS undergraduates is $2,500 per semester; for Marriott School graduate students, it is $5,810 per semester. All Marriott School students may apply for several school-specific and university-wide financial aid opportunities. Some are program-specific, others are need-based. The Hawes Scholars program is the highest scholarship distinction given to MBA students at the school.
