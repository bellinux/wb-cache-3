The species YAc 2 + and YAc 2 + were found to dominate yttrium aqueous speciation in experimental solutions at 25 100 °C (log [Ac?] < ? 1. 5, pH < 5. 2), whereas at 125, 150 and 175 °C introduction of YAc 30 into the Y Ac speciation model was necessary.

Seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits, one such example of an unconventional resource, will be mined for their high ore grade and abundance along oceanic plate margins. As these deposits are mined, fresh and highly reactive surfaces of sulfide minerals will be exposed to seawater, causing them to immediately oxidize.

Experiments run from pH 2 - 5, 0. 995 or 0. 10 atm O 2, and temperatures of 285 – 303 K were used in rate law calculations.

Results show that the initial concentration of dissolved oxygen is more influential upon the initial pyrite oxidation rate than the initial pH of the seawater under acidic, low temperature conditions. The pyrite oxidation rate in acidic seawater is the slowest of the sulfides pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite, with the reaction proceeding up to three orders of magnitude slower than that of pyrrhotite in synthetic seawater. The slow pyrite weathering rate (whether natural or anthropogenically induced) enhanced pyrite preservation in massive sulfide deposits.

Title of Thesis Osmotic concentracion of {{parenteral}} preparations. Electrolytes. Concentraction of the dissolved {{substances in}} parenteral solutions, which {{is involved in}} osmotic pressure of the preparation, is expressed as osmolarity (mosmol ∙ l- 1). This better complies to practical application and relates to molar concentration (mol ∙ l- 1). However, osmolarity cannot be measured, while osmolality (mosmol ∙ kg- 1) can. In this work, density at 20 řC and osmolality of aqueous solutions of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and ammonium chloride with <b>molal</b> <b>concentration</b> in a range 0, 1 - 1, 0 mol ∙ kg- 1 and/or molar concentration in a range 0, 1 - 1, 0 mol ∙ l- 1, respectively, were measured. The experimental data were used to estimate osmolarity. Molal osmotic factors of the dissolved solutes in molal solutions were expressed. The values decreased when the concentration increased. Estimation of the actuall osmolarity requires knowledge of the solutions density and the partial molal volume of the dissolved solute. No differences were observed when derived it from molal and/or molar solution concentration. Therefore, the [...] ...|$|E

Martina Pavelková Title of Thesis: Osmolality of {{parenteral}} preparations. Phosphates 1. The aim of {{this work}} was to prepare aqueous solutions of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate, in the concentration range from 0. 01 to 0. 3 mol/kg respectively mol/l and to measure their density and osmolality. Density with increasing temperature {{in the range from}} 15 řC to 40 řC decreased nonlinearly; the relationship was described by quadratic regression equations. At constant temperature, the density of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate, is directly proportional to the concentration. Osmolality increases with <b>molal</b> and molar <b>concentration</b> increases, the dependence was described by quadratic regression equation with a coefficient of determination 0. 8759 for molal solutions and 0. 8591 for molar solutions. From the measured values of osmolality was determined molal osmotic coefficient, whose values decrease when a concentration of the solution increased. The average density value of each of the solutions at temperature of 25 řC were used for the mutual conversion between molality and molarity and to estimate the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{differential}} calorimeter {{has been}} constructed {{to measure the}} heats of dilution of electrolytic solutions. The differential method made possible the determination of heats of dilution to within a few thousands of a calorie. Precision of this order was necessary to obtain meaningful values for the thermodynamic properties of very dilute solutions;The heats of dilution of neodymium chloride and erbium chloride solutions have been measured at 25 °C for concentrations up to 0. 2 molal. Empirical expressions for the relative apparent molal heat content of the solute, 2 ̆ 6 phis; L; the relative partial molal heat content of the solvent, L¯ 1; and the relative partial molal heat content of the solute, L¯ 2, have been derived from the heats of dilution. The following equations have been derived for neodymium chloride solutions: fL= 6925 m 1 / 2 - 16725 m+ 22278 m 3 / 2 - 7596 m 2, 74 L 12 ̆ 6 d 1;= - 62. 37 m 3 / 2 + 301. 32 m 2 - 602. 04 m 5 / 2 + 273. 70 m 3, 80 L 22 ̆ 6 d 1;= 10387 m 1 / 2 - 33450 m+ 55695 m 3 / 2 + 22788 m 2. 79 The corresponding equations for erbium chloride solutions were as follows: fL= 5687 m 1 / 2 - 8637 m + 7066 m 3 / 2, 87 L 12 ̆ 6 d 1;=- 51. 2 3 m 3 / 2 + 155. 60 m 2 - 190. 95 m 5 / 2, 88 L 22 ̆ 6 d 1;= 8531 m 1 / 2 - 17274 m+ 17665 m 3 / 2. 89;The thermodynamic properties of neodymium chloride and erbium chloride solutions were the same, within experimental error, for concentrations above 0. 02 <b>molal.</b> For <b>concentrations</b> below 4 x 10 - 4 molal, the thermodynamic properties of neodymium chloride solutions followed the Debye-Huckel law predictions, but the thermodynamic properties of erbium chloride solutions appeared to depart from theoretical predictions...|$|R
40|$|In the laboratory, {{solutions}} of {{polyethylene glycols}} (PEGs) {{are used to}} control and apply suction in soils using the osmotic technique. In this study, the suctions of PEGs with molecular weights (Mr) of 1500, 4000, 6000, and 20 000 were measured at 25 °C using the chilled-mirror dew-point technique. The mass ratio of PEG–water mixtures was varied between 0. 09 to 1. 09 g of PEG/g of water to cover {{a wide range of}} suction from 0. 09 MPa to 12. 2 MPa. The results showed that, in general, PEGs with low Mr generated greater suctions than those with higher Mr. The difference between suctions of PEGs 6000 and 20 000 was found to be minor. Concurrent with previous reports, analysis of the test results in terms of molality and molarity versus suction showed that PEGs with high M r generated greater suctions than those with lower Mr. For any PEG, both <b>molal</b> and molar <b>concentrations</b> tend to generate similar suctions at low concentrations, whereas the density effect of PEG–water mixtures was found to be significant at high concentrations in that suctions corresponding to molar concentrations were far greater than their molal series counterparts. In general, good agreements were noted between the suctions measured in this study and those reported in the literature for similar PEG types. New equations were proposed that independently related mass ratio, molality, and molarity to suction of the PEGs studied. Additionally, relationships were established between the measured % Brix values and suctions of the PEGs studied...|$|R
