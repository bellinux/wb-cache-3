40|$|Degranulation of basophils {{took place}} in {{sensitized}} guinea-pigs when challenged with specific antigen, {{regardless of whether the}} animals had received a <b>mepyramine</b> <b>maleate</b> (anti-histamine) injection or not. The degranulation was most pronounced in the first 5 minutes following challenge. The discharged basophil granules were taken up by the neutrophils, the macrophages, and the monocytes in the bone marrow; the neutrophils, however, responded much more promptly and actively than the other phagocytes. Phagocytosis of the discharged basophil granules was most active 10 – 15 minutes following challenge, during which varying numbers of phagocytic vacuoles were found in the phagocytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The bark of Terminalia arjuna L. (Combretaceae) {{is used in}} Ayurveda since {{ancient times}} for the {{treatment}} of cardiac disorders. Previous laboratory investigations have demonstrated the use of the bark in cardiovascular complications. The present study was aimed to find the effect of 70 % alcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna on anaesthetized dog blood pressure and probable site of action. Methods Six dogs were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of thiopental sodium and the blood pressure of each dog (n = 6) was measured from the left common carotid artery connected to a mercury manometer on kymograph. The femoral vein was cannulated for administration of drug solutions. The extract of T. arjuna (dissolved in propylene glycol) in the dose range of 5 to 15 mg/kg were administered intravenously in a pilot study and the dose (6 mg/kg) which produced appreciable hypotension was selected for further studies. Results Intravenous administration of T. arjuna produced dose-dependent hypotension in anaesthetized dogs. The hypotension produced by 6 mg/kg dose of the extract was blocked by propranolol but not by atropine or <b>mepyramine</b> <b>maleate.</b> This indicates that muscarinic or histaminergic mechanisms {{are not likely to be}} involved in the hypotension produced by the extract. The blockade by propranolol of the hypotension produced by T. arjuna indicates that the extract might contain active compound(s) possessing adrenergic ß 2 -receptor agonist action and/or that act directly on the heart muscle. Conclusion The results indicated the likely involvement of peripheral mechanism for hypotension produced by the 70 % alcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna and lends support for the claims of its traditional usage in cardiovascular disorders. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{contractile}} or relaxant {{activities or}} both of aqueous extracts of green and roasted coffees were assayed on isolated guinea pig tracheal spirals. Contractile and relaxant activities were compared with histamine and theophylline, respectively. Green coffee extracts induced concentration dependent contraction, but the maximal tension never exceeded 76. 3 % +/- 5. 2 of a maximal histamine contraction (0. 69 +/- 0. 07 g/mm 2 v 0. 52 +/- 0. 05 g/mm 2; p (0. 01). One gram of green coffee dust had a biological activity equivalent to 1. 23 +/- 0. 1 mg of histamine. The pD 2 value of histamine was - 5. 17 +/- 0. 05. The potency of green coffee was unaffected by <b>mepyramine</b> <b>maleate</b> (1 micrograms/ml, final bath concentration) while that of histamine was reduced 500 fold. Tissues contracted with histamine were not significantly relaxed by green coffee extracts. By contrast, roasted coffee extracts induced concentration dependent relaxation of uncontracted and histamine contracted tissues. Tissues contracted with green coffee extracts were also completely relaxed by roasted coffee extracts. The pD 2 value of theophylline was - 4. 10 +/- 0. 03. The relaxant activity of 1 g of roasted coffee was equivalent to 1. 95 +/- 0. 16 mg of theophylline. The potency of these extracts was significantly reduced after propranolol (1 micrograms/ml; dose ratio 1. 56). Our results show that coffee dust extracts have considerable biological activity which changes from a contractile to a relaxant action {{as a consequence of}} processing. The greater incidence of adverse reactions to green coffee dust(s) in coffee workers {{may be related to the}} contractile activity present in green coffee dust...|$|E
