The mission was successful. Fairley was able to secure supplies and expedite the delivery of those that were already on order but held up for lack of shipping or priority. In bringing the problem {{to the attention of}} the highest allied military and civil authorities overseas, he lifted the global profile and priority of malaria control measures.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is <b>more</b> <b>adequate</b> than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the <b>more</b> <b>adequate</b> symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E

This included vertical attacks, with the existence of machicolations over the entranceway and that served as the residence of the commander.|$|E
25|$|In his 1997 account, Chatterjee infers the {{presence}} of feathers from alleged quill knobs on the badly smashed ulna and metacarpals III and IV, and infers {{the presence}} of remiges from such structures (though he does caution that this is uncertain). As {{is the case with}} the alleged quill knobs on the ulna, the metacarpal structures appear to be attributable to post-mortem damage. Moreover, the thumb, unlike the case in all birds, is not medially divergent. Considering how poorly preserved the ulna is, it is entirely premature to make any definitive conclusions as to {{the presence of}} quill knobs until such time as <b>more</b> <b>adequate</b> material becomes available. Upon further examination of the material no structures were isolated that could be deemed as homologous to remigial papillae.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein's {{suggestion}} (PI, §66) {{about the}} impossibility of formulating a definition of games portrays a predicament for disciplines, which entail games as their subject matter, because it denies the possibility to know what games are. One possible solution is {{to point out that}} Wittgenstein merely acts out his failing attempt to define the concept of game, because he wanted to demonstrate a mechanism of language. He wasn't particularly concerned about games, nor about the concept of 'game', but he was interested in the consequence of a definitory failure. The demonstration aims to show, that {{there is no reason to}} search for real definitions, which describe essential attributes of things, but rather nominal definitions, which describe the use of the term in a community. He connected this idea to language games – lingual expressions combined with action – as a <b>more</b> <b>adequate</b> alternative to explain the function of language. Confusing this is his choice to denominate the approach (PI, §7) as 'language games', further fueling the impression that he provides insights about the concept of game. Wittgenstein wasn't interested in games but in language, therefore his theories and examples are only superficially related to academic disciplines with games as subject matter.|$|E

25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any new products and services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise <b>more</b> <b>adequate</b> measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E

Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined {{that the process of}} moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime, a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.|$|E
