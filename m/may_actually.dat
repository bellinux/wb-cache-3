5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E

5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature plants {{and the depth of}} the leaf-margin incisions.

5|$|In 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) {{changed its}} {{assessment}} of the killer whale's conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There {{is little evidence that}} it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder is shown {{evidence}} of alien life which <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> {{be part of a}} huge government hoax designed to deflect attention from secret military programs. Meanwhile, Scully struggles with her cancer in the face of hostility from her brother, who believes she should no longer be working.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E

5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by {{the glory of the}} statues housed within the halls of the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E

5|$|Despite finding like-minded {{students}} in Vienna, the city's climate took {{a toll on}} Andrić's health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> have been {{taking part in a}} protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones. For a time, Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He transferred in early 1914, and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds <b>may</b> <b>actually</b> increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
