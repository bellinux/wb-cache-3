50|$|The {{climate of}} the Kaiserstuhl also {{explains}} the vast richness of thermophile flora and fauna. The Kaiserstuhl is for example {{one of the places}} with the largest variety of orchids in Europe - more than 30 species have been recorded. Among the vines wild grape hyacinths sprawl and along acclivities iris plants blossom. Furthermore, sand lizards (lacerta bilineata) and praying mantis (Mantis religiosa) live here - species which mainly occur in the Mediterranean area. (However, according to the latest research results the sand lizard presumably belongs to the allochthone species of the European green lizard (Lacerta viridis)). The pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) is a Xerophyte and normally only occurs in Southern Europe, but is also able to survive at the Kaiserstuhl. This species has a disjunct distribution, which means away from its normal habitat. It is a relict of a postglacial warm period where there had been a much warmer climate around the Kaiserstuhl. After the end of the warm period only the named species were able to survive. Besides there is a larger population of the <b>May</b> <b>beetle</b> (Melolontha melolontha). In spite of protests from conservationists the <b>May</b> <b>Beetle</b> is controlled by the use of insecticides.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} half of 1932, Wilhelm Gutbrod, the President of the Standard Fahrzeugfabrik, came into contact with German {{engineer}} Josef Ganz. Ganz had been working on a small car design since the early 1920s and had so far built two prototypes, one for Ardie in 1930 and one for Adler in 1931, called the Maikäfer (<b>May</b> <b>Beetle).</b> After a demonstration with the Maikäfer by Ganz, Gutbrod was most interested to build a small car according to this design. The Standard Fahrzeugfabrik then purchased a license from Ganz to develop and build a small car according to his design. The prototype of this new model, which was to be called Standard Superior, was finished in 1932. It featured a tubular chassis, a mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear.|$|E

Some risks arise in the course of forest reproduction at fire-sites. Wastelands formation, <b>May</b> <b>beetle</b> outburst (Melolontha melolontha), fire recurrence are the most typical risks. Predominance in the forests (sandy soil) of the Republic of Mari El of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) determines regeneration of this very species. Accelerated growth of pine in fire-sites is achievable through artificial forest regeneration. The goal of our research is to study the influence of different technologies of plantation establishment in fire-sites on their development and productivity and assess possible risks mitigation in establishment and cultivation of the plantations. Eight different plots of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) were studied. These plots are rectangular (Н- 1, K- 1, К- 3, К- 4, К- 5), square (К- 2) and spot planting (Н- 2, Н- 3) plots. The initial density of the planted trees was different in the plots; it was low (К- 1, К- 2, К- 3), mean (К- 4) and high (Н- 1, К- 5). It was revealed that in the plots where trees were planted with high initial density (more than 10000 trees per hectare) the risk of <b>May</b> <b>beetle</b> outburst was reduced due to quick canopy closure (up to 3 - 4 years). Two-row spot planting of Scots pine and leaving the wide inter-rows (Н- 2, Н- 3) makes it possible to carry out the prevention measures and contributes to forest environment preservation and natural regeneration of broadleaved species...|$|E
40|$|Grubs, larvae of chafers, as a {{group are}} a major pest {{throughout}} the world. In Europe, the major species attacking agricultural and horticultural crops, is probably the cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha). In Ukraine, damage caused by the grubs of the cockchafer is increasing in outside crops.

The research should ultimately result in a strategy that is effective in reducing the damage as well as cost effective. It should also be environmentally sound and fitting into current Ukrainian regulations. New control methods will possibly require adaptation of existing regulations/laws. Project experts should prepare advice to Ukrainian authorities on how to adapt the current legislation to incorporate the new strategy to fight cockchafer damage (<b>May</b> <b>beetle...</b>|$|E
40|$|The small Caribbean {{island of}} Navassa (U. S. possession) is unoccupied by humans, but recent surveys have {{detected}} {{a surprising number}} of endemic (precinctive) invertebrates. A new species of <b>May</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phyllophaga navassa, is here described and compared to the Hispaniolan Phyllophaga fauna. The large genus Phyllophaga Harris is estimated to contain over 500 species (Morón 1997 : 229); perhaps the largest genus of New World Scarabaeidae. In the recent revision of the species for the island of Hispaniola (Woodruff and Sanderson 2004), 48 species were treated, of which 22 were described as new. All 48 are endemic only to Hispaniola, and many have restrictive distributions within the island. The Island of Navassa lies only 56 km west of the tip of Haiti, so it was somewhat surprising to learn that this endemic new species was abundant there. Discovery of these, and a narrative of the survey of the island, was documented by Steiner and Swearingen (1998, 2000), and Swearingen (1999). They reported collecting more than 600 terrestrial arthropod morphospecies, estimated to be 30 % endemic. Additional information on habitat was provided by Nearns and Steiner (2006) in the description of a new species of Plectromerus Haldeman (Cerambycidae), and by Steiner (2008) in a report on Carabidae known from the island. The island has been a U. S. possession since 1856, when it was claimed under the “Guano Act”, and it was mined for phosphates during {{the latter part of the}} 19 th century. The U. S. Coast Guard operated a lighthouse there from 1929 to 1996. It was acquired by the U. S. Department of Interior, and in 1999 it was designated as the Navassa National Wildlife Refuge under the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The herpetology of the island was treated by Powell (1999). The island is only 5 kilometers square, with no beaches, and abrupt cliffs reaching heights of 20 meters. The central forest is about 70 meters elevation, where many specimens were collected. The geology was studied by Burne, Horsfield, and Robinson (1974), and the island was estimated to be 2 - 5 million years old, but never connected to another larger landmass. This isolation would explain much of the endemism found. It is composed of Eocene limestone with rugged karst surface and red oolitic soil (reminiscent of the bauxite areas near Cabo Rojo in the Dominican Republic). It has a significant forest cover, dominated by 4 species of tropical trees: Sideroxylon foetidissimum Jacquin, Ficus populnea Wildenow var. brevifolia (Nuttall) Warb., Coccoloba diversifolia Jacquin...|$|E
