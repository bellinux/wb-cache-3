5|$|After playing only 22 total minutes since January 27, Morgan played {{more minutes}} (17) {{than the other}} low post players (McGary, Horford, and Max Bielfeldt) {{for the first time}} on February 24 against Illinois. Michigan {{defeated}} Illinois 71–58 behind 26 points and 8 assists from Burke. In the game, Burke became the seventh Wolverine sophomore to reach 1000 career points. On February 27, Michigan surrendered a 15-point second-half lead to give Penn State its only conference win of the season. Following the game, the team called a rare players-only meeting at the Pizza House, with fifth-year reserve Corey Person doing <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hanson {{remained}} silent during the team's interviews while Hawk did <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka {{to win the}} Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver. During that time, they also won the IWA World Tag Team Championship while competing in Tasmania. While in the Carolinas, Hanson and Hawk {{spent a lot of}} time with Ric Flair when Flair entered the wrestling business. Hawk stated that Flair used to cause trouble for the group, including one incident in which Flair flirted with the girlfriend of a Mafia member. Hanson and Hawk used their friendship with the Mafia member to help Flair escape from being killed in revenge.|$|E

During the discussion, the undercover agent offered Sharpton a 10% commission for arranging drug sales. On the videotape, Sharpton mostly nods and allows the FBI agent to do <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> No drug deal was ever consummated, and no charges were brought against Sharpton {{as a result of}} the tape.|$|E

25|$|After taking most of 1996 off, Falsk/Mathisen {{returned}} in 1997 with the album Chili Kick and the TV show Høy puls, which aired on TV3 and included Falsk experimenting with jazz poetry. In 1998, {{they continued to}} explore new genres by creating and starring in the sit-com Piker, vin og sang. However, the show was cancelled after one season. Then, {{in the summer of}} 1999 they toured with the show Det æ'kke lett å være hann which was described as a stand-up musical, where Falsk did <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> with his stand-up routine, while Mathisen played guitar in the backing band.|$|E

Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

They are featured {{in the majority of}} episodes as the A-Plot constructing large scale inventions or taking part in other outlandish activities. Ferb, an engineering genius, allows Phineas to do <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> for the pair and is [...] "more of a man of action."

500|$|The {{issue of}} trust was {{difficult}} to overcome. [...] Wooden Leg himself relates {{the attitudes of the}} Cheyenne at a peace feast organised to commemorate the 30th anniversary (1906) of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. [...] In the presence of many United States soldiers, the Cheyenne were questioned about the battle. [...] They answered with extreme caution; many facts, particularly regarding the deaths of US soldiers, were avoided. [...] Despite the long passage of time since the battle, they feared that they were being trapped into incriminating admissions. [...] They also chose not to reveal that they believed that many soldiers had died through suicide or at the hands of their comrades, as they knew this issue had made soldiers angry in the past. [...] They left <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> to one boastful Indian, Two Moons, who gave a colourful—but entirely inaccurate—account. [...] The others elected not to contradict him since this allowed them to remain silent. [...] Marquis slowly broke down the barriers and eventually persuaded all the Cheyenne survivors he was in contact with, not just Wooden Leg, to open up to him.|$|E
500|$|When Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{repeatedly}} disrupts Darryl Philbin's (Craig Robinson) warehouse {{safety training}} session, Lonny Collins (Patrice O'Neal) and Darryl mock the office workers' safety session in retaliation, claiming that office work does not entail physical danger. Offended by Darryl's disdain for office safety training, Michael decides {{to demonstrate the}} risk of depression and suicide by jumping off the roof, landing on a hidden trampoline. When Michael tests out the trampoline by dropping a watermelon from the roof, it bounces off and hits an office worker's car, prompting it {{to be replaced by}} a bouncy castle hidden from the general view of the parking lot. [...] From the roof of the building, Michael talks dramatically about the dangers of depression. When the bouncy castle is discovered, Jim and Pam realize that Michael is [...] "going to kill himself pretending to kill himself." [...] The employees collectively talk Michael down from the roof, with Darryl doing <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking,</b> to assure Michael that he is brave simply by living as himself. At the end, the car that was hit by the watermelon is revealed to be Stanley's (Leslie David Baker), who is shocked to see the mess.|$|E

2500|$|Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, do <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and {{decision}} making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised {{according to the law}} and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to say anything at all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families [...] [...] [...] All {{they have to do is}} just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".|$|E

[...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.|$|E
