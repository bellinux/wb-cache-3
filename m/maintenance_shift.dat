40|$|This is a {{quantitative}} {{study of the}} effects of inter-generational contact between a majority language (Spanish) and a heritage language (Veneto). Specifically, we are studying the effects of the Spanish verbal syntax, referred to as a syntactic frame, on the syntactic frame of Veneto verbs. Data was gathered from a total of 69 participants, 35 older speakers and 34 younger speakers, through translation activities. The results were then codified and analyzed in two separate analyses studying variation across speakers and the degree of cross-linguistic influence (CLI) according to age groups. Variation among speakers is ubiquitous {{and at the same time}} demonstrates subtle patterns of language <b>maintenance,</b> <b>shift,</b> and loss at the lexical level. T-tests demonstrate that the differences in the degree of CLI of both groups is statistically different and that older speakers maintain a more classical version of Veneto lexicon whereas the younger speakers produce a variety of Veneto with higher rates of lexical and frame borrowing from Spanish. The implications of this study include providing evidence that the cognitive processes of progressive language attrition are parallel to cognitive processes present among second language learners (parasitism in L 2 learning), but in opposite directions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInfrared {{emitters}} {{are widely}} used in industrial furnaces for thermal treatment. In these processes, {{the knowledge of the}} incident heat flux {{on the surface of the}} product is a primary step to optimise the command emitters and for <b>maintenance</b> <b>shift.</b> For these reasons, it is necessary to develop autonomous flux meters that could provide an answer to these requirements. These sensors must give an in-line distribution of infrared irradiation in the tunnel furnace and must be able to measure high heat flux in severe thermal environments. In this paper we present a method for in-line assessments solving an inverse heat conduction problem. A metallic mass is instrumented by thermocouples and an inverse method allows the incident heat flux to be estimated. In the first part, attention is focused on a new design tool, which is a numerical code, for the evaluation of potential options during captor conception. In the second part we present the realisation and the test of this “indirect” flux meter and its associated inverse problem. “Direct” detectors based on thermoelectric devices are compared with this new flux meter in the same conditions in the same furnace. Results prove that this technique is a reliable method, appropriate for high temperature ambiances. This technique can be applied to furnaces where the heat flux is inaccessible to “direct” measurements...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss some {{cultural}} factors influencing the language <b>maintenance</b> and <b>shift</b> patterns of the Hungarian community of Brisbane. This paper examines language shift in the context of language use in the family domain and discusses the connections between the development of cross-cultural attitudes (attitudes to the host society as well as the home culture), identity development and language <b>maintenance</b> and <b>shift.</b> The empirical evidence based on a sociolinguistic survey suggests that Hungarians attach great value to their language. Keeping a strong Hungarian identity is a strong factor in intergenerational language maintenance, and the development of dual-identities does not necessarily lead to language shift. Dual identity can be an additive rather than a subtractive force in the development of Hungarian-English bilinguality. Ethnicity, identity and language As many authors have noted, patterns of language <b>maintenance</b> and <b>shift</b> are driven by both social and cultural factors (Dorian 1989; Gal 1979; Giles et al. 1977).

40|$|Language <b>maintenance,</b> <b>shift</b> {{and loss}} are {{standard}} {{themes in the}} sociology of language but they are generally framed as homogeneous effects attributable to macro processes of social change or political intervention and adopted as metrics of ‘ethnolingusitic vitality’. As Block (2007) points out, {{there is also an}} axiomatic assumption in the academic literature that these linguistic patterns are evaluated in a uniform way, reinforced by the institutional rhetoric of diversity. This chapter takes a different perspective. We are interested in the evolving patterns of language contact and multilingualism in central Europe, and we focus on users and uses of the German language. However, we are not concerned here with the position or status of this language or with the vitality of putative ‘ethnolinguistic communities’, as deduced from an outside perspective. Rather, we ask how individuals who have lived through a turbulent period of social change recount their experience of changes in their linguistic repertoires and those of their families. Our discussion is based on interviews and conversations with individuals in Hungary and the Czech Republic conducted between 1995 and 2005, for all of whom some form of the German language has played a role in their lives. Drawing on Gal’s notions of authenticity and culturally coded temporality (Gal 2006, Gal and Irvine 2001), we explore some of the ways language and linguistic practices feature in the memories of these individuals – stories of language lost, stubbornly maintained, and occasionally (re) found...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to examine the {{influence}} of language policy on the development (<b>maintenance,</b> <b>shift</b> and/or revitalization) of a minority language. The question is asked whether Israeli language policy influences the decline of Judeo-Spanish and whether Judeo-Spanish shows signs of revitalization. By examining the position of the Sephardim in Palestine in the 19 th century and their life after the establishment of the Israeli State, a strong Israeli nationalism has been identified as the most influential factor which influenced a language shift from Judeo-Spanish to Hebrew. The major task of the Israeli political bodies and the Zionists in the new State was to create a new national culture by revitalizing Hebrew and not acknowledging non-Hebrew languages as well as the cultures of the immigrants. The engagement of the Israeli state with language policy to shape national identity provoked a change in Sephardim attitudes toward their language and a crisis in their ethnic identity. In Israel, religion and state are closely related, and this study tries to address the attitudes of the Israeli government toward the use of religious languages, for example Hebrew and Ladino, and Sephardic religious identity. The question of Israeli Official language law, educational language policy toward Judeo-Spanish and the process of revitalization of Judeo-Spanish are covered as well. The study concludes that attempts to revitalize Judeo-Spanish in Israel are present, but the relationship between language policy in Israel and a strong nationalism still shape the most important attitudes of the Sephardim toward Judeo-Spanish, as well as attitudes of other Jews toward this culture and their heritage language. ...|$|E
40|$|Code mixing is an {{interesting}} phenomenon in bilingual societies. The social aspects of code mixing which include various factors ranging from the setting, addressee, and addresser to the prestige attached to a language, and its socio historical background, determine the linguistic choices {{in the process of}} code mixing; reciprocally the linguistic choices for code mixing reflect the socio cultural environment. Code mixing leads to language hybridization that in turn gives birth to the issues of language <b>maintenance,</b> <b>shift,</b> and desertion. All these phenomena have significant socio-cultural implications in the context of globalization and emergence of English as an international language in the recent decades that has challenged the survival of regional and national languages of many countries. As far as Pakistan is concerned these phenomena are a familiar and well-known feature of the present day linguistic scenario that is clearly reflected in the media as well. In this context the present research aims at the study of language hybridization and code mixing of English in Urdu in the country. To analyze the linguistic, socio- cultural and attitudinal dimensions of code mixing, this research quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes the code mixed linguistic patterns used by the speakers in TV programs i. e. talk shows and discussion panels. Data is categorized under various lexical structural categories to study the processes employed, to examine the frequency of occurrence in different lexical and structural categories, and to investigate linguistic and social constraints involved. The linguistic data is further explored to trace the socio cultural implications of code mixing and language hybridization. Structurally the dissertation is divided into nine chapters. After presenting the background of research, review of the relevant literature, description of the research methodology, and issues of bilingualism in international and national scenario. The data is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and interpreted under three broad categories, Insertion, Hybridization and Synthesis respectively.

40|$|MA (English), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 Sub-cultural {{languages}} in South Africa – languages {{which do not}} enjoy official status amongst other qualities – have not received much attention academically. Existing theories of <b>maintenance</b> and <b>shift</b> accommodate mainstream {{languages in}} their role and function within dominant society. However the sub-cultural languages, in which Fanagalo will later be categorised, and their role and function in society are unclear. This {{may be the result}} of the inefficiency of current theories of <b>maintenance</b> and <b>shift</b> to explain the functionality of sub-cultural languages and the process they undergo leading to either <b>maintenance</b> or <b>shift.</b> Furthermore, failure to recognise the role and function of such sub-cultural languages may be attributed to their non-official status as they are not officially supported by language policies. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand the process of <b>maintenance</b> or <b>shift</b> a sub-cultural language undergoes. This process is accommodated by developing a theoretical model related to <b>maintenance</b> or <b>shift</b> for sub-cultural languages. This model, specifically based on Fanagalo, will expand on the boundaries set in existing theoretical models of <b>maintenance</b> and <b>shift</b> in order to accommodate sub-cultural language. It is important to stress that the period during which the data was collected on site at Mine X in Rustenburg, is volatile in nature. The unrest in the social context concerning the mine workers themselves during the period in which this data was gathered alludes to the value of the data and provides a unique insight not achievable under non-adverse circumstances. The unrest began in 2012 during which a “strike over pay ha(d) escalated into alleged turf war between unions” (Smith & Macalister, 2012) in Marikana, Rustenburg where more than thirty people were killed on the 17 th of August, 2012. A year later, an agreement between Amcu (Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union) and Lonmin was signed which, according to Mathunjwa, president of Amcu, was quoted as saying, ‘This shows that the victims did not die in vain and we pledge to continue with their fight for a living wage” (Mathunjwa, 2013, quoted by Steyn, 2013). This pledge was upheld as on 28 August, 2013, Amcu was, “asking for increases as high as 150 %, and Solidarity are still engaging” (Nicolson, 2013). As the interviews as part of the data collection process for this study were conducted on 14 August 2013, the value of the data should not go unrecognised. Master...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a sociolinguistic study which examined the language attitudes, acculturation strategies of the Dinka-speaking community in a regional Australian settlement. The paper is positioned in the context of language policy and planning both on the macro (official national) and micro (community-based) levels. This project is set in a highly unique multilingual setting with sharp differences in the structure, corpus, status, and power features of each language represented. The Sudanese community, mainly from Southern Sudan, represents 4 separate Dinka language groups with 4 separate dialects: Dinka Bhar Al Gazel, Dinka Bor, Neur and Dinka Ngok. The majority of Dinka in Toowoomba are from the Dinka Bor group, but they are highly multilingual and use Arabic, Acholi and Kiswahili as local lingue france. These 'low-status' codes are in sharp contrast with the 'powerful' host language, English. Given these sharp differences and the complexity of multilinguality, it is crucial to explore whether 'status-seeking behaviour' (Ager, 2001) will shape the future of the less prestigious languages. The regional Australian context is significant from two main perspectives. Firstly, there is increased policy focus on refugee settlement in regional and rural areas as they offer the 'highest degree of community support' (DIMIA, 2003 p. 27). The government recommends that 'humanitarian entrants settle in regional areas to enhance their prospects of early employment and help meet regional economies' demand for semi-skilled workers’ (DIMIA, 2003 p. 27). With this long-term strategic plan, the settlement of refugees in regional areas will be a high research priority from policy perspectives. Secondly, the regional context (as opposed to major urban) is a strong factor in language shift studies. It is well documented in the literature that regional and rural communities have different language <b>maintenance</b> <b>shift</b> patterns due to the demographic characteristics. The paper, firstly, gives a brief overview of current immigration, language and settlement policies in Australia. Then, the paper reports the survey data collected from 67 Dinka speakers in 8 schools and the main findings of the interview data conducted in 10 households. Attitudes and motivations for the maintenance for the Dinka language will be discussed and contrasted with attitudes to Arabic and Kiswahili as well as the the explicit desires of the community to exit the refugee identity and fit-into the mainstream Australian community. Findings of this study are applicable to other communities and have strong implications for building better links between macro- and micro-level language planning. ...|$|E
