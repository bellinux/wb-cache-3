It argued that a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> in industrial design would help graduates specialize in the related field and improve their skills. Therefore, this study consists of fundamental components about master. s studies in industrial design in turkey such as, existing circumstances of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree,</b> defining its problems and requirements, and resolution advisories to education. Seven universities offer a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> in the field of industrial design in Turkey. In the study, comparative analysis of these programs is conducted on their current education system and two survey studies are realized among the academics of these universities, to examine their opinions. In the field study, the increase number of department facilities was underlined as one of the positive developments whereas problems concerning the academic staff of master. s programs came into prominence as the most important weaknesses. In addition, the required improvements of YOK criteria for the discipline were also found a critical situation for the future of programs.

Of 108 day supervisors (D), 23 % were supervisors only while 777 were also either teachers or administrators. One-third reported three-fourths to full time devoted to supervision; one-third reported one-fourth time or less. Day supervisors were responsible for wider age ranges of children and types of teachers supervised and tended to receive better salaries. Of 150 residential supervisors (R), one-third were supervisors only, 937 worked with teachers of the deaf only, and two-thirds reported three-fourths to full time supervision.

In the old Soviet Union, there were four levels of management training, and in the new Russia several universities have opened MBA programs. In many ways the curricula of Russian managers exceed the rigor in U. S. training (McNully, 1992). This training structure might lead to the false conclusion that change would be easier and more welcome by the managers of Eastern Europe. Transforming the economies of the new republics has not been easy, nor have the results been the same in every country (Shama, 1993).

Esta dissertação desenvolvida no Programa da Pós-Graduação em Ciências da Religião, pertence à linha de pesquisa Religião, Sociedade e Cultura. A metodologia adotada na coleta de dados foi de uma revisão bibliográfica. O questionamento que norteou a pesquisa foi: qual o conceito de missão mundial em J. Stott e de missão {{integral}} em R. Padilla? Com as respostas obtidas, foi realizado um comparativo entre a teologia de ambos. No primeiro capítulo foi apresentado o conceito de missão mundial na teologia de J. Stott. No segundo capítulo, foi apresentado o conceito de missão integral na teologia de R. Padilla. Já no capítulo três, foi realizado um comparativo no qual ficou demonstrado que J. Stott em sua teologia da missão mundial prioriza a proclamação da palavra pela igreja, deixando o serviço de ação social para segundo plano, ao priorizar a necessidade da salvação da alma do pecador que se arrepende, mediante a aceitação Jesus Cristo como seu salvador. Em contrapartida, R. Padilla em sua teologia da missão integral coloca a proclamação da palavra e a prestação de serviço mediante a ação social de forma conjunta e indissociável para concretizar o anúncio do Reino de Deus na sociedade.

In the second chapter, the concept of integral mission in the theology of R. Padilla was presented as well. In the third chapter, through a comparison it has been demonstrated that J. Stott emphasizes the proclamation of the word by the church, leaving the social service action as a second matter, because his priority is the need of salvation of the sinner, through repentance and the acceptance of Jesus Christ as the savior. On the other hand, R.

40|$|At {{attainment}} of independence in 1980 the Zimbabwe Government adopted an egalitarian {{approach to the}} provision of education. Primary education was made compulsory and by 2008, the number of primary schools had increased by 136. 98 % and enrolments by 1980. 38 %. At the secondary school level the number of schools increased by 1132. 77 % with enrolment galloping to a figure of 1155. 74 %. At pre-university level student enrolments shot to 1125. 86 %. The ripple effect propagated right into higher education, putting constraints on quality of academic staff, quality and supply of resources, and the content and processes of management, leadership and instruction. A gradual reduction in State funding and its total withdrawal for postgraduate level forced universities to device own self-funding strategies. To meet the multiplicity of demands from multiple stakeholders the Chinhoyi University of Technology Graduate Business School (CUTGBS) adopted a QFD approach. The purpose of the case study was to assess and evaluate the response of a university business school (CUTGBS) to a QFD-based model for assuring quality in a structured <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> programme. A multi-method approach that included in-depth interviews, focus groups, documents analyses and observations {{was used to assess}} and evaluate the response of staff in the CUTGBS to the model and to {{the manner in which the}} model was rolled out. Interviews involved academics, non-academic staff, students, alumni and senior managers within the CUTGBS. Interviews were also held with staff in the Ministry of Higher Education and Training, industry, and the Zimbabwe Council on Higher Education (ZimCHE), the national quality assurance agency. The purpose of the study was to contribute to our understanding of how staff in the educational services sector respond to Business-based quality models by assessing and evaluating the adoption of QFD in a university Business School. A better understanding of quality management in terms of the tools and stages of the QFD model should create a new dimension of quality management in higher education against the domains of context, inputs, processes and market-orientation. The CUTGBS took a structured and deliberative approach in the adoption of QFD. A coreteam of permanently employed academics and non-pedagogic staff constituted the core QFD team which had the key strategic role for the CUTGBS. There were evidences of team-workquality on the parameters proclaimed by Hoegl and Gemeunden (2001). The CUTGBS staff participated in running Voice of Customer based on a Six Sigma paradigm. There was marginal use of Affinity Diagram, Tree Diagram and Kano s model in the treatment of Voice of Customer, a situation that has the danger of skewing decisions in favour of the domineering members of the team. However in situations of ideal speech situation (Harbermas, 1995) and deliberative democracy (Gutmann and Thompson, 2004) it has the advantage of deep-going aspect-by-aspect deliberations. Much of the normative and regulative requirements of the quality assurer were treated as voice of market and thus escalated to the CUTGBS policy regime. Student Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness (SETE) were used for Customer Satisfaction Performance evaluations, Goal Setting, and for scoping Target Value within the QFD paradigm. In essence QFD was adopted creatively and implemented on a selective incremental approach. Being a case study, the findings of this study have an indicative rather than a conclusive value. However the validation study indicated the feasibility of using QFD as a quality assurance model within the higher education system. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

Nesse modo de ver, a questão preliminar, ao abordar o tema proposto, refere-se à necessidade da sociedade global proteger juridicamente o Meio Ambiente em sua totalidade. Como conseqüência, constata-se que o campo de estudo do Direito Ambiental vem crescendo e se sofisticando com novos princípios e institutos, cedendo espaço para todos os elementos integrantes dos sistemas ecológicos, inclusive o humano. Aliás, possivelmente, a mais importante característica do Direito Ambiental é a de que seus princípios e normas possuem nítido caráter humanista do imperativo ético da dignidade da pessoa humana. A esse respeito, visando-se a promover um novo olhar sobre o Meio Ambiente é que caminha a presente dissertação de mestrado, ordenando reflexões dedutivas e históricas sobre o tema em sua inerente amplitude, integrando-se os conhecimentos da Ciência Ecológica, do Direito Ambiental e da Ética em torno de um conjunto de problemas e limitações humanas para que o maior bem estar possam vir a ser atingido por todos.

Indeed, {{issues related}} to the Environment are endless and incredibly up to date, regarding the fact that environmental imbalance gets bigger day after day in a complex scene which is typical of a technological and scientific society that is being formed, threatening the quality of human life, not to mention its own survival. From that viewpoint, the preliminary issue, when approaching the proposed topic, refers to global society s need to juridically protect the Environment as a whole. As a consequence, it s been noticed that the field of study of Environmental Law has been growing and becoming more and more sophisticated with new principles and institutes; making room for every component of ecological systems, including the human one. Possibly, Environmental Law s most important characteristic is that its principles and rules have a sharp humanistic character of the ethic imperative of human dignity. With that respect, aiming at promoting a different look over the environment is the objective of this very <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> essay, with deductive and historic reflection on the theme in its inherent amplitude, integrating knowledge of Ecological Science, Environmental Law, and Ethics related to a group of human problems and limitations so that all people are able to achieve major well being. Besides, it s equally important to protect the Environment through educational processes. Environmental Education must be implemented in each and every level of education, as stated on the Federal Constitution 225 (1) (6), for it s necessary to teach and make people fully aware of the effective seriousness of worlwide environmental degradation. By the way, the opportunity brought about by Environmental Education and its subsequent ethic awakening may indicate {{the beginning of a new}} era of cooperation among nations and peoples, looking forward to new inspirations that contact with Nature and with humanistic idea [...] .

The present {{piece of}} work was developed within the Research Group on Imaginary, Education and Memory (GEPIEM), a <b>Master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> Graduation Program in Education, {{in the field of}} Writing Culture: languages and learning. It has the analysis of the literary work "The Catcher in the Rye" by J. D. Sallinger as its methodological direction, with the aim of seeking convergence from this "novel of formation" (Bildungsroman) for reflections in education. In particular, to look for its contributions, {{in the sense of the}} composition between studies and the imaginary (self) human formation. The analyzed work is considered as a powerful symbolic and ideological device for being able to transit between a teenager and his conflicts, sufferings and individual drives in affective, social, and cultural contexts and the wider reach of the society of the time - mid-XX century. The narrative of the main character and his relationships with family, school peers and friends has a timeless dimension, ie, that can belong to any time, and this, therefore, makes the work so contemporary. From the reading of the work we extract some symbolic cores grouped into four "mythemes" able to show the wealth and power of the "novel of formation" for (self) human training. The first mytheme: a human can (self) be formed between conflict and madness in search of the treasure inside. The second mytheme: a (self) formation can take place on a trip between escape and confrontation. The third mytheme: a (self) human formation occurs by initiation and transmigration. In the last and fourth mytheme: the fall into the abyss as act of living and (self) forming. Such mythemes were analyzed in the light of studies of imaginary, especially in its symbolic aspects, in order to relate and appreciate the importance of reading the "novel of formation" and the writings of other ways to raise life to the education of the human being. In a perception that values the felt and lived things, as well as the known and proven ones...|$|E
40|$|PREFACE This {{master s}} thesis was written as the final step towards my <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree,</b> and it thereby marks the ending of my time at NTNU. The {{master s thesis}} was {{developed}} due to a proposal made by Texas Instruments, under the offered supervision of Oddgeir Fikstvedt. My supervisor at NTNU was Morten Olavsbråten. This report describes {{the design of a}} power amplifier in the 90 nm CMOS technology. The power amplifier is designed to deliver 1 W output power at 5. 8 GHz with a peak efficiency of 50 %. Both the class-E and the inverse class-D amplifier are described and examined, but the final choice in amplifier design is the inverse class-D amplifier. Simulation results on a realistic inverse class-D amplifier model are presented as the final outcome. Trondheim, 2009 - 07 - 16 Nina Tofte Røislien ABSTRACT Recently CMOS has been introduced as a technology for RF-front end applications. This results in higher levels of integration, which saves fabrication cost and area. The power amplifier often contributes to the highest power consumption, and the efficiency becomes very important. This master s thesis handles the design of a CMOS power amplifier at 5. 8 GHz. The design goals were an output power of 30 dBm, a Power Added Efficiency of 50 % and a gain of 25 dB. The main challenge in the CMOS-technology is the low breakdown voltage. This leads to a higher current and a lower load resistance compared to traditionally used RF-technologies. This makes it harder to design a high efficiency amplifier because of more power loss in the parasitic, and a more complex matching network. Two different amplifiers were investigated, both of the switching type; the class-E amplifier and the inverse class-D amplifier (current mode). The class-E amplifier has been studied by others for this kind of use, and has an advantage because of the load network that is synthesized to give non-overlapping voltage and current, even if the device switching time is appreciable fractions of the ac cycle. One can also utilize the high output capacitance of the CMOS-transistor as part of the load network. The inverse class-D amplifier has an advantage of being differential which provides a higher voltage swing across the load, and thereby a higher load resistance and a lower current compared to the class-E. In contrast with conventional voltage-mode class-D amplifiers, the inverse class-D features zero voltage switching which eliminates the output capacitance discharge loss. This output capacitance is also utilized as part of the resonance filter in the load network. No previous work of others that uses the inverse class-D amplifier in a similar configuration (RF, CMOS) was discovered. It was found that the inverse class-D amplifier was the best suited for this application. The load resistance of the class-E amplifier became too low compared to the parasitic losses to achieve the design goals. The ground inductance was also totally destructive for the class-E waveforms because of the single-ended topology. Since the inverse class-D amplifier instantly showed much more promising behavior, no time was used trying to solve this problem. The resulting inverse class-D amplifier design has a peak efficiency of 51 %, an output power of 30. 04 dBm. The gain is 25 dB for an output power of 28 dBm, but sadly it decreases below the design goal to 20. 06 dB at the point where Pout= 30 dBm and PAE= 50 %. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I would like to give great thanks to Oddgeir Fikstvedt and Morten Olavsbråten for invaluable support during this time, and for making this thesis possible. I would also like to give great thanks Trond Ytterdal for his help with Cadence, and to Tore Barlindhaug for help with some fatal last minute Cadence problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{perspectives}} of social studies teachers concerning the impact of the Ohio Graduation Test (OGT) on geography instruction in the secondary schools of central Ohio. The central research question was, From the perspectives of social studies teachers in secondary schools of central Ohio, what has been the effect of the Ohio Graduation Test (OGT) on geography instruction? In order to answer this major question in addition to supplementary research subquestions, an exploratory study employing quantitative methods was designed and successfully carried out in accordance with the procedures explained in detail in the methodology chapter. To summarize, the population of this study consisted of all secondary social studies teachers who are currently teaching in the middle and high schools of central Ohio. A specifically developed 28 -item cross-sectional survey as the major data collection instrument for this study was constructed through a content validity approach and pilot tested. The survey instrument was then administered via the Internet to a randomly selected sample of secondary social studies teachers. The number of teachers who responded to the questionnaire is 206. The data gathered were analyzed by SPSS 16. 0. Data analysis of the study basically utilized descriptive statistics. Tables and figures were constructed to present the results. The research instrument was intended to measure the perspectives of social studies teachers regarding whether or not there has been a change in geography instruction following the OGT, especially in the areas of instructional time devoted to teaching geography, curriculum and the instructional strategies used in the classroom, use of teaching materials, emphasis of particular geographic concepts/topics, and perceptions about geography and the impact of the OGT. The major demographic profile of the research subjects, according to responses from social studies teachers who participated in the study, is by and large Caucasian males who teach middle class students with above average OGT scores in suburban public schools for 11 or more years. A great majority of those teachers have a <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree,</b> hold a comprehensive social studies (7 - 12) licensure and completed at least two or more college level geography courses. One-third of these teachers work at a middle school and two-thirds work in a high school setting. Typically they work as teachers of U. S. History, World History and U. S. Government. Due to the nature of the OGT as a state-mandated standardized testing program, the results of this study mainly contributed to two bodies of literature: geography education in particular and high-stakes testing in general. Based on the overall research findings, it would be reasonable to infer that the OGT has impacted the way in which geography instruction is delivered in the secondary schools of central Ohio. Yet, this effect showed some variation by school level (middle school versus high school) as well as by grade level (Grades 6 - 8, 9 - 10 and 11 - 12). Parallel to the current literature regarding the effects of high-stakes testing on teaching and learning, the results of this study indicate that social studies teachers do practice more of a teaching to the test strategy since the implementation of the OGT. The findings specifically suggest that teachers who teach the grades where the OGT is administered evidently perform more teaching to the test behavior and are under more pressure. However, the most important impact that the OGT has had on geography instruction is a noteworthy decrease in the amount of time teachers spend with geography in their general social studies curriculum. According to the data, the time devoted to teaching geography is diminishing. Even though geography is one of the social studies subjects tested on the OGT, the decrease in the amount of time to teach geography within the social studies curriculum might imply that the geography portion of the social studies test on the OGT is not as important as the others or that geography is over-shadowed in the social studies curriculum by other subjects particularly by history. This was evidenced by the finding that teachers consider geography the least emphasized among the social studies content areas tested on the OGT. As a result, along with recommendations for further research, contributions to the related literature and implications for both policy-making and teaching and learning were discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa foi desenvolvida nos anos de 2008 a 2010, no curso de mestrado em Educa????o da Universidade Federal de Pelotas. Teve como objetivo estudar as a????es de um {{professor}} de Hist??ria enquanto experimenta com seus alunos como proposta para o ensino de Hist??ria a Experi??ncia Ficcional Virtual (EFV) atrav??s do game Age of Empires II. Para isto, procura-se saber como este professor sujeito da pesquisa - planeja, desenvolve e reflete sobre a pr??tica de dar aulas de Hist??ria Medieval a partir do game citado. Considera-se que em jogos eletr??nicos (como no game em quest??o), evidencia-se a possibilidade de atua????o em um tempo-espa??o hist??rico simulado pelas vias da computadoriza????o a qual denomina-se aqui de Experi??ncia Ficcional Virtual. Os conceitos que embasam este estudo s??o os seguintes: Dispositivo (AGAMBEM, 2009); Jogo (HUIZINGA, 2000 e CAILLOIS, 1990); Experi??ncia (LARROSA, 2002); Fic????o (FLUSSER, 2007) e Virtual (DELEUZE, 1988 e L??VY, 2007). A pesquisa tamb??m est?? ancorada em escritos de: Alves (2005), que tratam da import??ncia dos jogos eletr??nicos na educa????o; Lib??neo (1999) e Demo (2004), que discorrem sobre a relev??ncia do papel do professor num mundo bombardeado pelas informa????es, dentre outros. L??dke e Andr?? (1986) nortearam a escolha por uma abordagem metodol??gica qualitativa. Nesta fase da pesquisa, foi proposto ao sujeito que realizasse as etapas de planejamento e desenvolvimento de aulas de Hist??ria a partir do game Age of Empires II e, posteriormente, refletisse em torno desta pr??tica. As atividades foram planejadas partindo do game, por??m, antes que os alunos tomassem contato com o mesmo, o professor desenvolveu uma aula em que privilegiou, teoricamente, o assunto que seria tratado na ocasi??o seguinte. Atrav??s de encontros, entrevistas semi-estruturadas e observa????es das aulas desenvolvidas, foram coletados os dados. Os resultados encontrados mostram que o sujeito apreciou a atividade e que empenhou-se para p??r em pr??tica seu planejamento, mostrando que a EFV funciona como proposta para o ensino de Hist??ria. O pesquisado relatou ter percebido uma mudan??a de comportamento dos alunos frente a sua abordagem e afirma que isso lhe impele a continuar usando a EFV em suas pr??ticas. Observou-se que, adotando a EFV, o docente incluiu os discentes como atores no tempo hist??rico que o jogo retrata, possibilitando a estes, outra maneira de se relacionarem com a Hist??ria. This {{research was}} carried out from 2008 to 2010, in the <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> course in Education of the Universidade Federal de Pelotas. The aim {{of this paper is}} to study the actions of a History teacher while experiencing with his students as a proposal for teaching History the Virtual/Fiction Experience (EFV) through the game Age of Empires II. It is tried to make evident how this teacher subject of this research plans, develops, and reflects about the practice of teaching Medieval History through the game mentioned. It is considered that there is, in electronic games (as in the game mentioned), the evidence of the possibility of performance in a historical time and space simulated through informatics which is called here as Virtual/Fiction Experience. The concepts in which this study is based are the following: Dispositive (Agambem, 2009); Game (Huizinga, 2000 and Caillois, 1990); Experience (Larrosa, 2002); Fiction (Flusser, 2007) and Virtual (Deleuze, 1988 and L??vy, 2007). The research is also based on the following writings: Alves (2005), which focus on the importance of electronic games in education; Lib??neo (1999) and Demo (2004), whose writings are about the relevance of teacher s role in a world bombed by information, among others. L??dke and Andr?? (1986) guided the choice of a qualitative methodological approach. During this phase of the investigation, it was proposed to the subject of this research the realization of planning and developing stages of History classes through the use of the game Age of Empires II and, subsequently, a reflection about this experience. The activities were planned through the game, nevertheless, before the students having contact with it, the teacher developed a class where it was privileged, theoretically, the subject to be taught in following classes. It has been collected the data through meetings, semi-structured interviews and observations of the classes. The results found have shown that the interviewee enjoyed the activity and gave his best to put into practice his planning, demonstrating that EFV works as a proposal of History teaching. The interviewee also noticed a change in the student s behavior when facing his approach and states that this motivates him to continue using the EFV in his practices. It has been observed that, by adopting the EFV, the teacher includes the students as actors in the historical time that the game portraits, making possible for them to face another way of relation with History...|$|E
40|$|Trata-se de uma pesquisa de mestrado que tem por objetivo {{discutir}} os processos de planejamento educacional e de formação continuada do professor de Ensino Médio, envolvendo aspectos do trabalho coletivo dos educadores/professores, o momento do registro, os saberes docentes e do coordenador pedagógico e a construção da autonomia docente. O trabalho visa responder às seguintes questões: por que é tão difícil que o trabalho de planejamento, a troca de experiência, o estudo conjunto aconteçam na escola, mesmo quando são destinadas horas remuneradas para esses fins? Por que as horas destinadas ao planejamento, à troca de experiências, à avaliação do trabalho pedagógico e à formação continuada não são bem aproveitadas na escola? Muitos governos estaduais e municipais e mesmo muitos mantenedores de instituições privadas, geralmente "enfiam goela abaixo" dos educadores os seus projetos, não solicitando dos mesmos a contribuição, e o que é mais importante, o envolvimento no processo de elaboração. Os professores, ao resistirem aos processos de planejamento, estão reagindo a essa forma autoritária de desencadear políticas? Se não, que razões levam o professor a rejeitar mudanças em sua prática? Quais questionamentos fazem os professores em torno do planejamento/plano? A dissertação tem como objetivo geral analisar as respostas apresentadas da sondagem exploratória realizada no início da pesquisa, com quatro professores de uma mesma escola de Ensino Médio da rede particular, e relacioná-las aos estudos bibliográficos apresentados a partir de diversos autores estudiosos no assunto. Pretende, ainda, enfocar o "como" os professores poderiam utilizar melhor o processo do trabalho coletivo para um movimento reflexivo do ato de educar; o "quanto" as horas previstas e remuneradas poderiam contribuir para as discussões sobre o processo ensino-aprendizagem-avaliação. Como procedimento metodológico, além da entrevista inicial, foi realizado um estudo bibliográfico sobre a importância da palavra a partir dos estudos de Freud e, em seguida, da abordagem multirrefrencial por permitir um olhar plural e mais humano sobre os processos educacionais. Foram apresentados estudos sobre os conceitos atribuídos às políticas de planejamento curricular: o planejamento e o plano de ensino - práticas construídas no cotidiano. Como resultados, mesmo que provisórios, apontamos para: o trabalho coletivo no espaço organizado e garantido pelos gestores da escola; a valorização da memória e autoria docente, para a reflexão de práticas, a visibilidade do trabalho e o resultado pedagógico. O trabalho ainda considera a importância da formação contínua, planejada em momentos remunerados e garantidos pela instituição, a importância da construção dos saberes, docentes e do coordenador pedagógico e a historicidade das práticas de registro dos planos como aspectos inerentes a um projeto pedagógico e que devem ser reconhecidos, valorizados e estimulados pelas políticas institucionais. (AU) This is a <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>degree</b> {{research that}} has as a goal to discuss the processes of educational planning and of the continued formation of the teachers of Ensino Médio, involving the aspects of group work from {{the part of the}} educators/teachers, the moment of registering, the teaching and pedagogical coordination s knowledge and the construction of the teaching autonomy. This work aims to answer the following questions: Why is it so hard to make the work of planning, the exchange of experience, the group study happen in the school, even when there are paid hours for that? Why isn t the time destined to planning, to the exchange of experience, to the evaluation of the pedagogical work and to the continued formation well enjoyed/taken advantage of in the school? State and municipal government and even many proprietors of private institutions generally put down the educator s throats their projects, not asking for their contribution and the most important, not asking for the involvement on the elaboration process. Are the teachers, when resisting the planning process, reacting to this authoritarian way of initiating politics? If not, what are the reasons that take the teacher to reject the changes in his/her practice? What are the questionings that teachers make considering the planning/plan? The dissertation has as a general objective to analyze the answers presented in the explanatory survey made {{at the beginning of the}} research, with four teachers of the same Ensino Medio private school and relate them to the bibliographic studies presented from several authors that study this subject. It still intends to focus on the how teachers can use better the process of the group work to a reflexive movement of the act of educating; on the how much the provided and paid hours can contribute to the discussions about the teaching-learning-evaluating process. As a methodological procedure, besides the initial interview, there was a bibliographic study made on the importance of the word based on Freud s studies and, also, the importance of the multi-referential approach for allowing a plural and more human look on the educational processes. Studies on the concepts attributed to the curricular planning politics: the planning and the teaching plan practices built daily. As results, even if they are temporary, we point to: the documents that were built collectively, in an organized space that was provided by the managers of the school; the construction of memory and authorship, the reflection of practices, the visibility of the work and the pedagogical result. The work still considers the importance of continued formation, planned in paid and guaranteed moments provided by the institution, the importance of the construction of knowledge: teachers and pedagogical coordinator and the history of the practices of registering the plans as inherent aspects to a pedagogical project and that must be recognized, valued and stimulated by the institution s politics.
