5|$|Prompted by the {{exposure}} of No Gun Ri, survivors of similar alleged incidents from 1950–51 filed reports with the Seoul government. In 2008, an investigative commission said more than 200 cases of alleged large-scale killings by the U.S. <b>military</b> <b>had</b> been registered, mostly air attacks.|$|E

5|$|According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the {{operation}} was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) {{officials said they were}} present at what they called a joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani <b>military</b> <b>had</b> scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate <b>military</b> <b>had</b> a paper {{strength}} of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers {{from all over}} the South participated in a variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which had their own state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the field of battle for the enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E

5|$|As of 1 June 1989, the International Institute for Strategic Studies {{estimated}} that the Army comprised four corps and 12 division headquarters. At the time, the <b>military</b> <b>had</b> decreased considerably in size. The IISS noted that these formations 'were in name only; below establishment in units, men, and equipment. Brigades were of battalion size.' Units and formations listed in 1990 within six military sectors included the twelve divisions, four tank brigades, 45 mechanized and infantry brigades, 4 commando brigades, 1 surface-to-air missile brigade, 3 field artillery brigades, 30 field battalions, and one air defence artillery battalion.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, the Portuguese <b>military</b> <b>had</b> {{changed its}} strategy, {{adapting}} the British/American search and destroy operations utilising small shock troop sweeps. They also initiated a {{hearts and minds}} campaign, named the Aldeamentos Programme, which was a forced relocation program. But on November 9, 1972, FRELIMO – not numbering more than 8,000 fighters – launched a large offensive in Tete Province. The response from the Portuguese military was fierce, leading to reprisal attacks {{in an attempt to}} unbalance the local population's continuing faith in FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, the Algerian <b>military</b> <b>had</b> requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; the country was satisfied with the fighter's flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E

5|$|French {{security}} forces were initially {{taken by surprise}} and were unable to organize an effective response to contain the uprising. By May 1947, however, the French <b>military</b> <b>had</b> begun to counter the nationalists' attacks. Five North African battalions arrived in Madagascar {{at the end of}} July 1947, enabling the French to take the initiative. However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The number of troops increased to about 30,000 in 1948. The French forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of the French Foreign Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from the French territories of Comoros and Senegal.|$|E
5|$|Georgian {{artillery}} units launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23:35 on 7 August. This {{was followed}} by a 15-minute intermission, which purportedly enabled the civilians to escape, before the Georgian forces began bombarding enemy targets. Georgian military intentionally targeted South Ossetian military objects, not civilian ones. Although Georgian <b>military</b> <b>had</b> promised safety to the Russian peacekeepers for their neutrality, the Russian peacekeepers had to follow the Russian command to attack the Georgian troops.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long {{to go back on}} one of his many promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the <b>military</b> <b>had</b> accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E

5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw {{what was left of}} his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, where most of the nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so the <b>military</b> <b>had</b> to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|Rescue trains were {{dispatched}} {{from across}} Atlantic Canada, {{as well as}} the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3pm. The track had become impassable at Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the <b>military</b> <b>had</b> begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst and Stellarton and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville, Moncton and Saint John.|$|E
5|$|Since the Belgian <b>military</b> <b>had</b> officially {{surrendered}} in May 1940 and the Belgian Constitution specifically forbade Belgians {{from joining}} foreign militaries, the Free Belgian forces were officially committing treason; {{the charge was}} only annulled in 1948 and nobody was prosecuted.

Due to Barre's increasing reliance on his own clans, repressive policies, and the Somali Rebellion, the <b>military</b> <b>had</b> by 1988 begun to disintegrate. By the time President Siad Barre fled in 1991, the armed forces had dissolved. As of January 2014, the security sector is overseen by the Federal Government of Somalia's Ministry of Defence, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Interior and Federalism. The Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug regional governments maintain their own security and police forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} of the Imperial Roman army were professionals who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional <b>military</b> <b>had</b> begun during the late Republic, {{and was one of}} the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of conscripts had exercised their responsibilities as citizens in defending the homeland in a campaign against a specific threat. For Imperial Rome, the military was a full-time career in itself.|$|E
5|$|U.S. rhetoric abroad {{also had}} an effect on the Guatemalan military. The <b>military</b> <b>had</b> always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied a lot of {{pressure}} on senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E
