500|$|Lincoln's {{view of the}} Declaration became influential, {{seeing it}} as a moral guide to {{interpreting}} the Constitution. [...] "For most people now," [...] wrote Garry Wills in 1992, [...] "the Declaration <b>means</b> <b>what</b> Lincoln told us it means, {{as a way of}} correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it." [...] Admirers of Lincoln such as Harry V. Jaffa praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably Willmoore Kendall and Mel Bradford, argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated states' rights by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli led a toothless {{opposition}} in the Commons—seeing no way of unseating Palmerston, Derby had privately agreed not to seek the government's defeat. Disraeli kept himself informed on foreign affairs, and on {{what was going on}} in cabinet, thanks to a source within it. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Disraeli said little publicly, but like most Englishmen expected the South to win. [...] Less reticent were Palmerston, Gladstone (again Chancellor) and Russell, whose statements in support of the South contributed to years of hard feelings in the United States. In 1862, Disraeli met Prussian Count Otto von Bismarck for the first time and said of him, [...] "be careful about that man, he <b>means</b> <b>what</b> he says".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{political}} controversies and their age difference—he was fifteen years her senior—Helena {{was happy with}} Christian and was determined to marry him. As a younger son of a non-reigning duke, {{the absence of any}} foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in Britain—the Queen's primary concern—and she declared the marriage would go ahead. Helena and Christian were actually third cousins in descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales. Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained, and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian (who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from King Frederick V of Denmark) as either a cousin or brother-in-law. The Queen never forgave the Princess of Wales for accusations of possessiveness, and wrote of the Waleses shortly afterwards: [...] "Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [...] is by no <b>means</b> <b>what</b> she ought to be. It will be long, if ever, before she regains my confidence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also {{important}} to New Criticism was the idea—as articulated in Eliot's essay [...] "Hamlet and His Problems"—of an [...] "objective correlative", which posits a connection among {{the words of}} the text and events, states of mind, and experiences. This notion concedes that a poem <b>means</b> <b>what</b> it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different—but perhaps corollary—interpretations of a work.|$|E

2500|$|Today {{the word}} [...] "liberalism" [...] is used {{differently}} in different countries. One {{of the greatest}} contrasts is between the usage in the United States and usage in Europe. According to Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (writing in 1956), [...] "Liberalism in the American usage has {{little in common with}} the word as used in the politics of any European country, save possibly Britain." [...] In Europe, liberalism usually <b>means</b> <b>what</b> is sometimes called classical liberalism, a commitment to limited government, laissez-faire economics, and unalienable individual rights. This classical liberalism sometimes more closely corresponds to the American definition of libertarianism, although some may distinguish between classical liberalism and libertarianism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "substance" [...] and [...] "accidents" [...] - the latter term {{is not used}} in the Catholic Church's official definition of the doctrine [...] but {{has been used in}} the writings of theologians - arose from Aristotelian philosophy, but in Roman Catholic eucharistic theology is independent of that philosophy, since the distinction is a real one, as shown by the {{distinction between}} a person and that person's accidental appearances. [...] "Substance" [...] here <b>means</b> <b>what</b> something is in itself, its essence. A hat's shape is not the hat itself, nor is its colour, size, softness to the touch, nor anything else about it perceptible to the senses. The hat itself (the [...] "substance") has the shape, the color, the size, the softness and the other appearances, but is distinct from them. While the appearances, which are also referred to, though not in the Church's official teaching, by the philosophical term 'accidents', are perceptible to the senses, the substance is not.|$|E
2500|$|Searle's early work, {{which did}} {{a great deal to}} {{establish}} his reputation, was on speech acts. He attempted to synthesize ideas from many colleaguesincluding J. L. Austin (the [...] "illocutionary act", from How To Do Things with Words), Ludwig Wittgenstein and [...] (the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules)with his own thesis that such acts are constituted by the rules of language. He also drew on the work of Paul Grice (the analysis of meaning as an attempt at being understood), Hare and Stenius (the distinction, concerning meaning, between illocutionary force and propositional content), P. F. Strawson, John Rawls and William Alston, who maintained that sentence meaning consists in sets of regulative rules requiring the speaker to perform the illocutionary act indicated by the sentence and that such acts involve the utterance of a sentence which (a) indicates that one performs the act; (b) <b>means</b> <b>what</b> one says; and (c) addresses an audience in the vicinity.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there is}} little {{surviving}} evidence of Irish culture, some elderly islanders can remember when the term [...] "cilig" [...] (or killick) was used to describe a common method of fishing for sea turtles by tricking them into swimming into prearranged nets (this was done by splashing a stone on a line – the cilig – into the water on the turtle's opposite side). The word cilig appears to be meaningless in English, but in some dialects of Gaelic is used as an adjective meaning [...] "easily deceived". In Irish there is a word cílí meaning sly. It {{is used in the}} expression Is é an cílí ceart é (pronounced Shayeh kilic airtay) and <b>means</b> <b>What</b> a sly-boots. Alternatively, the word may be derived from an Irish word for a stone and wood anchor. Characteristics of older Bermudian accents, such as the pronunciation of the letter 'd' as 'dj', as in Bermudjin (Bermudian), may indicate an Irish origin. Later Irish immigrants have continued to contribute to Bermuda's makeup, with names like Crockwell (Ó Creachmhaoil) and O'Connor (Ó Conchobhair) now being thought of locally as Bermudian names. The strongest remaining Irish influence {{can be seen in the}} presence of bagpipes in the music of Bermuda, which stemmed from the presence of Scottish and Irish soldiers from the 18th through 20th centuries. Several prominent businesses in Bermuda have a clear Irish influence, such as the Irish Linen Shop, Tom Moore's Tavern and Flanagan's Irish Pub and Restaurant.|$|E
