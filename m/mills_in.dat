5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile <b>mills</b> <b>in</b> the state of Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool <b>mills</b> <b>in</b> Saltillo.

He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries {{the wool}} and cloth {{industries}} continued to thrive, {{powered by the}} waters of the River Sheppey. There were reputed to be 50 <b>mills</b> <b>in</b> the town and surrounding area in the early 18th century, and a number of fine clothiers' houses survive, particularly in Bowlish, a hamlet on the western edge of Shepton Mallet. Although these industries employed some 4,000 people {{towards the end of the}} century, they were already beginning to decline by this time. Discontent at the mechanisation of the mills resulted in the deaths of two men in a riot in the town in 1775, an event which apparently discouraged the mill-owners from modernising further. The decision resulted in Shepton's cloth trade losing out to the steam-powered <b>mills</b> <b>in</b> the north of England in the early 19th century. The manufacture of silk and crepe revived the town's fortunes somewhat, and Shepton's mills manufactured the silk used in Queen Victoria's wedding dress. However these industries also died out eventually.|$|E
