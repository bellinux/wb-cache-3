5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably {{with the work of}} Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the <b>metal</b> <b>screen</b> also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} setup {{was established to}} measure the pressure drop of flow through single- and double-layer woven <b>metal</b> <b>screens.</b> Three woven <b>metal</b> <b>screens</b> with different porosities of the plain-square type were tested in this study. The Reynolds number based on the screen wire diameter ranged from Re = 111 to Re= 2890 {{and the range of}} porosity was 0. 34 to 0. 67. Based on the measured drag coefficient of the three single- and double-layer plain woven <b>metal</b> <b>screens,</b> this study indicates the drag coefficient of low porosity double-layer screen is less than twice of that of the single-layer screen if the spacing of two layers remains less than 14 times of the screen wire diameter...|$|R

40|$|Metamaterials {{that present}} {{electromagnetic}} band-gaps have found many applications in solving signal integrity issues. In particular, inserting a metamaterial in a <b>metal</b> <b>screening</b> box prevents launching of cavity modes within the frequency {{range of the}} electromagnetic band-gap(s) and avoids {{in this way the}} necessity of insertion of resistive layers. We propose a solution for building a <b>metal</b> <b>screening</b> box working from dc up to several GHz and that may be used for packaging microwave circuits that occupy a certain space around the long axis of the box, such as directional coupler...|$|R

25|$|At Lichfield Cathedral, the 18th {{century had}} been a period of decay: the 15th-century library was pulled down, most of the statues on the west front were removed, and the {{stonework}} covered with Roman cement. After some structural work early in the 19th century by James Wyatt, the ornate west front (pictured above) was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It includes many ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, created from original materials where possible and new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Wyatt's choir-screen had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create the clergy's seats in the sanctuary. A new <b>metal</b> <b>screen</b> by Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip to designs by Scott was installed, as was a Minton tile pavement stretching from choir screen to altar, inspired by medieval tiles found in the Choir foundations.|$|E

The paint was applied using a scrub brush and handmade <b>metal</b> <b>screen</b> to produce Ben-Day dots via a process that left physical evidence behind. The Ben-Day dots technique enabled Lichtenstein to give his works a mechanically reproduced feel. Lichtenstein said that the work is [...] "supposed {{to look like a}} fake, and it achieves that, I think".|$|E
2500|$|The {{reflector}} {{can be of}} sheet metal, <b>metal</b> <b>screen,</b> or wire grill construction, and it can {{be either}} a circular [...] "dish" [...] or various other shapes to create different beam shapes. A <b>metal</b> <b>screen</b> reflects radio waves as well as a solid metal surface as long as the holes are smaller than one-tenth of a wavelength, so screen reflectors are often used to reduce weight and wind loads on the dish. To achieve the maximum gain, it is necessary that the shape of the dish be accurate within a small fraction of a wavelength, to ensure the waves from different parts of the antenna arrive at the focus in phase. [...] Large dishes often require a supporting truss structure behind them to provide the required stiffness.|$|E

2500|$|It {{took him}} a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators.

2500|$|Handmade {{paper is}} {{manufactured}} using a <b>metal</b> <b>screen</b> {{held in a}} wood frame which is dipped into a paper slurry, after which the frame is shaken in a particular manner to set the fibers of the paper and form a sheet, which is then removed to dry. The screen would usually have attached a design made of copper or brass wire which would leave a slight impression or watermark in the sheet of paper. In his 1952 article [...] "Watermarks are Twins", Stevenson discussed a fact that few bibliographers then understood, that handmade paper in earlier periods was ordinarily manufactured using twin moulds, the screens of which bore a near duplicate wire image producing almost identical, but nevertheless distinguishable, watermarks. Two workers would use a pair of frames acting in tandem, one using a frame to dip into the paper slurry while the second (the [...] "coucher") would shake the other frame to set the fibers and would then remove the paper to dry. He also observed that, as the screens were used repeatedly to make paper, the wire figures would suffer distortion, pieces of them sometimes breaking loose and having to be retied to the screen. A stock of paper manufactured by hand thus would contain two closely similar watermarks which define the stock for bibliographic purposes, or as Stevenson said, [...] "watermarks like wrens go in pairs." [...] A particular watermark could be uniquely identified by its position {{with respect to the}} [...] "chainlines" [...] formed by the <b>metal</b> <b>screen,</b> its state of freshness or deterioration, and the precise locations where it was tied or retied to the screen, which show up as dots in the watermark. He would later use these basic observations to date the manufacture of paper used in early printed books.|$|E

(See Savage, infra.) [...] A Monel <b>metal</b> <b>screen</b> divides the lobby from the banking hall on the second floor, the screen features a clock in the center designed by Tiffany. The building includes works by muralist Ezra Winter in the mosaic above the main lobby desk and the mural at the end of the banking hall. The large mosaic is of a pine tree and text that states the Union Trust Company's purpose for the building, [...] "Founded on principles of faith and understating, this building is erected for the purpose of continuing and maintaining the ideals of financial services which promoted the organization of the institution". The mural highlight’s Michigan’s industries such as manufacturing, farming and mining. In order to dampen the sound in the banking hall, its cement-plaster ceiling features a hand-painted canvas ceiling, which was stretched over a mat of horsehair.|$|E
