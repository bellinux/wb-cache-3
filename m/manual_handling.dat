After preliminary studies and determining {{the reliability and validity}} of questionnaires, the appropriate study population was selected from the workers, and the questionnaires were filled up through interviews.

Conclusion: This study confirms the efficiency of the theory of planned behavior in modifying the workers′ <b>manual</b> material <b>handling</b> behavior. But since all constructs of the theory of planned behavior could not predict the behavioral intention for correct <b>manual</b> material <b>handling,</b> it can be concluded that for changing the behavioral intention, other theories also should be taken into consideration...|$|R

25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly <b>manual)</b> <b>handling</b> of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{human spine}} is often exposed to {{mechanical}} load in vocational activities especially {{in combination with}} lifting, carrying and positioning of heavy objects. This also applies in particular to nursing activities with <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling.</b> In the present study a detailed investigation on the load of the lumbar spine during <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling</b> was performed. Methods For a total of 13 presumably endangering activities with transferring a patient, the body movements performed by healthcare workers were recorded and the exerted action forces were determined with regard to magnitude, direction and lateral distribution in the time course with a "measuring bed", a "measuring chair" and a "measuring floor". By the application of biomechanical model calculations the load on the lowest intervertebral disc of the lumbar spine (L 5 -S 1) was determined considering the posture and action force data for every <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling.</b> Results The results of the investigations reveal the occurrence of high lumbar load during <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling</b> activities, especially in those cases, where awkward postures of the healthcare worker are combined with high action forces caused by the patient's mass. These findings were compared to suitable issues of corresponding investigations provided in the literature. Furthermore measurement-based characteristic values of lumbar load were derived for the use in statement procedures concerning the disease no. 2108 of the German list of occupational diseases. Conclusions To protect healthcare workers from mechanical overload {{and the risk of}} developing a disc-related disease, prevention measures should be compiled. Such measures could include the application of "back-fairer" nursing techniques and the use of "technical" and" small aids" to reduce the lumbar load during <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling.</b> Further studies, concerning these aspects, are necessary. </p...|$|R

The <b>manual</b> material <b>handling</b> test was administered to 18 men employed from two different high frequency <b>manual</b> materl al <b>handling</b> industries. Estimated maximal aerobic capacity, V 02 values obtained from the <b>manual</b> material <b>handling</b> test were compared to those values obtained from the bench stepping test while supporting and not supporting an Oxylog unit that weighs 2. 6 kg (5. 8 lb). The mean S. D. <b>manual</b> material <b>handling</b> V 02 max of 2. 94 ? 0. 3 8 L 02 /min was not significantly greater (p = 0. 0798) than the bench stepping while supporting the Oxylog unit V 02 m. (2. 94 ? 0. 44 L 02 /min) and bench stepping while not supporting the Oxylog unit V 02 m@ (2. 85 ? 0. 50 L 02 /min). Submaximal aerobic capacities obtained from the <b>manual</b> material <b>handling</b> test shared a strong linear relationship with those obtained from the bench step test while supporting the Oxylog unit, mean r 2 = 0. 97 ? 0. 03, and from the bench step test while not supporting the Oxylog unit, mean r 2 = 0. 96 ? 0. 05, when compared on an individual basis. Predictive metabolic energy expenditure rates were compared to measured metabolic rates recorded during the progressive submaximal <b>manual</b> material <b>handling</b> test. According to Garg's energy equation validation study, the predictive metabolic energy equations were expected to be greater than actual metabolic energy expenditures (Garg 1979). However, this study found the predictive equations to produce values consistently lower (-I. 3 to- 5. 8 %) than measured metabolic energy rates. Analysis of variance found no significance in the differences between measured and predictive metabolic energy expenditures for stage 2 (p = 0. 6023), stage 3 (p = 0. 3755), stage 4 (p = 0. 2566) and stage 5 (p = 0. 7529). However, these differences were not tested for a longer duration (greater than 15 minute) or more demanding job task. Further studies are necessary to verify whether Garg's equations accurately predict the energy expenditure of industrial employees...|$|R

We also know that nursing personnel exposed to <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling</b> activity report high number of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of our study was to evaluate the relationships between work and musculoskeletal disorders in personnel exposed to <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling</b> activity. 160 health care workers of an hospice exposed to patient handling were compared to a control group of 172 people not exposed to the handling risk. In our study we considered only subject with pathology already diagnosed, withdrawing people with disturbs but without clinical trials. The statistical evaluation using the chi 2 test has not shown any meaning in the comparison between the two groups, we have calculated the Odds Ratio risk for discal hernia and protrusion finding a risk between low and modest (1. 52). We think that the least prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders to the back in the group exposed to <b>manual</b> patient <b>handling</b> activity, could be explained partly with the "healthy worker" effect and partly with the workplace improvement. That is demonstrated also with the M. A. P. O. index scoring between 0 and 1. 5 (negligible risk) ...|$|R
