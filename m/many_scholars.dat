5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>scholars</b> {{associated}} with the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views.

5|$|After Hinde's death, Constable quickly {{gathered}} {{all of his}} writings, diaries, business documents, and miscellaneous {{other items}} and donated them to Lyman Draper in 1864, who was known for collecting the papers of figures of the Trans-Allegheny frontier.

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>scholars</b> believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism. The {{philosophical}} terms Tao and De {{are indeed}} shared by both Taoism and Confucianism, and Laozi is traditionally held {{to have been}} a teacher of Confucius. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucianist and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucianist emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, and conventional morality, and favors naturalness, spontaneity, and individualism instead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>scholars</b> {{consider}} {{the figures of}} Gullveig/Heiðr and Freyja the same. These conclusions have been made through comparisons between the figure of Gullveig/Heiðr's use of seiðr in Völuspá and the mention of Freyja introducing seiðr to the Æsir from the Vanir in Heimskringla. This is at times taken further that their corruption of the Æsir led to the Æsir–Vanir War.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>scholars</b> have {{described}} rationalisation {{and the question}} of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.

5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, <b>many</b> <b>scholars</b> {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E
5|$|Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka {{village near}} Udupi in 1238, he learnt the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with <b>many</b> <b>scholars</b> and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).|$|E
5|$|Filming {{occurred}} during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by <b>many</b> <b>scholars,</b> include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E

5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, Either/Or received {{new life}} as a grand philosophical work {{with the publication of}} Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981), where MacIntyre situates Either/Or as an attempt to capture the Enlightenment spirit set forth by David Hume and Immanuel Kant. After Virtue renewed Either/Or as an important ethical text in the Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion for one to adopt an ethical way of life, <b>many</b> <b>scholars</b> have since replied to MacIntyre's accusation in Kierkegaard After MacIntyre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused <b>many</b> <b>scholars</b> to draw {{religious}} connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>scholars</b> {{believe that}} early Upanishads were {{interpolated}} and expanded over time.
