40|$|Earlier leaf removal {{represents}} a good alternative to widely adopted late leaf removal, which is nowadays loosing {{many of its}} advantages due to slightly higher seasonal temperatures and greater UV-radiation within sensitive phases of grape berry maturation. In our experiment, carried out in 2011, we investigated if earlier leaf removals, before flowering and at berry set, both already known to affect phenolic compounds, could in parallel also impact the occurrence of <b>methoxypyrazines</b> in grapes. Those compounds are often causing unwanted ''green'' aromas in red cultivars, especially in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' grapes and wines. Together with 'Cabernet Sauvignon', also 'Merlot' was studied in the same investigation due to its high economic importance for Vipava Valley. Along with basic grape quality and yield parameters, a treatment-related occurrence of two aroma-influential <b>methoxypyrazines</b> (IBMP and IPMP) was monitored during maturation and at harvest time by means of HS-SPME-GC-MS. The results revealed only few minor differences in basic grape quality parameters between the treatments but have indicated some changes in yield parameters in case of pre-flowering approach as compared to control and berry set leaf removal. For both of the <b>methoxypyrazines</b> a different trend between the two cultivars was observed {{as well as some}} substantial differences between the treatments were shown. At harvest, the differences in IBMP among treatments were indeed less obvious, however, pre-flowering leaf removal led to a slightly higher content in both cultivars and BS to lower, both as compared to control. In opposite, IPMP was no longer analytically detectable at harvest, thus the small changes triggered earlier in the season became irrelevant. The results suggested that preflowering leaf removal could result in a delay of maturation, which could also explain why <b>methoxypyrazines</b> in case of that very early treatment were decreasing with a slower rate through maturation as compared with berry-set leaf removal and control treatments...|$|R

40|$|Methoxypyrazines are aroma active {{compounds}} {{found in}} many wine varietals. These compounds can be of either grape-derived nature or can be introduced into wines via Coccinellidae beetles. Regardless of their origin, methoxypyrazines can have either a beneficial role for wine quality, contributing to the specificity of certain wine varietals (Cabernet sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Sauvignon blanc) or a detrimental role, particularly at higher concentrations, resulting in overpowering green, unripe and herbaceous notes. When methoxypyrazines of exogenous nature are responsible for these unpleasant characteristics, wines {{are considered to be}} affected by what is generally known as Ladybug taint (LBT). This is work is a collection of studies seeking to create a sensitive analytical method for the detection and quantification of methoxypyrazines in wines; to investigate the role of different Coccinellidae species in the tainting of wines with LBT and identify the main compounds in ladybug tainted wines responsible for the typical green herbaceous characteristics; to determine the human detection threshold of 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine in wines as well as investigate its contribution to the aroma of wines; and finally to survey <b>methoxypyrazine</b> concentrations in a large set of wines from around the world. In the first study, an analytical method for the detection and quantitation of methoxypyrazines in wines was created and validated. The method employs multidimensional Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry to detect four different methoxypyrazines (2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine, isobutyl <b>methoxypyrazine,</b> secbutyl <b>methoxypyrazine</b> and isopropyl methoxypyrazines) in wine. The low limits of detection for the compounds of interest, improved separation and isolation capabilities, good validation data, as well as the ease of use recommend this method as a good alternative to the existing analytical methods for <b>methoxypyrazine</b> detection in wine. In the second study the capacity of two Coccinellidae species, {{found in many}} wine regions – Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata - to taint wines is evaluated. Coccinella septempunctata is shown to be as capable as causing LBT in wines as Harmonia axyridis. Dimethyl <b>methoxypyrazine,</b> previously thought to be of exogenous nature only (from Coccinellidae haemolymph), is also detected in control (untainted) wines. The main odor active compounds in LBT wines are investigated through Aroma Extract Dilution Assay. These compounds are identified as isopropyl <b>methoxypyrazine,</b> sec- and iso- butyl <b>methoxypyrazine.</b> In the third study, the human detection threshold for dimethyl <b>methoxypyrazine</b> in wine is established to be 31 ng/L in the orthonasal modality and 70 ng/L retronasally.

40|$|Background and Aims:  This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the sensory properties and aroma compounds responsible for driving consumer preference of Sauvignon Blanc wines. Methods and Results:  Three thiols, including their respective enantiomers, a <b>methoxypyrazine</b> and a combination of esters were added singly and in combinations to a neutral white wine at realistic concentrations to mimic Sauvignon Blanc wines. A sensory descriptive analysis of 21 samples was conducted. While each thiol contributed to tropical and cat urine/sweaty attributes, 3 -mercaptohexyl acetate (3 MHA) was of particular importance. The ‘green’ characteristics were primarily related to <b>methoxypyrazine,</b> but thiols were also found {{to contribute to a}} cooked green vegetal attribute. The aroma and flavour of the <b>methoxypyrazine</b> dominated the sensory properties of other components. The thiol S-enantiomers gave higher cooked green vegetal or cat urine/sweaty than their R-counterparts. Six combinations and the base wine were evaluated for liking by 150 consumers. One cluster of consumers (31 %) preferred wines with higher tropical and confectionary aroma; a second cluster (43 %) preferred wines with 'green' attributes; and the final cluster's liking was positively related to solvent and 'green' attributes, and negatively to tropical and cat urine/sweaty. Conclusions:  There were strong and varied interactive effects among the compounds studied. A sizeable proportion of consumers tested preferred the samples with 'green' attributes, with a minority preferring the 'fruit' aromas. E. S. King, P. Osidacz, C. Curtin, S. E. P. Bastian and I. L.

With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compounds are <b>methoxypyrazines,</b> or pyrazines, that are perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter herb, green bell pepper, or cat urine. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so ladybird taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.|$|R
500|$|The long narrow {{geography}} of the South Island ensures that no vineyard is more than [...] from the coast. The cool, maritime climate of the area allows for a long and steady growing season in which the grapes can ripen and develop a natural balance of acids and sugars. This brings out the flavors and intensity that distinguish New Zealand Sauvignon blancs. More recently, Waipara in the South Island and Gisborne and Hawkes Bay in the North Island have been attracting attention for their Sauvignon blanc releases, which often exhibit subtle differences to those from Marlborough. The asparagus, gooseberry and green flavor commonly associated with New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is derived from flavor compounds known as <b>methoxypyrazines</b> that becomes more pronounced and concentrated in wines from cooler climate regions. Riper flavors such as passion fruit, along with other notes such as boxwood, may be driven by thiol concentrations.|$|R

40|$|Cabernet sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red wine grape in California and is valued in the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars. Cabernet sauvignon grapes, when severely vigorous or overcropped, can contain vegetal aromas and flavors when harvested. 3 -alkyl-methoxypyrazines are the volatile compounds responsible for this effect and can lower the perceived quality of the wine. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin that has many medical and health benefits and can be found in red wines. An experiment was conducted in Paso Robles, CA to assess the effects of five yield levels, manipulated through cluster thinning, on <b>methoxypyrazine</b> and resveratrol concentrations. Berry weights and chemistry were also measured, in the form of ºBrix, pH, and TA. In 2009 and 2010, no significant statistical differences were found in methoxypyrazines in the harvested grapes. In 2009, resveratrol concentrations were below the detection limits in the wine produced. In 2010, berry weight and chemistry measurements were not significantly different, except for grapes from lightly- and greatly-thinned vines which varied in pH at harvest. The 2009 wines were subjected to discrimination and preference testing by trained tasters. No significant difference was found in the discrimination test and no difference was found using the Friedman and Kramer’s Rank test for the preference test. Only a very slight difference was found between the wines made from unthinned and greatly-thinned vines according to Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test.

40|$|Early leaf removal {{around the}} cluster zone {{is a common}} {{technique}} applied in cool climate viticulture, to regulate yield components and improve fruit quality. Despite the increasing amount of information on early leaf removal {{and its impact on}} total soluble solids, anthocyanins and polyphenols, less is known regarding aroma compounds. In order to verify the hypothesis that defoliation, applied before or after flowering, could impact the biosynthesis of thiol precursors, we performed a two year (2013 and 2014) experiment on Sauvignon blanc. We provided evidence that differential accumulation of thiols precursors in berries is affected by the timing of defoliation and this impact was related to modifications in biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the possible interaction between leaf removal treatment and seasonal weather conditions, and its effect on the biosynthesis of volatile precursors are discussed. Our results suggested that in Sauvignon blanc the relative proportion of 4 -S-glutathionyl- 4 -methylpentan- 2 -one (G- 4 MSP) and 3 -S-glutathionylhexan- 1 -ol (G- 3 SH) precursors can be affected by defoliation, and this could be related to the induction of two specific genes encoding glutathione-S-transferases (VvGST 3 and VvGST 5), while no significant effects on basic fruit chemical parameters, polyphenols and <b>methoxypyrazines</b> were ascertained under our experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Leaf removal is a viticultural {{practice}} {{applied to}} improve cluster microclimate and grape composition. This practice {{can reduce the}} incidence of bunch rot but could also promote the degradation of berry <b>methoxypyrazines,</b> key components for the aromatic profile of 'Sauvignon blanc' wines. The influence of cluster-zone leaf removal, applied after berry set, was evaluated on 'Sauvignon blanc' grapevines grown in the Isonzo DOC region (Italy). In 2010 and 2011, yield components and fruit chemical composition were recorded from vines in which the five basal leaves of each single shoot were manually removed at the groat-sized phenological stage, and compared to untreated vines. Our results indicated that leaf removal did not influence yield or fruit composition at harvest, but significantly decreased the incidence and severity of Botrytis bunch rot, while reducing the severity of sunburn damage to the fruit. Increased sunlight cluster exposure decreased 2 -methoxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine (IBMP) and 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) concentrations in early stages of berry development, whereas at harvest no significant differences between treatments (defoliated and non-defoliated) were observed.

40|$|<b>Methoxypyrazines</b> (MPs) are {{strongly}} odorant volatile molecules with vegetable-like fragrances that are widespread in plants. Some grapevine (Vitis vinifera) varieties accumulate {{significant amounts of}} MPs, including 2 -methoxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine (IBMP), which is the major MP in grape berries. MPs are of particular importance in white Sauvignon Blanc wines. The typicality of these wines relies on a fine balance between the pea pod, capsicum character ofMPs and the passion fruit/grapefruit character due to volatile thiols. Although MPs {{play a crucial role}} in Sauvignon varietal aromas, excessive concentrations of these powerful odorants alter wine quality and reduce consumer acceptance, particularly in red wines. The last step of IBMP biosynthesis has been proposed to involve the methoxylation of the nonvolatile precursor 2 -hydroxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine to give rise to the highly volatile IBMP. In this work, we have used a quantitative trait loci approach to investigate the genetic bases of IBMP biosynthesis. This has led to the identification of two previously uncharacterized S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase genes, termed VvOMT 3 and VvOMT 4. Functional characterization of these two O-methyltransferases showed that the VvOMT 3 protein was highly specific and efficient for 2 -hydroxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine methylation.

Of particular interest is {{the performance of the}} NPD with respect to peak parameters of asymmetry and sensitivity. Since GC x GC produces much narrower peaks than obtained with fast GC (e. g. 100 ms vs. < 1 s) the effect of detector response time and any lack of symmetry arising from the detection step is important if peak separation (resolution) is to be maintained. It was observed that detector gas flows {{had a significant impact on}} peak asymmetry and peak magnitude, and that optimisation of the detector was critical, particularly for complex sample analysis by GC x GC-NPD. Peak asymmetries ranging from A(s) = 1. 8 to 8. 0 were observed under different conditions of detector gas flows. Comparison of GC x GC-NPD with GC x GC-flame ionisation detection (FID) showed the former to be approximately 20 times more sensitive for the detection of nitrogen-containing <b>methoxypyrazines</b> analytes, and GC x GC-NPD had a larger linear detection range compared to GC x GC-FID.

Almost 150 compounds corresponding to aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, organic acids, acetate and ethyl esters, lactones, terpenes, norisoprenoids, pyrazines, thiols and phenolic compounds were found in these wines. Both extraction techniques were complementary; HS-SPME allowed to identify several important compounds that were not detected by liquid-liquid solvent extraction, in particular b-damascenone, nerolidol, citronellol, linalool, ethyl 2 -methyl-butyrate and geranyl acetone. Several varietal volatile compounds with significant odorant properties were also identified: 3 -mercaptohexyl acetate (3 MHA), 3 -mercaptohexan-l-ol (3 MH), benzenemethanethiol (BM), 2 -furanmethanethiol (2 FM); and 2 -isobutyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP) while 2 -isopropyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) and 4 -mercapto- 4 -methylpentan- 2 -one (4 MMP) were not detected. Twenty two of these compounds, including b-damascenone, several thiols, ethyl octanoate, 2 -phenylethanol, and 2 -isobutyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine, showed significant odor activities values (OAV), and were clearly related with the cooked fruits, berries-like and herbaceous notes characteristic of Carménère wines. Olfactometric techniques are underway to validate the sensory impact of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|Multicoloured Asian Lady Beetles (MALB) and 7 -spot Lady Beetles that infect {{vineyards}} can secrete alkyl-methoxypyrazines {{when they}} are processed with the grapes, resulting in wines containing a taint. The main <b>methoxypyrazine</b> associated with this taint is 3 -isopropyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP). The wines are described as having aroma and flavours of peanut butter, peanut shells, asparagus and earthy which collectively, have become known as “ladybug taint”. To date, there are no known fining agents used commercially added to juice or wine that are effective in removing this taint. The goal of this project was to use previously identified proteins with an ability to bind to methoxypyrazines at low pH, and subsequently develop a binding assay to test the ability of these proteins to bind to and remove methoxypyrazines from grape juice. The piglet odorant binding protein (plOBP) and mouse major urinary protein (mMUP) were identified, cloned and expressed in the Pichia pastoris expression system. Protein expression was induced using methanol and the proteins were subsequently purified from the induction media using anion exchange chromatography. The purified proteins were freeze-dried and rehydrated prior {{to use in the}} <b>methoxypyrazine</b> removal assay. The expression and purification system resulted in yields of approximately 78 % of purified plOBP and 62 % of purified mMUP from expression to rehydration. Purified protein values were 87 mg of purified plOPB per litre of induction media and 19 mg of purified mMUP per litre of induction medium. In order to test the ability of the protein to bind to the MPs, an MP removal assay was developed. In the assay, the purified protein is incubated with either IPMP or 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP) for two hours in either buffer or grape juice. Bentonite is then used to capture the protein-MP complex and the bentonite-protein-MP complex is then removed from solution by filtration. Residual MP is measured in solution following the MP removal assay and compared to that in the starting solution by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). GC/MS results indicated that the mMUP was capable of removing IBMP and IPMP from 300 ng/L in buffer pH 4. 0, buffer pH 3. 5 and Riesling Juice pH 3. 5 down to the limit of quantification of the instrument, which is 6 ng/L and 2 ng/L for IBMP and IPMP, respectively. The results for the plOBP showed that although it could remove some IBMP, it was only approximately 50 - 70 ng/L more than bentonite treatment followed by filtration, resulting in approximately 100 ng/L of the MPs being left in solution. pIOBP was not able to remove IPMP in buffer pH 3. 5 using this system above that removed by bentonite alone. As well, the pIOBP was not able to remove any additional MPs from Chardonnay juice pH 3. 5 above that already removed by the bentonite and filtration alone. The mouse MUP was shown to be a better candidate protein for removal of MPs from juice using this system...|$|E
40|$|After {{characterization}} {{of a novel}} odorant-binding protein (OBP) variant isolated from the rat nasal mucus, the corresponding cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR. Recombinant OBP- 1 F, the sequence of which is close to that of previously reported rat OBP- 1, has been secreted by the yeast Pichia pastoris at a concentration of 80 mg´L 21 in a form identical to the natural protein as shown by MS, N-terminal sequencing and CD. We observed that, in contrast with porcine OBP- 1, purified recombinant OBP- 1 F is a homodimer exhibiting two disulfide bonds (C 44 ±C 48 and C 63 ±C 155), a pairing close to that of hamster aphrodisin. OBP- 1 F interacts with fluorescent probe 1 -aminoanthracene (1 -AMA) with a dissociation constant of 0. 6 ^ 0. 3 mm. Fluorescence experiments revealed that 1 -AMA was displaced efficiently by molecules including usual solvents such as EtOH and dimethylsulfoxide. Owing to the large OBP- 1 F amounts expressed, {{we set up a}} novel biomimetic assay (volatileodorant binding assay) to study the uptake of airborne odorants without radiolabelling and attempted to understand the odorant capture by OBP in the nasal mucus under natural conditions. The assay permitted observations on the binding of airborne odorants of different chemical structures and odors (2 -isobutyl- 3 <b>methoxypyrazine,</b> linalool, isoamyl acetate, 1 -octanal, 1 -octanol, dimethyl disulfide and methyl thiobutyrate). Uptake of airborne odorants in nearly physiological conditions strengthens the role of OBP as volatile hydrophobic odorant carriers in the mucus of the olfactory epithelium through the aqueous barrier towards the chemo-sensory cells...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the flavour and fragrance industry has indicated {{that there is a}} great demand for flavours to have the natural, halaal and kosher status. This has opened the door for the increase in production of flavours by microbial means. Particularly with regards to pyrazine production, bacterial species such as Bacillus are commonly used. Although previous literature indicated that fungi are not as prominent pyrazine producers compared to bacteria, this study has indicated that mycelial fungi can be considered for the production of natural pyrazine flavours. Out of the 280 fungi screened, 45 % showed pyrazine flavour production as indicated in chapter 2. This chapter also showed that the content of growth media can have a substantial influence on flavour production. For example, fungi grown in Cz-medium produced more of the caramel and chocolate flavours, compared to fungi that were grown in TSB, which produced more of the nutty, meaty and potato flavours. The green flavour was, however, prominent in both media, of which mostly members of the Aspergillus and Penicillium groups produced this flavour. Selected Penicillium species, including Penicillium rubrum and P. purpurogenum produced a green pepper odour that is indicative of the presence of <b>methoxypyrazine.</b> Chemical analytical methods as described in chapter 3 confirmed that Penicillium purpurogenum produced 2 -methoxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine (MIBP) and Penicillium rubrum produced both 2 -methoxy- 3 -isobutylpyrazine (MIBP) and 2 -methoxy- 3, 5 / 6 -isopropylpyrazine (MIPP). Methoxypyrazines are high impact aroma chemicals that have a typical green pepper odour and a high market value. Due to the favourable characteristics of the Penicillium species in industrial fermentation processes (such as mass spore production and rapid colonization of substrates) and their ability to produce high value compounds, these fungi were selected for further studies. In order to explore the potential use of these fungi in an industrial application, the methoxypyrazines produced were quantified. Prior to quantitation, a solvent extraction method, using dichloromethane, was developed. Amongst the different pH parameters analysed acidified conditions showed the best results, where 69 % MIPP and 97 % MIBP were recovered from the liquid-liquid extraction and 76 % MIPP and 99 % MIBP were recovered from the solid-liquid extraction. Pyrazines quantified from the liquid-liquid extractions indicated that Penicillium rubrum produced 0. 38 μg MIPP. L- 1 and 0. 88 μg MIBP. L- 1, and Penicillium purpurogenum produced 0. 88 μg MIPP. L- 1 and 2. 15 μg MIBP. L- 1 (Chapter 4). Yields obtained from this study were not seen as feasible for the production of methoxypyrazines by the fungi on an industrial scale and, therefore, solid state fermentation was investigated as an option to improve the yields. Due to the availability of soy press cake as a by-product, as well as the variety of the amino acids present, it was selected as a possible substrate for pyrazine production. The results from this study, however, indicated that the nature of the substrate, such as the lipid content, fungal content and particle size of the soy press cake does not support fungal growth and makes pyrazine analyses problematic. Alternate methods of improving <b>methoxypyrazine</b> yields thus need to be found. A limiting factor is the lack of understanding of the metabolic pathway involved in pyrazine production by Penicillium species. By having this knowledge the fermentation process can be adapted accordingly for the optimal production of methoxypyrazines by these microorganisms. Additionally, substrates that contain the necessary precursors that are cost effective would contribute significantly in the development of an economically viable fermentation process for the production of methoxypyrazines by Penicillium species.

40|$|Winemakers, {{small fruit}} growers, and homeowners are {{concerned}} with noxious compounds released by multicolored Asian ladybird beetles (Harmonia axyridis, Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). New method based on headspace solid phase microextraction (HS‐SPME) coupled with multidimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry—olfactometry (MDGC‐MS‐O) system was developed for extraction, isolation and simultaneous identification of compounds responsible for the characteristic odor of live H. axyridis. Four <b>methoxypyrazines</b> (MPs) were identified in headspace volatiles of liveH. axyridis as {{those responsible for the}} characteristic odor: 2, 5 ‐dimethy 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (DMMP), 2 ‐isopropy 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (IPMP), 2 ‐sec‐buty 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (SBMP), and 2 ‐isobuty 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (IBMP). To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report of H. axyridis releasing DMMP and the first report of this compound being a component of the H. axyridis characteristic odor. Quantification of three MPs (IPMP, SBMP and IBMP) emitted from live H. axyridis were performed using external calibration with HS‐SPME and direct injections. A linear relationship (R 23 ̆e 0. 9958 for all 3 MPs) between MS response and concentration of standard was observed over a concentration range from 0. 1  ng L− 1 to 0. 05  μg L− 1 for HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS. The method detection limits (MDL) based on multidimensional GC‐MS approach for three MPs were estimated to be between 0. 020  ng L− 1. to 0. 022  ng L− 1.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} reducing leaf area by shoot hedging in combination with bunch thinning on metabolite concentration and sensorial quality of Sauvignon blanc grapes and wines. Methods and results: Four vine treatments were conducted: shoot hedging/bunch thinning (SH/BT), shoot hedging/no bunch thinning (SH/NBT), full canopy/bunch thinning (FC/BT) and full canopy/no bunch thinning (FC/NBT). Shoot hedging delayed total soluble solids accumulation {{at the beginning of}} the grape maturation in SH/BT and SH/NBT treatments. At harvest there were no significant differences in the concentration of hydroxycinnamoyl tartaric acids, glutathione, total soluble solids, titratable acidity and pH value in grape juice between all treatments and <b>methoxypyrazines</b> were below the limit of detection. Lutein concentration in grape berry was higher in treatments without bunch thinning, while there was no significant difference in the concentration of β-carotene and neoxanthin. The highest leaf area to yield ratio (FC/BT) resulted in higher concentration of glutathione in must and higher concentration of thiols in Sauvignon blanc wines. Upon sensory evaluation, the FC/BT wine was best scored for overall quality and heavier tropical aroma, whereas the FC/NBT wine was best scored for fresh tropical aroma and second best for overall quality. Conclusion: Leaf area to yield ratio impacted beny ripening kinetics, grape and wine metabolite composition, and sensorial properties of Sauvignon blanc wine. Signiricance and impact of the study: The shidy showed that the highest leaf area to yield ratio resulted in the best overall sensorial quality of wine. © Vigne et Vin Publications Internationales (Bordeaux, France) ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of aroma {{compounds}} that are fundamental to the sensory properties of Sauvignon Blanc wines. Two such classes of compounds are volatile thiols and esters, both of which are modulated by yeast during alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, controlling fermentation using appropriate inoculated wine yeast is likely to be an effective means of enhancing wine aroma. In an initial study, Sauvignon Blanc wines were made using different commercial Saccharomyces yeast strains, with two-and three-yeast co-inoculations, as well as singlestrains, and equal blends of the single-strain wines after fermentation. The wines were analysed for volatile aroma compounds, and sensory descriptive analyses were performed approximately six months post-bottling. Differences in the chemical composition and sensory profiles were observed (which confirmed and elaborated on previous research). The coinoculated yeast treatments generally had higher concentrations of volatile thiols and higher levels of esters, with higher ratings for ‘tropical’ and ‘fruity’ attributes, than their single-strain components and the blends of the single-strain components. The co-inoculated treatments generally fermented faster and issues with an ‘acetic’ flavour for one strain were eliminated when included in co-inoculation. Some of the wines were stored, under screw cap closures, at 15 °C for three years, and the chemical and sensory analyses were repeated. The results showed that some of the yeast-derived flavour differences in young Sauvignon Blanc wines were retained after extended bottle storage. A subset of wines showing large sensory differences was subjected to consumer acceptance testing approximately six months after bottling. Differences in liking for the different yeast treatments were observed, with the largest group of consumers preferring the two-yeast coinoculation with an intermediate sensory profile, while another group favoured the wine made using the three-yeast co-inoculation with highest ratings for the ‘estery’ and ‘floral’ aromas and highest concentrations of volatile thiols. To further investigate this result, a study was conducted to identify which sensory attributes drive consumer preferences for Sauvignon Blanc wines, and furthermore, the volatile compounds and their levels responsible for these sensory attributes. Volatile thiols, esters and <b>methoxypyrazines</b> were added to a neutral white wine at realistic levels to mimic those found in Sauvignon Blanc wines. A sensory descriptive analysis was conducted, and a subset of samples was evaluated by consumers for liking. All three classes of compounds were responsible for influencing consumer liking, with ‘confectionary’, ‘cat urine/sweaty’, ‘cooked green vegetal’ and ‘fresh green’ aromas identified as the strongest drivers of liking for different groups of consumers identified. Demographic information, and wine usage and attitudes of these white wine consumers were also used in a segmentation exercise to gain insights into consumer behaviour. The results of this study demonstrate that the choice of yeast inoculum, using single or multiple yeasts, affects wine aroma composition and sensory properties even after an extended period of bottle age, and that there are sufficiently large differences to influence consumer preference. This study has also shown, for the first time, clear linking of Sauvignon Blanc aroma compounds, their associated sensory attributes and interactions, and effects on consumer preference. These findings highlight the importance of yeast strain selection, and give wine producers a clearer direction for tailoring white wine styles that can be targeted to specific consumer groups.
