Reports {{indicated}} that a <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> frayed during launch, shearing off shards of metal that struck the riders. The injuries were mainly arm abrasions, with one passenger experiencing cuts to the face. They were treated at the park's first aid station, and two later sought further medical attention.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|E

50|$|Signals {{transmitted}} on {{optical fiber}} attenuate {{much less than}} through other media like <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> or wireless media. By using optical fiber, the radio signals can gap larger transmission distances, reducing the need of additional repeaters or amplifiers.|$|R
2500|$|Materials {{were chosen}} {{for their ability to}} serve {{multiple}} functions. Castellated beams were integrated into the structure to reduce the weight of steel used and to encourage air movement. [...] The exposed concrete slab was polished and used as the finish floor surface. The castellated steel beam structure, chosen for strength, lower cost, and reduced material was left exposed and painted white, allowing light, air and services to circulate. The <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> tray system corrals electrical and data cabling also serve as the support for the light fixtures. Ceiling mounted acoustical panels double as light reflectors. Acoustical wall panels provide additional noise damping and a place to pinup sketches.|$|E
2500|$|Tennis {{is played}} on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77m) long, and [...] wide for singles matches and [...] for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is {{required}} in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> or cord that can {{be no more than}} [...] The net is [...] high at the posts and [...] high in the center. The net posts are [...] outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, [...] outside the singles court on each side.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{types of}} metal or {{synthetic}} substances {{are used for}} bit mouthpieces, which may determine how much a horse salivates or otherwise tolerates a bit; a horse having a moist mouth is considered more relaxed and responsive. Commonly used metals include stainless steel and nickel alloys, which generally do not rust and have a neutral effect on salivation; sweet iron, aurigan and copper, which generally tend to encourage salivation, and aluminum, which is considered drying and is discouraged as a mouthpiece metal. [...] Synthetic mouthpieces may be made with or without internal <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> or bar reinforcement. [...] Rubber bits are generally thicker than metal bits, but other types of synthetics such as plastics are also used. Plastic-coated bits are often {{the same size as}} metal bits, and some are flavored.|$|E

50|$|An {{evolution}} of the Huitfeldt designs was {{the replacement of the}} heel strap with a <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> and springs. Invented in 1929 by the Swiss ski racer Guido Reuge, patented by him and marketed in 1932, the spring-loaded cable binding was named for the Lord Roberts of Kandahar Cup ski races. Kandahar-style cable bindings would be almost universal into the early 1960s.|$|E

Operation was controlled from the control room located in the top station. Trains ran on a normal track gauge (1435 mm). In the middle of the route a branch allowed the simultaneous passage of the wagons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{submarine}} cable {{was to have}} a capacity of 1,000 MW for the transmission of up to 8.7 TWh of electricity per year. It was to consist of two ironclad cables at a distance of 50 to 100 m from each other, and one ground <b>metal</b> <b>cable.</b> [...] It was to be linked with the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant at Sosnovy Bor.|$|E
50|$|Because metals {{are good}} {{conductors}} of electricity, they are valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an electric current over long distances with little energy loss or dissipation. Thus, electrical power grids rely on <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> to distribute electricity. Home electrical systems, for example, are wired with copper for its good conducting properties and easy machinability. The high thermal conductivity of most metals also makes them useful for stovetop cooking utensils.|$|R

Because of uncertainties surrounding the death, there was a full evacuation of the building and shutdown of all campus activities after his body was found. In August 2008, <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> were installed {{in the center of the}} two main stairwells to prevent objects from falling, most likely in response to this event.|$|R

50|$|Volta, a {{professor}} of experimental physics in the University of Pavia, {{was among the first}} scientists who repeated and checked Galvani’s experiments. At first, he embraced animal electricity. However, he started to doubt that the conductions were caused by a specific electricity intrinsic to animal's legs or other body part. Volta believed that the contractions depended on the <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> Galvani used to connect nerves and muscles in his experiments.|$|E
50|$|The Zinc Swinging Bridge is a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge spanning Sugar Orchard Creek {{in the small}} town of Zinc, Arkansas. Located adjacent to Washington Street, it is constructed out of triangular concrete piers, <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> 1.25 in thick, with wooden planking supported by runner borders bolted to the cables. The bridge is 104 ft long, its piers set 60 ft apart. The bridge was built in 1927. It is one of a small number of suspension bridges in the state, and one of its most distinctive.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Charles Kao of STC's Standard Telecommunication Laboratories in Harlow {{demonstrated}} that light rather than electricity {{could be used}} to transmit speech and (even more importantly) data accurately at very high speeds. Again material technology took time to catch up but by 1977 a commercial fibre optic link had been installed in England. Within ten years BT abandoned <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> except at the subscriber’s premises. Before STC’s demise, its plant at Newport came to dominate the recabling of the UK public telephone system.|$|R
40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with analysis of cabling and cabling systems in data center and with their projection as follows. The {{part of the work}} is aimed at the measurement parameters of <b>metal</b> <b>cables</b> which are used in data center with noise. The first part is focused on analyzing the structure of the data center and cabling used in it. The structure of the data center is based on the TIA- 942 and consists of an entrance room, main distribution area MDA, horizontal distribution area HDA, zone distribution area ZDA and the equipment distribution area EDA. Divided into backbone cabling and horizontal cabling and use standard and pre-terminated cabling. The measurement results of structured <b>metal</b> <b>cabling</b> with noise are discussed in the next part. There were used these types of cables UTP, FTP and S/FTP. The measurement was performed in the electricity substation and in the laboratory of electromagnetic compatibility. The third part of this work deals with the actual design of structured cabling for the data center. In the first design we use the standard installation, the second preterminated cabling. For both types of installation cost statement is processed (CAPEX). Thesis is also completed with DC design drawings and rack drawings...|$|R
