5000|$|Machinery Pool: [...] A {{family farm}} {{may be too}} small to justify the {{purchase}} of expensive farm machinery, which may be only used irregularly, say only during harvest; instead local farmers may get {{together to form a}} <b>machinery</b> <b>pool</b> that purchases the necessary equipment for all the members to use.|$|E
30|$|Of course, the {{complexity}} of the exemplary smart factory is limited and, therefore, the server’s first rank may seem obvious. However, smart factory networks in practice are far more complex and unmanageable because they consist of considerably more production components and IT components, inducing a highly complex dependency structure. Further, we assumed a symmetric setting regarding the production components’ capacities within a process step, meaning that all production components in a process step possess identical capacities. This might also differ in practice, as machines are constantly developed and production facilities typically grow over time, resulting in a heterogeneous <b>machinery</b> <b>pool.</b> Nevertheless, the results and insights of our application clearly indicate the need for decision support through a structured approach that assesses the availability risks of individual IT components. With the information provided by our risk assessment model, the focal company’s management can discuss potential IT security measures and can profoundly ground corresponding investment decisions.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural supply cooperatives {{aggregate}} purchases, storage, {{and distribution}} of farm inputs for their members. By taking advantage of volume discounts and utilizing other economies of scale, supply cooperatives bring down members' costs. Supply cooperatives may provide seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery. Some supply cooperatives also operate <b>machinery</b> <b>pools</b> that provide mechanical field services (e.g., plowing, harvesting) to their members.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{commissioned}} by ZIDS, in its capacity as the main consultant to the Makoni District Collective Co-operative Union Limited {{as part of a}} Master Study ZIDS is carrying out for the MDCCU. The aims and objectives of the study are embodied in the terms of reference below. The Terms of Reference for the Transport and Farm Machinery Feasibility Study The terms of reference as given to us by ZIDS were as follows: â€¢ A brief historical development of the existing transport and farm <b>machinery</b> <b>pool.</b> â€¢ Analysis of the economic and other activities of the existing pool focusing particularly on capacity utilisation and service charges as well as the effectiveness and adequacy of such services. â€¢ Determine the key constraints facing the existing operations. â€¢ Identify other services that demancj opportunities/potentials. â€¢ Determine the appropriate levels of both short-term and long-term requirements indicating approximate truck, trailer, tractor and implements capacities (sizes). â€¢ Determine the. supportive infrastructural requirements e. g. workshop and fuel station. â€¢ Address any other relevant issues/recommendations and factors that may arise {{in the course of this}} exercise. The study will be expected to make recommendations about the findings and operational strategies for the MDU. Such recommendations should be concrete on which aspects require assistance and the nature of such assistance.,Stichting-Hivos of Hollan...|$|E
50|$|Agricultural cooperatives or farmers' cooperatives are cooperatives where farmers pool their {{resources}} for mutual economic benefit. Agricultural cooperatives are broadly divided into agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individual farming members, and agricultural production cooperatives, where production {{resources such as}} land or <b>machinery</b> are <b>pooled</b> and members farm jointly. Known examples of agricultural production cooperatives are the cranberry-and-grapefruit cooperative Ocean Spray, collective farms in socialist states and the kibbutzim in Israel.|$|R
50|$|An {{agricultural}} cooperative, {{also known}} as a farmers' co-op, is a cooperative where farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activity.A broad typology of agricultural cooperatives distinguishes between agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individually farming members, and agricultural production cooperatives, where production resources (land, <b>machinery)</b> are <b>pooled</b> and members farm jointly. Examples of agricultural production cooperatives include collective farms in former socialist countries, the kibbutzim in Israel, collectively governed community shared agriculture, Longo Mai co-operatives and Nicaraguan production co-operatives.|$|R
30|$|Considering {{the second}} {{dimension}} studied, {{the sophistication of}} the products traded in Latin America’s regional production networks, the results provided evidence that partially supported the hypothesis that increases in imports of parts and components from Asian countries promote {{an increase in the}} quality of the intra-bloc export basket. The EA coefficient was positive for the <b>pooled</b> <b>machinery</b> data in Latin America and almost all subregions, while imports from China increased the sophistication of intra-bloc exports of electric machinery parts and components. The coefficients for subregional <b>pooled</b> <b>machinery</b> data imports from China were negative, revealing that its exports to Latin America were still composed of cheaper and less sophisticated parts and components. The results from imports from North America were mixed, with negative coefficients in the subregional cases and positive coefficients when all Latin American countries were analyzed.|$|R
40|$|Daily field {{operations}} were simulated for 15 - 20 {{years with a}} model built using a discrete event simulation technique in order to analyse machinery performance on cereal farms as influenced by daily weather. Daily soil workability was inferred by means of moisture threshold values and simulated soil moisture contents from another model (the SOIL-model) using weather data from Malmö and Uppsala, Sweden. The simulation model for field machinery operations {{had the capacity to}} determine operation dates for sowing and harvesting for individual fields and years. The dates were utilized to estimate annual timeliness costs, their mean and variance for each of the machinery sets assessed. Using this procedure to determine timeliness costs, total machinery costs (specific machinery + labour + timeliness costs) were also estimated for varying machinery set sizes, farm sizes, number of drivers and locations. Some of the findings were: (a) within certain limits of machinery size and for a given farm, there was not only one set identified as ‘the least-cost set’ but several; (b) sets with high daily effective field capacity showed low variation in annual timeliness cost; and (c) the machinery set to be selected should be the largest one among those with similar ‘least-cost’ on account of its lower annual variation, which in turn should lead to lower risks. The simulation model for field operation was also applied to a case study where a machinery co-operative was evaluated. <b>Machinery</b> <b>pooling</b> enabled farms to reduce total costs by about 15 % and investment requirements by about 50 %. Average timeliness cost estimates were of some consideration and their annual range was large (10 - 120 EUR ha- 1), even for the machinery systems with sufficient capacity. A seedbed field experiment on the effects of spring preparation date and associated soil water contents in a clayey soil found that preparation date had only a minor effect on soil compaction but the fraction of fine aggregates in the seedbed increased with time...|$|R
5000|$|The {{collectivisation}} {{of private}} and state owned agricultural land in East Germany was the progression of a policy of food security (at the expense of large scale bourgeois farmers). It began in the years of Soviet occupation (1945-48) {{as part of the}} need to govern resources in the Soviet Sector. Beginning with the forced expropriation of all land holdings in excess of 100 ha, land was redistributed in small packets of around 5 to 7 ha to incoming landless refugees driven off lost German territory to the east. These Neubauern (new farmers) were given limited ownership rights to the land, meaning that they kept it as long as they worked it. In the early 1950s, remaining farmers with largish holdings (60 to 80 ha) were effectively driven out of business through means such as denying access to <b>pooled</b> <b>machinery</b> and by setting production targets that rose exponentially with amount of land owned to levels that were impossible to meet.|$|R
30|$|Considering {{parts and}} {{components}} suppliers, we verify that imports from the ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America promoted {{an increase in}} the sophistication of the final products traded inside Latin America. A 1 % increase in North American participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, promotes an increase of 0.06 % in the quality of the intra-bloc export basket, while imports from EU promoted an increase of 0.04 %, followed by increases of 0.02 % in the case of imports from LA or EA, and 0.01 % for the ROW. The second column reveals that imports just from LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric machinery sector, while the coefficients for imports from other regions are statistically insignificant. Increases of 1 % in imports from North America promote an increase of 0.07 % in the quality of final electric machinery intra-bloc export basket, while imports from LA promote an increase of 0.06 %. Transport equipment coefficients were all statistically insignificant. In the second half of Table  5, we verify similar results for the case of <b>pooled</b> <b>machinery</b> data. North American imports promote an increase of 0.1 % in the quality of the parts and components export basket, while imports from the EU and EA promote an increase of 0.04 % each. In column 5, the coefficients are slightly different, revealing that imports only from China promote a 0.04 % increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric machinery parts and components, while imports from EA have a negative effect. Once again, transport equipment coefficients are statistically insignificant.|$|R
40|$|During endocytic transport, {{specific}} integral membrane proteins {{are sorted into}} intraluminal vesicles that bud {{from the}} limiting membrane of the endosome. This process, known as multivesicular body (MVB) sorting, is important for several important biological processes. Moreover, components of the MVB sorting machinery are implicated in virus budding. During MVB sorting, a cargo protein recruits components of the MVB sorting <b>machinery</b> from cytoplasmic <b>pools</b> and these sequentially assemble on the endosome. Disassembly of these proteins and recycling into the cytoplasm is critical for MVB sorting. Vacuolar protein sorting 4 (Vps 4) is an AAA (ATPase associated {{with a variety of}} cellular activities) ATPase which has been proposed to {{play a critical role in}} disassembly of the MVB sorting machinery. However, the mechanism by which it disassembles the complex is not clear. Vps 4 contains an N-terminal microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain, which has previously been shown to be required for recruitment to endosomes, and a single AAA ATPase domain, the activity of which is required for Vps 4 function. In this study we have systematically characterized the interaction of Vps 4 with other components of the MVB sorting machinery. We demonstrate that Vps 4 interacts directly with Vps 2 and Bro 1. We also show that a subset of Vps 4 interactions is regulated by ATP hydrolysis, and one interaction is regulated by ATP binding. Finally, we show that most proteins interact with the Vps 4 MIT domain. Our studies indicate that the MIT domain has a dual role in substrate binding and recruitment to endosomes and indicate that Vps 4 disassembles the MVB sorting machinery by direct effects on multiple proteins.

30|$|The {{most highly}} evolved {{structure}} in the human brain is the neocortex, {{which is responsible for}} the higher cognitive functions unique to humans (Rakic, 2009; Borrell and Reillo, 2012). The dramatic human neocortical expansion and gyri formation underline the precise orchestration of neurogenesis and neuronal migration in the embryonic stage, especially during the peak of neurogenesis, which occurs during the second trimester of gestation in humans (Kriegstein et al., 2006; Lui et al., 2011; de Graaf-Peters and Hadders-Algra, 2006). Radial glial (RG) cells constitute a major population of neural progenitor cells and are referred to vRG cells (ventricular radial glial cells); these cells occupy the proliferative ventricular zone (VZ) (Noctor et al., 2002; Hartfuss et al., 2001; Anthony et al., 2004). vRG cells display interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) behavior, proliferate extensively at the luminal surface of the VZ and predominantly undergo asymmetric division to self-renew while simultaneously giving rise either directly to neurons or to an IPC that subsequently divides symmetrically to produce neurons (Kriegstein et al., 2006; Noctor et al., 2001; Fishell and Kriegstein, 2003; Huttner and Kosodo, 2005). A new population of neural stem/progenitor cells has recently been reported to occupy the greatly expanded subventricular zone (SVZ), which is composed of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) and outer radial glial (oRG) cells and can be divided into the inner (ISVZ) and outer SVZ (OSVZ) by the inner fiber layer (IFL) in primates (Dehay and Kennedy, 2007; Hansen et al., 2010; LaMonica et al., 2012; Garcia-Moreno et al., 2012). Unlike vRG cells, oRG cells show distinctive mitotic somal translocation (MST) behavior, giving rise to IPCs in humans (Hansen et al., 2010; LaMonica et al., 2012; Ostrem et al., 2014; Taverna and Huttner, 2010; Gertz et al., 2014) instead of neurons, as in mice (Wang et al., 2011), and serve as transit amplifying <b>machinery</b> for proliferative <b>pool</b> expansion (Lui et al., 2011; Fietz and Huttner, 2011; Pontious et al., 2008). An enlarged OSVZ, accompanied by an increase in both oRG cells and IPCs, may account for neuronal amplification and the tangential dispersion of neurons that contributes to cortical expansion and gyrification (Borrell and Reillo, 2012; LaMonica et al., 2012; Reillo et al., 2011; Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013).|$|R
