40|$|All {{seals and}} {{cetaceans}} have lost {{at least one}} of two ancestral cone classes and should therefore be colour-blind. Nevertheless, earlier studies showed that these marine mammals can discriminate colours and a colour vision mechanism has been proposed which contrasts signals from cones and rods. However, these earlier studies underestimated the brightness discrimination abilities of these animals, so that they could have discriminated colours using brightness only. Using a psychophysical discrimination experiment, we showed that a harbour seal can solve a colour discrimination task by means of brightness discrimination alone. Performing a series of experiments in which two harbour seals had to discriminate the brightness of colours, we also found strong evidence for purely scotopic (rod-based) vision at light levels that lead to <b>mesopic</b> (rod-cone-based) <b>vision</b> in other mammals. This finding speaks against rod-cone-based colour vision in harbour seals. To test for colour-blindness, we used a cognitive approach involving a harbour seal trained to use a concept of same and different. We tested this seal with pairs of isoluminant stimuli that were either same or different in colour. If the seal had perceived colour, it would have responded to colour differences between stimuli. However, the seal responded with "same", providing strong evidence for colour-blindness...|$|R

MethodsBinocular best distance corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at high and low contrast [4 m], best distance corrected near visual acuity (BCNVA) [40 cm], intermediate visual acuity [80 and 60 cm], and distance contrast sensitivity (CS) under photopic [85 cd/m 2] and mesopic [3 cd/m 2] conditions, were measured in 36 eyes that underwent implantation of the AcrySof ReSTOR Aspheric IOL (SN 6 AD 3). ResultsAt the 3 -month postoperative visit, binocular BCVA was - 0. 058 ± 0. 091, 0. 200 ± 0. 079, and 0. 258 ± 0. 071 logMAR, for 100 %, 25 % and 12. 5 % of contrast, respectively.

To report visual performance after bilateral implantation of a diffractive toric multifocal intraocular lens in high myopes. Methods. Prospective, observational case series to include patients with axial length of ≥ 26 [*]mm and corneal astigmatism of > 1 dioptre who underwent bilateral AT LISA 909 M implantation. Postoperative examinations included photopic and mesopic distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity; photopic contrast sensitivity; visual symptoms (0 – 5); satisfaction (1 – 5); and spectacle independence rate. Results. Twenty-eight eyes (14 patients) were included. Postoperatively, mean photopic monocular uncorrected distance, intermediate, and near visual acuities (logMAR) were 0. 12 ± 0. 20 (standard deviation), 0. 24 ± 0. 16, and 0. 29 ± 0. 21, respectively.

40|$|A {{controversy}} {{exists on}} photic {{driving in the}} human visual cortex evoked by intermittent photic stimulation. Frequency entrainment and resonance phenomena are reported for frequencies higher than 12 Hz in some studies while missing in others. We hypothesized {{that this might be}} due to different experimental conditions, since both high and low intensity light stimulation were used. However, most studies do not report radiometric measurements, which makes it impossible to categorize the stimulation according to photopic, <b>mesopic,</b> and scotopic <b>vision.</b> Low intensity light stimulation might lead to scotopic vision, where rod perception dominates. In this study, we investigated photic driving for rod-dominated visual input under scotopic conditions. Twelve healthy volunteers were stimulated with low intensity light flashes at 20 stimulation frequencies, leading to rod activation only. The frequencies were multiples of the individual alpha frequency (α) of each volunteer in the range from 0. 40 – 2. 30 *α. 306 -channel whole head magnetoencephalography recordings were analyzed in time, frequency, and spatiotemporal domains with the Topographic Matching Pursuit algorithm. We found resonance phenomena and frequency entrainment for stimulations at or close to the individual alpha frequency (0. 90 – 1. 10 *α) and half of the alpha frequency (0. 40 – 0. 55 *α). No signs of resonance and frequency entrainment phenomena were revealed around 2. 00 *α. Instead, on-responses at the beginning and off-responses {{at the end of each}} stimulation train were observed for the first time in a photic driving experiment at frequencies of 1. 30 – 2. 30 *α, indicating that the flicker fusion threshold was reached.

Methods: Sixty eyes of 31 normal controls, 92 eyes of 52 patients with retinitis pigmentosa without other ocular disorders (RP- 1 group), and 20 eyes of 14 patients with retinitis pigmentosa with cataracts and without other ocular disorders (RP- 2 group) were studied. Conventional visual acuity was measured using a conventional Landolt ring chart with 100 % contrast and luminance of 150 cd/m 2. All of the patients with retinitis pigmentosa had a decimal visual acuity better than 1. 0. Contrast visual acuity was measured with the same Landolt ring chart with contrasts of 100 % and 10 % and under photopic (200 cd/m 2) and mesopic (10 cd/m 2) conditions. Decimal visual acuities were converted to logMAR units for the analyses. Results: The 100 % contrast visual acuity and the 10 % contrast visual acuity determined under both photopic and mesopic conditions were significantly poorer in both the RP- 1 and RP- 2 groups than in the controls. The differences between the conventional visual acuity and the 100 % contrast visual acuity were significantly greater in the RP- 1 and RP- 2 groups than in the controls under both photopic and mesopic conditions. The differences between the 100 % contrast visual acuity and the 10 % contrast visual acuity were not significant among the three groups under photopic and mesopic conditions. Conclusion: Contrast visual acuities were greatly reduced in patients with retinitis pigmentosa with relatively well preserved conventional visual acuity, and the contrast visual acuity was largely influenced by ambient light levels in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Although a longitudinal study for confirmation has to be performed, our findings indicate that contrast visual acuity is a better test to follow changes in visual function in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

40|$|Background: Today, {{patients}} often {{expect to}} achieve spectacle independance after cataract surgery. New trifocal intraocular lenses {{have been developed}} to try and fullfill this demand. The {{purpose of this study is}} to report the short-term visual outcomes of a new trifocal intraocular lens (AcrySof PanOptix™). Methods: Consecutive adult patients undergoing cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the study intraocular lens in a private practice clinic were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were the presence of other ocular pathologies or preoperative astigmatism > 1. 5 diopters (D). Patients with intraoperative complications were excluded from analysis. One month after surgery patients underwent: monocular defocus curve; monocular and binocular uncorrected visual acuity in photopic and mesopic conditions, for far (4 m), intermediate (60 cm) and near (33 cm) distances and binocular contrast sensitivity. Patients completed a visual satisfaction questionnaire between 9 and 12 months after surgery. Results: One hundred and sixteen eyes of fifty-eight patients receiving bilateral implantation of the study intraocular lens were analysed. Mean binocular uncorrected visual acuity in photopic conditions was 0. 03 LogMAR for far, 0. 12 for intermediate and 0. 02 for near distances. All patients achieved a binocular uncorrected visual acuity better than 0. 3 LogMAR (20 / 40 Snellen equivalent) for distance and near vision and 94. 8 % of patients for intermediate <b>vision.</b> <b>Mesopic</b> binocular uncorrected visual acuity values were similar to photopic values. The monocular defocus curves showed that the best visual acuity was reached at a vergence of 0. 00 D. Visual acuity dropped slightly at − 1. 00 D and peaked again at − 2. 00 D. Visual acuities better than 0. 2 LogMAR were maintained between − 2. 50 D and + 0. 50 D. Contrast sensitivity was high and similar in photopic and mesopic conditions. As regards patient-evaluated outcomes, only 2 patients (3. 4 %) were fairly dissatisfied with their sight after surgery. Three patients (5. 1 %) reported the need for spectacle correction for certain activities. All other patients (94. 8 %) reported never using spectacle correction. Conclusions: The PanOptix trifocal IOL provides good short-term visual outcomes, with good intermediate performance and excellent patient-reported satisfaction. The similar values achieved in mesopic and photopic conditions in binocular uncorrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity suggest low pupillary dependence for light distribution.

50|$|Humans see {{differently}} {{at different}} light levels. This is because under high light levels typical {{during the day}} (photopic vision), the eye uses cones to process light. Under very low light levels, corresponding to moonless nights without electric lighting (scotopic vision), the eye uses rods to process light. At many night-time levels, {{a combination of both}} cones and rods supports vision. Photopic vision facilitates excellent color discrimination ability, whereas colors are indiscriminable under scotopic vision. <b>Mesopic</b> <b>vision</b> falls between these two extremes.

5000|$|The {{human eye}} is not equally {{sensitive}} to all wavelengths of visible light. Photometry attempts {{to account for}} this by weighing the measured power at each wavelength with a factor that represents how sensitive the eye is at that wavelength. The standardized model of the eye's response to light {{as a function of}} wavelength is given by the luminosity function. The eye has different responses as a function of wavelength when it is adapted to light conditions (photopic vision) and dark conditions (scotopic vision). Photometry is typically based on the eye's photopic response, and so photometric measurements may not accurately indicate the perceived brightness of sources in dim lighting conditions where colors are not discernible, such as under just moonlight or starlight. Photopic vision is characteristic of the eye's response at luminance levels over three candela per square metre.

Since these cells respond mostly to blue light, {{it has been suggested that}} they have a role in <b>mesopic</b> <b>vision.</b> Zaidi and colleagues' work with rodless coneless human subjects hence also opened the door into image-forming (visual) roles for the ganglion cell photoreceptor. It was discovered that there are parallel pathways for vision - one classic rod and cone-based pathway arising from the outer retina, and the other a rudimentary visual brightness detector pathway arising from the inner retina, which seems to be activated by light before the other. Classic photoreceptors also feed into the novel photoreceptor system, and colour constancy may be an important role as suggested by Foster. The receptor could be instrumental in understanding many diseases including major causes of blindness worldwide like glaucoma, a disease that affects ganglion cells, and the study of the receptor offered potential as a new avenue to explore in trying to find treatments for blindness. It is in these discoveries of the novel photoreceptor in humans and in the receptors role in vision, rather than its non-image-forming functions, where the receptor may have the greatest impact on society as a whole, though the impact of disturbed circadian rhythms is another area of relevance to clinical medicine.|$|E

The second part focused on a possible improvement of visual performance by comparing a regular grid pattern to a randomly chosen spacing of the laser spots (n 0 16).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this article, {{we review}} {{the impact of}} vision on older people's night driving abilities. Driving is the {{preferred}} and primary mode of transport for older people. It is a complex activity where intact vision is seminal for road safety. Night driving requires mesopic rather than scotopic vision, because there is always some light available when driving at night. Scotopic refers to night vision, photopic refers to vision under well-lit conditions, and <b>mesopic</b> <b>vision</b> {{is a combination of}} photopic and scotopic vision in low but not quite dark lighting situations. With increasing age, <b>mesopic</b> <b>vision</b> decreases and glare sensitivity increases, {{even in the absence of}} ocular diseases. Because of the increasing number of elderly drivers, more drivers are affected by night vision difficulties. Vision tests, which accurately predict night driving ability, are therefore of great interest. METHODS: We reviewed existing literature on age-related influences on vision and vision tests that correlate or predict night driving ability. RESULTS: We identified several studies that investigated the relationship between vision tests and night driving. These studies found correlations between impaired <b>mesopic</b> <b>vision</b> or increased glare sensitivity and impaired night driving, but no correlation was found among other tests; for example, useful field of view or visual field. The correlation between photopic visual acuity, the most commonly used test when assessing elderly drivers, and night driving ability has not yet been fully clarified. CONCLUSIONS: Photopic visual acuity alone is not a good predictor of night driving ability. Mesopic visual acuity and glare sensitivity seem relevant for night driving. Due to the small number of studies evaluating predictors for night driving ability, further research is needed...|$|E

We discuss the findings in the context of rod inputs to the three primary retinogeniculate pathways to understand rod contributions to <b>mesopic</b> <b>vision.</b> Additionally, we present evidence that hue perception is possible under scotopic, pure rod-mediated conditions that involves cortical mechanisms...|$|E
