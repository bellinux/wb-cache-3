5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the <b>might</b> <b>of</b> the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} to push a radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy. He was opposed by conservatives such as Michał Wielhorski, who were supported by the Prussian and Russian ambassadors, who threatened war if the reform was passed. The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the Radom Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to pass at the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to guarantee the Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the <b>might</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Empire.|$|E

He ordered the knight of St. Pierre of the French Royal Naval Fleet {{to build a new}} war fleet to fight the Ottoman scourge. Meanwhile, the old galleys, together with the <b>might</b> <b>of</b> a vessel armed with 80 cannons, waged war at sea against the pirates.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{threat that}} Clan Donald posed to the Scottish crown {{led to the}} forcible {{dissolution}} of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV in 1493, but although the king {{had the power to}} subdue the organised military <b>might</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrides, he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. The House of Stuart's attempts to control the Outer Hebrides were then at first desultory and little more than punitive expeditions. In 1506 the Earl of Huntly besieged and captured Stornoway Castle using cannon. In 1540 James V himself conducted a royal tour, forcing the clan chiefs to accompany him. There followed a period of peace, but all too soon the clans were at loggerheads again.|$|E
5|$|The monarchists {{leaned on}} the Swedish regime's year 1772 monarchist constitution, belittled the Declaration of Independence 1917 and {{proposed}} a modernized monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law, accepted by Russia in 1809, lost validity in the February Revolution, the <b>might</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917 and Finnish republic was accepted on 6 December. The republicans were able to postpone processing of the monarchists' proposal in the parliament, {{and in the end}} a new monarchist constitution was not accepted in Finland. The monarchists responded by applying directly the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country.|$|E

5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the <b>might</b> <b>of</b> the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E
5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and <b>might</b> <b>of</b> Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic <b>might</b> <b>of</b> nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, the Great White Fleet {{was ordered}} by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt {{to circle the}} world, as a {{demonstration}} of the <b>might</b> <b>of</b> the United States Navy. Kentucky was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and was commanded by Captain Walter C. Cowles, while the fleet as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, Kentuckys former flag officer. On 16 December 1907, the fleet saluted the presidential yacht , and left from Hampton Roads. The fleet then sailed south, passing Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and going through the Straits of Magellan. From there she passed the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet arrived at San Diego on 14 April 1908 and continued to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later it arrived at Honolulu, and from there sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving on 9 August. On 20 August, the fleet reached Sydney, Australia, and a week later sailed for Melbourne.|$|E

During the fracas, the Green Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane Watson, taking her to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay his murder of Gwen Stacy. However, a drugged Doctor Octopus intervenes, attacking the Green Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after {{a bolt of lightning}} sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Green Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden Aunt May, and rescues her as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving from his residence. After this battle, Osborn attempts to escape to Paris, but is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.|$|E
5|$|The king Prithviraj Chauhan was {{defeated}} in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori, a Muslim invader from Afghanistan, who made {{a concerted effort to}} conquer northern India. By 1200, native Hindu resistance had begun to crumble, the dominance of foreign Turkic Muslim dynasties in north India was to last for the next five centuries. The slave general of Ghori, Qutb-ud-din Aibak was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India and then Ghori returned to his capital, Ghor. He died in 1206 AD. He had no heirs and so his generals declared themselves independent in different parts of his empire. Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions. He laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mamluk Dynasty. he began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (<b>Might</b> <b>of</b> Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. Qutb-ud-din faced widespread Hindu rebellions because he broke several ancient temples to acquire wealth and material to build mosques and other monuments. It was his successor, Iltutmish (1211–36), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India. Razia Sultan, daughter of Iltutmish, succeeded him as the Sultan of Delhi. She is the first and only woman to rule over Delhi.|$|E
