25|$|In the {{following}} time, especially {{the western part}} of the plateau was again significantly risen, so that in this area, the sediments of the upper sweetwater <b>molasse</b> and the upper sea <b>molasse</b> have been largely eroded.|$|E
25|$|During the Tertiary orogenic uplift, around 60 – 40 {{millions}} years ago, {{the area}} of today's Swiss Plateau was a Karst plateau somewhat inclined to the south. Through processes of rising and lowering that were brought by the folding of the Alps, the area was twice flooded by a sea. The corresponding sediments are distinguished as sea <b>molasse</b> and freshwater <b>molasse,</b> even though the latter consists rather of fluvial and eolian sediments (a kind of mainland <b>molasse).</b>|$|E
25|$|Upper sea <b>molasse</b> (around 22 - 16 {{millions}} years ago): For {{a second}} time, a shallow sea invaded. The {{formation of the}} conglomerate fans of the Napf and of the Hörnli began.|$|E
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of the sea molasses are fossil snails, shells and shark teeth, whereas in the sweetwater <b>molasse,</b> fossils of typical land mammals and former subtropical vegetation (for instance palm leaves) are found.|$|E
25|$|Geologically {{the most}} {{important}} layer of the Swiss Plateau is the thick <b>molasse</b> sequence that accumulated at {{the border of the}} Alps due to the rapid erosion of the concurrently uplifted mountains. The thickness of the <b>molasse</b> increases from west to east (at the same distance from the Alps). The former alpine rivers built huge fans of sediment {{at the foot of the}} mountains. The most important examples are the Napf fan and the Hörnli fan; other sedimentary fans exist in the Rigi region, in the Schwarzenburg region and in the region between the eastern lake Geneva and the middle reaches of the Saane/Sarine.|$|E
25|$|To the north, {{beyond the}} Isère Valley, the Romanais continues, geologically, Valence plain. The lower Miocene <b>molasse</b> {{in the north}} of the plain was covered by outwash {{alluvium}} of the Isère, whose terraces today still mark the shape of the Valentinois.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{freshwater}} <b>molasse</b> (about 16 - 2 millions years ago): The sea receded as {{the formation}} and of the Napf and Hörnli fans continued (along with other minor fans). At {{the end of this}} period, the thickness reached about 1500 meters.|$|E
25|$|The Bohemian Massif and its foothills {{were formed}} in the Variscan orogeny of the late Paleozoic era. Another {{important}} element of Austrian geology and geography is the late Mesozoic Alpine orogeny, and the subsequent formation of the Paratethys ocean and <b>Molasse</b> Basin in the Cretaceous era.|$|E
25|$|Lower {{freshwater}} <b>molasse</b> (around 30 - 22 millions years ago): The sea receded {{because of}} uplift, {{but also because}} of a worldwide lowering of the mean sea level. The initiation of the Alpine orogeny and subsequent folding and uplift resulted in rapid erosion accompanied by deposition of the first conglomerate fans.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the growing {{weight of the}} {{mountain}} belt can cause isostatic subsidence {{in the area of}} the overriding plate on the other side to the mountain belt. The basin type resulting from this subsidence is called a back-arc basin and is usually filled by shallow marine deposits and <b>molasse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lower sea <b>molasse</b> (around 37 - 30 {{millions}} years ago): The limestone plateau subsided gradually, and {{a shallow}} sea invaded, spreading {{east to the}} Carpathian Mountains. The sediments consisted of fine-grained sands, clay and marl. There were no conglomerate fans since the proper Alpine folding began {{only at the end}} of that period.|$|E
25|$|The Drôme des Collines, which {{integrates}} Valence, {{formed at}} the end of the Miocene. Under the effect of the Alpine thrust, the area was covered by a lake and fluvio-lacustrine <b>molasse</b> formed with a few ripples in the plain of Valence. The confluence of the Isère and Rhône and fluvial erosion caused by their waters, in the Quaternary, formed four superimposed terraces which are located in Valence.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Swiss Plateau forms a basin, {{it is by}} no means a flat territory, but {{depending}} on the region, it has a manifold structure. Important elements are the two big lakes, Lake Geneva and Lake Constance that delimit the Swiss Plateau in the southwest and the northeast. The western plateau is stamped by the Gros-de-Vaud plateau (up to 600 meters AMSL) and the Jorat <b>molasse</b> hills (up to 900 meters AMSL) but sometimes intersected by deep valleys. Only near the Jura there is an almost continuous dip consisting of the Venoge and the Orbe valleys which are separated by the Mormont hill, the main watershed between Rhône and Rhine, at only 500 m AMSL. The Seeland ('lake land'), characterized by the Murten, Neuchâtel and Biel lakes, represents the biggest plain of the Swiss Plateau, though it is also interrupted by isolated <b>molasse</b> ranges. In the east, it is neighboured by various hill countries the height of which decreases to the north. Another major plain is the Wasseramt where the Emme runs. In a broad valley alongside the Jura, the Aare collects all the rivers that come down from the Alps.|$|E
25|$|A third type of basin exists along {{convergent}} plate boundaries – {{places where}} one tectonic plate moves under another into the asthenosphere. The subducting plate bends and forms a fore-arc basin {{in front of}} the overriding plate—an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called flysch. When the convergent movement of the two plates results in continental collision, the basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland basin. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a mountain belt in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called <b>molasse</b> and has either a shallow marine or a continental facies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} and northwest, the Swiss Plateau is sharply delimited {{geographically}} and geologically by the Jura Mountains. In the south, {{there is no clear}} border with the Alps. Usually, the rising of the terrain to altitudes above 1500 metres AMSL (lime Alps, partly sub-alpine <b>molasse),</b> which is very abrupt in certain places, is taken as a criterion for delimitation. Occasionally the regions of the higher Swiss Plateau, especially the hills of the canton of Fribourg, the Napf region, the Töss region and parts of the Appenzell region are considered to form the Swiss Alpine foreland in a narrow sense. However, if a division into the three main regions Jura Mountains, Swiss Plateau and Alps is considered, the Alpine foreland belongs clearly to the Swiss Plateau. In the southwest, the Swiss Plateau is confined by Lake Geneva, in the northeast, by Lake Constance and the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{layers of}} the Swiss Plateau are relatively well known. The base level is crystalline basement which outcrops in the central crystalline Alps {{as well as in}} the Black Forest and the Vosges mountain range but forms a deep geosyncline in the Swiss Plateau and in the Jura (see also Jurassic). Around 2500 – 3000 metres below the surface, but considerably deeper near the Alps, the drillings have hit the crystalline basement. It is covered by unfolded strata of Mesozoic sediments, which are part of the Helvetic nappes. Its depth gradually decreases from about 2.5km in the west to 0.8km in the east. These layers, like the ones of the Jura Mountains, were deposited in a relatively shallow sea, the Tethys Ocean. Above the Mesozoic layers, is the <b>Molasse,</b> consisting of conglomerate, sandstone, marl and shale. The uppermost layer consists of gravel and glacial sediments that have been transported by the glaciers of the ice ages.|$|E
2500|$|The former municipality's area {{includes}} {{a part of}} the Swiss plateau's <b>molasse</b> uplands. The sprawling, yet narrow, area is bordered on the southeast by the Schiffenensee. All along this reservoir's shoreline in the Barberêche area is a [...] high dike topped with trees, broken here and there by sandstone cliffs. Several gullies carved by erosion empty into the lake; these have been partially flooded owing {{to the creation of the}} reservoir. The gullies divide the terrace that Barberêche is built on into several small plateaux, which themselves are abutted in the northwest by the <b>molasse</b> hill.|$|E
2500|$|Hasle bei Burgdorf {{is located}} [...] {{as the crow flies}} {{southeast}} of the district capital Burgdorf. It is in the Emmental in the floodplain on the left shore of the Emme in the <b>molasse</b> hills of the higher Swiss plateau.|$|E
2500|$|The eastern Swiss Plateau is {{structured}} by the valleys of the Limmat (including lake Zurich), the Glatt, the Töss and the Thur. Between them there are hill countries, in the canton of [...] Thurgau also the broad <b>molasse</b> ranges of Seerücken and Ottenberg.|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{southern}} and {{western part of}} the municipality is covered by´the <b>molasse</b> hills between Emmental and Aaretal. This landscape is characterized by hill crests as well as valleys and trenches, which are often very steep - this makes agricultural use of the land very difficult. Therefore, the hills are dominated by pasture and forests from a certain height. The hills reach an average height of [...] above sea level. On the Wägesse a broad crest between Biembachtal and the Widimattgraben - another valley - the highest point in Hasle bei Burgdorf is reached with [...] above sea level.|$|E
2500|$|The {{granitic}} base, {{cut by the}} Rhône in the Saint-Vallier/Tain-l'Hermitage pass, {{is covered}} by [...] of sediments in the Valence trough. In the Miocene, a <b>molasse</b> formed of detrital rocks due to {{the erosion of the}} Alps and the Massif Central, was deposited in a shallow sea. Its thickness can reach [...] During the Pliocene, the sea was reduced into a lake, resulting in lacustrine deposits and loess formation. During the Quaternary, between glacial periods, moraines were swept away by the meltwater in the interglacial stages and were carved by the rivers. Thus, nested terraces were formed. These nested terraces of Isère and Rhône eventually filled the gap of Valence.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the region}} of Pomerol lies what is {{described}} as a bouttonière (or [...] "buttonhole") of unique blue-clay (known as <b>molasse)</b> sitting on top of band of sand rich in iron deposits that is known as crasse de fer or machefer. This is a small region of only about 20 hectares (50 acres) that is very atypical of the soils found in rest of Pomerol, but because the vineyard of the noted estate of Château Pétrus is planted on more than half of these hectares, its influence on the wine has been much discussed in the literature. Other vineyards which have at least some planting on this bouttonière include Château La Conseillante, Château L'Évangile, Château Lafleur, Château Gazin, Château Trotanoy, Château Clinet, Château le Gay and Vieux Château Certan.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this period}} the Himalayan orogeny began, and the {{volcanism}} {{associated with the}} Deccan Traps continued. The rocks of this era have valuable deposits of petroleum and coal. Sandstones of Eocene age are found in Punjab, which grade into chalky limestones with oil seepages. Further north the rocks found in the Simla area are divided into three series, the Sabathu series consisting of grey and red shales, the Dagshai series comprising bright red clays and the Kasauli series comprising sandstones. Towards the east in Assam, Nummulitic limestone {{is found in the}} Khasi hills. Oil is associated with these rocks of the Oligo-Miocene age. Along the foothills of the Himalayas the Siwalik <b>molasse</b> is composed of sandstones, conglomerates and shales with thicknesses of [...] to [...] and ranging from Eocene to Pliocene. These rocks are famous for their rich fossil vertebrate fauna including many fossil hominoids.|$|E
6000|$|... 110. And, {{because it}} is well at once to know some {{direction}} in which our work may be definite, let me suggest to {{those of you who}} may intend passing their vacation in Switzerland, and who care about mountains, that if they will first qualify themselves to take angles of position and elevation with correctness, and to draw outlines with approximate fidelity, there are a series of problems of the highest interest to be worked out on the southern edge of the Swiss plain, {{in the study of the}} relations of its <b>molasse</b> beds to the rocks which are characteristically developed in the chain of the Stockhorn, Beatenberg, Pilate, Mythen above Schwytz, and High Sentis of Appenzell, the pursuit of which may lead them into many pleasant, as well as creditably dangerous, walks, and curious discoveries; and will be good for the discipline of their fingers in the pencilling of crag form.|$|E
6000|$|... 116. So again--for having {{begun to}} speak of myself I will do so yet more frankly--I suppose that when people see my name down for a hundred pounds to the Cruikshank Memorial, and for another hundred to the Eyre Defense Fund, they think only that I have more money than I {{know what to do}} with. Well, the giving of those {{subscriptions}} simply decides the question whether or no I shall be able to afford a journey to Switzerland this year, in the negative; and I wanted to go, not only for health's sake, but to examine the junctions of the <b>molasse</b> sandstones and nagelfluh with the Alpine limestone, in order to complete some notes I meant to publish next spring on the geology of the great northern Swiss valley; notes which must now lie by me at least for another year; and I believe this delay (though I say it) will be really something of a loss to the traveling public, for the little essay was intended to explain to them, in a familiar way, the real wonderfulness of their favorite mountain, the Righi; and to give them some amusement in trying to find out where the many-colored pebbles of it had come from. But it is more important that I should, with some stoutness, assert my respect for the genius and earnest patriotism of Cruikshank, and my much more than disrespect for the Jamaica Committee, than that I should see the Alps this year, or get my essay finished next spring; but I tell you the fact, because I want you to feel how, in thus leaving their men of worth to be assisted or defended only by those who deeply care for them, the public more or less cripple, to their own ultimate disadvantage, just the people who could serve them in other ways; while the speculators and money-seekers, who are only making their profit out of the said public, of course take no part in the help of anybody. And even if the willing bearers could sustain the burden anywise adequately, none of us would complain; but I am certain there is no man, whatever his fortune, who is now engaged in any earnest offices of kindness to these sufferers, especially of the middle class, among his acquaintance, who will not bear me witness that for one we can relieve, we must leave three to perish. I have left three, myself, {{in the first three months}} of this year. One was the artist Paul Gray, for whom an appeal was made to me for funds to assist him in going abroad out of the bitter English winter. I had not the means by me, and he died a week afterwards. Another case was that of a widow whose husband had committed suicide, for whom application was made to me at the same time; and the third was a personal friend, to whom I refused a sum which he said would have saved him from bankruptcy. I believe six times as much would not have saved him; however, I refused, and he is ruined.|$|E
50|$|The {{region where}} the <b>molasse</b> crops out {{is divided into}} two. The Subalpine <b>Molasse</b> zone along the Alps and the Foreland <b>Molasse</b> zone further into the foreland. In the Foreland <b>Molasse</b> zone the <b>molasse</b> sediments are {{relatively}} undisturbed, in the Subalpine <b>Molasse</b> zone the beds are often tilted, folded and thrust over each other.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The Bavarian Alps {{rise from}} the green hills of the <b>Molasse</b> basin. The hills consist of tilted <b>molasse</b> beds, erosional {{material}} transported from the mountains into their foreland.|$|E
50|$|Tüllinger Mountain is {{situated}} predominantly in the Tüllinger softwater <b>molasse.</b> The <b>molasse</b> comprises vryenen marl {{and parts of}} the Alsace <b>molasse.</b> The mountain was created through a fracture zone. The soil on Tüllinger Mountain comprises loess, clay-saboulous, and chalky soils, which allows for the cultivation of grapes and other fruit. Closed vine-areas are located in the south between Baselweg, Lichsenweg, and the lower Wagenkehrweg in the direction of Alt-Weil.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} time, especially {{the western part}} of the plateau was again significantly risen, so that in this area, the sediments of the upper sweetwater <b>molasse</b> and the upper sea <b>molasse</b> have been largely eroded.|$|E
50|$|During the Tertiary orogenic uplift, around 60 - 40 {{millions}} years ago, {{the area}} of today's Swiss Plateau was a Karst plateau somewhat inclined to the south.

50|$|The total {{thickness}} of <b>molasse</b> deposits {{in the basin}} can be up to 6 kilometers. Lithostratigraphically, this <b>molasse</b> is treated as {{a group that is}} divided into four formations. This division is made on whether the sedimentary facies is continental or marine.|$|E
5000|$|Continuation of North Alpine <b>Molasse</b> Basin to the Carpathians ...|$|E
50|$|When a {{foreland}} basin {{was formed}} in the Rhenohercynian zone, this was filled with upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) flysch and <b>molasse</b> sediments. The Namurian is characterized by flysch, in the Westphalian this gradually grades into <b>molasse</b> and other continental deposits, among which the thick coal layers of the Belgian coal measures.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>molasse</b> can {{sometimes}} completely fill a foreland basin, creating a nearly flat depositional surface, that nonetheless remains a structural syncline. <b>Molasse</b> {{can be very}} thick near the mountain front, but usually thins out towards {{the interior of a}} craton; such massive, [...] accumulations of sediment are known as clastic wedges.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the huge}} amounts of sediments that were eroded from the forming {{mountain}} chain the basin was filled up and got shallower. During the Oligocene and Miocene epochs (more exactly between 10 and 30 million years ago), undeep marine to continental <b>molasse</b> was deposited in the basin. Around 10 to 5 million years ago, tectonic uplift had raised the basin to such a height that netto sedimentation stopped. From the south, the <b>molasse</b> deposits were overthrust about 10 kilometers by the Helvetic nappes, which caused the deformation in the Subalpine <b>Molasse</b> zone. The Jura mountains, a fold and thrust belt along the present Swiss-French border, also originated from this tectonic phase. In some places in the Jura mountains, <b>molasse</b> deposits were folded together with older Mesozoic limestones. In present-day central Switzerland however, the <b>molasse</b> formed a thick, competent mass that was thrust northward in one piece over a decollement horizon {{at the base of}} the Mesozoic, in Triassic evaporites. Deformation instead localized further north, thus forming the relatively flat Swiss Mittelland between the Alps and the Jura Mountains. The Swiss part of the <b>Molasse</b> basin is now located in between the Alps and the Jura mountains, as a large piggy-back basin. In the Eastern Alps an external mountain range such as the Jura Mountains never developed. Due to the last phase of tectonic uplift around 5 million years ago, the <b>molasse</b> in the Swiss Plateau, the South Bavarian plain and Eastern Austria is now at 350 to 400 meters above sea level at its northern rim, slowly rises southwards and can attain more than 1,000 m at its contact with the Alps.|$|E
5000|$|The Helvetic zone {{consists}} {{of a number of}} tectonically very different units. The [...] "Helvetic nappes" [...] are a nappe stack that was thrusted over the <b>molasse</b> of the <b>Molasse</b> basin in the Alpine foreland. They are composed of Mesozoic marine limestone, marls and shales. The Helvetic nappes are completely detached from their former basement.|$|E
