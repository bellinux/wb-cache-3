25|$|The {{triumph of}} <b>Minute</b> <b>by</b> <b>Minute</b> was bittersweet, however, because it {{coincided with the}} near-dissolution of the band. The {{pressure}} of touring while recording and releasing an album each year had worn the members down. Jeff Baxter and Michael McDonald {{had been in the}} midst of a creative conflict for some time. McDonald desired a direct, soulful and polished rock/R sound, while Baxter insisted on embellishing guitar parts in an increasingly avant garde style. (Both McDonald and Baxter elaborated on the matter in the documentary series Behind the Music, which aired on VH1 in February 2001.) Just as the success of <b>Minute</b> <b>by</b> <b>Minute</b> had become apparent, founding drummer Hartman, longtime guitarist Baxter, and percussionist LaKind left the band. A two-song set on the January 27, 1979, broadcast of Saturday Night Live (with guest host Michael Palin) marked the final television appearance of this lineup, and a brief tour of Japan marked the last live performances of the band in its middle-period configuration (Hartman subsequently joined Johnston's touring band in 1979 and taped an appearance with Johnston that aired on Soundstage in 1980).|$|E

2500|$|... 1980 {{marked the}} return of LaKind to the lineup as a {{full-time}} member and the [...] "Doobies" [...] released their ninth studio album, One Step Closer. The LP featured the hit title track and the Top 10 smash [...] "Real Love" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} the John Lennon composition) but did not dominate the charts and the radio as <b>Minute</b> <b>by</b> <b>Minute</b> had two years earlier, largely due to an oversaturation of the [...] "McDonald sound" [...] by many other artists (such as Robbie Dupree's hit [...] "Steal Away", which copied the [...] "McDonald sound" [...] nearly note for note) heard on the radio at that time—not to mention McDonald's numerous guest vocal appearances on hits by other artists at that time, such as Kenny Loggins, Christopher Cross, Lauren Wood and Nicolette Larson. The album itself was also noticeably weaker musically than the previous three with the band itself sounding tired and seemingly devolving to little more than McDonald's [...] "backup band" [...] by then (according to contemporary references at that time). [...] "Ted and Michael became one faction against Pat and the rest of us,” Porter said in an interview. Long frustrated with the realities of relentless touring and yearning for a stable home life, as well as battling self-admitted problems with cocaine, Porter left the band after the recording of Closer. Session bassist Willie Weeks joined the band and the Doobies continued touring throughout 1980 and 1981 (Post-Doobies, Weeks has performed with the Gregg Allman Band, Eric Clapton, and many others).|$|E
