40|$|The {{consideration}} in the article {{is given to the}} state of objects of heat power engineering in Sverdlovsk region. Particular attention is paid to social importance of delivering of heat and power energy under climatic conditions of Sverdlovsk region. The necessity of <b>modernization</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> participating at delivering of heat and power energy is admitted. The main problem is a search of financing source of measures related to overhaul and current repair as well as to replacement of old equipment. Tariffs on heat and power energy are set by government and their increase has big social resonance. Therefore three possible variants of search of financing sources are considered: liberalization of tariffs on heat power energy, governmental support of heat power engineering branch, attracting of private investments with applying of mechanisms of governmental support. The conclusion is made about favorite developing of the three sources of financing. It is concluded that priority development of the third source of financing, involving a combination of private investments into heating delivery and creation of a favorable environment, including optimization of the tariff system, in the interests of both producers and consumers of heating; the rational use of mechanisms of state support, including the ones within public-private partnerships, as well as promoting energy-saving technologies both to thermal power producers and consumers...|$|E
