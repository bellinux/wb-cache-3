Herein we report on {{the development of a new}} disposable electrochemical instrument exploiting the latest advances in printed electronics and printed biosensors. The current system is manufactured under ambient conditions with all interconnections printed; electrochemical measurements and data elaboration are realized by the integration onto the platform of two chips: a MICROCHIP-PIC 24 F 16 KA 101 and a Texas Instrument’s LMP 91000. A PEDOT. PSS vertical electrochromic display (VECD) is also incorporated into the system to visualize the data.

50|$|Future goals include {{development}} of a large data base on this diverse ethnic group, develop a <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostic</b> platform with v-sat capability to reach the rural community, improve the connectivity {{of the health care}} providers at 600 districts and 33,000 primary health care facility with cost effective diagnostic platform and a web-based consulting service. Diagnosis of diseases also will necessitate the need for cost effective treatment plans. Serious considerations will be given to develop a total integrative health management so that it will cover the largest section of the society. One example of simplification that we are contemplating is to develop capability to do all the blood chemistry on a cell phone like platform, so that data could be obtained with a drop of blood, stored and transmitted to a web based consulting platform or to a personal physician for further interpretation and advise. Similarly we could also include on such a mobile platform diagnostic capability to monitor pulse flow of the blood in regional vascular beds or to monitor the heart rate, EKG (ECG) blood oxygen and various other parameters. By exploring these avenues {{we will be able to}} bring the clinic to the individual instead of individual going to clinic for normal risk factor detection and management.|$|E

We propose a Clinical Activity Model (CAM) to understand pervasive CDS system design and use across multiple health care spaces as patients move between critical care, recovery, and long-term home care.

40|$|Abstract Background Goose circovirus (GCV) {{presents}} an immunosuppressive problem in production of geese. The infection’s clinical symptoms include growth retardation or feathering disorders but the infection process may remain non-symptomatic {{what makes the}} infected birds more susceptible for secondary viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Diagnosis of GCV infection is made by histopathological examination, dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. However these techniques require application of thermocyclers and qualified staff which may be cost-consuming for some diagnostic units. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) as a simple method of GCV detection. Results The presented study has shown LAMP as a rapid tool of detecting DNA of goose circovirus (GCV) as soon in 30 min time. The method used three sets of primers: two outer primers (F 3 and B 3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP) and two loop primers (FL and BL) to accelerate the reaction. The optimum reaction temperature and the time were 61 °C for 30 min, respectively. The results were analysed using SYBR Green dye and GelRedTM solutions. Thirty-eight isolates of GCV collected from geese flocks in Poland were examined. For comparison, real-time polymerase chain reaction with F 3 and B 3 primers and SYBR Green dye was conducted. The obtained results have shown GCV-LAMP as a sensitive, rapid and specific assay and alternative for PCR-based methods. Conclusions The developed technique due to its simplicity may be applied by any veterinary laboratory or even <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostics</b> units for the routine detection of GCV. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microscopy {{for medical}} {{diagnostics}} requires expensive equip-ment {{as well as}} highly trained experts to operate and interpret the ob-served images. We present a new, easy to use, <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system consisting of a direct imaging microlens array and a mobile computing platform for diagnosing parasites in clinical samples. Firstly, the captured microlens images are reconstructed using a light field rendering method. Then, OpenCL accelerated classification utilizing local binary pattern features is performed. A speedup of factor 4. 6 was achieved for the mo-bile computing platform CPU (AMD C- 50) compared with the GPU (AMD 6250). The results show that a relatively inexpensive system {{can be used for}} automatically detecting eggs of the Schistosoma parasite. Furthermore, the system can be also used to diagnose other parasites and thinlayer microarray samples containing stained tumor cells. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Accessibility of {{audiometry}} is {{hindered by}} {{the cost of}} sound booths and shortage of hearing health personnel. This study investigated the validity of an automated <b>mobile</b> <b>diagnostic</b> audiometer with increased attenuation and real-time noise monitoring for clinical testing outside a sound booth. DESIGN : Attenuation characteristics and reference ambient noise levels for the computer-based audiometer (KUDUwave) was evaluated alongside the validity of environmental noise monitoring. Clinical validity was determined by comparing air and bone conduction thresholds obtained {{inside and outside the}} sound booth (23 subjects). Test-retest reliability was established for a sub-group of 11 subjects. RESULTS : Improved passive attenuation and valid environmental noise monitoring was demonstrated. Clinically, air conduction thresholds inside and outside the sound booth, corresponded within 5 dB or less > 90 % of instances (mean absolute difference 3. 3 ± 3. 2 SD). Bone conduction thresholds corresponded within 5 dB or less in 80 % of comparisons between test environments, with a mean absolute difference of 4. 6 dB (3. 7 SD). Threshold differences were not statistically significant. Mean absolute testretest differences outside the sound booth was similar to those in the booth. CONCLUSION : Diagnostic pure tone audiometry outside a sound booth using automated testing, improved passive attenuation, and real-time environmental noise monitoring demonstrated reliable hearing assessments.

50|$|NETRA is a <b>mobile</b> eye <b>diagnostic</b> device {{developed}} at MIT Media Lab {{consisting of a}} clip-on eyepiece and a software app for smart phones. The co-inventors include Ramesh Raskar and Vitor Pamplona. It {{can be seen as}} the inverse of expensive Shack-Hartmann sensors. NETRA allows for the early, low-cost diagnosis of the most common refractive Refractive Disorders. The subject looks into the device and aligns patterns on the display. By repeating this procedure for eight meridians, the required refractive correction is computed. NETRA exploits the fact that aberrations are expressed using only a few parameters (Spherical, Cylindrical and Axis of Astigmatism) to create an easier user interaction approach. Leveraging mobile connectivity, the system can transmit test data to appropriate facilities for immediate action, aggregate data for use in analysis, or instruct a separate machine for automatic dispensing of spectacles.|$|R
