50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Stromberg-Carlson also {{produced}} the SC4020, a computer-controlled film recorder used chiefly for COM (Computer Output Microfilm) applications. The SC4020 could output graphics and text either to 16mm microfilm or hardcopy (using chemically-developed light-sensitive paper) utilizing a Charactron CRT {{as the heart}} of the recorder (with the <b>microfilm</b> <b>camera</b> pointed directly at the face of the Charactron inside a light-proof column inside the 4020). Some 4020s were fitted with a 16mm motion picture camera instead of the stock <b>microfilm</b> <b>camera,</b> in order to create some of the first computer-generated animation.|$|E
50|$|The {{very nature}} of <b>microfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> and the high {{contrast}} properties of microfilm stock itself also impose limits {{on the amount of}} detail that can be resolved particularly at the higher reduction ratios (36x or greater) needed to film larger drawings. Faded drawings or those of low or uneven contrast do not reproduce well and significant detail or annotations may be lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} used {{would have been}} a combination of electromechanical controls, <b>microfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> and readers, all integrated into a large desk. Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will. A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails.|$|R
40|$|After {{researching the}} current applications, problems, and {{evaluation}} techniques of planetary microfilming systems, the authors designed and constructed a standard Planetary <b>Microfilming</b> <b>camera</b> Target Array (PMTA) that essentially satisfied three criteria, i. e. 1) inexpensive to produce, 2) simple to use, and 3) satisfies testing criteria for both microfilming equipment manufacture and user. Ten evaluation parameters were incorporated in two targets PMTA-I and PMTA-II. PMTA-I includes tests for 1) resolution, 2) readability of printed matter, 3) reduction ratio, 4) exposure and processing, 5) full field visual distortion, and finally 6) corner visual distortion. PMTA-II {{was designed to}} evaluate, 7) quatitative distortion, 8) continous tone, 9) evenness of illumination, and 10) alignment of microfilming system...|$|R

Equipped with false employment records and a tiny <b>microfilm</b> <b>camera</b> disguised as a cigarette lighter, he tells everyone—including girlfriend Rita McKelvey (Marjorie Lord), a reporter for a rival newspaper—that he is going on a fishing trip, but actually heads for Cloverdale Prison Farm in the deep south, scene of recent incidents which left three inmates dead.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Licensed Betting Offices in the UK began using microphotography {{as a means}} of keeping compact records of bets taken. Betting shop {{customers}} would sometimes attempt to amend their betting slip receipt to attempt fraud, and so the microphotography camera (which also generally contained its own independent time-piece) found use as a definitive means of recording the exact details of each and every bet taken. The use of microphotography has now largely been replaced by digital 'bet capture' systems, which also allow a computer to settle the returns for each bet once the details of the wager have been 'translated' into the system by an employee. The added efficiency of this digital system has ensured that there are now very few, if indeed any, betting offices continuing to use <b>microfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> in the UK.|$|R

50|$|In July 1968 Queensland State Archives was {{relocated}} to a purpose-built facility in Dutton Park. Conservation was accorded a new {{emphasis in the}} Dutton Park building, with fumigation chambers installed to deal with pest and mould infestation. Stricter environmental controls were placed upon the storage of the records. There {{was an increase in}} the number and complexity of reference enquiries and new reprography services were introduced. A <b>microfilm</b> <b>camera</b> was purchased in 1971 and a microfilm storage vault was built. The use of microfilm provided access to heavily used records while preserving the original documents. Space was again an issue by 1974 and in 1978 a building at West End in Brisbane was acquired for use as remote storage. A new building was proposed and a site selected at Runcorn.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the administration of rural relief in Saskatchewan during the period when the Saskatchewan Relief Commission existed, 1931 to 1934. It is a study which first attempts to place the Saskatchewan Relief Commission within a historical and constitutional framework. The first chapters examine the first three decades of Canadian history, noting in particular Canada's prosperity and growth, both of which depended,in large measure, upon world markets for natural products and staple commodities. These chapters also attempt to delineate some of the more glaring constitutional anomalies, especially as these touched upon Federal-Provincial financial relations. The study notes that the Depression showed not only the vulnerability of the Canadian economy, but also the difficulties inherent within the Federal-Provincial relations. While the Federal Government watched helplessly as world markets closed to Canadian products and prices dropped, it continued to insist upon the provincial and municipal responsibility for the growing unemployment and relief problems. Soon these problems became so immense that the lower levels of government could not handle them, and it became necessary for the Federal Government to corne to their aid. Thus began the complicated and cumbersome fiscal transfers from Ottawa to the various provinces. Of all the Canadian provinces, Saskatchewan probably suffered the most during the Depression. The disastrous combination of economic depression and adverse growing conditions of the 1930 's wrought their greatest havoc in this province, especially amongst the rural population. To {{meet the needs of the}} rural destitute, the Provincial Government established the Saskatchewan Relief Commission which orchestrated the immense task of providing direct relief (food, fuel, clothing and shelter), and agricultural relief (seed, feed and fodder, fuel and lubricants, etc.) to destitute farmers and their families. In addition, the Saskatchewan Relief Commission, for a time, assumed responsibility for the destitute residents of the villages and towns located in the driest parts of the province, and, for one year, was involved in the program to relieve the distress of single, homeless, unemployed persons. The main body of the thesis focuses on the operations of the Saskatchewan Relief Commission as it contended not only with unprecedented needs which obtained in rural Saskatchewan, but also with the awkward constitutional and financial relationships which existed between all three levels of government. After examining, in considerable detail, the activities of the Saskatchewan Relief Commission in its distribution of direct relief, in its guidance of a program of agricultural relief, in its attempts to meet the needs of those who moved to northern sections of the province in orderto escape the drought of the southern areas and in its implementation of a medical relief program, the study concludes that the Relief Commission's handling of these facets of rural relief was quite exemplary, given the immensity of the task and the limitations imposed upon the Relief Commission by the two senior levels of government. After {{an examination of}} the Saskatchewan Relief Commission's involvement in schemes to care for the province's single, homeless unemployed, the study concludes that the Relief Commission failed to provide adequate care and supervision for this class of indigent. As. the study notes, this aspect of the Saskatchewan Relief Commission's administration of relief was the unfortunate exception to its other activities. At this point some reference should be made to sources. On the issue just raised, the author is aware that the full story has not been told. If other sources were examined, e. g. material in the National Archives, perhaps they would qualify significantly this writer's conclusion about the Relief Commission's role in the plight of single, unemployed persons. Without douht, the most valuable source for this study has been the records of the Relief Commission itself, in particular, its own files (which are quite voluminous), as well as the minutes of the proceedings of the meetings of the Commissioners. The economical measures of the Depression seem to have dictated that even carbon paper and typewriter ribbon usedin Government departments and in the Relief Commission be replaced only when absolutely necessary. Hence, much of the material is very difficult to read. This, combined with a second-rate <b>microfilming</b> <b>camera,</b> made much of the research slow and arduous. Next in importance has been the Relief Records of those Government departments which had close and on-going relationships with the Saskatchewan Relief Commission. The relief files of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Treasury and Municipal Affairs were the most important in this regard. Although the Western Producer (Saskatoon), and the Leader Post (Regina), appear in few footnote citations, they did provide the writer with a way "into" the decade and gave insights into the prevailing atmosphere, concerns and frustrations of the day. A survey of a small town newspaper, The Goose Lake Herald (Harris, Saskatchewan), produced nothing of value for this study. Ministerial papers, annual reports of Government departments, annual reports and other files of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities and of the United Farmers of Canada made a minor contribution to this project. The Minutes of the Council proceedings of the two rural municipalities; Willow Bunch, Number 42 and Marriott, Number 317, and the correspondence of the latter, did not fulfil the writer's expectations, and failed to give any clear picture of the administration of rural relief at the municipal level. Any such picture emerged from the files of the Relief Commission itself and the Department of Municipal Affairs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which the use of {{microfilm}} served as a precursor to later computerized information systems in business, education, and science. This accessible and inexpensive photographic technology allowed scientists, scholars, and others to experiment with ideas for information storage and retrieval that were not ultimately realized until the 1990 s. In 1926, George McCarthy, vice president of a New York bank, invented a rotary <b>microfilm</b> <b>camera</b> for copying bank checks automatically. This camera paved the way for the microfilm industry to record large volumes of documents very rapidly. Microfilm was quickly adopted by banks in the 1930 s and by other businesses, industries, and government agencies. Libraries, eager to expand access to resources required by a burgeoning research community, also adopted microfilm. Although academic enthusiasts predicted that microfilm would revolutionize scholarship, the limitations of reading machinery precluded an unmitigated success. Users in academia, business, technology, and science also sought to improve on {{the ways in}} which data could be retrieved from microfilm. This paper discusses three specific attempts to overcome output limitations: the struggle for good reading machines; the pursuit of more standardized and sortable formats, i. e., microcards and aperture cards; and finally the use of microfilm as an expendable element in new computerized information systems...|$|E
