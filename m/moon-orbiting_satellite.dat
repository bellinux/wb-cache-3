In light of presently considered lunar missions, we propose radio measurements from a <b>Moon-orbiting</b> <b>satellite.</b> First systematic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the detectability of Askaryan pulses from neutrinos with energies above 10 ^{ 20 } eV, i. e. near and above the interesting GZK limit, at the very low fluxes predicted in different scenarios.

40|$|Abstract: The Earthâ€™s Moon {{provides}} the largest potential detection volume {{for the study}} of the highest-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. When one of these particles interacts at or beneath the lunar surface, the Askaryan Effect is expected to produce an intense pulse of coherent radio emission in a burst lasting of the order of a few nanoseconds. In order be detected by an Earth-based radio telescope or a <b>Moon-orbiting</b> <b>satellite,</b> the pulse must propagate through the rough lunar surface. In this contribution, the first simulation of the effects of small-scale lunar surface roughness is presented. A facet model is used to replicate the lunar surface, using data from lunar orbiters and ground-based radar. The radio-emission from particle tracks located beneath the surface is then propagated through the facets using the equations of Stratton and Chu, while keeping track of the full phase and polarisation information. The resulting transmitted radiation is presented, demonstrating that while small-scale roughness greatly affects the radiation pattern on an event-by-event basis, the effect on the average detection probability will likely be small...|$|E
