40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> (Chrysomelidae) {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse {{families}} of herbivorous insects. Many of them are important agricultural pests and cause remarkable loss of crop and money as well. Plant leaves and roots are primary food source of both larva and adults of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Plants produce many secondary metabolites in reaction to herbivore insects. It is a well-known phenomenon that quantity and variety of secondary metabolites in plant leaves may change in response to insect attacks. Herbivore insects have to deal with such defensive secondary chemicals and overcome either by detoxifying or storing them. Accordingly, many specialist herbivores coevolved with their host plant. Certain phenolic glycosides may reduce <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding. Condensed tannins are anti-herbivore defenses against <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>beetles,</b> including <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Flavonoid compounds are feeding deterrents for many flea <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Cinnamic acid derivatives are other known feeding deterrents for <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Secondary metabolites quantity and nutritional quality of host plants are not only important for feeding but also for providing enemy-free space and suitable oviposition sites. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cross-resistance, and {{longevity}} of resistance, {{induced by the}} bean <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerotoma trifurcata, was studied IN the soybean PI 227687 that exhibited induced response in earlier studies. Bean <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> adults and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens, larvae were used to induce resistance and to determine beetle feeding preference. Beetles were collected from soybean fields 2 to 5 days prior to the feeding preference test.
