25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family at a time like this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> – no one.|$|E

My diaphragm function, the way <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
500|$|The siege {{settled down}} into a routine of {{bombardment}} and counter-bombardment. This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December {{to tell him that}} [...] "many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works but I always opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, as I believe you will have an [...] of.

She said on the photograph, [...] "Having an Iconic Moment in the studio with Toby-Mozilla and S1. <b>My</b> <b>throat</b> hurts from singing, laughing and crying." [...] Gad worked with Madonna on fourteen songs, all of which appeared on the album. According to Gad, [...] "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics to say things as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. [...] This was Steele's {{first film}} since her {{break-through}} horror performance in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960). [...] The actress recalled {{that she was}} [...] "in awe" [...] of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: [...] "Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one take…He really went at me and I had the bruises on <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> to prove it. [...] Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me—a perfect gentleman—a truly kind figure {{in spite of his}} image." [...] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's [...] "thick working class English accent" [...] was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.|$|E
500|$|As Morrison began live {{performances}} of the 40-year-old album Astral Weeks in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as [...] "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive". Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: [...] "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth – softer on the diction – but none the less impressively powerful." [...] Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: [...] "The approach now is to sing from lower down [...] so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly." ...|$|E

500|$|Maria was in poor health, and {{the couple}} moved to Philadelphia shortly after their marriage, {{thinking}} that her lungs could heal there. In Philadelphia, he became {{a contributing editor for}} the Pennsylvania Freeman, an abolitionist newspaper. In the spring of 1845, the Lowells returned to Cambridge to make their home at Elmwood. They had four children, though only one (Mabel, born 1847) survived past infancy. Blanche was born December 31, 1845, but lived only fifteen months; Rose, born in 1849, survived only a few months as well; their only son Walter was born in 1850 but died in 1852. Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children. His grief over the death of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem [...] "" [...] (1847). He again considered suicide, writing to a friend that he thought [...] "of my razors and <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and that I am a fool and a coward not to end it all at once".|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E

According to Gad, [...] "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics to say things as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." [...] For the track, she initially asked American rapper Jay Z to be featured on with verses about icons, however he called American rapper Chance the Rapper and said {{that it would be better}} if somebody that was a new person and that he thought that could be a new icon got on the record. Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.|$|E

Hore, who had been suffering from malaria, had become ill by this time and command had effectively passed to an Australian, Major Walter Tunbridge from the Queensland Mounted Infantry. In order to demonstrate the respect with which he held the defence that the garrison had put up, de la Rey offered them safe passage to British lines and was even prepared to allow the officers to retain their revolvers so that they could leave the battlefield with dignity. Once again, however, the offer was rejected, and Hore is reputed to have stated: [...] "I cannot surrender. I am in command of Australians who would cut <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> if I did."

In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. [...] "I was doing sit-ups when I felt something pop in my neck. I reached down and I felt a small lump at the base of <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it." [...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy.
