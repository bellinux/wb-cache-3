5|$|Athletes {{train for}} each level on a {{seasonal}} schedule {{designed for the}} targeted events: marathon or mid-distance. Additional aspects of training address aerobic (low-intensity) exercise—especially for endurance—and strength to improve joint flexibility and to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> injury. Cross-country ski training occurs throughout the year, including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski-specific muscle fitness.|$|E

In the {{aftermath}} of Enron, he co-sponsored (with Barbara Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the contemporaneous movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts for Social Security.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression.

Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs {{that have not been}} approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E

5|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible {{but very}} peppery. The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only {{using it to}} add flavour to other mushrooms. It {{has been used as}} a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> gastric symptoms; the peppery taste is lost with cooking. In powdered form, it loses its peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify C.piperatus as inedible. Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing; depending on the mordant used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> initial failure.|$|E
5|$|On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused {{extensive}} {{destruction in}} the borough, ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages {{for hundreds of}} thousands of city residents and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
