5|$|The inner <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> is {{compartmentalized}} into numerous cristae, which {{expand the}} surface area of the inner <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria {{have their}} own genetic material, and the {{machinery}} to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins (see: protein biosynthesis). A published human mitochondrial DNA sequence revealed 16,569base pairs encoding 37 genes: 22tRNA, 2 rRNA, and 13peptide genes. The 13 mitochondrial peptides in humans are integrated into the inner <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> along with proteins encoded by genes that reside in the host cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> potential required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors support this model; for example, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced efflux at the MAM and preventing collapse of the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> potential post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor suppressors includes a few that are enriched at the MAM.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondria are {{key players}} in {{fundamental}} processes such as energy production and adaptive responses to cellular stress, including apoptosis. <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> may undergo permeabilization when perturbed {{by a number of}} intracellular stress mediators, and consequently may allow the release of intramitochondrial proteins. This event triggers and amplifies the cellular apoptotic program, provided sufficient energy is available. <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> are therefore both targets and regulators of intracellular pathways controlling cell fate. Evidence is emerging that the integration and biological outcome of these pathways might be critically dependent on the unique lipid composition of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Pyruvate {{molecules}} {{produced by}} glycolysis are actively transported across the inner <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> {{and into the}} matrix where they can either be oxidized and combined with coenzyme A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, or they can be carboxylated (by pyruvate carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E
5|$|The enzymes of the {{citric acid}} cycle {{are located in}} the {{mitochondrial}} matrix, with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, which is bound to the inner <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> as part of Complex II. The citric acid cycle oxidizes the acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, and, in the process, produces reduced cofactors (three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2) that are a source of electrons for the electron transport chain, and a molecule of GTP (that is readily converted to an ATP).|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E
40|$|Much of {{the action}} in the {{mammalian}} apoptotic program {{takes place at the}} mitochondrial level. Physicochemical characteristics and integrity of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> may {{play a crucial role in}} the recruitment and multimerization of pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family members, opening of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) and the release of mitochondrial components which trigger the 'intrinsic' pathways of cellular apoptosis and activate executioner caspases. Recent evidence has accumulated pointing toward the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> as the key targets for lipid and glycolipid mediators of stress-induced apoptosis. <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> may thus act as 'sensors' of cellular stress by quantitating the local accumulation of specific lipids and glycolipids. Acute accumulation of ceramides, directly or indirectly, profoundly affects mitochondrial functions. GD 3 ganglioside, a glycolipid which is actively synthesized and transiently accumulates in the early stages of apoptosis, relocates to the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> causing the opening of the PTPC and the release of apoptogenic factors. <b>Mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> appear to represent a common destination where protein and glycolipid mediators of stress converge and where crucial decisions about cellular adaptation or apoptotic cell death are taken...|$|R

5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria will be {{used for}} cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> the lipid-soluble {{electron}} carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Doxorubicin (DOX) is {{a widely}} {{prescribed}} antineoplastic and although the precise mechanism(s) {{have yet to be}} identified, DOX-induced oxidative stress to <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> is implicated in the pathogenic process. Previous attempts to protect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity with a-tocopherol (vitamin E) have met with limited success possibly as a result of inadequate delivery to relevant subcellular targets such as <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes.</b> The present investigation was designed to assess whether enrichment of cardiac membranes with a-ocopherol is sufficient to protect against DOX-induced mitochondrial cardiotoxicity. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received seven weekly subcutaneous injections of 2 mg/kg DOX and fed either standard diet or diet supplemented with a-tocopherol succinate. Treatment with a cumulative dose of 14 mg/kg DOX caused mitochondrial cardiomyopathy as evidenced by histology, accumulation of oxidized cardiac proteins, and a significant decrease in mitochondrial calcium loading capacity. Maintaining rats on the a-tocopherol supplemented diet resulted in a significant (two-to fourfold) enrichment of cardiac <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> with a-tocopherol and diminished the content of oxidized cardiac proteins associated with DOX treatment. However, dietary a-tocopherol succinate failed to protect against mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac histopathology. From this we conclude that although dietary vitamin E supplementation enriches cardiac <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> with a-tocopherol, either (1) this tocopherol enrichment is not sufficient to protect cardiac <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> from DOX toxicity or (2) oxidative stress alone is not responsible for the persistent mitochondrial cardiomyopathy caused by long-term DOX therapy.

40|$|After {{synthesis}} in the cytosol, most mitochondrial proteins must traverse <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> {{to reach}} their functional location. During this process, proteins become unfolded and then refold to attain their native conformation after crossing the lipid bilayers. Mitochondrial molecular chaperones play an essential mechanistic role at various steps of this process. They facilitate presequence translocation, unfolding of the cytosol-localized domains of precursor proteins, movement across the <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> and, finally, folding of newly imported proteins within the matrix. ...|$|R

5|$|The outer <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> which {{encloses}} {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Å) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E

The mechanisms underlying MEN-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death are not yet fully understood. In this work, a systematic study was performed to unveil the effects of MEN on membrane lipid organization, using models mimicking <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> and native <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes.</b> MEN was found to readily incorporate in membrane systems composed of a single phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) or the lipids dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and tetraoleoylcardiolipin at 1 : 1 : 1 molar ratio, as well as in <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes.</b> Increased permeability in both membrane models, monitored by calcein release, seemed to correlate with the extent of MEN incorporation into membranes.

Also, quenching studies with the fluorescent probes DPH and TMA-DPH showed that MEN distributed across the bilayer thickness in both model and native <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes.</b> MEN's ability to promote alterations of membrane lipid organization was related with its reported mitochondrial toxicity and promotion of apoptosis, predictably involved in its anti-carcinogenic activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlzheimer's {{disease and}} Parkinson's disease are {{neurodegenerative}} disorders characterised by the misfolding of proteins into soluble prefibrillar aggregates. These aggregate complexes disrupt mitochondrial function, initiating a pathophysiological cascade leading to synaptic and neuronal degeneration. In order {{to explore the}} interaction of amyloid aggregates with <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes,</b> we made use of two in vitro model systems, namely: (i) lipid vesicles with defined membrane compositions that mimic those of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes,</b> and (ii) respiring mitochondria isolated from neuronal SH-SY 5 Y cells. External application of soluble prefibrillar forms, but not monomers, of amyloid-beta (Aβ 42 peptide), wild-type α-synuclein (α-syn), mutant α-syn (A 30 P and A 53 T) and tau- 441 proteins induced a robust permeabilisation of mitochondrial-like vesicles, and triggered cytochrome c release (CCR) from isolated mitochondrial organelles. Importantly, the effect on mitochondria was shown to be dependent upon cardiolipin, an anionic phospholipid unique to mitochondria and a well-known key player in mitochondrial apoptosis. Pharmacological modulators of mitochondrial ion channels failed to inhibit CCR. Thus, we propose a generic mechanism of thrilling mitochondria in which soluble amyloid aggregates have the intrinsic capacity to permeabilise <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes,</b> without the need of any other protein. Finally, six small-molecule compounds and black tea extract were tested {{for their ability to}} inhibit permeation of <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> by Aβ 42, α-syn and tau aggregate complexes.
