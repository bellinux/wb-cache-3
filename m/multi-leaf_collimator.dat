50|$|Several {{centers around}} the world have used fast {{neutrons}} for treating cancer. Due to lack of funding and support, at present only three are active in the USA.The University of Washington and the Gershenson Radiation Oncology Center operate fast neutron therapy beams and both are equipped with a <b>Multi-Leaf</b> <b>Collimator</b> (MLC) to shape the neutron beam.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> (MLC) {{consists}} of two sets of 40 to 80 leaves, each around 5 mm to 10 mm thick and several centimetres {{in the other two}} dimensions. Newer MLCs now have up to 160 leaves. Each leaf in the MLC is aligned parallel to the radiation field and can be moved independently to block part of the field. This allows the dosimetrist to match the radiation field to the shape of the tumor (by adjusting the position of the leaves), thus minimizing the amount of healthy tissue being exposed to radiation. On a machine without an MLC this must be accomplished using several hand-crafted blocks.|$|E

30|$|With {{the advent}} of {{advanced}} sophisticated treatment planning software and <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> (MLC), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is becoming increasingly popular and widely used {{for the treatment of}} breast carcinoma. IMRT is thought to result in a preferred dose distribution compared to 3 DCRT after conservative surgery or mastectomy (Cozzi et al. 2005; Fong et al. 2009; Johansen et al. 2009; Vatanen et al. 2009). The IMRT allows the user to modulate the intensity of each radiation beam, so each field may have one or many areas of high intensity radiation and any number of lower intensity areas within the same field.|$|R

40|$|Background: External {{radiation}} therapy {{is one of}} the best management options available for localized prostate cancer. The higher the {{radiation therapy}} dose administered, the more likely local control will be obtained, but the radiation dose that can be given is limited by the need to restrict the frequency and severity of unwanted effects. Late side effects can permanently decrease well-being and the quality of life. The technology of 3 -dimenssional treatment planning has opened up a possibility of quantitatively analyze the relationship between radiation long-term effects, dose and the volume of irradiated tissue. Little attention has been paid to assess fecal leakage in relation to the dose given to the anal-sphincter region. Patients and Methods: A selfadministered questionnaire for assessing symptoms indicating anal sphincter, large-bowel, urinarytract and sexual dysfunction was sent to all patients with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma treated by external beam radiation in 199396 in Stockholm. Information on the external beam radiation therapy was retrieved from hospital records. The dose-planning treatment data were restored to the treatment planning system and dosevolume histograms of the analsphincter region and rectum were produced. Long-term effects on anal sphincter and large-bowel function were investigated. Results: Of all the 158 available patients, 145 (92 %) answered and returned the questionnaire. Defecation-urgency was reported by 28 % (8 / 29) of the patients irradiated using 4 fields with a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> and 20 percent (8 / 40) of the patients treated using 3 fields (one AP, two lateral) without <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator.</b> Seven out of 29 patients (24 %) treated with 4 -field reported diarrhea or loose stools. None of the patients treated with 3 fields (one AP, two oblique) with a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> reported this symptom. A statistically significant correlation was obtained between DVHs of the anal-sphincter region and risk of fecal leakage at intermediate dose (45 - 55 Gy). None of patients who received a dose of 35 Gy or more or 40 Gy or more to, at the most, 60 or 40 percent, respectively, of the anal-sphincter region volume reported fecal leakage. There was a statistically significant correlation between DVHs of the rectum and the risk of defecation-urgency and diarrhea in the dose interval 25 - 42 Gy. Preserved erectile function at 9 - 18 months was found in 17 of the 31 men (55 %) and at the 4 to 5 -year follow-up in five of 22 (23 %). Conclusions: Among patients irradiated with a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator,</b> defecation-urgency, diarrhea and loose stools were more common after four fields than after three, but fecal leakage necessitating the use of pads and distress from the gastrointestinal tract were less common. Three fields (one AP and two lateral) without a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> entailed a higher risk of defecation-urgency than three fields (one AP and two oblique) with a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator.</b> Among bowel symptoms, the strongest association with gastrointestinal distress was found for fecal leakage. Careful monitoring of unwanted radiation to the analsphincter region as well as rectum may reduce the risk of fecal leakage, blood and phlegm in stools, defection-urgency, and diarrhea; it is probably possible to define a threshold for a by and large harmless dose (in terms of induced dysfunction) to the anal sphincter region (35 Gy or more to, at the most, 60 % or 40 Gy or more to, at the most, 40 % of the anal sphincter region?) ...|$|E

An accurate, efficient method of describing and sampling radiation sources is needed, and a simple, flexible solution is provided. The teletherapy source package for PEREGRINE, coupled with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations of treatment heads, {{makes it possible to}} describe any teletherapy photon beam to the precision needed for highly accurate Monte Carlo dose calculations in complex clinical configurations that use standard patient modifiers such as collimator jaws, wedges, blocks, and/or <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators.</b> Generic beam descriptions for a class of treatment machines can readily be adjusted to yield dose calculation to match specific clinical sites...|$|R
40|$|Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is an innovative, {{three-dimensional}} conformal {{radiation treatment}} that can deliver highly focused and precisely shaped radiation to a tumor site {{through the use}} of the <b>Multi-Leaf</b> <b>Collimators</b> (MLC). A crucial step in IMRT procedure is the verification of MLC positioning to assure the accuracy of radiation treatment delivery. In this paper, we have developed an automated image based method for MLC positioning verification using images acquired from an Electronic Portable Imaging Device. The method consists of three major steps: 1) non-linear geometric distortion correction, 2) isocenter estimation, and 3) MLC leaf boundary recovery. Preliminary experiment on real image data shows that the proposed method is both fast and robust to image artifacts such as intensity inhomogeneity and noise, making it a promising approach for replacing manual verification of MLC in the IMRT treatment...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a new}} {{technique}} in IMRT and 3 D conformal gamma radiation dose delivery using a linear accelerator with no flattening filter. The technique improves patient radiation therapy by reducing radiation scattered to surrounding normal tissue and reducing electron contamination. It increases dose rate to shorten treatment time. Linear accelerators have for decades come with a photon flattening filter to make the photon profile of planar fluence to make the dose distribution more uniform. These filters, however, resulted in fluence attenuation and contamination of the beam. Now {{in the age of}} techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) the function of the flattening filter becomes redundant. The flattening filter now merely reduces the efficiency of the beam by reducing the fluence and increasing scattered radiation. Our technique involves removal of the flattening filter for complex treatments. It uses inverse planning along with <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> to shape the dose distribution...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the following problem: to decompose a nonnegative integer matrix into a linear combination of binary matrices that respect the consecutive ones prop- erty. This problem occurs in the radiotherapy treatment of cancer. The nonnegative integer matrix corresponds to fields giving the different radiation beams that a linear accelerator has to send throughout {{the body of a}} patient. Due to the in- homogeneous dose levels, leaves from a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> are used between the accelerator and the body of the patient to block the radiations. The leaves positions can be represented by segments, that are binary matrices with the consecutive ones property. The aim is to find efficient decompositions that simultaneously minimize the irradiation time, the cardinality of the decomposition and the setup-time to configure the <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> at each step of the decomposition. We propose for this NP-hard multiobjective combinatorial problem a heuristic, based on the adaptation of the two-phase Pareto local search. Experiments are carried out on different size instances and the results are reported...|$|E

Eleven plan variations were created with systematic errors introduced: <b>Multi-Leaf</b> <b>Collimator</b> (MLC) positional errors with all leaf pairs shifted {{in the same}} or the opposite direction, and collimator rotation offsets. Plans were measured using an Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) and an ionisation chamber array. The plans were evaluated using gamma analysis with different criteria. The gamma pass rates remained around 95 % or higher for most cases with MLC positional errors of 1 mm and 2 mm with 3 %/ 3 mm criteria.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Use {{of solid}} compensators {{is a very}} {{effective}} means of implementing IMRT on any linear accelerator. The standard practice has been IMRT delivery using accelerators equipped with <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> (MLC’s). Truth is the addition of MLC’s to an accelerator is quite expensive. Previous studies have shown solid compensators to have better dose conformance, easier implementation, and more cost effective than MLC IMRT. On the other hand, the addition of these commercially available brass compensators changes the beam characteristics {{and needs to be}} taken into account. The treatment planning system must be modeled to represent the dose accordingly. Many previous data suggest a 5 % dose agreement to be acceptable for treatment. With sufficient study of the beam characteristics of the compensated beam and proper modeling of the treatment planning system one should achieve greater dose agreement. This study will attempt to develop a more accurate method of implementing solid IMRT compensators for use with the ADAC pinnacle by extensive beam analysis and computer modeling...|$|R

The computer aided design interface of Geant 4 was used to accurately model the LINAC components, including the Millenium <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> (MLCs). The simulation tool was verified via simulation of standard commissioning dosimetry data acquired with an ionisation chamber in a water phantom. Verification of the MLC model was achieved by simulation of leaf leakage measurements performed using GafchromicTM film in a solid water phantom. An absolute dose calibration capability was added by including a virtual monitor chamber into the simulation. Furthermore, a DICOM-RT interface was integrated with the application to allow the simulation of treatment plans in radiotherapy.

40|$|Background: In Radiation Therapy, the sparing {{of normal}} tissues can be {{performed}} using either <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> or Cerrobend blocks. The current work focuses on the physical characteristics of Cerrobend blocks including attenuation coefficient, effective penumbra width and isodose curves undulation in penumbral regions. Materials and Methods: All measurements were performed using a dual energy linac and the Cerrobend blocks designed and fabricated using a commercial Cerrobend material. Data were collected using a calibrated ionization chamber as well as EDR 2 films. Results: The {{results showed that the}} attenuation coefficient was found to be 0. 4475 and 0. 4276 cm- 1 for photon beams 6 MV and 15 MV, respectively, and a potential air bubble with a diameter greater than 3 mm affects beam attenuation significantly. The optimum Cerrobend block width was found to be around 16 mm. The isodose curves scalloping achieved for secondary collimator jaws, were also similar. Conclusion: If Cerrobend blocks are used as a basic method to protect normal tissues, its physical characteristics will be recommended {{to be taken into account}} comprehensively. A. Taherkhani, M.

40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used treatment modalities for cancer. Its purpose is to deliver prescribed radiation doses to cancerous targets using high energy radiation beams while sparing nearby healthy organs. The treatment planning process of radiotherapy is an optimization problem, where beam parameters, such as directions, shapes, and intensities, can be adjusted in simulations to yield desired dose distributions. This can be applied under the recently developed volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) setup which involves the use of a full-rotation trajectory of the beam about the patient along with a <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimator</b> for beam shape sculpting, with notable advantages in shortened treatment time.

40|$|The {{verification}} {{of the treatment}} fields location on a simulator {{is one of the}} main activities within the field of radiation quality. Simulation pictures are compared with reference pictures (DRR). during the simulation. If a patients position during the simulation differs from the reference picture, the deviations are shown in individual axes. The aim of a radiotherapy assistant is to reduce the extent of those deviations to a minimum, or at least to the range of tolerance given in a tolerance table. The accuracy of the setup is an important factor in the process of quality assurance in radiotherapy. There are two methods available for the assessment of deviations on a simulator: - the method of anatomical structures comparison - the method of picture fusion In the case of the method of comparison of anatomical structures, the level of equivalence of the pictures is ascertained by using the <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> lamellas or the degree scale shown in the picture.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{outcomes of}} {{many forms of}} breast cancer have become very favorable. The usual standard of successful treatment of five years without a recurrence is not adequate any longer for breast cancer. Many patients live well beyond this time interval only {{to have a second}} malignancy develop in the contralateral breast ten or twenty years later. Boice et al (1992) found that there was a correlation between the amount of dose to the contralateral breast and the likelihood of a secondary malignancy forming. The normal practice today is to use <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> (MLC) to modulate the photon beam in radiation therapy. Due to the limited use of physical compensators, very little data has been presented as to their effectiveness in reducing dose to the contralateral breast. This study will use a Varian 2100 C/D linear accelerator to irradiate a Rando phantom with simulated breast material using both the traditional method and the compensator method. The dose to the contralateral breast will be measured using MOSFETs at various depths in the tissue. The results suggest that the compensators do not reduce the dose to the contralateral breast as effectively as the MLC method. There were a few instances for specific cases where the compensator performed better and these cases require further study for verification and clarity...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{collects}} {{a series}} of lectures presented at the tenth ESI School held at Archamps (FR) in November 2007 and dedicated to radiotherapy and brachytherapy. The lectures focus on the multiple facets of radiotherapy in general, including external radiotherapy (often called teletherapy) as well as internal radiotherapy (called brachytherapy). Radiotherapy strategy and dose management {{as well as the}} decisive role of digital imaging in the associated clinical practice are developed in several articles. Grouped under the discipline of Conformal Radiotherapy (CRT), numerous modern techniques, from <b>Multi-Leaf</b> <b>Collimators</b> (MLC) to Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy (IMRT), are explained in detail. The importance of treatment planning based upon patient data from digital imaging (Computed Tomography) is also underlined. Finally, despite the quasi- totality of patients being presently treated with gamma and X-rays, novel powerful tools are emerging using proton and light ions (like carbon ions) beams, bound to become more and more important in patient treatment. These technological developments, going under the comprehensive name of "Hadrontherapy", are presented here with special focus on the rational and state of the art of the field.

40|$|A new {{delivery}} {{option for}} cancer centers equipped with linear accelerators fitted with <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> (MLC) [...] i. e. centers which can perform intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) [...] is rotational delivery. In rotational delivery, the beam is on while the gantry is rotating and the MLC leaves are moving, thus treating the patient more efficiently (regarding time) than in IMRT. A consideration {{that should be}} examined when evaluating this new type of delivery method is the tradeoff between treatment plan quality and delivery time: what do we sacrifice in terms of plan quality by guaranteeing a 2 minute delivery, for example? In this paper we examine this question by studying a simplified 2 D phantom where leaf and gantry motion are directly included in the optimization model. We formulate the model as a linear mixed integer program. Because of the difficulty in solving to optimality, we employ additional models which allow us to trap the true optimal solution between upper and lower bounds. The lower bound solutions reveal which beam directions are most useful for treatment (i. e. where the gantry should slow down), and this information is used to produce deliverable solutions close to the lower bound solutions. For the phantom cases studied, we show that when time is not an issue, IMRT solutions are optimal, but when allowable treatment time is constrained sufficiently, rotational delivery is the preferred choice...|$|R
40|$|A {{geometric}} {{solution of the}} problem of optimal orientation of beams in conformal external radiotherapy is presented. The method uses geometric derived quantities which consider the intersection volume between organs at risk (OAR) and the beam shape. In comparison to previous geometric methods a true 3 D volume computation is used which takes into account beam divergence, concave shapes, as well as treatment settings such as individual beam shaping by blocks or <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators.</b> For standard dosimetric cost functions used by dose optimization algorithms a corresponding set of geometric objective functions is proposed. We compare the correlations between geometric and dosimetric cost functions for two clinical cases, a prostate and a head tumour case. A correlation is observed for the prostate case, whereas for the head case it is less pronounced due to the larger part of overlapping volumes between the beams which cannot be considered by the used objectives. In comparison to not-optimized beam directions the dose distribution is significantly better for the beam directions found by the optimization of a geometric multi-objective cost function. An optimal dose distribution can easily be achieved using the geometric model. This is shown by comparing for the two cases the dose-volume histograms (DVH) of manually optimized plans by experienced planners and the DVHs of the geometrically found optimal solutions. In comparison to the manually optimized plans the solutions found by the geometric method significantly reduce the average dose in the OARs and NT, while maintaining the same PTV coverage...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the first}} steps towards the {{development}} of a comprehensive quality program for radiation oncology in Australia has been a survey of practice. This paper reports on the results of the survey that should inform the development of standards for radiation oncology in Australia. A questionnaire of 108 questions spanning aspects of treatment services, equipment, staff, infrastructure and available quality systems was mailed to all facilities providing radiation treatment services in Australia (n = 45). Information of 42 sites was received by June 2006 providing data on 113 operational linear accelerators of which approximately 2 / 3 are equipped with <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators.</b> More than 75 % of facilities were participating in a formal quality assurance (QA) system, with 63 % following a nationally or internationally recognised system. However, there was considerable variation in the availability of policies and procedures specific to quality aspects, and the review of these. Policies for monitoring patient waiting times for treatment were documented at just 71 % of all facilities. Although 85 % of all centres do, in fact, monitor machine throughput, the number and types of efficiency measures varied markedly, thereby limiting the comparative use of these results. Centres identified workload as the single most common factor responsible for limiting staff involvement in both QA processes and clinical trial participation. The data collected in this ‘snapshot’ survey provide a unique and comprehensive baseline for future comparisons and evaluation of changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Treatment {{planning}} in radiosurgery and radiation therapy involves {{a large number}} of medical and technical constraints. The main technical constraints stem from the gantry kinematics and the type of collimator available. The gantry kinematics (i. e. number and spatial arrangement of movable joint axes) determines the type of motion which can be performed by the therapeutic beam. The collimator determines the shape of the beam. We describe a new method for treatment planning which relies on a hardwareindependent intermediate treatment plan. This abstract plan is computed as an inverse plan, namely a plan, for which it can be decided via complete methods whether the given constraints can be satis ed. The intermediate plan {{does not take into account}} speci c hardware requirements. Instead, we show that the plan computed for this intermediate layer can be resolved into executable plans for common systems. In particular, it is shown how the generated intermediate plans can be resolved into minimal-time plans for both jaw <b>collimator</b> systems and <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators.</b> Interestingly, this computation of minimum time paths is possible in a complete way based on the Gilmore-Gomory algorithm. Here (low) polynomial computing time can be achieved, which is not possible for the original application of the Gilmore-Gomory algorithm. The described planning method allows for transparent and uniform inverse planning. Completeness properties with respect to satis ability of medical constraints and minimum-time paths are a further bene t of this new method...|$|R
40|$|Background: One of the {{standard}} equipment in medical linear accelerators is <b>multi-leaf</b> <b>collimators</b> (MLCs); which {{is used as a}} replacement for lead shielding. MLC's advantages are a reduction of the treatment time, the simplicity of treatment, and better dose distribution. The main disadvantage of MLC is the radiation leakages from the edges and between the leaves. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of various treatment parameters in the magnitude of MLC leakage in linear accelerators. Materials and Methods: This project was performed with ONCOR Siemens linear accelerators. The amount of radiation leakage was determined by film dosimetry method. The films were Kodak-extended dose range- 2, and the beams were 6 MV and 18 MV photons. In another part of the experiment, the fluctuation of the leakage was measured at various depths and fields. Results: The amount of leakage was generally up to 1. 5 ± 0. 2 % for both energies. The results showed that the level of the leakage and the amount of dose fluctuation depends on the field size and depth of measurement. The amount of the leakage fluctuations in all energies was decreased with increasing of field size. The variation of the leakage versus field size was similar to the inverse of scattering collimator factor. Conclusions: The amount of leakage was more for 18 MV compare to 6 MV The percentage of the leakage for both energies is less than the 5 % value which is recommended by protocols. The fluctuation of the MLC leakage reduced by increasing the field size and depth...|$|R
