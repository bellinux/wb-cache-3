His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he dissected those species, indeed vivisecting some; he mentions the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.|$|E

Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in her earlier books, the recipes are interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of {{astronomy}}, optical or visible-light astronomy {{extends from}} approximately 400 to 700 nm. Positioning an optical telescope in space {{means that the}} telescope does not see any atmospheric effects (see astronomical seeing), providing higher resolution images.

Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

25|$|The message I {{would give}} to Aikidoka {{in general is}} that what we see today is not, in my humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder.

25|$|Leno Prestini {{had shown}} artistic talent {{from an early}} age. By 1931 he was the company's chief modeler, {{creating}} distinctive architectural ornaments (which can still be seen on many buildings around the Pacific Northwest) and designing decorative tiles, which were marketed under the 'WACO' trade name. He had also developed a reputation as an eccentric and adventurous character, filling his free time with, among <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> mountain climbing and exploring the bottoms of local lakes in a homemade diving suit.|$|E

25|$|Navier–Stokes {{equations}} {{are useful}} because they describe {{the physics of}} many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They {{may be used to}} model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> Coupled with Maxwell's equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Many female deities {{representing}} {{love and}} fertility {{were associated with}} breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte were represented as pillars studded with breasts. Isis, an Egyptian goddess who represented, among <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling pharaohs, thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god Hapy who {{was considered to be}} responsible for the annual overflowing of the Nile.|$|E
25|$|Airway, breathing, and circulation, {{therefore}} {{work in a}} cascade; if the patient's airway is blocked, breathing {{will not}} be possible, and oxygen cannot reach the lungs and be transported around {{the body in the}} blood, which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.|$|E

25|$|TCM's view of {{the body}} places little {{emphasis}} on anatomical structures, but is mainly concerned with the identification of functional entities (which regulate digestion, breathing, aging etc.). While health is perceived as the harmonious interaction of these entities and the outside world, disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interaction. TCM diagnosis aims to trace symptoms to patterns of an underlying disharmony, by measuring the pulse, inspecting the tongue, skin, and eyes, {{and looking at the}} eating and sleeping habits of the person as well as <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} a place of pilgrimage for Queen Catherine of Aragon who was a regular pilgrim. Likewise, Anne Boleyn also {{publicly}} announced an intention of making a pilgrimage but it never occurred. Its wealth and prestige did not, however, prevent its being a disorderly house. The visitation of Bishop Nicke in 1514 revealed that the prior was leading a scandalous life and that, among <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> he treated the canons with insolence and brutality; the canons themselves frequented taverns and were quarrelsome. The prior, William Lowth, was removed and by 1526 some decent order had been restored.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the Church had {{the true}} faith {{for more than}} twelve hundred years, during which time the holy Fathers never once {{mentioned}} this transubstantiation — certainly, a monstrous word for a monstrous idea — until the pseudo-philosophy of Aristotle became rampant in the Church these last three hundred years. During these centuries <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> have been wrongly defined, for example, that the Divine essence neither is begotten nor begets, that the soul is the substantial form of the human body, and the like assertions, which are made without reason or sense, as the Cardinal of Cambray himself admits.|$|E

25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since {{it was only a}} few months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain for granted and has learned to live with it. Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> including a thorn in the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E
25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water after we had been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E
25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E
