Therefore the mobility of the herbicides simazine, <b>methabenzthiazuron</b> and diuron was investigated in soils under different types of land use (cultivated field, meadow, gravel track). Undisturbed lysimeters (20 cm x 40 cm) were taken from selected natural plots.

Spiked soil samples having different physico-chemical properties, and selected soil-derived matrices with diverse MBT adsorption capacity, characterized by their Freundlich equation K-f values, were used to verify the method applicability to {{a broad range of}} different soils. The spiking procedure was considered a crucial point to reproduce as closely as possible the solute - soil adsorption taking place in the natural environment. Ageing effects, where the compound could diffuse into inaccessible locations within the soil matrix in view of its great stability, were considered of particular concern. In spite of the heterogeneous physico-chemical properties of soils under study, recoveries were greater than 90 %. Performance of the MASE procedure correlated highly with the adsorption capacity of soil-derived matrices: the lowest recoveries were for illite (67 - 73 %), among the mineral surfaces, and for a humic acid (67 - 72 %), among the organic fractions.

Five free-draining lysimeters, cropped with winter wheat, barley, and oat were used to monitor actual evapotranspiration soil moisture, and drainage for 627 d. One of the five lysimeters was also treated with <b>methabenzthiazuron</b> (MBT), and soil residues as well as leaching were experimentally determined.

40|$|How can {{leaching}} risk {{be assessed}} if the chemical flux and/or the toxicity is highly uncertain? For many strongly sorbing pesticides {{it is known}} that their transport through the unsaturated zone occurs intermittently through preferential flow, triggered by significant rainfall events. In these circumstances the timing and frequency of these rainfall events may allow quantification of leaching risk to overcome the limitations of flux prediction. In this paper we analyze the leaching behavior of bromide and two herbicides, <b>methabenzthiazuron</b> and ethidimuron, using data from twelve uncropped lysimeters, with high-resolution climate data, in order to identify the rainfall controls on rapid solute leaching. A regression tree analysis suggested that a coarse-scale fortnightly to monthly water balance was a good predictor of short-term increases in drainage and bromide transport. Significant short-term herbicide leaching, however, was better predicted by the occurrence of a single storm with a depth greater than a 19 mm threshold. Sampling periods where rain events exceeded this threshold accounted for between 38 % and 56 % of the total mass of herbicides leached during the experiment. The same threshold only accounted for between 1 % and 10 % of the total mass of bromide leached. On the basis of these results, we conclude that in this system, the leaching risks of strongly sorbing chemicals can be quantified by the timing and frequency of these large rainfall events. Empirical and modeling approaches are suggested to apply this frequentist approach to leaching risk assessment to other soil-climate systems...|$|E

Extraction was optimal using a fexIKA extractor operating at 110 degrees C for three cycles (total time = 95 min) with 75 g of soil and 150 mL of a 60 : 40 v/v acetone/water mixture. Extracts were further purified on a 500 mg silica SPE cartridge.

MBT adsorption reached an apparent equilibrium within 2 h and followed a second-order reaction. The maximum adsorbed amounts for natural soils ranged from 32 to 145 mug g(- 1). Rate constants were considered relatively low (0. 27 - 1. 5 x 10 (- 4) [mug g(- 1) ](1 -n) (s- 1)); the slow process {{was attributed to}} a combined effect of diffussion and adsorption.

During this period the lysimeters were cropped with winter wheat, winter barley and oat. The models TRACE, MARTHE, ANSWERS and MACRO were applied to the lysimeter data with the scope of upscaling local scale process understanding for regional scale. MARTHE and TRACE solve the 3 -d Richards' equation for variably saturated water flow. MACRO is a 1 -d model based on the Richards' Equation and accounting for preferential flow in the unsaturated zone, while ANSWERS is a regional scale capacity based watershed model. Measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, drainage, soil temperature, pesticide residues and leaching are used for comparison with model results.

The heat flow is also well described with ANSWERS, MARTHE and MACRO. Larger deviations were found between model results and measured pesticide transport. An inadequate reproduction of the measured MBT degradation was found for the available model input parameters.

40|$|Poa trivialis is a {{perennial}} grass weed {{commonly found in}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) racetrack swards throughout New Zealand. Its presence is undesirable as it does not tolerate high wear and is susceptible to dying out over the summer. Two pot trials at Massey University and one field trial carried out at the Awapuni racecourse were conducted during winter and spring 1995 to test the relative susceptibility of Poa trivialis and perennial ryegrass {{to a wide range}} of herbicides. A bioassay was also conducted to determine whether herbicide residues from the field trial could affect the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown soon after treatment. Results showed that none of the chemicals at their chosen respective rates could completely remove Poa trivialis from a racetrack sward in the spring without some damage being caused to perennial ryegrass. Propyzamide and fenoxaprop at rates of 0. 2 and 0. 15 kg/ha respectively showed the most potential of the chemicals, severely damaging Poa trivialis (causing 50 to 75 % reductions) with no adverse effect on perennial ryegrass 8 weeks after spraying. Propyzamide can also provide some control of Poa annua. Fenoxaprop was not improved by increasing the application rate or adding an oil. The performance of fenoxaprop was substantially reduced when applied with either MCPA or a picloram/triclopyr mix. Dalapon and asulam showed good potential to control Poa trivialis but at the high rates tested caused variable or harmful effects to perennial ryegrass. Ethofumesate and chlorpropham applied at rates of 2. 0 and 2. 5 kg/ha respectively gave inadequate control of Poa trivialis. None of the above herbicides, when used in the field trial resulted in residues which reduced the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown 3 weeks after spraying. Herbicides tested in the pot trials which showed poor control of Poa trivialis were atrazine, dicamba, isoproturon/diflufenican, linuron, mecoprop, <b>methabenzthiazuron,</b> metsulfuron, pendimethalin, prometryne, thifensulfuron-methyl, triclopyr, and trinexapac-ethyl.
