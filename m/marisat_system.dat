50|$|The three {{satellites}} {{were all}} launched in 1976. MARISAT F1 was launched on 19 February 1976, MARISAT F2 was launched on 10 June 1976, and Marisat F3 was launched at 22:44 GMT, 14 October 1976. Launch {{vehicle for the}} satellites was the McDonnell Douglas 2914 Delta rocket. The satellites were launched from Cape Canaveral by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under contract with COMSAT. In 1981 the INMARSAT took over from the <b>Marisat</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{concert with}} COMSAT General Corporation's (another {{business}} unit of COMSAT Corp) <b>MARISAT</b> <b>system,</b> CMC sparked {{a revolution in}} medium- and long-distance maritime ship-to-shore communication, augmenting and eventually replacing cumbersome and technically challenging high-power radiotelegraph and radiotelephone equipment with solid state, user-friendly satellite terminals which required relatively minimal training to use in voice, fax, and telex modes that were impervious to normal radio propagation conditions and unaffected by distance, although initial rates were high ($10 per minute for voice/fax to/from the USA).|$|E
50|$|Marisat {{satellites}} {{were the}} first maritime telecommunications satellites and were designed to provide dependable telecommunications for commercial shipping and the U.S Navy from stable geosynchronous orbital locations over the three major ocean regions. The three Marisat satellites, F1, F2, and F3, were built by Hughes Aircraft Corporation (HAC) for COMSAT Corporation starting in 1973. The satellites were designed to provide maritime telecommunications services in three large ocean areas, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, and were located at 72.5° East longitude, 176.5° E, and 345° E in the geosynchronous orbital arc. The three-satellite <b>Marisat</b> <b>system</b> served as the initial INMARSAT constellation.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{communication}} satellite systems {{to provide assistance}} in disaster relief operations on a global basis is presented. Disaster problem phases such as detection, warning, and relief; requirements for the communication capability including remote data collection, imaging and voice broadcast; and the global disaster network are discussed. Utilization of Intelsat and <b>Marisat</b> <b>systems</b> and the size and type of ground terminals required for satellite access is considered, and estimates {{of communication}} requirements for a global system and of costs for satellite services to support relief operations are given. NASA disaster related activities including studies of direct-to-home disaster warning and determination of disaster response times are described, and it is concluded that existing international satellite communication systems offer real potential {{for the establishment of}} a reliable and flexible network devoted to disaster related communication services...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{existing}} and planned communication satellite systems {{to provide assistance}} {{in the implementation of}} disaster relief operations on a global basis was discussed along with satellite communications system implications and their potential impact on field operations in disaster situations. Consideration are given to the utilization of both INTELSAT and <b>MARISAT</b> <b>systems</b> operating at frequencies ranging from 1. 5 to 4 GHz and to the size and type of ground terminals necessary for satellite access. Estimates of communication requirements for a global system are given. Some discussion of cost estimates for satellite services to support operations are included. Studies of communication satellites for both pre and post disaster applications conducted for NOAA are included as well as recent experiments conducted in conjunction with the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the Agency for International Development...|$|R
