40|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>amplifiers</b> combine active {{elements}} with passive {{transmission line}} circuits to provide functions critical to microwave systems and instruments. The history of <b>microwave</b> <b>amplifiers</b> begins with electron devices using resonant or slow-wave structures to match wave velocity to electron beam velocity. The design techniques used for BJT and FET amplifiers employ {{the full range}} of concepts we have developed in the study of microwave transmission lines, two-port networks and Smith chart presentation. The development of S-parameter matrix concepts grew from the need to characterize active devices and amplifiers in a form that recognized the need for matched termination rather than short- or open-circuit termination. Much of the initial work was performed at the Hewlett-Packard Company in connection with the development of instruments to measure device and amplifier parameters.

50|$|A {{reflection}} amplifier {{is a type}} of <b>microwave</b> <b>amplifier</b> circuit utilizing negative {{differential resistance}} diodes such as tunnel diodes and Gunn diodes. Negative differential resistance diodes can amplify signals, and often perform better at microwave frequencies than two-port devices. However, since the diode is a one-port (two terminal) device, a nonreciprocal component is needed to separate the outgoing amplified signal from the incoming input signal. By using a 3-port circulator with the signal input connected to one port, the biased diode connected to a second, and the output load connected to the third, the output and input can be uncoupled.|$|E

These gain media could release stimulated emissions between an excited state and a lower excited state, not the ground state, facilitating {{the maintenance of a}} population inversion.

50|$|The {{tunnel diode}} showed great promise as an {{oscillator}} and high-frequency threshold (trigger) device since it operated at frequencies {{far greater than}} the tetrode could, well into the microwave bands. Applications for tunnel diodes included local oscillators for UHF television tuners, trigger circuits in oscilloscopes, high-speed counter circuits, and very fast-rise time pulse generator circuits. The tunnel diode {{can also be used}} as a low-noise <b>microwave</b> <b>amplifier.</b> However, since its discovery, more conventional semiconductor devices have surpassed its performance using conventional oscillator techniques. For many purposes, a three-terminal device, such as a field-effect transistor, is more flexible than a device with only two terminals. Practical tunnel diodes operate at a few milliamperes and a few tenths of a volt, making them low-power devices. The Gunn diode has similar high frequency capability and can handle more power.|$|E
50|$|Consider a <b>microwave</b> <b>amplifier</b> with a 50-ohm {{impedance}} with a 50-ohm resistor {{connected to}} the amplifier input. If the resistor is at a physical temperature TR, then the Johnson-Nyquist noise power coupled to the amplifier input is PJ = kBTRB, where kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and B is the bandwidth. The noise power at {{the output of the}} amplifier (i.e. the noise power coupled to an impedance-matched load that is {{connected to the}} amplifier output) is Pout = GkB(TR + Tamp)B, where G is the amplifier power gain, and Tamp is the amplifier noise temperature. In the Y-factor technique, Pout is measured for two different, known values of TR. Pout is then converted to an effective temperature Tout (in units of kelvin) by dividing by kB and the measurement bandwidth B. The two values of Tout are then plotted as a function of TR (also in units of kelvin), and a line is fit to these points (see figure). The slope of this line is equal to the amplifier power gain. The x intercept of the line is equal to the negative of the amplifier noise temperature −Tamp in kelvins. The amplifier noise temperature can also be determined from the y intercept, which is equal to Tamp multiplied by the gain.|$|E
