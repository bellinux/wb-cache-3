5|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, Lithuania {{lost its}} {{independence}} and Marcinkus was largely forgotten. His <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> kept alive by the Lithuanian émigré press. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, more detailed accounts of his life were published there and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his failure}} at seizing the throne, Constantine Doukas' {{popularity}} meant that his <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> preserved both {{among the people}} and the aristocracy of Asia Minor: in the 930s, Basil the Copper Hand assumed his identity and led a peasant revolt, while among the aristocracy he was glorified as a hero. Elements of Constantine's life eventually found their way into the epic poem Digenes Akrites.|$|E
50|$|Field vs. Observer: Autobiographical <b>memories</b> can <b>be</b> {{experienced}} {{from different}} perspectives. Field <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> <b>memories</b> recollected {{in the original}} perspective, from a first-person point of view. Observer <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> <b>memories</b> recollected from a perspective outside ourselves, a third-person point of view. Typically, older <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> recollected through an observer perspective, and observer <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> more often reconstructions while field <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> more vivid like copies.|$|R
30|$|Three {{types of}} <b>memory</b> buffer <b>are</b> {{generally}} used in any 2 -D DWT architecture, i.e., frame, transposition, and temporal <b>memory.</b> Frame <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> required to store intermediate LL coefficients, transposition <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> mainly required for storing row processor output, and temporal <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> required to store partial results during column processing. Temporal and transposition <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> on-chip, while the frame <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> on or off-chip, {{depending upon the}} architecture. Size of transposition <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> limited by the method adopted to scan external memory. Different scanning techniques have been proposed, such as line-based, block-based, and stripe-based[14, 19 – 21].|$|R
50|$|Declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> the <b>memory</b> for {{conscious}} events. There are {{two types}} of declarative memory: episodic and semantic. Episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> for remembering experiences whereas semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> remembering specific facts.|$|R
5|$|Domitian's reign {{came to an}} end in 96 when he {{was assassinated}} by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> {{condemned}} to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.|$|E
5|$|Each {{background}} processor {{consisted of}} a computation section, a control section and local memory. The computation section performed 64-bit scalar, floating point and vector arithmetic. The control section provided instruction buffers, memory management functions, and a real-time clock. 16 kwords (128 kbytes) of high-speed local <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> incorporated into each background processor for use as temporary scratch memory.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, Mayor Cornelius Devennel {{ordered all}} closet doors be {{equipped}} with special knobs that can open easily from both inside and outside. This order was made mandatory for all new home constructions or reconstructions. A ceremony in her <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> held at the St. Francis de Sales Church that same day. On March 20, radio station WPEN presented Freitta with a new puppy, an English Setter.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussing}} multidirectional <b>memory,</b> it <b>is</b> {{important to}} highlight that screen <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> also {{a kind of}} multidirectional memory, even though screen memory operates more on the personal level while multidirectional <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> primarily collective. Screen <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> “covering up a traumatic event-another traumatic event-that cannot be approached directly”.|$|R
30|$|The {{observation}} of the expert agent shows how spatial <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> connected to his own formative history. When reference <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> richer, then drawn images are more numerous and significant. But <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> stimulated also from the interaction: therefore, new images of old <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> created, {{as well as new}} memories can revive old images, following a permanent and repeated intersection of cognitions and actions.|$|R
25|$|An autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to {{memory of a}} person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything {{that has happened in}} one's past. <b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from <b>memory.</b> Autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical <b>memories</b> <b>is</b> questionable because of memory distortions.|$|R
5|$|Shepard {{established}} a small chapel on his Briarcliff Manor property, and founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church in 1892. The church and its manse were donated by Margaret after his death. It {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard Jr. (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and William Rutherford Mead). The church, dedicated on May 11, 1895 in Shepard's <b>memory,</b> <b>was</b> briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church.|$|E
5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> soon forgotten in the ensuing decades.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> a {{very broad}} {{function}} which includes several distinct abilities, {{all of which can}} be selectively impaired and require individual testing. There is disagreement as to the number of memory systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken. From a clinical perspective, a view of five distinct types of <b>memory,</b> <b>is</b> in most cases sufficient. Semantic memory and episodic memory (collectively called declarative memory or explicit memory); procedural memory and priming or perceptual learning (collectively called non-declarative memory or implicit memory) all four of which <b>are</b> long term <b>memory</b> systems; and working memory or short term <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> for facts, episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> autobiographical <b>memory,</b> procedural <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> for the performance of skills, priming <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> facilitated by prior exposure to a stimulus and working <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> a form of short term memory for information manipulation.|$|R
50|$|Declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> {{which can}} <b>be</b> {{consciously}} recalled, such as facts and knowledge, for instance autobiographical memory. Within declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> semantic and episodic <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> facts, and episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> recalling previous experiences in life. Studies on individuals with ASD has shown impairments to their episodic memory but a relative preservation of their semantic memory. The brain regions that {{play a major}} role in declarative learning and <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> the hippocampus and regions of the medial temporal lobe.Little research has been conducted on M-LFA individuals and memory function. Memory profiles of M-LFA individuals and of HFA individuals seem to be similar, but there is some evidence that declarative <b>memory</b> impairment <b>is</b> consistently greater for M-LFA individuals than for HFA individuals.|$|R

5|$|Caracalla is {{presented}} in ancient sources as a tyrant and cruel leader, an image that has survived into modernity. Dio Cassius and Herodian present Caracalla as a soldier first and emperor second. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, Caracalla's <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> revived {{in the works of}} French artists due to the parallels between Caracalla's apparent tyranny and that of King Louis XVI. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as a psychopathic and evil ruler. His rule is remembered as being one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Lethbridge {{published}} The Monkey's Tail, {{in which}} he discussed Darwinian evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless argued {{that there was a}} blueprint for existence and that genetic <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> a reality. In a sequel published in 1969, The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?, Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by Erich von Däniken in Chariots of the Gods (1968), Lethbridge argued that the late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft. In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the Earth mysteries movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
50|$|Decay {{theory is}} similar to {{interference}} theory {{in the way that}} old <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> lost over time. <b>Memories</b> <b>are</b> lost in Decay Theory by the passing of time. In Interference Theory, <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> lost due to newly acquired memories. Both Decay and Interference Theories are involved in psychological theories of forgetting.|$|R

5|$|Recorded {{over six}} weeks in late 2004, Commit This to <b>Memory</b> <b>was</b> created largely at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a {{suburban}} home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} frontman Justin Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. He hoped for his lyricism to better emphasize storytelling, inspired by the lyrics of Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson. Hoppus mainly worked with the band on completing song arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The Intel 8080 did {{not have}} {{dedicated}} circuitry to support dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because in 1975, this type of <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> still a new technology. MITS wanted to use DRAM because it consumed less power than static RAM. However, they had several design and component problems {{that led to a}} high failure rate with their 4K Dynamic RAM board. By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards with the promise of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{picture of}} Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself {{on the brink of}} invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.|$|E
50|$|Autobiographical <b>memories</b> {{can also}} <b>be</b> {{differentiated}} into Remember vs. Know categories. The {{source of a}} remembered <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> attributed to personal experience. The source of a known <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> attributed to an external source, not personal memory.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Fingleton divided {{his time}} between Canberra, where until his {{retirement}} in 1978 he was political correspondent for Radio Australia, and cricket journalism. He forged close relationships with several Prime Ministers. In particular, Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, provided him with a laudatory foreword in his book, Masters of Cricket. Fingleton's Test coverage resulted in a number of books that placed him at the forefront of Australian cricket writers. The books included Cricket Crisis (mainly an account of the 1932–33 Bodyline series), Brightly Fades the Don (the 1948 Invincibles tour), Brown & Company: The Tour in Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1950–51), The Ashes Crown the Year (the Australian tour of England in 1953), Masters of Cricket, Four Chukkas to Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1958–59), The Greatest Test of All (the Tied Test of 1960), Fingleton on Cricket and The Immortal Victor Trumper. His final book, the autobiographical Batting From <b>Memory,</b> <b>was</b> to have its Australian launch during the week in which he died of a heart attack. His cricket writing, {{regarded as one of the}} most stylish by an Australian, often left a sour taste with observers because of the persistent anti-Bradman jibes.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> revived {{in the art}} of late {{eighteenth-century}} French painters. His tyrannical career {{became the}} subject of the work of several French painters such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.A.C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the French monarchy. Caracalla's visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla's likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had {{died as a result of}} their apparent tyranny.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that fetal memory may begin within the second trimester after conception. Substantial evidence for fetal <b>memories</b> has <b>been</b> found at around 30 weeks after conception. Fetal <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> important for parental recognition, and facilitates the bond between child and parents. One of the most important types of <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> that which stores information contributing to the maternal bond between infant and mother. This form of <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> important for a type of development known as attachment. Fetal <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> thus critical to the survival of the fetus both prenatally (in the womb) and after birth as an infant.|$|R
