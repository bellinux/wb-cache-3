40|$|Species {{differences}} in neurochemical expression and {{activity in the}} brain may {{play an important role}} in species-specific patterns of social behavior. In the present study, we used immunoreactive (ir) labeling to compare the regional density of cells containing oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (AVP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), or estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) staining in the brains of social <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> (Meriones unguiculatus) and solitary Chinese striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis). Multiple region- and neurochemical-specific species differences were found. In the anterior hypothalamus (AH), <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> had higher densities of AVP-ir and ERa-ir cells than Chinese striped hamsters. In the lateral hypothalamus (LH), <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> also had higher densities of AVP-ir and TH-ir cells, but a lower density of OT-ir cells, than Chinese striped hamsters. Furthermore, in the anterior nucleus of the medial preoptic area (MPOAa), <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> had higher densities of OT-ir and AVP-ir cells than Chinese striped hamsters, and an opposite pattern was found in the posterior nucleus of the MPOA (MPOAp). Some sex differences were also observed. Females of both species had higher densities of TH-ir cells in the MPOAa and of OT-ir cells in the intermediate nucleus of the MPOA (MPOAi) than males. Given the role of these neurochemicals in social behaviors, our data provide additional evidence to support the notion that species-specific patterns of neurochemical expression in the brain may be involved in species {{differences in}} social behaviors associated wit...|$|R
50|$|Meriones unguiculatus evolved on the semideserts and steppes of Mongolia.

40|$|The early larval {{development}} and migration route of Taenia polyacantha were examined using oral inoculation of oncospheres into red-backed voles and <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils.</b> The larvae were recovered {{in the wall}} of the small intestine and in the mesenteric lymph nodes by 5 days postinfection (PI) and from the peritoneal cavity after 6 days PI. These results suggest that the larval cestodes developed initially in {{the wall of the}} small intestine and the mesenteric lymph nodes, and later migrated to the peritoneal cavity. Although the development of the parasite was quite similar in the 2 host species, pathological changes were different. In <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils,</b> these changes were slight, but in red-backed voles, they were marked and fatal. In addition to oral inoculation, hatched oncospheres were injected intraperitoneally and subcutaneously into red-backed voles, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils,</b> and AKRlJ mice. Larval development took place at the injection sites in gerbils and mice, but was delayed and abnormal. Some of the parasites in the injection site showed abnormal numerous budding.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite, {{formed from}} NO and {{superoxide}} anion, poly (ADP-ribole) synthetase have been implicated as mediators of neuronal damage following focal ischaemia. Here we {{have investigated the}} effects of n-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment in <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> subjected to cerebral ischaemia. Treatment of gerbils with NAC (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 30 [*]min before reperfusion and 1, 2 and 6 [*]h after reperfusion) reduced the formation of post-ischaemic brain oedema, evaluated by water content. NAC also attenuated {{the increase in the}} brain levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the increase in the hippocampus of myeloperoxidase (MPO) caused by cerebral ischaemia. Positive staining for nitrotyrosine was found in the hippocampus in <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> subjected to cerebral ischaemia. Hippocampus tissue sections from <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> subjected to cerebral ischaemia also showed positive staining for poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS). The degree of staining for nitrotyrosine and for PARS were markedly reduced in tissue sections obtained from animals that received NAC. NAC treatment increased survival and reduced hyperactivity linked to neurodegeneration induced by cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion. Histological observations of the pyramidal layer of CA 1 showed a reduction of neuronal loss in animals that received NAC. These results show that NAC improves brain injury induced by transient cerebral ischaemia...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induced DNA damage {{which may}} be related to gastric cancer development. The DNA damage res-ponse {{coordinates}} DNA repair, cell-cycle transition, and apoptosis through activation of DNA damage response molecules. The damaged DNA is repaired through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). In the present study, we investigated the changes of HR DNA repair proteins (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; ATM, ATM and Rad 3 -related; ATR), NHEJ repair proteins (Ku 70 / 80), cell cycle regulators (Chk 1, Chk 2), and apoptosis marker (p 53 /p-p 53) were determined in H. pylori-infected <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils.</b> In addition, the effect of an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on H. pylori-induced DNA damage response was determined to assess the involvement of oxidative stress on DNA damage of the animals infected with H. pylori.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{performance}} of three in-house diagnostic tests, that is, histopathology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for the diagnosis after experimental infection with Toxocara cati. Twenty <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> and Wistar rats were divided into ten groups (n= 2 /group). Toxocara cati infections were established in <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> and Wistar rats by administering doses of 240 and 2500 embryonated Toxocara cati eggs by gavage, respectively. Tissue sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and observed under the light microscope. Sera and vitreous fluid collected from separate infected groups were tested against Toxocara cati antigens, for 92 days postinfection. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, and aqueous fluids belong to the animals. The histopathology test gave negative results among the groups of animals examined between 5 and 92 days postinfection. The ELISA results showed that anti-Toxocara antibodies have risen between 7 and 61 days postinfection in sera and vitreous fluid in the animals infected, respectively. Analysis of PCR products revealed positive band (660 [*]bp) in the orbital tissue infected <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> at 5 days postinfection. Of the three evaluated methods, the PCR could be recommended for scientific and laboratory diagnoses of toxocariasis in experimentally infected animals...|$|R

5000|$|Meriones unguiculatus, the Mongolian jird or <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbil</b> is a rodent {{belonging}} to subfamily Gerbillinae. It {{is the most}} widely known species of the gerbil subfamily, and is the usual gerbil species to be kept as a pet or experimental animal, when it {{is known as the}} domesticated gerbil. Like the Syrian or golden hamster, it was first brought to the United States in 1954 by Dr. Victor Schwentker for use in research. Forty-four pairs were caught in Mongolia and brought to England. They were described as [...] "squirrel colors... with long furry tails." [...] They are somewhat larger than mice, with a body about 12 cm long (and a tail of similar length), with body mass averaging 50-55 grams in females and 60 grams in males.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbil</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} research animal for several reasons. In the wild during the long, cold winter of the arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia, China and Russia the gerbil stays in small social groups mostly underground {{in a series of}} burrows in which separate areas are designated for food storage, sleeping, and voiding. The enclosed living habitats of domestication is similar and gerbils easily adapted to the new setting. In addition gerbils are able to manufacture most vitamins in their metabolic system so fresh vs. dehydrated foods are not a requirement for their health, and indeed can give them diarrhea. The extra dry environment this produces in their living areas keeps the growth of bacteria and fungi down and keeps odours down too. This means they are very easy animals to keep in a research setting.|$|E
40|$|The {{indigenous}} {{microbial flora}} {{of the middle}} ear cavity of <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils,</b> Meriones unguiculatus, was isolated, characterized, and identified, showing it to be sparse and transitory. Organisms, when found in the middle ear cavity, were most likely to be Staphylococcus epidermidis-like organisms. Cerumen from the external auditory canal of these animals yielded mostly staphylococci, coryneforms, and other gram-positive rods, including some anaerobic species. The nasopharynx supported a flora consisting mainly of staphylococci, lactobacilli, and coryneforms, with a smaller incidence and numbers of many other species. No mycoplasmas were cultured or seen in scanning electron microscope studies. None of the major pathogens of human otitis media were found; therefore, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> are microbiologically acceptable candidates as a model for induced otitis media, using organisms isolated from human otitic infections...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mongolian</b> <b>Gerbils</b> {{are often}} used as a {{biological}} model, but it remainsunclear whether these rodents display nocturnal, diurnal,or crepuscular patterns of behavior.

50|$|Evidence {{from studies}} on female {{cooperative}} breeding <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils</b> indicated {{that type of}} living environment influences hormone concentrations of progesterone and prolactin. To investigate living environment effects, female gerbils in three housing groups (FH-family housed, PH-pair mate housed, and SH- singly housed) were observed and compared to each other. Unfamiliar pups were placed in a cage with each female to observe any infanticide response. Following the pup test samples of prolactin and progesterone were taken via blood. Analyses showed that females with lower progesterone (FH group) and prolactin levels rarely displayed infanticidal behavior toward the unfamiliar pup, compared to the females that possessed higher levels, in which they attacked the pup. These results show that cohabitation with family, contributes to lower progesterone and prolactin concentrations in female <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbils,</b> which is shown to decrease the likelihood that infanticide will occur.|$|R
50|$|T. asiatica causes {{intestinal}} taenisis {{in humans}} and cysticercosis in pigs. There is a suspicion {{that it may}} also cause cysticercosis in human. Like other taenids, humans are the definitive hosts, but in contrast, pigs, wild boars, as well as cattle can serve as intermediate hosts. Moreover, SCID mice and <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbil</b> can be experimentally infected. The life cycle is basically {{similar to those of}} other taenids. Humans contract the infection by eating raw or undercooked meat - a practice common in East and Southeast Asia - which are contaminated with the infective larva called cysticercus. Cysticercus develops into adult tapeworm in human intestine, from where it releases embryonated eggs along faeces into the external environment. Pigs acquire the eggs from vegetation. The eggs enter the digestive tract, which they penetrate to migrate to other body organs. Unlike other Taenia they preferentially settle in the liver, where they form cysticerci.|$|E

40|$|The pars flaccida of the Meriones unguiculatus (<b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbil)</b> was in {{previous}} studies shown to bulge almost spherically when pressurized, a behavior suggesting that it is suspended by a fixed circular boundary. The question arises whether this "functional" boundary {{is based on an}} underlying circular anatomical boundary, an important issue for modeling the middle-ear mechanics. In this article, the boundaries of the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>gerbil</b> pars flaccida were visualized in situ with otomicroscopy and in slides with light microscopy and by micro-CT radiology. For the major part of its circumference, the pars flaccida was found to be suspended by rigid bone, that is, the tympanic legs.

The attachment to these structures is simple and uncomplicated, and the geometry is regular and symmetric: deviating by only 3. 5 % from a perfect circular shape.
