25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> operated from the control car.|$|E

Opening the valve to 90 degrees increased the flow rate to over 9, 700 gpm. The velocity of the flushing wave was 8. 5 fpm with a flow depth of 3. 5 in.

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found a gouge in the pipe, probably caused by excavation equipment years earlier; {{in combination with}} brittle pipe material and excessive operating pressures likely led to the rupture.

50|$|Some {{automatic}} transmissions modified or {{designed specifically for}} drag racing may also incorporate a transbrake {{as part of a}} <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> body. Activated by electrical solenoid control, a transbrake simultaneously engages the first and reverse gears, locking the transmission and preventing the input shaft from turning. This allows the driver of the car to raise the engine RPM against the resistance of the torque converter, then launch the car by simply releasing the transbrake switch.|$|R

50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force. Stems are either smooth for actuator controlled valves or threaded for <b>manual</b> <b>valves.</b> The smooth stems are surrounded by packing material to prevent leaking material from the valve. This packing is a wearable material and will have to be replaced during maintenance. With a smooth stem the ends are threaded to allow connection to the plug and the actuator. The stem must not only withstand a large amount of compression force during valve closure, but also have high tensile strength during valve opening. In addition, the stem must be very straight, or have low run out, in order to ensure good valve closure. This minimum run out also minimizes wear of the packing contained in the bonnet, which provides the seal against leakage. The stem may be provided with a shroud over the packing nut to prevent foreign bodies entering the packing material, which would accelerate wear.|$|E
50|$|Electronic bidets are {{controlled}} with waterproof electrical switches {{rather than with}} a traditional <b>manual</b> <b>valve.</b> There are models that have a heating element which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless remote controls, illumination through built in night lights, or built in deodorizers and activated carbon filters to remove odors. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.|$|R

40|$|The beam pipe of the TESLA cryomodule {{is closed}} off by <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> {{on both sides}} of the string of 12 cavities.

Three types of losses are distinguished: transient and resonant losses due to wake fields induced by the valves themselves and losses due to wakes induced in the cavities. The calculations have been done for two different operation modes - linac operation and FEL operation. In addition the transverse kick has been calculated and compared with the strongest kick from a nine cell cavity.

40|$|The GTRAN {{program was}} {{developed}} to solve transient, as well as steady state, problems for gas piping systems. GTRAN capabilities allow {{for the analysis of}} a variety of system configurations and components.

In addition, boundary conditions can be incorporated to simulate specific components. The governing equations of GTRAN are the one-dimensional transient gas dynamic equations. The three equations for pressure, velocity, and density are reduced to numerical equations using an implicit Crank-Nicholson finite difference technique. Input to GTRAN includes a description of the piping network, the initial conditions, and any events (e. g. valve closings) occuring during the period of analysis. Output includes pressure, velocity, and density versus time. GTRAN is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer.

50|$|Micro-compounding is {{typically}} performed with a table top, twin screw micro-compounder or -extruder with a working volume of 5 or 15 ml.

The L/D of a continuous twin screw extruder is mimicked in a batch micro-compounder by the recirculation mixing time, which is controlled by a <b>manual</b> <b>valve.</b> With this valve the recirculation can be interrupted to unload the formulation in either a strand, or an injection moulder, a film device or a fiber line. Typical recirculation times are 1-3 min, dependent on the ease of dispersive and distributive mixing of the formulation.|$|R
