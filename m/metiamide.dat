50|$|Ganellin's {{contribution}} to this research was integral to its success. His adeptness at physical organic chemistry enabled him to understand the individual H2-receptor antagonist drugs they developed. Initially, the team developed burimamide as a potential H2-receptor antagonist for medicinal use. However, it was soon realised that burimamide was not an appropriate oral medicine. They quickly identified a similar drug, <b>metiamide,</b> which appeared to have clinical potential. However, <b>metiamide</b> also had a shortcoming - its safety was uncertain. The end result of their trials was cimetidine, an H2-receptor antagonist superior to both burimamide and <b>metiamide.</b> The precursor drugs which marked the progress of their research are termed prototypes. These prototype drugs helped them understand the mechanisms that described how the drugs function. Ganellin's input was vital to the progression of their research along the sequence of prototypes to final product.|$|E

Patients with duodenal ulcers were stimulated by a steak meal, and acid secretion was measured by in vivo intragastric titration. The largest dose of isopropamide that can be taken clinically without producing intolerable side effects (maximum tolerated dose) suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion by 35 %. By contrast, <b>metiamide</b> in a 400 -mg dose produced no side effects and almost completely abolished food-stimulated acid secretion.

40|$|Cimetidine is a non-thiourea {{analogue}} oj <b>metiamide.</b> It is {{a specific}} com petitive histamine H^-receptor antagonist and is an effective inhibitor of gastric secretion in animals and man with similar pharmacological properties to <b>metiamide.</b> No renal damage or haematological changes were observed in 90 -day studies in rats or dogs.

40|$|In a {{cell-free}} system prepared from {{guinea pig}} gastric mucosa, histamine and Nα-methyl-histamine produced dose-dependent stimulation of cyclic AMP formation and 1, 4 -methylhistamine had a minimal stimulatory effect.

40|$|Using {{oxygen uptake}} as {{an index of}} the {{physiological}} response of isolated parietal cells, the interactions between histamine and gastrin and between histamine and carbamylcholine {{and the effects of}} atropine and <b>metiamide</b> on these interactions have been studied. Parietal cells were isolated from canine fundic mucosa by sequential exposure of separated mucosa to collagenase and EDTA. In previous studies carbamylcholine, isobutyl methyl xanthine, gastrin, and histamine have each been shown to increase oxygen uptake by these cells. Isobutyl methyl xanthine greatly enhanced the histamine effect.

In the present studies, potentiating interactions between histamine and carbamylcholine and between histamine and gastrin have been demonstrated. Against a histamine (0. 1 and 1 μM) plus isobutyl methyl xanthine (0. 1 mM) background, the dose for 50 % response for gastrin was approximately 1 nM, and the maximal response was obtained at 0. 1 μM.
