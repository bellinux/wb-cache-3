5|$|Commoners are {{estimated}} to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively {{little is known about}} them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and cacao, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as <b>maize</b> <b>flour</b> and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected to be grateful for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in <b>maize</b> <b>flour.</b> In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (<b>maize</b> <b>flour)</b> {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E

Experiment was conducted using five pairs of 3 - 5 day old T. castaneum on 5 g of processed staple meals in a 25 mL glass jars. Insects were allowed to mate and oviposit {{for a period of}} twenty days {{and at the end of}} twenty days both live and dead insects were removed. Insect count was started from the day of emergence in each treatment and was carried out for twenty days in each treatment and replicate. Significantly (p=< 0. 05) more T. castaneum adults developed in wheat, millet, sorghum and <b>maize</b> <b>flour(s)</b> with Susceptibility Indices (SI) of 8. 65,. 26,. 46 and 3. 19, respectively. Fewer adults emerged in semovita grits, cassava and yam flour with SI of 2. 69,. 27 and 2. 22, respectively. Developmental Period (DP, in days) for cassava flour was 54. 8 days; while the least DP was 27. 0 days in wheat.

Extrusion caused a diminishment in the contents of the essential amino acids isoleucine, leucine, lysine, threonine and valine when compared to their original flours (P 0. 05). QPM samples, either raw or extruded, were significantly higher in lysine, methionine and tryptophan compared to samples of normal maize (P< 0. 05). Extrudates produced with yellow QPM flours were lighter than their correspondent raw material (P< 0. 05), different from that of yellow normal maize. This trend was also observed for redness (a values) in extrudates. On the other hand, white and yellow extrudates presented higher b values (yellowness) than their correspond raw flour.

40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciências Agrárias. Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência dos Alimentos. Native landraces of Brazilian maize {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} valuable resources for the development of corn cultivars with end-use quality. Besides, they have high environmental adaptation potential which makes them desirable for breeding programs. The cultivation of maize landraces by small producers helps in the rescue, preservation, and production of varieties, which in turn maintains corn#s genetic variability. The choice of a particular landrace should be based not only on agronomic factors but also on the nutritional and industrial quality factors. For this purpose, eight Brazilian maize landraces were evaluated. Chemical composition, quality factors, superficial kernel appearance and starch granules were eterminated. Values for protein and lipids (dry basis) were in the range of 8 - 10, 3 % and 4, 8 - 5, 4 %, respectively. Starch is the major component of maize, and ranged between 63 and 73 %. The fatty acids composition was evaluated and these landraces showed the linoleic composition higher than the other, as usual to maize. All protein fractions were extracted and quantified. By SDS-PAGE, the molecular weight was obtained, and the superficial net charge was observed by capillary electrophoresis, which showed that albumins, globulins and prolamins, represented by zein I and II are clearly negatively net charge. The hardness of the kernel is controlled by the á-zein class, and all samples showed the presence of these proteins as seen by SDS-PAGE. The functional and thermal properties of <b>maize</b> <b>flours</b> were studied by RVA, texture analysis and rheology. Genetic clusters were constructed to evaluate the differences in the samples, and a large difference was found between the samples in each protein fraction. Dynamic properties was studied and the storage (G#) and lost of energy (G#) modulus were obtained, allowing to classified the gels formed as week gels. The frequency sweep had low interference on these results and for all samples the G# modulus was higher to G# modulus. The rheological study makes easy the application of the <b>maize</b> <b>flours</b> in starch-based products...|$|R

The TPFs were then mixed with a copolyester [poly(butylene adipate-terephtalate) ]. All of the blends contained the same volume fractions and were prepared with the same mixing conditions. The morphology and rheological behavior of each blend were characterized. Different morphologies, ranging from cocontinuous to nodular, were observed. In fixed mixing conditions, the blend morphology was shown to be governed by the rheological behavior of the starchy phase and the plasticizer content.
