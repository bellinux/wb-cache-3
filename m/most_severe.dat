5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the <b>most</b> <b>severe).</b> This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (<b>most</b> <b>severe)</b> though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity of}} the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (<b>most</b> <b>severe).</b>|$|E

5|$|The creek flooded in September 1850. It was the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> {{flood of}} the creek up to that time. In January 1996, 400 {{buildings}} along Solomon Creek flooded by it due to melting snow. This was one of numerous floods on that area {{of the creek}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Permian saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic extinction event: probably the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> mass extinction event of the phanerozoic. There was a protracted loss of species, due to multiple extinction pulses. Many of the once large and diverse groups died out or were greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its course, Typhoon Dot {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} in the Philippines, China and Vietnam, resulting in significant damage and eight fatalities. The <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> impacts {{took place on}} Hainan Island where 1,400 homes were destroyed and another 60,000 were damaged. In Vietnam, Dot exacerbated flooding triggered in late May by Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E
50|$|On July 30, 2004 a {{high-pressure}} {{natural gas}} pipeline operated at a pressure of 70 bar ruptured following recent third party damage. Twenty-four people {{died as a}} result and 150 survivors were hospitalised, <b>most</b> with <b>severe</b> burns.|$|R
50|$|Treatment of {{hyperglycemia}} requires {{elimination of}} the underlying cause, such as diabetes.

5|$|Although Ivan was a {{powerful}} storm at landfall, its effects were relatively minor compared to the storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. Agricultural industries sustained the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> damage, as thousands of animals drowned in the storm. Total damage was estimated at $9.6million (1997 USD; $13.1million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm.|$|E
5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets. Damage was widespread {{throughout the area}} and flood waters reached waist-high levels. The storm was the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> in years at Jersey City, New Jersey, {{despite the fact that}} its damage was moderate. Trees were blown down and cellars filled with water there and in nearby areas, such as Hoboken.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's close {{proximity}} to the United States resulted in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach. Wind impacts were felt primarily from South Carolina to Virginia, though a frontal zone aided in bringing precipitation as far north as Maine. In the United States, Helene caused $11.2million in damages and one indirect fatality.|$|E
50|$|The area, {{like many}} others in Mexico City, is prone to flooding, {{especially}} {{during the rainy season}} in the summer and fall. The <b>most</b> recent <b>severe</b> flooding occurred in July 2010, along with several other colonias in the Cuauhtemoc borough.|$|R
25|$|Hybrid IIIs are {{designed}} to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects {{of other types of}} impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. After head-on collisions, the <b>most</b> common <b>severe</b> injury accident is the side impact.|$|R
40|$|The CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis {{conductance}} Transmembrane Regulator) is {{the gene}} responsible for Cystic Fibrosis, the <b>most</b> common <b>severe</b> autosomal recessive disease in Europeans.

5|$|Heavy rains caused {{landslides}} {{and flash}} flooding, which {{were responsible for}} extensive crop and property damage. Throughout the island of Shikoku, 14people were killed. In Mishima, two landslides claimed {{a total of four}} lives. Another landslide in Tsukude killed a 53-year old man, a 78-year old women, and a 14-year old girl. Hokkaido suffered the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> flooding in 10years. Several major rivers on the island overflowed their banks, leaving towns inundated and isolated. Around 1,200residents in Tsukigata were evacuated after a nearby river overflowed its banks.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{entered the}} Caribbean as a Category2 {{hurricane}} through the Saint Lucia Channel on August 17. It moved briskly between the Lesser Antillean islands of St. Lucia and Martinique, with its storm surge and rain bands reaching every {{island in the}} chain. Damage was <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> in Martinique where total damage was estimated at €400million and three indirect deaths, while nearby Guadaloupe suffered €400million of damage. In St. Lucia, damage was mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at US$18million.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{activity}} was above average {{during this time}} period. A hurricane in 1903 hit near Atlantic City, causing heavy damage near the shore. The <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> hurricane in the time period was the 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane. Though it did not make landfall, it brought strong winds and waves to the coastline, destroying hundreds of homes.|$|E
5000|$|Birk’s team deciphered the {{molecular}} basis and mechanism {{of more than}} 30 human diseases, {{including some of the}} <b>most</b> prevalent <b>severe</b> hereditary diseases in Arabs and in Jews worldwide. Among the many diseases discovered are Progressive Cerebello Cerebral Atrophy (PCCA) and PCCA2, the two <b>most</b> common <b>severe</b> genetic diseases in Sephardic Jews, the first gene for near-sightedness, as well as two genetic syndromes named after professor Birk. Human Genetics studies in the Birk lab (named after philanthropist Morris Kahn) span from generation of novel bioinformatics tool, to the clinical delineation and molecular identification of novel disease-associated genes, to in-depth developmental biology and molecular biochemistry studies discovering novel molecular pathways in health and disease. Human diseases whose molecular basis was discovered in the Birk lab include: ...|$|R
50|$|Repinotan’s {{side effects}} during trials as a {{treatment}} for ischemic stroke consisted mainly of serotonergic side effects including nausea and vomiting. The most common side effect was headache. Neurological worsening, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain edema were the <b>most</b> common <b>severe</b> effects. However, repinotan was generally shown to be safe.|$|R
50|$|Possible {{side effects}} of {{cilostazol}} use include headache (the <b>most</b> common), diarrhea, <b>severe</b> heat intolerance, abnormal stools, increased heart rate, and palpitations.|$|R
5|$|Hydrochloric acid {{is used in}} methamphetamine's {{manufacturing}} process, but academic reviews {{have not}} supported {{the idea that the}} acid contributes to dental decay. Speculation that oral consumption of the drug causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users' mouths is also unsupported. Meth mouth is generally <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> in users who inject the drug, rather than those who smoke, ingest or inhale it.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{more than}} 400 students, {{angry about the}} {{dismissal}} of a popular professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the <b>most</b> <b>severe</b> type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
30|$|In {{the decay}} phase, {{compartment}} temperatures cool {{as the fire}} intensity decreases. Generally the <b>most</b> structurally <b>severe</b> fire conditions are assumed to occur during peak heating. However, testing of exposed steel structures has shown that structural behavior in the cooling phase can result in structural failure (Usmani, et al., 2000).|$|R
5|$|In addition, Clumbers {{often have}} {{difficulties}} conceiving and giving birth, and may require caesarian sections. Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to anaesthesia. The <b>most</b> common <b>severe</b> health {{conditions in the}} Clumber Spaniel are entropion/ectropion eye conditions, spinal disc herniation and hip dysplasia. They have a median lifespan of around 10 years.|$|R
