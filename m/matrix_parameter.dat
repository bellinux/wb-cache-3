40|$|Among {{vertebral}} deformities, {{the prevalence}} of wedge fractures is about twice that of endplate (biconcave) deformities, {{both of which are}} greater than crush deformities. The anterior cortex is, therefore, a site of interest for understanding mechanisms of vertebral fracture. Despite its importance to vertebral mechanics, there are limited data describing the role of cortical shell, microdamage and bone <b>matrix</b> <b>parameters</b> in vertebral fragility. This review of literature emphasizes the translational aspects of bone quality and demonstrates that a greater understanding of bone fractures will be gained through bone quality parameters related to both cortical and cancellous compartments as well as from microdamage and bone <b>matrix</b> <b>parameters.</b> In context of vertebral fractures, measures of cortical shell and bone <b>matrix</b> <b>parameters</b> related to the organic matrix (Advanced Glycation Products and α/β CTX ratio) are independent of BMD measurements and can therefore provide an additional estimate of fracture risk in older patients...|$|R

Theoretical expressions are derived for the two source-location method, and these are shown to be identical to those for the two-load method. However, the two methods are conceptually different. The two-source method is shown to be functionally much more stable and entirely independent of the loading terminations.

40|$|We {{show that}} rate-adaptive multivariate density {{estimation}} {{can be performed}} using Bayesian methods based on Dirichlet mixtures of normal kernels with a prior distribution on the kernel’s covariance <b>matrix</b> <b>parameter.</b> We derive sufficient conditions on the prior specification that guarantee convergence to a true density {{at a rate that}} is minimax optimal for the smoothness class to which the true density belongs. No prior knowledge of smoothness is assumed. The sufficient conditions are shown to hold for the Dirichlet location mixture-of-normals prior with a Gaussian base measure and an inverse Wishart prior on the covariance <b>matrix</b> <b>parameter.</b> Locally Hölder smoothness classes and their anisotropic extensions are considered. Our study involves several technical novelties, including sharp approximation of finitely differentiable multivariate densities by normal mixtures and a new sieve on the space of such densities...|$|E

40|$|Multivariate {{identifier}} filters (multiple {{inputs and}} multiple outputs - MIMO) are adaptive digital systems having a loop {{in accordance with}} an objective function to adjust <b>matrix</b> <b>parameter</b> convergence to observable reference system dynamics. One way of complying with this condition is to use fuzzy logic inference mechanisms which interpret and select the best <b>matrix</b> <b>parameter</b> from a knowledge base. Such selection mechanisms with neural networks can provide a response from the best operational level for each change in state (Shannon, 1948). This paper considers the MIMO digital filter model using neuro fuzzy  digital filtering   to find an adaptive   parameter matrix which is integrated into the Kalman filter by the transition matrix. The filter uses the neural network as back-propagation into the fuzzy mechanism to do this, interpreting its variables and its respective levels and selecting the best values for automatically adjusting transition matrix values. The Matlab simulation describes the neural fuzzy digital filter giving an approximation of exponential convergence seen in functional error.   </p...|$|E
