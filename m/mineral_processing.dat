25|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>processing</b> (or mineral dressing) is a {{specialized}} {{area in the}} science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste material). Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as sluice boxes. Only minor shaking or washing {{may be necessary to}} disaggregate (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.|$|E

2500|$|Anthropogenic (man-made) {{sources of}} arsenic, like the natural sources, are mainly arsenic oxides and the {{associated}} anions. Man-made sources of arsenic, include wastes from <b>mineral</b> <b>processing,</b> swine and poultry farms. For example, many ores, especially sulfide minerals, are contaminated with arsenic, which is released in roasting (burning in air). In such processing, arsenide is converted to arsenic trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures and is released into the atmosphere. Poultry and swine farms make heavy use of the organoarsenic compound roxarsone as an antibiotic in feed. Some wood is treated with copper arsenates as a preservative. The mechanisms by which these sources affect [...] "downstream" [...] living organisms remains uncertain but are probably diverse. One commonly cited pathway involves methylation.|$|E

40|$|Solar energy, {{particularly}} {{electricity generated}} from the solar resource, has long been thought to be amongst the most expensive energy products. However, in a climate of electricity shortages and pressures on industries to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, many previous truths are being challenged. In the solar energy field there have emerged several technical and market innovations, thus making it more attractive. This could {{be of interest to}} many mining operations which are located in desert-type environments with high solar insolation and far from electricity grids. The objective of this dissertation is to evaluate the use of the available solar energy technologies at utility scale to supply the high energy demand of selected <b>minerals</b> <b>processing</b> industries by co-locating a solar power plant with a <b>minerals</b> <b>processing</b> operation. The effect on how the use of a utility scale solar energy use affects fuel transportation energy and conversion and transmission line losses is assessed. The study analyses the energy usage of different typical <b>minerals</b> <b>processing</b> operations, to identify the processing areas that are likely to benefit from the use of solar energy. Comminution, hot leaching processes and electrowinning circuits are shown to be the most energy intensive areas. Comminution requires high voltage AC power which can be supplied by the solar thermal (ST) technology which converts solar heat to steam which then drives a turbine. Process steam generation can also be achieved directly from ST technology. Electrowinning on the other hand requires low voltage DC electrical output, which can be generated directly using Photovoltaic (PV) technology. Five <b>minerals</b> <b>processing</b> operations, chosen to represent a range of different types of processes and energy supply scenarios, are profiled and their energy requirements quantified as a basis for establishing the extent to which solar energy can augment energy supply in different cases in this industry...|$|R
