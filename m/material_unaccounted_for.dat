40|$|Nuclear {{material}} accounting (NMA) is {{the only}} safeguards system whose benefits are routinely quantified. Process monitoring (PM) is another safeguards system that is increasingly used, and one challenge is how to quantify its benefit. This paper considers PM {{in the role of}} enabling frequent NMA, which is referred to as near-real-time accounting (NRTA). We quantify NRTA benefits using period-driven and data-driven testing. Period-driven testing makes a decision to alarm or not at fixed periods. Data-driven testing decides as the data arrives whether to alarm or continue testing. The difference between period-driven and datad-riven viewpoints is illustrated by using one-year and two-year periods. For both one-year and two-year periods, period-driven NMA using once-per-year cumulative <b>material</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for</b> (CUMUF) testing is compared to more frequent Shewhart and joint sequential cusum testing using either MUF or standardized, independently transformed MUF (SITMUF) data. We show that the data-driven viewpoint is appropriate for NRTA and that {{it can be used to}} compare safeguards effectiveness. In addition to providing period-driven and data-driven viewpoints, new features include assessing the impact of uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix of the MUF sequence and the impact of both random and systematic measurement errors...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{conclusions}} by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding States' {{nuclear material}} inventories and flows {{are provided in}} the form of material balance evaluations (MBEs). MBEs use facility estimates of the <b>material</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for</b> together with verification data to monitor for possible nuclear material diversion. Verification data consist of paired measurements (usually operators' declarations and inspectors' verification results) that are analysed one-item-at-a-time to detect significant differences. Also, to check for patterns, an overall difference of the operator-inspector values using a “D (difference) statistic” is used. The estimated DP and false alarm probability (FAP) depend on the assumed measurement error model and its random and systematic error variances, which are estimated using data from previous inspections (which are used for metrology studies to characterize measurement error variance components). Therefore, the sample sizes in both the previous and current inspections will impact the estimated DP and FAP, as is illustrated by simulated numerical examples. The examples include application of a new expression for the variance of the D statistic assuming the measurement error model is multiplicative and new application of both random and systematic error variances in one-item-at-a-time testing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the challenges and}} policy choices associated with verifying a North Korean declaration about its past nuclear activities. In terms of the plutonium programme, there are two key choices facing policy makers. First, in light of North Korea’s reported statement that its October 2006 test involved only 2 kg of plutonium, is the IAEA’s standard definition of a significant quantity appropriate? Second, using open source information, this paper argues that the uncertainty in the <b>material</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for,</b> σ(MUF), will be between 5 and 10 kg, depending {{on the degree of}} cooperation afforded by North Korea. In order to ensure that verification produces a conclusive answer, the magnitude of σ(MUF) will necessitate some combination of decreasing the detection probability and increasing the false alarm rate from their standard IAEA values, or adopting entirely different criteria against which to assess North Korean compliance. The paper also includes a discussion of the process for verifying the absence or existence of a clandestine uranium enrichment programme by formulating it as a Bayesian inference problem. This framework, together with an analysis of the politics of inspections at undeclared locations suggests that, unless detailed intelligence pinpointing the location of a clandestine centrifuge facility is available, inspection rights at undeclared facilities may be of limited utility...|$|E

Tulane University established the Libraries Recovery Center in 2008 to sort the restored items, check them against the library’s historic catalogue, create an inventory of <b>materials</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for,</b> and return the materials to the library’s collections. In 2013, this task was still ongoing. [...] The Howard-Tilton Memorial Library reopened in spring 2006 {{for the start of}} the first post-Katrina semester. At that point, a battery of temporary HVAC units were being used to combat mold and humidity by distributing air throughout each floor by long semi-inflated tubes hung from the ceilings and attached through the windows along the back of the building to eight galvanized metal towers. In August 2013, plans were announced to replace these climate control systems with a more permanent solution, as well as to add a 5th and 6th floor to the library. The completion date is scheduled for Fall 2015. The basement of the Howard-Tilton Memorial Library remains gutted and empty, as does the basement level in Jones Hall.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} design {{issues for}} establishing a near-real-time accountability (NRTA) system for modem fuel fabrication facilities; however, the approach for developing an NRTA {{could be applied}} to many nuclear facilities planned for construction. The proposed design is for a computerized materials accounting system capable of providing near-real-time materials balances and associated variances. The system must accommodate data from both destructive analysis (DA) and nondestructive analyses (NDA) of material-in-process and interim storage. DA and mass measurements are used by facility operations for process control and drawing material balances. NDA measurements will be used primarily by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors for verification of inventories. An essential component of the NRTA system is a software interface between the facility`s process control computer and the NRTA computer. The purpose of the interface is to facilitate the use of process measurement and material transfer data to compute <b>materials</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for</b> (MUF), limit of error of MUF (LEMUF), and covariance matrices for a sequence of MUFs. The design of the interface facilitates use of LANL developed software Materials Accounting with Sequential Testing (MAWST) for the NRTA calculations described above. The basic approach involves a comprehensive systems analysis to evaluate the NRTA system design; development of simulation software for analysis of process flows, holdup, and MUF/LEMUF; development of evaluation software for analysis of NRTA systems; and preparation of design specifications for software to implement NRTA...|$|R

40|$|Although the KFA-Jülich {{has been}} subject to {{international}} inspection under the Euratom Treaty from the outset, safeguards measures for special nuclear material are currently being re-negotiated and reorganized to correspond to the new and more stringent requirements laid down in the Verification Agreement pursuant to the Nuclear Weapons Nah-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear research centres in general pose special problems for international nuclear material control. The total amount of material present isusually distributed over a multitude of individual items and batches. The classical IAEA safeguards measure of periodic MUF (<b>material</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for)</b> determination is impractical. A viable alternative approach is to focus attention only an those few classes of physical inventory which contain {{the bulk of the}} fissile material. Such classes at the KFA Jülich comprise the frech and irradiated fuel assemblies for the two research reactors FRJ- 1 and FRJ- 2, fuel pebbles for the KAHTER critical assembly and stored spent AVR fuel. We will be concerned in the present investigation with developing a safeguards concept for the spent AVR fuel. A large fraction of the total inventory of fissile material at the KFA-Jülich {{is in the form of}} irradiated fuel from the AVR high temperature reactor. This material is accessible to measurement for verification purposes only with considerable difficulty and therefore poses serious technical problems from a safeguards standpoint. With the continuing operation of the AVR, coupled with still unresolved problems of final disposal, theamount of material in this category is increasing steadily. Moreover it is expected that the AVR pebbles will merge with irradiated fuel from the THTR- 3 oo in a large HTR away-fromareactor dry storage installation, also located at the KFA, thus becoming part of a much larger inventory of fissile material. With the gradual decay of short-lived fission products, its potential strategic value will increase steadily, rendering adequate safeguards measures indispensable.

40|$|Pebble-fueled high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) technology was first {{developed by the}} Federal Republic of Germany in the 1950 s. More recently, the design has been embraced by the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa. Unlike light water reactors that generate heat from fuel assemblies comprised of fuel rods, pebble-fueled HTGRs utilize thousands of 60 -mm diameter fuel spheres (pebbles) comprised of thousands of TRISO particles. As this reactor type is deployed across the world, adequate methods for safeguarding the reactor must be developed. Current safeguards methods for the pebble-fueled HTGR focus on extensive, redundant containment and surveillance (C/S) measures {{or a combination of}} item-type and bulk-type material safeguards measures to deter and detect the diversion of fuel pebbles. The disadvantages to these approaches are the loss of continuity of knowledge (CoK) when C/S systems fail, or are compromised, and the introduction of <b>material</b> <b>unaccounted</b> <b>for</b> (MUF). Either vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to divert fuel pebbles from the reactor system. It was determined that a solution to maintaining CoK is to develop a system to identify each fuel pebble that is inserted and removed from the reactor. Work was performed to develop and evaluate the use of inert microspheres placed in each fuel pebble, whose random placement {{could be used as a}} fingerprint to identify the fuel pebble. Ultrasound imaging of 1 mm zirconium oxide microspheres was identified as a possible imaging system and microsphere material for the new safeguards system concept. The system concept was evaluated, and it was found that a minimum of three microspheres are necessary to create enough random fingerprints for 10, 000, 000 pebbles. It was also found that, over the lifetime of the reactor, less than 0. 01 % of fuel pebbles can be expected to have randomly the same microsphere fingerprint. From an MCNP 5. 1 model, it was determined that less than fifty microspheres in each pebble will have no impact on the reactivity or temperature coefficient of reactivity of the reactor system. Finally, using an ultrasound system it was found that ultrasound waves can penetrate thin layers of graphite to image the microsphere fingerprint...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of the {{non-uniform}} nuclide composition in spent fuel on material accountancy in the pyroprocess. High-fidelity depletion simulations are performed using the Monte Carlo code SERPENT in order to determine nuclide composition as a function of axial and radial position within fuel rods and assemblies, and burnup. For improved accuracy, the simulations use short burnups step (25 days or less), Xe-equilibrium treatment (to avoid oscillations over burnup steps), axial moderator temperature distribution, and 30 axial meshes. Analytical solutions of the simplified depletion equations are built to understand the axial non-uniformity of nuclide composition in spent fuel. The cosine shape of axial neutron flux distribution dominates the axial non-uniformity of the nuclide composition. Combined cross sections and time also generate axial non-uniformity, as the exponential term in the analytical solution consists of the neutron flux, cross section and time. The axial concentration distribution for a nuclide having the small cross section gets steeper than that for another nuclide having the great cross section because the axial flux is weighted by the cross section in the exponential term in the analytical solution. Similarly, the non-uniformity becomes flatter as increasing burnup, because the time term in the exponential increases. Based on the developed numerical recipes and decoupling of the results between the axial distributions and the predetermined representative radial distributions by matching the axial height, the axial and radial composition distributions for representative spent nuclear fuel assemblies, the Type- 0, - 1, and - 2 assemblies after 1, 2, and 3 depletion cycles, is obtained. These data are appropriately modified to depict processing for materials in the head-end process of pyroprocess that is chopping, voloxidation and granulation. The expectation and standard deviation of the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio by the single granule sampling calculated by the central limit theorem and the Geary-Hinkley transformation. Then, the uncertainty propagation through the key-pyroprocess is conducted to analyze the <b>Material</b> <b>Unaccounted</b> <b>For</b> (MUF), which is a random variable defined as a receipt minus a shipment of a process, in the system. Finally, the Type-I error for the Pu MUF is evaluated for spent fuel assemblies with respect the size of granules and powders which are the key parameters to evaluate the uncertainty in determining ratio by sampling. The main observations of this calculation are the following: (1) the probabilities of Type-I error for the Pu MUF are occasionally greater than 5 % when the size of powder particles and granules are large and small; (2) the possibility of Type-I error greater than 5 % increases by increasing the depletion period, because the increasing production of Pu and 244 Cm with increasing burnup propagates the uncertainty through the system; (3) the major contributor to the uncertainty of ratio is the non-uniformity of 244 Cm; (4) Pu generation in the Type- 2 spent fuel assemblies is greater that in the others due to higher gadolinia bearing fuel (GBF) loading in the assembly, therefore, the area indicating the probability of Type-I error {{greater than or equal to}} 5 % is the widest among the figures for the Type- 0 and - 1 spent fuel assemblies. The random variable, LOPu, is defined for evaluating the non-detection probability at each Key Measurement Point (KMP) as the original Pu mass minus the Pu mass after a missing scenario. A number of assemblies for the LOPu to be 8 kg is considered in this calculation. The probability of detection for the 8 kg LOPu is evaluated with respect the size of granule and powder using the event tree analysis and the hypothesis testing method. We can observe there are possible cases showing the probability of detection for the 8 kg LOPu less than 95 %. In order to enhance the detection rate, a new Material Balance Area (MBA) model is defined for the key-pyroprocess. The probabilities of detection for all spent fuel types based on the new MBA model are greater than 99 %. Furthermore, it is observed that the probability of detection significantly increases by increasing granule sample sizes to evaluate the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio before the key-pyroprocess. Based on these observations, even though the Pu material accountability in pyroprocess is affected by the non-uniformity of nuclide composition when the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio method is being applied, that is surmounted by decreasing the uncertainty of measured ratio by increasing sample sizes and modifying the MBAs and KMPs...|$|E
