For {{a better understanding of the}} spatial distribution and the explaining variables of biodiversity, a correlation between broadscale, longterm environmental data and species' habitat requirements is indispensable. High temporal remote sensing provides this information globally with sufficient spatial resolution. However, the explanation is limited to coarse spatial patterns, also due to restrictions in manpower for ground based assessments of additional environmental parameters. Here we focus on ecologically elevant products which are derived from remote sensing imagery, i. e. habitat fragmentation and habitat loss, land cover dynamics and change. These parameters are crucial for ecological research and resemble environmental indicators which have already been proven to be important for species assemblage, richness and population survival. The use of high temporal and moderate spatial resolution {{satellite imagery}} (e. g. MODIS) allows the construction of timeseries using several higher level products, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), or Land Surface Temperature (LST). These datasets provide information on phenology and, compared for several years, land cover change and temporal anomalies. Moreover, using the quality layer of MODIS, quality assessments of the respective remotely sensed data can be conducted and unwanted distortions like clouds, haze or shadow can be masked. With this approach the quality of other temporal datasets (e. g. NOAA AVHRR NDVI) is evaluated. In contrast to <b>monotemporal</b> <b>data,</b> multitemporal variables provide information regarding land cover dynamics and transformations. Considering the historical archives of the NOAA AVHRR sensor dating back to the early 1980 ies, past events can be taken into account to complement the analysis of present land cover patterns. Based on these data sets land cover information can be derived and validated. Meta population models using algorithms by Hanski and Ovaskainen were implemented in the Geographic Ressource Analysis Support System (GRASS) and applied on MODIS timeseries. The required species settings for habitat requirements and dispersal capabilities were provided by zoologists for each species. The model provides a value for the importance of each habitat patch for spatial distribution of the species or functional group in question. Patches can thus be classified as possible sources, sinks or stepping stones for dispersers in a metapopulation. Using MODIS timeseries imagery with an appropriate temporal and spatial resolution for the taxa under investigation the annual and inter annual dynamic of the meta population value of each patch are analysed. By applying meta population models on timeseries satellite data it is feasible to delineate areas of high importance for the persistence of populations in a land scape...|$|E
40|$|Surface soil {{moisture}} {{is a key}} variable to describe water and energy exchanges at the surface/atm interface and measure drought and aridification. The Ts-NDVI space is an effective method to monitor regional surface {{soil moisture}} status. Due to the disturbance of multiple factors, the established dry or wet boundary with <b>monotemporal</b> remote sensing <b>data</b> is unstable. This paper developed a Ts-NDVI triangle space with MODIS NDVI dataset to monitor soil moisture in the Mongolian Plateau in 2000 - 2012. Based on the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), the spatiotemporal variations of drought were studied. The results indicated that (1) the general Ts-NDVI space method is {{an effective way to}} monitor regional soil moisture. However, if the single time space shows perfect structure, there would be no differences between the inverted results of the single time space and the general space. (2) The TVDI calculated in the paper is expected to show the water deficit for the region from low (bare soil) to high (full vegetation cover) NDVI values, and it is found to be in close negative agreement with precipitation and soil moisture; changes in the TVDI are dependent on the water status in the study area. (3) In the Mongolian Plateau, TVDI presented a zonal distribution with changes in Land Use/Land Cover types, vegetation cover, and latitude. Drought was serious in bare land, construction land, and grassland. Drought was widely spread throughout the Mongolian Plateau, and there was aridification in the study period. Vegetation degradation, overgrazing, and climate warming could be considered as the main reasons...|$|R
