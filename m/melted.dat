Whilst it is widely accepted that water leaving the slab causes the magmatism, the method in which the water leaves the slab and causes magmatism is unclear. In this thesis we will examine the hypothesis that water leaving the slab via a large hydraulic fracture will cause instantaneous ‘flash’ <b>melting</b> in the mantle wedge. We will test whether this flash <b>melting</b> occurs and whether it produces sufficient <b>melting.</b> We will also look at hydrous flux <b>melting</b> and hydrous decompression <b>melting</b> occuring after the initial flash <b>melting</b> {{to see if they}} increase the <b>melting.</b> A thermal model for a subduction zone is built, with the wedge flow solved analytically, to provide the temperature input for the <b>melting</b> models. Four <b>melting</b> models were tested; flash <b>melting,</b> flash <b>melting</b> followed by hydrous flux <b>melting,</b> flash <b>melting</b> followed by hydrous decompression <b>melting</b> and flash <b>melting,</b> then hydrous flux <b>melting</b> followed by hydrous decompression <b>melting.</b> Another thermal model was also made with the wedge flow solved numerically, this allowed buoyancy to be added into the model to allow investigation into the magma migrating buoyantly.

40|$|International audienceU-series {{studies in}} oceanic basalts are {{critical}} for understanding <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> extraction in the Earth's mantle. The combined results of a detailed geochemical study of <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> extraction at Theistareykir, northern Iceland, provide {{a strong case for}} <b>melt</b> extraction via channeled <b>melt</b> flow at an active spreading ridge. It has often been argued, however, that widely used <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> extraction models, which simulate channeled <b>melt</b> extraction (i. e. fractional and/or dynamic <b>melting),</b> can only partially explain the global U-series systematics in oceanic basalts. As a consequence, more complicated models have been invoked, which suggest different styles of <b>melt</b> extraction at different depths/pressures in the mantle, so-called “two-porosity models”. Alternatively, diffusion-controlled mechanisms have been proposed. Here we show that U–Th–Pa–Ra systematics in oceanic basalts can indeed be explained by models where <b>melt</b> transport occurs without chemical equilibrium between <b>melt</b> and solid when variations in all three critical <b>melting</b> parameters (residual porosity, upwelling rate of the solid mantle and <b>melt</b> velocity) are taken into account. <b>Melting</b> at ridges requires systematic variation of at least two critical <b>melting</b> parameters, most likely upwelling and <b>melt</b> extraction rate. <b>Melts</b> generated with increasing lateral distance to the ridge axis are generated with slower upwelling rates and are extracted with lower velocities than <b>melts</b> created closer to the ridge axis. <b>Melting</b> at ocean islands, on the other hand, can successfully be explained by variations in upwelling rate only. Global U-series systematics in OIB originate from superimposed global variations in upwelling velocity due to different buoyancy fluxes and from local variation in upwelling velocity as a function of radial distance to the plume center. The model proposed here is consistent with other geochemical data for oceanic basalts and strongly supports <b>melt</b> extraction via high-porosity channels as a general means of <b>melt</b> extraction from the Earth's upper mantle...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} <b>melt</b> onset affects the surface energy uptake {{throughout}} the <b>melt</b> season. Yet the processes triggering <b>melt</b> and causing its large interannual variability {{are not well}} understood. Here we show that <b>melt</b> onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier <b>melt</b> onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at <b>melt</b> onset, indicating that <b>melt</b> is not triggered by SWD. When <b>melt</b> occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding <b>melt.</b> In contrast, when <b>melt</b> begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to <b>melt.</b> Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for <b>melt</b> onset.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the importance of <b>melt</b> migration in shaping major characteristics of geological features associated with the partial <b>melting</b> of the upper mantle, such as sea-floor spreading, continental flood basalts and rifting. The partial <b>melting</b> produces permeable partially molten rocks and a buoyant low viscosity <b>melt.</b> <b>Melt</b> migrates through the partially molten rocks, and transfers mass and heat. Due to its much faster velocity and appreciable buoyancy, <b>melt</b> migration {{has the potential to}} modify dynamics of the upwelling partially molten plumes. I develop a 2 -D, two-phase flow model and apply it to investigate effects of <b>melt</b> migration on the dynamics and <b>melt</b> generation of upwelling mantle plumes and focusing of <b>melt</b> migration beneath mid-ocean ridges. <b>Melt</b> migration changes distribution of the melt-retention buoyancy force and therefore affects the dynamics of the upwelling plume. This is investigated by modeling a plume with a constant initial <b>melt</b> of 10 % where no further <b>melting</b> is considered. <b>Melt</b> migration polarizes melt-retention buoyancy force into high and low <b>melt</b> fraction regions at the top and bottom portions of the plume and therefore results in formation of a more slender and faster upwelling plume. Allowing the plume to <b>melt</b> as it ascends through the upper mantle also produces a slender and faster plume. It is shown that <b>melt</b> produced by decompressional <b>melting</b> of the plume migrates to the upper horizons of the plume, increases the upwelling velocity and thus, the volume of <b>melt</b> generated by the plume. <b>Melt</b> migration produces a plume which lacks the mushroom shape observed for the plume models without <b>melt</b> migration. <b>Melt</b> migration forms a high <b>melt</b> fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable oceanic lithosphere. Using realistic conditions of <b>melting,</b> freezing and <b>melt</b> extraction, I examine whether the high <b>melt</b> fraction layer is able to focus <b>melt</b> from a wide partial <b>melting</b> zone to a narrow region beneath the observed neo-volcanic zone. My models consist of three parts; lithosphere, asthenosphere and a <b>melt</b> extraction region. It is shown that <b>melt</b> migrates vertically within the asthenosphere, and forms a high <b>melt</b> fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable lithosphere. Within the sloping high <b>melt</b> fraction layer, <b>melt</b> migrates laterally towards the ridge. In order to simulate <b>melt</b> migration via crustal fractures and cracks, <b>melt</b> is extracted from a <b>melt</b> extraction region extending {{to the base of the}} crust. Performance of the <b>melt</b> focusing mechanism is not significantly sensitive to the size of <b>melt</b> extraction region, <b>melt</b> extraction threshold and spreading rate. In all of the models, about half of the total <b>melt</b> production freezes beneath the cooling base of the lithosphere, and the rest is effectively focused towards the ridge and forms the crust. To meet the computational demand for a precise tracing of the deforming upwelling plume and including the chemical buoyancy of the partially molten zone in my models, a new numerical method is developed to solve the related pure advection equations. The numerical method is based on Second Moment numerical method of Egan and Mahoney [1972] which is improved to maintain a high numerical accuracy in shear and rotational flow fields. In comparison with previous numerical methods, my numerical method is a cost-effective, non-diffusive and shape preserving method, and it can also be used to trace a deforming body in compressible flow fields...|$|R

Melt-bearing rocks become porous at a few vol % <b>melt</b> initiating an advective flow regime.
