50|$|The 'choke' for constant-depression {{carburettors}} {{such as the}} SU or Stromberg {{does not}} use a choke valve in the air circuit but instead has a mixture enrichment circuit to increase fuel flow by opening the <b>metering</b> <b>jet</b> further or by opening an additional fuel jet or 'enrichment'. Typically used on small engines, notably motorcycles, enrichments work by opening a secondary fuel circuit below the throttle valves. This circuit works exactly like the idle circuit, and when engaged it simply supplies extra fuel when the throttle is closed.|$|E
50|$|When {{the engine}} starts and air {{begins to flow}} through the venturi, the {{pressure}} in the venturi drops according to Bernoulli's principle. This causes the pressure in chamber B to drop. At the same time, air entering the carburetor compresses {{the air in the}} impact tubes, generating a positive pressure based on the density and speed of the air as it enters. The difference in pressure between chamber A and chamber B creates the air metering force which opens the servo valve and allows fuel in. Chamber C and chamber D are connected by a fuel passage which contains the fuel metering jets. As fuel begins to flow, the pressure drop across the <b>metering</b> <b>jet</b> creates the fuel metering force which acts to close the servo valve until a balance is reached with the air pressure and the spring.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} float chamber, and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the float chamber affected this. Fish's design kept the float chamber, but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The float chamber was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the <b>metering</b> <b>jet.</b> This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|E
25|$|Chamber C and chamber D are {{connected}} by a fuel passage which contains the fuel <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> When the mixture control lever is moved from the idle-cutoff position, fuel starts to flow through the <b>metering</b> <b>jets</b> and into chamber D where it becomes metered fuel.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to carry out an investigastion into {{suitable}} alternatives to gasoline for use in modern automobiles. The fuel would provide the western world with a means of extending the natural gasoline resources and the third world a way of cutting down their dependence on the oil producing countries for their energy supply. Alcohols, namely methanol and ethanol, provide this solution. They {{can be used as}} gasoline extenders or as fuels on their own. In order to fulfil the aims of the project a literature study was carried out to investigate methods and costs of producing these fuels. An experimental programme was then set up in which the performance of the alcohols was studied on a conventional engine. The engine used for this purpose was the Fiat 127 930 cc four cylinder engine. This engine was used because of its popularity in the European countries. The Weber fixed jet carburettor, since it was designed to be used with gasoline, was adapted so that the alcohol fuels and the blends could be used in the most efficient way. This was mainly to take account of the lower heat content of the alcohols. The adaptation of the carburettor was in the form of enlarging the main <b>metering</b> <b>jet.</b> Allowances for the alcohol's lower specfic gravity were made during fuel metering. Owing to the low front end volatility of methanol and ethanol, it was expected that `start up' problems would occur. An experimental programme was set up to determine the temperature range for a minimum required percentage `take off' that would ease start-up since it was determined that a `take off' of about 5 % v/v liquid in the vapour phase would be sufficient for starting. Additions such as iso-pentane and n-pentane were used to improve the front end volatility. This proved to be successful. The lower heat content of the alcohol fuels also meant that a greater charge of fuel would be required. This was seen to pose further problems with fuel distribution from the carburettor to the individual cylinders on a multicylinder engine. Since {{it was not possible to}} modify the existing manifold on the Fiat 127 engine, experimental tests on manifold geometry were carried out using the Ricardo E 6 single cylinder variable compression engine. Results from these tests showed that the length, shape and cross-sectional area of the manifold play an important part in the distribution of the fuel entering the cylinder, ie. vapour phase, vapour/small liquid droplet/liquid film phase, vapour/large liquid droplet/liquid film phase etc. The solvent properties of the alcohols and their greater electrical conductivity suggested that the materials used on the engine would be prone to chemical attack. In order to determine the type and rate of chemical attack, an experimental programme was set up whereby carburettor and other components were immersed in the alcohols and in blends of alcohol with gasoline. The test fuels were aerated and in some instances kept at temperatures ranging from 50 oC to 90 oC. Results from these tests suggest that not all materials used in the conventional engine are equally suitable for use with alcohols and alcohol/gasoline blends. Aluminium for instance was severely attacked by methanol causing pitting and pin-holing in the surface. In general this whole experimental programme gave valuable information on the acceptability of substitute fuels. While the long term effects of alcohol use merit further study, it is clear that methanol and ethanol will be increasingly used in place of gasoline...|$|E

5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a float chamber to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor's <b>metering</b> <b>jets,</b> thus a constant pressure.

50|$|A wet nozzle differs in the {{way that}} it takes in both nitrous and fuel which are <b>metered</b> by <b>jets</b> to create a perfect or proper air-fuel ratio (AFR). Proper {{atomisation}} of the fuel and nitrous will ensure consistent power gains.|$|R

50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main <b>metering</b> <b>jets.</b> The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|R

40|$|The {{two stroke}} engine was {{developed}} to obtain a greater output from the same size of engine. The engine mechanism eliminates the valve arrangement making it mechanically simpler. Theoretically a two stroke engine develops twice {{the power of a}} comparable four stroke engine, thus making it more compact. Getting air into an engine is the key to making power and {{there are many ways to}} increase the air flow into the engine. There are such forced induction, nitrous system, better port and valve shapes to improve flow. But for this study the technique that has been selected were the better port size. The claims that this where the harnessing the inertia of the airs velocity to better fill the cylinders. Modification in intake port is made. Also use of different fuel <b>metering</b> <b>jets</b> is used for different A/F mixtures. At various throttle positions and with torque and speed as input,performance parameters of engine are calculated. Based on the results various performance curves are plotted. The objective of the project is to determine how much power improvement with the modification in intake system in compared to the original intake system. Modification to the engine without additional system attach tothe engine operation were the best solution to have an optimum engine operation in term of torque and horsepower. To optimize the power and intake port flow produce by the engine modification were through avery limited value. The value is limited due to the restricted area of the engine production by the manufacturer. Hence modification must be planned carefully as over modification of the inlet port can end up with a device slower than its stock counterpart...|$|R
50|$|A velocity-type meter {{measures}} {{the velocity of}} flow through a meter of a known internal capacity. The speed of the flow can then be converted into volume of flow to determine the usage. There are several types of meters that measure water flow velocity, including <b>jet</b> <b>meters</b> (single-jet and multi-jet), turbine meters, propeller meters and mag meters. Most velocity-based meters have an adjustment vane for calibrating the meter to the required accuracy.|$|R
40|$|To {{accomplish}} {{the removal of}} warm fog about an area such as an airport runway, a plurality of nozzles along a line adjacent the area propelled water jets through the fog to heights of approximately twenty-five <b>meters.</b> Each water <b>jet</b> breaks up forming a water drop size distribution that falls through the fog overtaking, colliding, and coalescing with individual fog droplets and thereby removes the fog. A water retrieval system is used to collect the water {{and return it to}} reservoirs for pumping it to the nozzles once again...|$|R
50|$|A {{multiple}} <b>jet</b> or multijet <b>meter</b> is a velocity type meter {{which has}} an impeller which rotates horizontally on a vertical shaft. The impeller element is in a housing in which multiple inlet ports direct the fluid flow at the impeller causing it to rotate in a specific direction {{in proportion to the}} flow velocity. This meter works mechanically much like a single <b>jet</b> <b>meter</b> except that the ports direct the flow at the impeller equally from several points around the circumference of the element, not just one point; this minimizes uneven wear on the impeller and its shaft. Thus these types of meters are recommended to be installed horizontally with its roller index pointing skywards.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Hamilton {{developed}} {{the technology to}} accurately <b>meter</b> fuel in <b>jet</b> engines, and its fuel controls were employed on Boeing 707's and Douglas DC-8's {{as well as most}} other Pratt & Whitney jet engines. In 1952 Hamilton Standard opened its plant in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. In 1958 Hamilton's first environmental control system entered service on the Convair 880. In 1968 Hamilton began delivering automatic, electronic systems for control of cabin pressure in aircraft. Hamilton's mechanical fuel controls, in use since the 1950s, evolved into electronically controlled fuel controls and, eventually, to Full Authority Digital Electronic Controls (FADEC) for jet engines and are in use today on many commuter, airline, and military engine applications. Hamilton's environmental systems and early association with NASA were highlighted in the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing - supported by environmental control, fuel cell, and life support systems manufactured by Hamilton Standard.|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} community has known about Fluidic Oscillation as a measurement technology for many years. Recent advances in this technology now {{make this a}} highly robust, cost-effective solution to metering needs. This paper will discuss the advances and benefits. Based on Bernoulli’s Theory- A slow moving high pressure gas becomes fast moving low pressure gas at the nozzle exit forming a jet of gas. The jet, once formed can be controlled by the Coanda effect using an obstacle in the flow {{that is designed to}} optimize the performance of the <b>meter.</b> Controlling the <b>jet</b> path enables formation of feedback nodes of pressure {{on either side of the}} jet. This provides a predictable oscillation of the jet. The metrology of the meter is only related to the mechanical design of the oscillation chamber and flow tranquilizer.

In addition to the commonly known benefits of static metering (no moving parts and possible integrated volume correction and AMR), fluidic oscillation provides high rangeability and tolerates dirty gas...|$|R
