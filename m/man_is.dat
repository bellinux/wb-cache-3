5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E

The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland.

5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations.

Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
