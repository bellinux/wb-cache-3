40|$|We have {{investigated}} <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> globular cluster (GC) {{systems in the}} fiducial semi-analytic galaxy formation model of Cole et al. We assume that GCs are formed at high-redshift (z > 5) in proto-galactic fragments, and during the subsequent gas-rich merging of these fragments. We find that <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal-rich GCs are dependent upon host galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity, whereas <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal-poor GCs are not. We find that gaseous merging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proto-galactic fragments leads to a significant age-spread amongst the metal-rich GCs, which increases for lower-luminosity galaxies. We find the total GC populations scale with host galaxy luminosity as L^ 1. 25, due to the systematic increase in the mass-to-light ratios (with mass) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy haloes in the model.
