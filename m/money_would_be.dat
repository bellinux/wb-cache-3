The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia {{to be placed}} in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Following a lost {{vote in the}} Scottish Parliament, the SNP-led {{minority}} Scottish Government {{agreed to}} continue the line {{from the airport to}} Leith on condition that no more public <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supplied. A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498 million, £375 million in funding from the Scottish Government and £45 million from Edinburgh Council.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E

5000|$|The UN Security Council proposes Resolution 706, a [...] "food for oil" [...] resolution, {{allowing}} Iraq {{to export}} up to $1.6bn of oil, the revenue from which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> paid into a UN-administered account.

5|$|Hsu may in {{fact have}} been running {{multiple}} cons on a massive scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E
5|$|The winning {{candidates}} were informed {{of their success}} in an e-mail from NRP and were also sent various contracts to sign and return.

The contracts stated that their food, accommodation and leisure <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> provided, and that they were to meet in London on 10 June 2002 for the programme to begin filming. Each contestant was also told to set up a new bank account to which Russian could have access and to arrive without money or credit cards on the launch day.|$|E
5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E

5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to be paid by Laing by the September deadline. When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the money would barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing. In September, Rigel Entertainment declared bankruptcy. On October 26, GEDCA board met and established that Laing {{had made a}} partial late payment of $75,000 on the $150,000 still outstanding. A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013. Laing missed the January deadline, but in late February, GEDCA reported receiving the money, thus bringing the lawsuit to a close.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> passed on to businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{major news}} conference {{regarding}} the fishery at The Rooms in St. John's. Along with cabinet ministers and industry officials, Dunderdale {{announced that the}} federal and provincial governments would be investing $400 million, over three years, into the fishery. The federal government portion of the money totalled $280 million while the provincial portion was $120 million. The money is compensation for the province eliminating minimum processing requirements for the European Union. Although the premier said that her government plans to work with industry officials on how the <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent, she {{said it would be}} invested into such things as research and development, new marketing initiatives and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed to keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled {{the presidents of the}} other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Belahcen Fitzgerald found a {{property}} to rent and registered Amal Women's Training Center and Moroccan Restaurant as a non-profit organization. In early 2013 the center {{raised more than}} $7300 through crowdfunding on RocketHub, exceeding its $5000 goal. The money was used to purchase kitchen equipment and to ensure the kitchen was up to code. The restaurant opened in April 2013, and in July 2013, the center was awarded a three-year grant by the Drosos Foundation {{with the goal of}} making the program self-sustaining by 2016. The first group of trainees began training in February 2014. Within the first month of operation, several of the restaurant's customers had expressed interest in hiring future Amal graduates to work at local hotels and restaurants. The center completed a second round of crowdfunding on RocketHub in 2014, raising more than $9600. In October 2015 the center was awarded €25,000 by the Orange Foundation. Belahcen Fitzgerald stated that the prize <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used to help women start their own catering micro businesses.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolt of}} 1381 {{broke out in}} Essex, {{following}} the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May. Bampton {{was a member of}} Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles. He based himself in Brentwood and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, Fobbing and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June. The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks. Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forthcoming. When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out. Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed. Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|The two {{chambers}} {{announced that}} their negotiations had reached an impasse {{just days before}} the constitutionally mandated end of the session on April 15, but Bevin insisted he would not call a special legislative session for them to continue negotiations. Just before 3:00a.m. on April 14, negotiators announced they had reached a compromise that would cut public universities' budgets by 4.5 percent over the biennium instead of the 9 percent requested by Bevin and implement a performance-based funding model in 2017. The <b>money</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reallocated to contribute over $1 billion toward the state pension system's liabilities, which exceeded $30 billion. Republicans agreed to fund a Democratic proposal for a scholarship program providing free community college tuition for qualified students, relented on their demands to stop state funding for Planned Parenthood, and spared the state's prevailing wage guidelines. Bevin signed the budget, but used his line-item veto to strip funding for the scholarship program {{in the first year of}} the biennium, saying the guidelines were poorly written and should be revised before implementing the program in 2017. Because of the constitutional prohibition against the legislative session extending past April 15, the General Assembly was unable to override the veto.|$|E
