50|$|Linguistic {{universals}} are {{patterns that}} can be seen cross linguistically. Universals can either be absolute, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> every documented language exhibits this characteristic, or statistical, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> this characteristic is seen in most languages or is probable in most languages. Universals, both absolute and statistical can be unrestricted, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> they apply to most or all languages without any additional conditions. Conversely, both absolute and statistical universals can be restricted or implicational, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> a characteristic will be true on the condition of something else (if Y characteristic is true, then X characteristic is true).|$|R
50|$|Leptons are {{particles}} of spin-, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> they are fermions. They carry an electric charge of −1 e (charged leptons) or 0 e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry colour charge, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> {{they do not}} experience the strong interaction. Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> {{they are subject to}} the weak interaction. Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.|$|R
50|$|Some gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are {{classified}} as organic, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> they are produced by living organisms. Others are inorganic, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.|$|R
25|$|Filipino has the {{following}} composite characters: á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û. The actual use of diacritics for Filipino, however, is rare, and is meant only {{to distinguish between}} homonyms with different stresses and <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> either occur near {{each other in a}} text or to aid the reader in ascertaining its otherwise ambiguous meaning. Sometimes appears in Spanish loanwords and names if Spanish orthography is observed.|$|E
25|$|From a {{morphological}} {{point of}} view, some compound verbs {{are difficult to}} analyze because several derivations are plausible. Blacklist, for instance, might be analyzed as an adjective+verb compound, or as an adjective+noun compound that becomes a verb through zero derivation. Most compound verbs originally have the collective meaning of both components, {{but some of them}} later gain additional <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> may supersede the original, emergent sense. Therefore, sometimes the resultant meanings are seemingly barely related to the original contributors.|$|E
25|$|Discourses in Tunisian Arabic {{are likely}} to use some rhetorical styles like metaphors. Furthermore, Tunisian Arabic styles and tenses hold several figurative meanings. For example, the use of past tense can mean that the {{situation}} is uncontrollable. As well, the use of the third person pronouns can be figurative to mean saints and/or supernatural beings and the use of demonstrative can have figurative meanings like underestimation. Moreover, the name of some parts of the body can be used in several expressions to get figurative <b>meanings.</b> <b>That</b> is entitled the embodiment.|$|E

25|$|Yaska, in {{his famous}} text titled Nirukta, asserts that Rigveda in the ancient tradition, can be {{interpreted}} in three ways - {{from the perspective of}} religious rites (adhiyajna), {{from the perspective of the}} deities (adhidevata), and from the perspective of the soul (adhyatman). The fourth way to interpret the Rigveda also emerged in the ancient times, wherein the gods mentioned were viewed as symbolism for legendary individuals or narratives. It was generally accepted that creative poets often embed and express double meanings, ellipses and novel ideas to inspire the reader. Nirukta enables one to identify alternate embedded <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> poets and writers may have included in old texts.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of the birds {{has long been a}} topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic chickens have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and they respond to these alarm calls appropriately. However, a language has, in addition to words, grammar (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult due to the range of possible interpretations. Research on parrots by Irene Pepperberg is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Studies on starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures.|$|E
25|$|Maize is {{preferred}} in formal, scientific, and international usage because it refers specifically {{to this one}} grain, unlike corn, which has a complex variety of <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> vary by context and geographic region. Maize is used by agricultural bodies and research institutes such as the FAO and CSIRO. National agricultural and industry associations often include the word maize in their name even in English-speaking countries where the local, informal word is something other than maize; for example, the Maize Association of Australia, the Indian Maize Development Association, the Kenya Maize Consortium and Maize Breeders Network, the National Maize Association of Nigeria, the Zimbabwe Seed Maize Association. However, in commodities trading, corn consistently refers to maize and not other grains.|$|E

25|$|Following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the {{predominant}} anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth {{as a form}} of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.|$|E
25|$|The term is used {{in various}} {{different}} ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book entitled Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, {{but in some cases}} the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors. Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in {{sense of right and wrong}} from the average person.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E
50|$|At Level 1, {{both the}} {{intercepts}} and slopes in the groups {{can be either}} fixed (<b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> all groups have the same values, although {{in the real world}} this would be a rare occurrence), non-randomly varying (<b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> the intercepts and/or slopes are predictable from an independent variable at Level 2), or randomly varying (<b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> the intercepts and/or slopes are different in the different groups, and that each have their own overall mean and variance).|$|R
5000|$|These {{techniques}} can be sound, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> the verified properties can be logically deduced from the semantics, or unsound, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no}} such guarantee. A sound technique yields a result only once it has searched the entire space of possibilities. An example of an unsound technique is one that searches only a subset of the possibilities, for instance only integers up to a certain number, and give a [...] "good-enough" [...] result. Techniques can also be decidable, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> their algorithmic implementations are guaranteed to terminate with an answer, or undecidable, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> they may never terminate. Because they are bounded, unsound techniques are often more likely to be decidable than sound ones.|$|R

25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

500|$|Naming {{the train}} was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd. [...] He wanted a name that started with the letter Z because this train was {{intended}} to be the [...] "last word" [...] in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither zymurgy nor zyzzle conveyed the <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> Budd was looking for. [...] The name of the new train came from The Canterbury Tales, which Budd had been reading. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by Zephyrus, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd thought that would be an excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine—Zephyr.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to having a Hamiltonian cycle, the square of a 2-vertex-connected graph G must also be Hamiltonian connected (<b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> it has a Hamiltonian path starting and ending at any two designated vertices) and 1-Hamiltonian (<b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> if any vertex is deleted, the remaining graph still has a Hamiltonian cycle). It must also be vertex pancyclic, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> for every vertex v and every integer k with 3 ≤ k ≤ |V(G)|, there exists a cycle of length k containing v.|$|R

500|$|Pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty {{summarized}} the practical effects: Even for moral guardians of Breen's dedication, however, film censorship {{can be a}} tricky business. Images must be cut, dialogue overdubbed or deleted, and explicit messages and subtle implications excised from what the argot of film criticism calls the [...] "diegesis". Put simply, the diegesis is {{the world of the}} film, the universe inhabited by the characters existing in the landscape of cinema. [...] "Diegetic" [...] elements are experienced by the characters in the film and (vicariously) by the spectator; [...] "nondiegetic" [...] elements are apprehended by the spectator alone.... The job of the motion picture censor is to patrol the diegesis, keeping an eye and ear out for images, languages, and <b>meanings</b> <b>that</b> should be banished from the world of film.... The easiest part of the assignment is to connect the dots and connect what is visually and verbally forbidden by name. … More challenging is the work of the textual analysis and narrative rehabilitation that discerns and redirects hidden lessons and moral meanings.|$|E

[...] This reviewer noted that Garfunkel's voice was noticeably restrained in high passages, though still harmonious, and that the evening's only weak spot was the [...] "Kodachrome"/"Maybellene" [...] medley, because neither singer could raise the right level of emotion for the rock songs. A Billboard reviewer wrote in March 1982, [...] "This 19 song, two record set gloriously recaptures the past with sterling renditions {{of most of the}} duo's classics as well as a few of Simon's solo compositions filled out by Garfunkel's harmony." [...] However, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice dismissed the album as [...] "a corporate boondoggle—a classy way for Warner Bros. artist Simon to rerecord, rerelease, and resell the catalogue CBS is sitting on." [...] He felt Simon had been better off without Garfunkel since 1971 and quipped, [...] "live doubles are live doubles, nostalgia is nostalgia, wimps are wimps, and who needs any of 'em?" ...|$|E
