40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a method called MODULAR MENU MAPPING, which rationalizes menu layout and trades menu hit-test {{time with a}} look up table, thereby reducing the cost of determining the <b>menu</b> <b>box</b> inclusion of the cursor to a single unit of time. To overcome the problem of space required to store the look-up table, a hybrid method called RUN-LENGTH ENCODING is introduced. It reduces the storage space requirements by substituting the two-dimensional look-up table with a linear vector. It does however, require some search, which is nevertheless still much cheaper then the full search of a non-mapped men...|$|E

The content is provided here unedited by the Idaho Geological Survey. Additional information is available in his Ph. D. dissertation: Russell, Charles W., 1988, Crystallization history of the Banks complex: Implications for middle crustal evolution in Cordilleran batholithic terranes: University of Washington Ph. D. dissertation, 226 p. This document has been formatted for on-screen viewing using either Adobe Acrobat, or the Adobe Acrobat reader. If printed, it will be approximately 60 pages in length. Printing may not be necessary. 1. All figures and tables have been collected {{at the end of}} the text, but are accessible within the text from the blue boxes. Once you are done ex-amining a figure, if you "right-click " on a figure, you will bring up a <b>menu</b> <b>box</b> with "Go to previ-ous view " as one of the options. Use of this op-tion will allow you to quickly switch between fig-ures and text. 2. Figures have been reduced in size and strongly compressed to limit download times- larger versions of these figures are available upon re-quest. Note that Adobe Acrobat will allow you to magnify a figure up to 200 %. For line draw-ings, all relevant detail should be recoverable using this method (some photographic detail may not be recoverable).

[...] While EpiInfo has many statistical procedures, correlation is not one of them. Rather correlation is found by regression. [...] This means that EpiInfo will not produce a single table showing correlations among multiple variables. According to the Zelig installation manual, use of Zelig requires that R and several of its libraries already be installed, and the installation also requires some degree of background in R. One limit of MicrOsiris is in handling the output.

The interpreter {{is equipped with a}} command expander to provide parameter checking, default handling and command control without the burden of the C punctuation. The command expander operates on a command description file which is a text file containing per routine; type, default and range or legal values of its arguments.
