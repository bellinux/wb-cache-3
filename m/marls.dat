5|$|Blackdown and Sampford Commons have {{extensive}} surviving {{examples of the}} heathland, carr woodland and marshy grassland habitats that have developed on the acidic soils overlying the Greensand and Keuper <b>Marls</b> of the Blackdown Hills. The heathland supports a typical invertebrate fauna, including {{a wide variety of}} butterfly species, and with spiders notably abundant. The site is regionally important for birds which favour heathland habitats.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marls</b> was colonized by pioneer species, then {{shrubs and}} trees, {{corresponding}} to a primary succession. Without human intervention, a climax community would be reached. This dynamic may {{eventually lead to}} the disappearance of related open environments, particularly heritage species. However woodlands can also {{play an important role}} in creating habitat for many species. The management plan is therefore to maintain patch dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red sandstones, <b>marls</b> and conglomerates. It rises as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Marl</b> was {{extensively}} mined in Central New Jersey as a {{soil conditioner}} in the 1800s. In 1863, {{the most common}} <b>marl</b> was blue <b>marl.</b> While the specific composition and properties of the <b>marl</b> varied depending on what layer it was found in, blue <b>marl</b> was generally composed of 38.70% silicic acid and sand, 30.67% oxide of iron, 13.91% carbonate of lime, 11.22% water, 4.47% potash, 1.21% magnesia, 1.14% phosphoric acid, and [...]31% sulphuric acid.|$|R
5|$|The Triassic rocks {{consist of}} red <b>marls,</b> sandstones, breccias and {{conglomerates}} which {{spread over the}} older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic Beds are full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are famous for their fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source of lime for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative building stone. Blue Lias {{is believed to have}} been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local cement works closed.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by shortening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker <b>marls</b> and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, leading to folds at different stratigraphic levels have different locations, orientations or wavelengths. Earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the same}} {{sedimentary}} types {{are present in}} the <b>marls</b> as are in the waterstones but with less arenaceous and more argillaceous material. An irregular rhythm is discernible, each sedimentary cycle is well developed and have banded or stippled beds at the base. It is in this banded stratum that features such as sun cracks are found. Ripple marks are less common but they are evidence of deposition in shallow water. Pitting sometimes found has been linked to rain pitting but may have occurred during the de-gassing of the <b>marls</b> during drying out. The banded strata which may be red or grey pass up into blocky unstratified mudstones (broken up and allowed to resettle before consolidation).|$|E

25|$|In the Lower Eocene, Basin {{conditions}} became restricted, {{producing an}} alternating dolomite and anhydrite sequence with a consistent thickness. The mid-Eocene saw {{development of a}} wide carbonate platform, richly nummulitic, also constant in thickness. There are argillaceous limestone interbeds, marl, and occasional calcareous sandstones. The Late Eocene reflects more frequent lateral variations of interbedded limestones, dolomites, <b>marls,</b> and shales.|$|E
25|$|Underlying {{the upper}} reaches of the Trent, are {{formations}} of Millstone Grit and Carboniferous Coal Measures which include layers of sandstones, <b>marls</b> and coal seams. The river crosses a band of Triassic Sherwood sandstone at Sandon, and it meets the same sandstone again as it flows beside Cannock Chase, between Great Haywood and Armitage, there is also another outcrop between Weston-on-Trent and King's Mill.|$|E
25|$|The geology of {{the area}} {{consists}} of thick sandstones and <b>marls</b> formed in desert conditions in the Triassic period, some 250 million years ago, and thin-bedded sandstones and shales formed 300million {{years ago in the}} Carboniferous period.

25|$|The {{territory}} of Rodez {{is packed with}} geological diversity. It straddles on the ancient base of Ségala composed of acidic siliceous earths of Les Rougiers to soil consisting of red argillite, and causses composed of limestones and <b>marls.</b> The city was built on a conical isolated terrain, locally called Le Piton, and gradually spread to the surrounding slopes. It {{is located in a}} level 2 zone of seismicity, in other words at a low level.|$|E
25|$|Geologically, the Golan plateau and the Hauran {{plain to}} the east {{constitute}} a Holocene volcanic field that also extends northeast almost to Damascus. Much of the area is scattered with dormant volcanos, as well as cinder cones, such as Majdal Shams. The plateau also contains a crater lake, called Birkat Ram ("Ram Pool"), which is fed by both surface runoff and underground springs. These volcanic areas are characterised by basalt bedrock and dark soils derived from its weathering. The basalt flows overlie older, distinctly lighter-colored limestones and <b>marls,</b> exposed along the Yarmouk River in the south.|$|E
25|$|Crystalline rocks crop out {{at several}} capes; Cretaceous limestones, {{containing}} an abundant and specific fauna of gigantic ammonites, occur at Dui {{on the west}} coast; and Tertiary conglomerates, sandstones, <b>marls</b> and clays, folded by subsequent upheavals, are found {{in many parts of}} the island. The clays, which contain layers of good coal and an abundant fossil vegetation, show that during the Miocene period, Sakhalin formed part of a continent which comprised north Asia, Alaska and Japan, and enjoyed a comparatively warm climate. The Pliocene deposits contain a mollusc fauna more Arctic than that which exists at the present time, indicating that the connection between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans was probably broader than it is now.|$|E

25|$|Soil in {{the borough}} is principally of poor to {{moderate}} agricultural quality although high grade land {{is present in}} pockets. The south of the borough has acid soils and gravels, but poorly drained clays predominate in the north. Most of the borough is covered {{by a series of}} clays and <b>marls,</b> with sandy and lignitic beds, part of the Bracklesham Group of beds. As well as clay soils, the Bracklesham Beds result in some bands of sandy soil to the north of West End, and podzol soils around the M27 motorway west of Hedge End and on small areas of the gravels on top of the beds themselves. However most of the soil over the beds is more fertile brown earth.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Jurassic, {{extension}} {{at the west}} Australian margin initiated simple shear mechanics creating a system of listric normal faults near the eastern region of the Exmouth Plateau. These listric faults were a product from {{the development of a}} major low angle detachment fault between a sedimentary base of Permian-Triassic upper crust and the mid-crustal horizon. As a result, brittle deformation and crustal thinning in the upper crust of the eastern Exmouth Plateau occurred, while in the west, the lower crystalline crust and lithosphere experienced shear stress and thinning. The formation of the fault system closer to the coast caused the initial development of the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier sub-basins of the Northern Carnarvon Basin. Carbonate marine sediment, primarily <b>marls,</b> continued to be deposited at this time on the central and western portions of the plateau. Closer to the shoreline siliciclastic mud and silt were deposited from marine and deltaic environments.|$|E
25|$|An extensional {{regime in}} the early Permian is {{believed}} to have initiated major faults which were to form the basin margins, the most notable of these is the Wem-Red Rock fault system in the east. Subsidence related to this fault movement heralded the beginning of basin formation and of infilling by early Permian sediments, the distribution of which is thought to have been controlled by the NE-SW faults parallel to the Wem-Red Rock faults. Basal Permian breccias deposited as alluvial fans lie unconformably. Manchester <b>Marls</b> represent a brief transgression into marine conditions in the mid Permian, their distribution and increased thickness of Permian sediments in the north indicates a depositional centre towards the north or northeast of the basin at this time. Basin subsidence was initiated in the early Triassic when subsidence related to movements on the faults on the eastern margins of the Worcester and Cheshire basins led to a connection between them and to the evolution of a drainage system with rivers sourced in the Variscan foreland.|$|E
