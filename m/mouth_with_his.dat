5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|Maddux {{established}} himself as the Cubs' ace in 1989, winning 19 games, including a September game at Montreal's Olympic Stadium that clinched the Cubs' second-ever National League Eastern Division championship. Manager Don Zimmer tabbed him to start Game One of the National League Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed eight runs and was relieved after surrendering Will Clark's grand slam home run with two outs in the fourth. Maddux believed that just before the grand slam, Clark was able to read his lips during a conference at the mound between Maddux and Zimmer, and so knew what pitch to expect. After that incident, Maddux always covered his <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> glove during conversations on the mound. Maddux took a no-decision in Game Four; the Cubs ended up losing the NLCS four-games-to-one.|$|E
25|$|After hosting and {{performing}} in the American Idol Christmas special in 2003, Aiken has had several subsequent hosting jobs. He {{was a special}} correspondent for The Insider for the 2005 Emmy Awards, and on the sets of the sitcom Reba with Reba McEntire and Dancing With the Stars. He co-hosted The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet in 2006, and on November 17, 2006, filled in for Regis Philbin as guest host on Live with Regis and Kelly. During an interview, Aiken covered Kelly Ripa's <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand. The incident drew considerable media reaction after Ripa complained at length about the incident on her show the following Monday. Aiken made fun of the controversy on the 2006 American Music Awards the next night with Tori Spelling. On The Tyra Banks Show in 2006, filmed before the Ripa incident, Aiken mentioned wanting to have his own talk show someday, and Banks switched seats with him and let him interview her for one segment of the show. Aiken was a guest judge on the April 8, 2009 segment of Banks show America's Next Top Model; in what the show refers to as a teach, he worked with the remaining 8 contestants on their acting skills prior to the judging.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cooper, {{putting a}} huge hand over <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{struggled}} nobly <b>with</b> <b>his</b> feelings.|$|R
60|$|He {{then came}} close to her, and spoke into her ear. Whilst he spoke he held her head to <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> both <b>his</b> hands. Strange {{expressions}} came over her face; the workings of her mouth were painful to observe. Still he held her and whispered on.|$|R
50|$|In his soloing, Blackmore {{combines}} blues {{scales and}} phrasing with dominant minor scales and ideas from European classical music. While playing he would often put the pick in <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> playing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fingers. He occasionally uses the diatonic scale, with rapidly changing tonality.|$|R
500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand for fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season. He also said that he was unfazed by the pressure he supposedly has on his shoulders going into the final, with new high expectations of him from his home supporters after his amazing performance against Germany.|$|E
2500|$|When Xiang Yu grew older, Xiang Liang killed {{someone so}} they fled to Wu (吳; present-day {{southern}} Jiangsu) {{to evade the}} authorities. At the time, Qin Shi Huang was on an inspection tour in that area and Xiang Yu and his uncle watched the emperor's procession pass by. Xiang Yu said, [...] "I can replace him.". Xiang Liang was shocked and immediately covered his nephew's <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand. Since then, Xiang Liang began to see his nephew in a different light.|$|E

5000|$|Wake Forest University's mascot, the Demon Deacon, {{appears in}} a {{commercial}} featuring David Wright of the New York Mets, wherein Wright, John Anderson, and Neil Everett lampoon the baseball practice of covering the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> the glove while speaking on the field so that the opposing team cannot read the speaker's lips — they discuss where they are to meet for a party later that evening while covering their <b>mouths,</b> Wright <b>with</b> <b>his</b> glove, the anchors with folders.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did you ever, Muster Gashford,' whispered Dennis, with {{a horrible}} kind of admiration, {{such as that}} with which a cannibal might regard his {{intimate}} friend, when hungry,--'did you ever--and here he drew still closer to his ear, and fenced <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> both <b>his</b> open bands--'see such a throat as his? Do but cast your eye upon it. There's a neck for stretching, Muster Gashford!' ...|$|R
60|$|The first terrier {{was back}} upon him, {{and he was}} {{whirling}} to meet it, when a new and equally unprovoked assault was made upon him. This time it was Captain Duncan, in a rage at sight of his slain cat. The instep of his foot caught Michael squarely under the chest, half knocking the breath out of him and wholly lifting him into the air, so that he fell heavily on his side. The two terriers were upon him, filling their <b>mouths</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> straight, wiry hair as they sank their teeth in. Still on his side, as {{he was beginning to}} struggle to his feet, he clipped his jaws together on a leg of one, who screamed with pain and retreated on three legs, holding up the fourth, a fore leg, the bone of which Michael's teeth had all but crushed.|$|R
6000|$|Copple circled his <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{hands and}} {{bellowed}} to the Haughts: [...] "Climb! Climb! Hurry! Hurry! He's just above you--under that bluff." ...|$|E

60|$|Before Rob could stammer {{a word in}} answer, Captain Cuttle turned out, all in a heap, {{and covered}} the boy's <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{who showed}} me these things {{was a good}} man," [...] {{continued}} Cheenbuk. [...] "I do not know his name, but I liked him much. Yet I think he was not wise to fill <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> smoke and <b>his</b> inside <b>with</b> sickness." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pritchett nearly {{closed his}} eyes, and almost opened <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and sat <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hands {{resting on his}} stomach before him, {{as though he were}} much too humble to have any hopes of his own.|$|R
5000|$|In the event, Pastorius {{spent more}} of his {{creative}} attention on the Word of <b>Mouth</b> project, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> only writing for the Weather Report album being his contribution to a single group-composed piece. Shorter (who only contributed one whole composition to the 1982 album beyond group-written work) was already taking a more philosophical approach. He later commented, [...] "for {{a long time in}} Weather Report, I abstained. I elected not to do things." ...|$|R
60|$|Macheson {{was taken}} too {{completely}} by surprise to frame an immediate answer. Stephen Hurd rose slowly to his feet, dabbing his <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|The count {{leaned across}} the table, and struck the man full in the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> open palm, and then the others closed in between them.|$|E
60|$|And as Ralph {{covered his}} nose and <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> handkerchief, {{he could see a}} black vapor, almost like smoke, arising {{from the mouth of the}} well.|$|E
6000|$|Thus adjured, {{the young}} savage opened <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wide, pointed <b>with</b> <b>his</b> finger down his throat, then {{up at the}} sky, spread both hands abroad in a vague manner, and exclaimed [...] "ho!" [...] as though to say, [...] "that's plain enough, surely!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{from the}} Turf Hill estate of Rochdale, Castree lived in nearby Shaw and Crompton {{and was a}} taxi driver for many years. He was unpopular <b>with</b> <b>his</b> neighbours, {{who said he had}} a very nasty temper. His former wife said [...] "he was foul <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and foul <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fists".|$|R
60|$|Immediately he was marched {{out of the}} {{conservatory}} {{at the point of}} a walking-stick, and made to hop down to the river, into whose waters he splashed, and we saw him no more. We regret to say that the popular indignation was so precipitate in its results; otherwise the special artist who sketched Hum, the son of Buz, intended to have made a sketch of the old villain, as he sat <b>with</b> <b>his</b> luckless victim's hind legs projecting from <b>his</b> solemn <b>mouth.</b> <b>With</b> all <b>his</b> moral faults, he was a good sitter, and would probably have sat immovable any length of time that could be desired.|$|R
60|$|But he got no further. Carthoris guessed what {{he would}} have said, and before the words could be uttered he had sprung forward and struck the man across the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> open palm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, did it strike your ladyship {{that she}} was like anybody?" [...] asks Mr. Guppy, {{crossing}} his arms, holding his head on one side, and scratching {{the corner of his}} <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> memoranda.|$|E
60|$|Isaac, {{believing he}} was on the point of telling what he knew {{regarding}} the seizure of boats, covered the boy's <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand, for he was not minded to give the enemy any information.|$|E
50|$|Alongside {{his passion}} for painting, Otto Müller also took {{pleasure}} in musical improvisation.

5000|$|Frank and Louie {{was born}} with one brain, but had two faces, two mouths, two noses and three blue eyes.

6000|$|Presently Neale espied General Lodge {{leaning out}} of a window of his car. He was waving. Neale pointed down at his feet, at the solid masonry; and then, {{circling}} his <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hands, he yelled with all his might: ...|$|E
60|$|Erickson paused. He {{licked his}} thick lips, his eyes blank and lidded, like a toad's. At last {{he rubbed his}} <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand and reached down, lifting up the sample case. He {{set it on the}} table in front of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prod him!" [...] yelled Dave, and Ben {{promptly}} did as requested, {{catching the}} bull in the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> stick. Then, as the animal turned aside, Dave jumped closer, {{put out his}} stick, and caught the improvised hook in the nose ring.|$|E
60|$|Enlarging the {{aperture}} by pushing the earth through between the braces while he covered <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and nose <b>with</b> <b>his</b> blouse, he crept {{back to the}} drift, unfastened his cap-lamp, removed the safety screen, and placed {{the light in the}} passage after raising the wick a trifle.|$|R
5000|$|Rollino {{also became}} known as a strongman, moving more than a ton, bending nails <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and coins <b>with</b> <b>his</b> bare hands.

60|$|As erewhile recounted, {{not being}} on the best terms in Mardi with the King of Dominora, Media saw fit to draw nigh unto his dominions in haughty state; he (Media) being upon {{excellent}} terms with himself.
