5000|$|The opinion by Justice Stevens {{noted that}} under the FTDA {{the owner of a}} {{trademark}} may obtain an injunction if another person's commercial use of a <b>mark</b> <b>or</b> <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> [...] "causes dilution of the distinctive quality" [...] of the famous mark. As the definition of dilution in the FTDA is described as the [...] "lessening of the capacity of the famous mark" [...] and [...] "likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception," [...] the Court held that the FTDA requires proof of actual dilution. However, this proof did not necessarily include actual loss of sales or profit, as the Fourth Circuit had held. Instead, the owner of the trademark could use surveys or other circumstantial evidence of dilution. As Victoria's Secret did not provide evidence of actual dilution, the judgment of the circuit court was reversed.|$|E
