An't for is not may also have filled a gap {{as an extension of}} the already-used conjugations for to be not. Jonathan Swift used an't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella (1710–13): It an't <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> 'tis Patrick's fault; pray now don't blame Presto.|$|E

25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I had to say was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. It was <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Los Angeles Times, music {{journalist}} Randall Roberts {{was critical}} of the nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards, particularly for the Album of the Year category, noting the exclusion of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, [...] "the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record", as a snub in favor of nominating less substantial albums. West, who was vocal in his displeasure with past award snubs, responded onstage during a concert on the Watch the Throne Tour, saying [...] "That's <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> for dropping Watch the Throne and Dark Fantasy the same year. I should've just spaced it out, {{just a little bit}} more." ...|$|E
500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> badly composed, <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E

500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|The term brostep {{has been}} used by some as a slight pejorative {{descriptor}} for a style of popular Americanised dubstep. US and Canadian artists often drew inspiration from British brostep producers who tended to work less with sub-bass and more with mid-range sounds such as Caspa, Rusko, and Vex'd. Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that [...] "brostep is sort of <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> but now I've started to hate it in a way... It's like someone screaming in your face... you don't want that." [...] According to a BBC review of his 2012 album Songs, the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a [...] "Jamaican inheritance" [...] and distance it from the [...] "belching, aggressive, resolutely macho" [...] dubstep produced by his contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E

500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. It was <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E

500|$|In the 1985 season, {{the team}} {{improved}} further, posting an 11–5 record {{and making the}} playoffs as a wild card team. They {{went on to become}} the first team in NFL history to advance to the Super Bowl by winning three playoff games on the road, defeating the New York Jets 26–14, the Los Angeles Raiders 27–20, and the Miami Dolphins 31–14. It was the first time the Patriots had beaten the Dolphins at the Orange Bowl (Miami's then-home stadium) since 1966, Miami's first season as a franchise. The Patriots had lost to the Dolphins there 18 consecutive times, including a 30–27 loss in Week 15 of the regular season. Despite their success in the playoffs, the Patriots were heavy underdogs to the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. They lost 46–10 in what was at the time the most lopsided defeat in Super Bowl history. [...] "We couldn't protect the quarterback, and that was <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I couldn't come up with a system to handle the Bears' pass rush", Berry acknowledged.|$|E
500|$|Nhu's agents soon {{reported}} Có's {{activities to}} the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said [...] "This is <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not really gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
500|$|Bennett's {{attitudes to}} the music of his {{continental}} contemporaries, aside from that of Mendelssohn, were cautious. Arthur Sullivan claimed that Bennett was [...] "bitterly prejudiced against the new school, as he called it. He would not have a note of Schumann; and as for Wagner, he was outside the pale of criticism." [...] In Bennett's 1858 lecture on [...] "The visits of illustrious foreign musicians to England", the latest mention is of Mendelssohn, bypassing Chopin, Wagner, Verdi and Hector Berlioz, (who all only came to England after Mendelssohn's last visit); Liszt (who visited London in 1827) is omitted. In a subsequent lecture he opined that Verdi was [...] "immeasurably inferior" [...] to Gioachino Rossini, and could only say in favour of Berlioz that he [...] "must be allowed the character of a successful and devoted artist... it cannot be doubted that his treatment of a great orchestra is masterly in the extreme." [...] Of Wagner, [...] "the hero of the so-called 'music of the future'", Bennett noted [...] "I have no intention of treating him disrespectfully; that I entirely misunderstand him and his musical opinions may be <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> and not his. At any rate he possesses an influence at this moment over musical life, which {{it would be impossible to}} overlook." ...|$|E
