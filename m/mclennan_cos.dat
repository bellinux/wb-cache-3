40|$|Current Version: 7 - 6 - 07 The New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer’s {{civil suit}} against the mega-broker Marsh & <b>McLennan</b> <b>Cos,</b> on October 14, 2004, for “bid-rigging ” and {{inappropriate}} use of “contingent commissions ” has {{raised questions about the}} judiciousness of contingent commission as a compensation mechanism and has brought to the forefront the need to design a new regulatory structure to address the shortcomings of the insurance regulatory system. We test the market reaction to the civil action suit by applying the event study methodology, within a GARCH framework, to insurance brokers and property-liability and life-health-accident insurers. The findings are fourfold. First, ARCH/GARCH effects are significant for both the sectoral portfolios and about half of individual brokers and property-liability insurers. Second, the event generated negative effects both within the brokerage sector and for individual brokerage firms, suggesting that the contagion effect dominates the competitive effect. Third, the inter-sectoral information spillover effects across the brokerage, property-liability, and life-health sub-sectors of the insurance industry are also significant and mostly negative. Fourth, our results support the information-based hypothesis against the pure-panic contagion effect as the size of the impact due to the event is highly correlated with firm characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Most litigants, {{if given}} the chance, prefer to assert tort {{theories}} to recover their economic losses, rather than rely on the remedies provided under contract law. This is primarily because plaintiffs {{have the potential to}} recover more damages under tort law than contract law. However, most courts have adopted a doctrine known as the economic loss rule to bar plaintiffs from asserting certain tort theories to recover for their economic loss. Although the economic loss rule may seem like an easy way to maintain the boundary between tort law and contract law, confusion abounds when courts attempt to determine the proper contexts in which to apply the doctrine. In 2013, the Florida Supreme Court resurrected issues of the doctrine’s proper scope when it rendered Tiara Condominium Ass’n v. Marsh 2 ̆ 6 <b>McLennan</b> <b>Cos.,</b> which restricted application of the doctrine to products liability cases. Although the Florida Supreme Court has held that the economic loss rule applies only when a defective product causes pecuniary loss to the plaintiff, other jurisdictions adhere to a broader application of the doctrine. In these jurisdictions, the doctrine serves a fundamental purpose to protect the boundary line between tort law and contract law by preventing parties who are in contractual privity from circumventing the bargain that they made in their contract. This Note argues that the economic loss rule is not just for products liability, but should be applied to serve such a fundamental purpose, specifically where sophisticated parties engage in arms-length transactions, bargaining for the allocation of risk and economic loss in their contract...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} how the Florida Supreme Court in Tiara Condominium Association v. Marsh 2 ̆ 6 <b>McLennan</b> <b>Cos.</b> receded {{from its}} definition of “other property” in Casa Clara Condominium Association, Inc. v. Charley Toppino 2 ̆ 6 Sons, Inc. In Casa Clara the Florida Supreme Court {{held that a}} building is {{to be treated as}} a “product” for purposes of applying the Economic Loss Rule’s bar to tort claims for defective building materials incorporated into the building. Although Casa Clara adopted the economic loss rule established by Seely v. White Motor Co. and East River Steamship Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., it departed from those seminal cases by adopting the “object of the bargain” rationale and, in doing so, determining that real property is the “product itself. ” In addition, Casa Clara departed from prior Florida precedent which held that real property is not a product in the context of products liability actions. Moreover, in Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J. M. Martinac 2 ̆ 6 Co. the United States Supreme Court rejected the “object of the bargain” analysis that served as the sole basis for the Florida Supreme Court’s characterization of real property as the “the product itself. ” The Saratoga Court recognized that the focus should be on the product that was “placed in the stream of commerce” instead. Thus, when the Florida Supreme Court returned the economic loss rule to its original interpretation under Seely and East River in Tiara, it receded from Casa Clara’s holding that a building must be treated as a “product” for the purposes of applying the economic loss rule...|$|E
