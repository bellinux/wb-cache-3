5000|$|Shape {{factors are}} {{dimensionless}} quantities used in image analysis and microscopy that numerically describe {{the shape of}} a particle, independent of its size. Shape factors are calculated from measured dimensions, such as diameter, chord lengths, area, perimeter, centroid, moments, etc. The dimensions of the particles are usually measured from two-dimensional cross-sections or projections, as in a <b>microscope</b> <b>field,</b> but shape factors also apply to three-dimensional objects. The particles could be the grains in a metallurgical or ceramic microstructure, or the microorganisms in a culture, for example. The dimensionless quantities often represent the degree of deviation from an ideal shape, such as a circle, sphere or equilateral polyhedron. [...] Shape factors are often normalized, that is, the value ranges from zero to one. A shape factor equal to one usually represents an ideal case or maximum symmetry, such as a circle, sphere, square or cube.|$|E

40|$|Reliable histologic {{methods for}} gauging the {{maturity}} of fibrotic lesions are limited, making interventions {{in the healing}} process difficult to assess. As collagen ages there is enhanced birefringence due to increased molecular and fibrillar organization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a microscopal technique to quantify this process and to determine its ability to distinguish scars of varying ages. Fibrosis in the rat gracilis muscle was studied 5 to 63 days after superficial injury. Sections were stained with picrosirius red and illuminated with monochromatic, polarized light. The <b>microscope</b> <b>fields</b> were digitized using a computer-video system yielding an image in which noncollagenous material was dark (gray level 0) and collagen was depicted by grey levels 1 to 255. In the fibrosis model used, the collagen area fraction plateaued at 80 % by day 21. The median collagen grey level increased progressively as the scar aged. It is concluded that this histologic, nondestructive technique can reliably quantify age-related optical properties of fibrotic collagen and that this could be used to determine the maturity of fibrotic lesions...|$|R

In this article, we present a set of novel technologies that significantly increase the throughput and capabilities of our previously described vertebrate automated screening technology (VAST). We developed a robust multi-thread system that can simultaneously process multiple animals. System throughput is limited only by the image acquisition speed {{rather than by the}} fluidic or mechanical processes. We developed image recognition algorithms that fully automate manipulation of animals, including orienting and positioning regions of interest within the <b>microscope's</b> <b>field</b> of view.

40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} assay {{based on}} the quantitative analysis of DNA methylation in individual interphase nuclei by indirect immunolabelling with anti- 5 -methylcytosine antibodies was recently developed in our laboratory. In situ analyses were performed on individual nuclei from normal and experimentally hypo- or hypermethylated cultured cells {{as well as on}} human peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from normal and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) samples. We present the results obtained on cells from patients affected by different degrees of preneoplastic or neoplastic changes of the uterine cervix as compared to normal controls. The analysis of DNA methylation in individual cells from cytofuge samples was performed as follows: within each nucleus the eu- and heterochromatin methylation levels were quantified in the grey scale range by dedicated software in terms of numbers, areas and optical densities (ODs) of the immunolabeled dense heterochromatic regions ('spots'), and of the optical density of nuclear background, i. e., of nuclear euchromatin. Analogously, in randomly chosen <b>microscope</b> <b>fields</b> of tissue sections from paraffin-embedded samples, progressive tissue demethylation was observed in dysplastic and cancer cells as compared to normal ones.

The amounts of CXCL 12 and CCL 19 in the supernatants of MFC cells were examined by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R & D System, Shanghai, China).

40|$|Although the {{mechanical}} activity of spermatozoa plays {{an essential role}} in the process of fertilization there is little precise information concerning the type and speed of movement of individual cells in their normal state of activity. This paper represents an attempt to fill this gap with respect to a sea-urchin whose spermatozoa, being of the typical monoflagellate type, provide valuable material for the study of flagellar propulsion in general. Accurate observation of the movements of fully active spermatozoa encounters three main difficulties: first, the diameter of the tail—on whose activity the pro-pulsion of the head depends—is near the limit of resolution by transmitted light; secondly, the normal frequency of the tail's movements is far above that which can be followed by the human eye; thirdly, direct observation is almost entirely restricted to cells constrained to move in the plane of the <b>microscope's</b> <b>field</b> by the presence of a glass/water or water/air interface.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} autofocusing specifically studied for the acquisition of digital slides, i. e. full histologic and cytologic slides, utilising low-cost equipment. At first, experimentations {{with some of the}} most used focus measures and algorithms have been made, in order to choose the most suitable for histologic and cytologic images. Then, a study of the specific features of digital slides has been preliminarily carried out in order to understand the constraints of the domain.

Based on the findings, an algorithm based on a dynamic focus position space, with a variance-based focus measure has been adapted to the specific situation. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed algorithm allowed us to show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the acquisition of digital slides, and furthermore it can be implemented starting from a basic microscope with an inexpensive motorised stage. The algorithm is currently implemented into a complete digital slide acquisition system, which is in turn being used for a Quality Assurance Programme in cervicovaginal cytologic screening...|$|R
40|$|The direct count {{method for}} {{enumerating}} bacteria in natural environments is widely used. This paper analyzes {{the sources of}} variation contributed by the various levels of the method: subsamples, filters, and <b>microscope</b> <b>fields.</b> Based on a nested analysis of variance, we show {{that most of the}} variance (less than 80 %) is caused by the fields and that the filters contributed nearly all of the remaining variance. The replication at each of the levels determines the total cost and error of a measurement. We compared several sampling schemes, including an optimal strategy which gives the lowest possible variance for a given cost. We recommend that preparing one filter from one subsample is adequate only if the samples are closely spaced in time or distance; otherwise, one filter should be prepared from two or preferably three subsamples. This sampling scheme emphasizes the importance of the highest level of replication. Our analysis shows that the accuracy of the direct count method can be substantially improved (by 20 to 50 %) without a large increase in cost when the proper degree of replication at each level is performed...|$|R
