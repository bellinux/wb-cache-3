40|$|On {{turbocharged}} spark-ignited (SI) engines with wastegate {{the position}} of the wastegate changes the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure.</b> A secondary effect of this is that the residual gas mass trapped inside the cylinder at exhaust valve closing changes and causes the volumetric efficiency to change. The volumetric efficiency is used to estimate air-mass-to-cylinder which is important for good air/fuel ratio control. Air-mass to-cylinder is not directly measurable so observers for air-mass flow to the cylinder are therefore often proposed. For observers with one state for intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> and proportional feed-back from measured state, there is a tradeoff whether to estimate intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> or air-mass-tocylinder. A new nonlinear air-mass-to-cylinder observer is suggested with two states: one for intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> and one for the in-cylinder air-mass offset compared to expected using the volumetric efficiency.

40|$|Copyright c â—‹ 2004 SAE International Mean value {{cylinder}} {{air charge}} (CAC) estimation models for control and diagnosis are investigated on turbocharged SI-engines. Two topics are studied; Firstly CAC changes due to fuel enrichment and secondly CAC sensitivity to exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. The {{objective is to}} find a CAC model suitable for control and diagnosis. Measurements show that CAC models based on volumetric efficiency gives up to 10 % error during fuel enrichment. The error is caused by the cooling effect that the fuel has as it evaporates and thus increases the charge density. To better describe the CAC during fuel enrichment a simple one parameter model is proposed which reduces the CAC estimation error on experimental data from 10 % to 3 %. With active wastegate control, the pressure changes in the exhaust manifold influences the CAC. The magnitude of this influence is investigated using sensitivity analysis on an exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent CACmodel. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded, that the CAC is most sensitive to exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> changes for low intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures</b> (part load). Without taking the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> into account the CAC error is approximately 5 % when the wastegate is opened at part load. The exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent CAC model is then augmented with the charge cooling model and the total model gives precise agreement on experimental data.

40|$|Stronger {{environmental}} awareness {{as well as}} actual and future legislations increase the demands on diagnosis and supervision of any vehicle with a combustion engine. Particularly this concerns heavy duty trucks, where it is common with long driving distances and large engines. Model based diagnosis is an often used method in these applications, since {{it does not require}} any hardware redundancy. Undesired changes in the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause increased emissions. In this thesis a diagnosis system for supervision of the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> is constructed and evaluated. The diagnosis system is based on a Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) of the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> in a diesel engine with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT).

To achieve a robust system design, four different observer approaches are evaluated. The four approaches are extended Kalman filter, high-gain, sliding mode and an adaption of the open model. The conclusion of this evaluation is that a sliding mode approach is the best alternative to get a robust diagnosis system in this application.

This thesis deals with the finding of the best air-fuel ratio to be input into the Engine Control Unit (ECU) so that the ECU can manage the engine properly. Simulation of experiment of effect of variable AFR at variable <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> for fixed RPM is run using GT-Power software. Hence a modified single cylinder diesel engine to run on CNG is studied and parameters are taken from the engine to be input into the template library of GT-Power software. In this project, the studied RPM is from 800 RPM to 3000 RPM with increment of 200 RPM. The <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> range from 0. 25 Bar to 1. 00 Bar with increment of 0. 05 Bar. As for the air-fuel ratio (AFR), the range is from 12. 5 to 21. The results obtained from the simulation are viewed using GT-Post. The data are then transfer to Microsoft Excel to plot out the graph. From the graph, the best AFR is determined and input into the AFR table of Megatune software and burn into the ECU. Result shows that the engine operate well on lean mixture for all condition.
