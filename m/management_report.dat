25|$|According to the 2002 Metro Manila Solid Waste <b>Management</b> <b>Report</b> of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Valenzuela has {{the highest}} number of {{identified}} recycling companies in the region. It was also said that recycling centers related to plastic materials are relatively higher than other recyclable objects like metals, paper, glass among others. Accordingly, the city government allocates an amount of about 785.70 Philippine pesos (approx. US$18 as of April 2011) for every transportation and collection costs of a ton of waste material. In 2003, the city generated about 307.70 tons of waste every day. In 2001, it was reported by ADB that the city has as high as 25% solid waste management cost recovery rate through service charges on households and other enterprises for operational activities associated with waste collection, treatment and disposal. That same year, the city's proposal to implement a community-based solid waste management project in barangay Mapulang Lupa, was approved by the national government, which involves social mobilization, training of personnel, implementation of segregated collection and establishment of materials recovery facility and windows composting operation among others. The city government was granted a maximum of US$25,000 from Asian Development Bank for the operation of the project.|$|E

Three case companies A, B and C from the same group were studied in order to reach the objective. Three research questions were identified: What are the existing <b>management</b> <b>reporting</b> procedures in Company B and Company C? In what ways do Companies B and C, with Company A, share knowledge in <b>management</b> <b>reporting?</b> Are the existing <b>management</b> <b>reporting</b> procedures sufficient for effective internal communication, and if not, how could they be improved? Methodology This study used the case study method for data collection. Data was collected through 10 semi-structured interviews in the case companies A, B and C. Six interviews were conducted face-to-face in Helsinki and four via email to reach employees positioned in Asia, Europe and Canada, or who otherwise were unavailable for face-to-face interviews. In addition, <b>management</b> <b>reporting</b> data such as process descriptions and Balanced Scorecards were provided by the case companies and observations were made by the researcher as she had worked for case companies B and C for nearly four years. The interview questions focused on <b>management</b> <b>reporting,</b> internal communication and knowledge sharing. Results of the study The research findings indicate that internal communication and knowledge sharing could improve <b>management</b> <b>reporting.</b> Internal communication occurred mainly through email in the case companies and knowledge sharing was sparse. The results of the study show a need for more knowledge sharing and suggestions for improved knowledge sharing were implementing an integrated computer system, having more regular meetings and changing the organizational culture from silence to transparency and openness.
