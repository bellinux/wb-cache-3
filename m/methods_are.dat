The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum.

5|$|The {{algorithms}} {{are classified}} {{according to the}} type of input they require. Sequence-based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins in order to create an alignment. Sequence <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins. Structure-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered. They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are able to detect circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity. Some structural <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> topology independent, meaning that they are also able to detect more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.|$|E

The COA <b>method</b> <b>is</b> more computationally complex and can more accurately reflect the continuity of fuzzy output. The Min–Max and Average–Average <b>methods</b> <b>were</b> also chosen as the inference alternatives. The Min–Max <b>method</b> <b>is</b> a popular <b>method</b> due to its simplicity. The Average–Average <b>method</b> <b>was</b> selected because it smooths the outputs in a dynamic environment (Sabounchi et al. 2011). Having smooth output indicates that the function has continuous derivatives.|$|R
