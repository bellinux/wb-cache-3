40|$|This {{document}} is a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of the University of Hertfordshire for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Part Time) in 'EMC in Wire-line Communications' in the School of Electronic, Communication and Electrical Engineering at the University of Hertfordshire. It describes a programme of research into the modelling and measurement of radio frequency interference emissions from various communication networks including Power Line (Tele) communications (PLC/PLT) and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). An introduction and literature review are followed by the results of practical measurements on installed networks. These measurements include antenna gain and Longitudinal Conversion Loss (LCL). Power line communication networks, splitterless DSL and home phoneline networks in buildings are studied and modelled and the models are compared with the measured results. Improved EMC test methods are also described, in particular the modelling and design of four types of portable antennas for use in radiated EMC measurements with improved sensitivity at frequencies up to 30 MHz. The first type is a set of three manually tuned loop antennas covering 100 kHz - 30 MHz. The second is a set of three loop antennas that cover a similar frequency range but with remote tuning via an optical fibre link, under the control of software which also controls an EMC <b>measuring</b> <b>receiver.</b> The third type is a larger (1. 6 m diameter) tuned loop covering 1. 75 - 10 MHz that allows the measuring system noise floor to be below the typical atmospheric noise floor. The fourth type is an electrically short dipole covering 10 - 30 MHz with improved matching. The protection requirements for various types of radio communication services are analysed and are compared with emission levels from various types of wireline communication network. A review of existing applicable EMC standards and standards under development is also presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{presented}} a useful and economic measuring principle with which radar spurious emissions can be investigated {{under field conditions}} without disturbing {{the function of the}} radar in any way. The method presented here consists of two parts: In the time-domain parameter study is presented, how the radar antenna rotation produces radar pulses to the <b>measuring</b> <b>receiver.</b> Also is presented, how receiver parameters are defined by availability and use of radar pulses in the measurement. In the frequency spectrum measurement part a new sweep measurement system is presented. In this measurement the YIG filter presented by ITU [1] is replaced by a similar multistage tunable band-stop filter, which meets similar filtering characteristics, this is more easy to use and a less expensive filter. It is explained how the needed measurement dynamics are achieved and how the measurement time is determined and optimized in different situations. A two part measuring approach like this has not been reported before. ITU recommendations for attenuation of radar spurious emissions are updated to 100 dB below the radar nominal frequency (NF) signal level. The fulfillment of these spurious level requirements sets a hard challenge for measuring dynamics: dynamics must be more than 110 dB. The author provides in this work a solution to this requirement. This measuring method produces results, with which one can conclude the relative power level of radar spurious emissions and its effect on other radio services. In this work the spectrum produced by a 5 GHz weather radar has been studied and the results have been applied to study radar impact to terrestrial digital radio relay systems (TDRRS). The achieved result is both very important and current, and it can be utilized in the planning of new radar systems as also in the planning of new radio networks operating in the frequency ranges adjacent to radar frequencies. Possible radio networks in addition to TDRRSs that can be interfered from radar spurious emissions are Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Area (WiMAX) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. These systems also can interfere with radar frequencies...|$|E
