At Life Music Award 2009, a Tokyo FM competition based on radio DJ nominations, Sakanaction were the runners up for the Best Impact of Life award for <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> act, however lost to 9mm Parabellum Bullet. In the 2009 CD Shop Awards, the album was chosen {{as one of the}} ten finalists.|$|E
5|$|The series premiere was {{watched by}} 10.81 million viewers, and {{four days after}} the premiere episode was broadcast, Doctor Who was renewed for a christmas special as well as a second series. The series was well {{received}} by both critics and fans, winning {{for the first time in}} Doctor Whos history a prestigious BAFTA Award. <b>Most</b> <b>surprising</b> was the approval from Michael Grade, who had previously forced an 18-month hiatus on the show in 1985, and had postponed Doctor Who out of personal dislike on several occasions. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-oriented Saturday night drama.|$|E
25|$|Sunset Pass...was {{not only}} one of the best but also one of the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> in {{presenting}} Randolph Scott and Harry Carey as heavies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, they quarrel a good deal--that is, the nigger quarrels; {{though the}} Indian {{is too much}} above him to mind what he says. Nor will I say that Yop {{actually}} quarrels, sir, for he has the greatest possible regard for his friend; but he aggravates in the <b>most</b> <b>surprisingest</b> manner--just like a nigger, howsever, I do suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed they do, sir, in the <b>most</b> <b>surprisingest</b> manner! They {{was both}} antiquities, as we says in Hengland, when I {{came to this}} country, sir--and that was before you was born, Mr. Hugh--an age agone. But there they sits, sir, {{day in and day}} out, looking like monumentals of past times. The nigger"--John had been long enough in the country to catch the vernacular--"The nigger grows uglier and uglier every year, and that is most of a change I can see in him; while I do think, sir, that the Indian grows 'andsomer and 'andsomer. He's the 'andsomest old gentleman, sir, as I know of, far and near!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure, Mr. Hugh, you are heartily {{welcome to}} my services, come as you may to ask them. It was a <b>most</b> <b>surprisingest</b> deception, sir, as I shall ever hadmit; but I thought the whole time you wasn't exactly what you seemed to be, as I told Kitty as soon as I went down stairs: 'Kitty,' says I, 'them two pedlers is just the two genteelest pedlers as hever I see in this country, and I shouldn't wonder if they had known better days.' But, now you have been to see the hanti-renters with your own eyes, Mr. Hugh, {{what do you think}} of them, if I may be so bold as to ask the question?" ...|$|R
25|$|In Iran, 46.8% {{of female}} workers are {{salaried}} and in Tunisia the percentage is 69.1%. Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> case is Syria where 74.30% {{of women are}} salaried. This is the largest percentage in the Middle East {{and one of the}} highest in the entire Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's {{allowance}} in advance, {{along with}} a letter ending her patronage. She claimed bankruptcy. <b>Most</b> <b>surprising</b> about the break was its extreme suddenness. Barely a week beforehand, she had sent him a typically intimate, loving and confessional letter. The letter dealt in large part with how her children were squandering their future inheritance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> results came in Punta Gorda, where 5 UDP {{candidates}} were elected but not Mayoral nominee Charles Selgado; and in Benque Viejo, where the PUP's Armando Chulin sneaked {{on to the}} council by 17 votes. In the Amandala of Sunday, March 5, 2006, publisher Evan X Hyde claimed the Punta Gorda result showed the maturity of Belizean voters in selecting a bipartisan council.|$|E

25|$|Dirk Nannes {{was their}} first buy, but their <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> {{purchase}} was South Africa's bowling allrounder Chris Morris for $625,000. Soon after getting Morris, the Super Kings went after the Sri Lankan spinner Sachithra Senanayake too, but lost him to Kolkata Knight Riders. Towards {{the end of the}} auction they picked up Australian seamer Ben Laughlin, Sri Lankan spinner Akila Dananjaya and the towering West Indian quick Jason Holder, all at their respective base prices.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{tourism is}} either the first, {{second or third}} largest {{employer}} in 29 states, employing 7.3 million in 2004, {{to take care of}} 1.19 billion trips tourists took in the US in 2005. The US outbound holiday market is sensitive in the short term, but possibly one of the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> results from the September 11, 2001 attacks was that by February 2002 it had bounced back. This quick revival was generally quicker than many commentators had predicted only five months earlier.|$|E
25|$|Some of the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> hunting {{behaviour}} occurs {{among the}} araneophagous Salticidae, and it varies greatly in method. Many of the spider-hunting species quite commonly will attack other spiders, whether fellow salticids or not, {{in the same}} way as any other prey, but some kinds resort to web invasion; nonspecialists such as Phidippus audax sometimes attack prey ensnared in webs, basically in acts of kleptoparasitism — sometimes they leap onto and eat the web occupant itself, or simply walk over the web for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|Of the Roman {{citizens}} sine suffragio (which {{were mainly}} Italic tribes wholly annexed to the Roman state) Hannibal scored one major success: the defection {{of most of}} the Campanians. This was the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> of the defections, as the Campanians had been loyal allies of Rome since the 340's BC, when they requested Roman protection from Samnite incursions. They had also remained loyal during the Pyrrhic invasion, as Pyrrhus was the champion of the Campanians' other main rivals, the Italiote Greeks. The deciding factor in Capua's defection from Rome appears to have been the prospect of replacing Rome as Italy's leading city.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} from Hammond & Anderson {{that the first}} {{printing}} appeared on March 1, 1938. A library copy of the third printing has been seen with a check-out date of November 28, 1938. If we accept, then, that the first edition consisted of multiple runs on the evidence of emendations to the text block, the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> fact arising out of the dating {{is that the first}} three printings appeared within nine months of each other. It is not known whether a planned larger, single run was shortened and broken up for the corrections, or whether demand was simply strong enough to warrant new runs with corrections made opportunistically.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals paid dearly {{by calling}} a snap {{election}} three years into their mandate in 1990. Before Peterson called the election, his government stood at a 54% approval rating in the polls. However, the early election call {{turned out to}} be his undoing as the public interpreted it as arrogance. Several scandals also broke out after the election call and some suspected the Liberals of calling an election just to dodge the upcoming recession. In the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> election results in Ontario's history, the NDP was able to win a majority government, however with only 37% of the vote. This government was Ontario's second social democratic government (after the United Farmers government of Ernest Drury 1919-1923), and its track record would keep the NDP out of serious contention for power in Ontario until the present.|$|E
500|$|Since its rediscovery, {{the play}} {{has been studied}} and {{analyzed}} by scholars interested in its place in Verne's oeuvre, though it remains relatively little-known among his works. The American Verne scholar Arthur B. Evans has called it [...] "delightful," [...] saying it [...] "shows [...] at his most whimsically science-fictional." [...] The Swiss-American Verne scholar Jean-Michel Margot has described it as [...] "one of the <b>most</b> intriguing, <b>surprising,</b> and important later works by Jules Verne." ...|$|R
2500|$|Snape's character, {{which becomes}} more layered and enigmatic as the series progresses, was widely {{acclaimed}} by readers and critics. Rowling {{described him as}} [...] "a gift of a character" [...] whose story she had known since the first book, and Elizabeth Hand of The Washington Post opined that Snape's life [...] "is the <b>most</b> heartbreaking, <b>surprising</b> and satisfying of all of Rowling's achievements". [...] Actor Alan Rickman portrayed Snape in all eight Harry Potter films, released between 2001 and 2011.|$|R
5|$|The <b>most</b> {{interesting}} and <b>surprising</b> results occur when i>n. The first such surprise was {{the discovery of}} a mapping called the Hopf fibration, which wraps the 3-sphere S3 around the usual sphere S2 in a non-trivial fashion, and so is not equivalent to a one-point mapping.|$|R
25|$|On October 6, 2009, Castle {{announced}} his candidacy in the 2010 special election {{for the seat}} in the United States Senate held by Democrat Ted Kaufman. Kaufman, appointed by Governor Ruth Ann Minner to fill the vacancy created by Joe Biden (who resigned to become Vice President of the United States), was not a candidate in the special election. The election would determine who would fill the balance of Biden's term, which would end on January 3, 2015. In one of the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> election results of the 2010 campaign season, Castle was defeated in the Republican primary for the US Senate seat by Christine O'Donnell. He would have been heavily favored {{in the general election}} against Democrat Chris Coons, who went on to easily beat O'Donnell by 17%.|$|E
25|$|Branch and Terrell Owens {{each had}} 100 yards {{receiving}}, marking {{the third time}} in Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, and Branch and Muhsin Muhammad the second a year earlier in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Branch also became the fourth player to have at least 100 yards receiving in back-to-back Super Bowls, joining John Stallworth, Jerry Rice and Antonio Freeman. Also, Mike Vrabel and David Givens became just the 14th and 15th players to score a touchdown in consecutive Super Bowls. Vrabel is the <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> person on this list because he is a linebacker and he scored his on offense. They also became just the 7th and 8th players to catch a touchdown in back-to-back Super Bowls.|$|E
25|$|In early 1962, Mangeshkar {{was given}} slow poison. A doctor was called. He came with an x-ray machine to examine her, {{and gave her}} an {{injection}} to render her unconscious, because she was in pain. For three days, she had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. The doctor told her that somebody had given her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bedridden for nearly 3 months. The <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> thing was that soon after the incident, the cook {{who used to work}} at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour.|$|E

60|$|The loss of {{the allies}} was three {{thousand}} killed and wounded, five thousand prisoners, and seventy-two guns; while the Prussians lost but one hundred and sixty-five killed, and three hundred and seventy-six wounded.

2500|$|The final {{revelation of}} Snape's loyalty in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was viewed {{positively}} by fans and critics alike. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry Potter {{in the movie}} series, expressed his delight, saying he {{was pleased to see}} that his theory that Snape would end up being a sort of tragic hero came through. Elizabeth Hand from The Washington Post wrote, [...] "The much-maligned loner Snape does not come onstage until the latter part of [...] "Deathly Hallows," [...] but when he does the book becomes his: Snape's fate, more than Voldemort's, perhaps more even than Harry's, is the <b>most</b> heartbreaking, <b>surprising</b> and satisfying of all of Rowling's achievements." ...|$|R
25|$|There were {{questions}} about the actual content of the map. Witten had pointed out that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner Andrea Bianco, but others found some of {{the similarities and differences}} very strange—the map cuts off Africa where Bianco's map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions in the far east and west. The <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous Cantino World Map, the Vinland Map depicts Greenland as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while Norway, of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of Claudius Clavus in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, Arctic sea ice may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent Japan—they seem to show not only Honshu, but also Hokkaido and Sakhalin, omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.|$|E

At some points, even the storytelling is better. What's <b>most</b> amazing and <b>surprising</b> about BioShock 2, however, is that by diving deeper into Rapture's tortured history and exploring more of Rapture's haunted world, it actually manages to make the original BioShock better, too." ...|$|R
50|$|Active {{since the}} late 1970s, Leif Elggren {{has become one of}} the <b>most</b> {{constantly}} <b>surprising</b> conceptual artists to work in the combined worlds of audio and visual. A writer, visual artist, stage performer and composer, he has many albums to his credits, solo and with the Sons of God, on labels such as Ash International, Touch, Radium and his own Firework Edition. His music, often conceived as the soundtrack to a visual installation or experimental stage performance, usually presents carefully selected sound sources over a long stretch of time and can range from quiet electronics to harsh noise. His wide-ranging and prolific body of art often involves dreams and subtle absurdities, social hierarchies turned upside-down, hidden actions and events taking on the quality of icons.|$|R
60|$|The {{performances}} at the Hippodrome are very various. Sometimes whole troops of horse {{come in from}} between two great curtains at one end, all elegantly caparisoned and mounted, some by men and some by girls, but all, whether men or girls, dressed in splendid uniforms. These troops ride round and round the area, {{and up and down}} in the middle of it, performing a great variety of evolutions in the <b>most</b> rapid and <b>surprising</b> manner.|$|R
