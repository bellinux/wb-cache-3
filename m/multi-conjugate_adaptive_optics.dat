40|$|We {{present in}} this study a first {{analysis}} of the astrometric error budget of absolute astrometry relative to back- ground galaxies using <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics.</b> We use for this analysis <b>multi-conjugated</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (MCAO) images obtained with GeMS/GSAOI at Gemini South. We find {{that it is possible}} to obtain 0. 3 mas reference precision in a random field with 1 hour on source using faint background galaxies. Systematic errors are correctable below that level, such that the overall error is approximately 0. 4 mas. Because the reference sources are extended, we find it necessary to correct for the dependency of the PSF centroid on the used aperture size, which would oth- erwise cause an important bias. This effect needs also to be considered for Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). When this effect is corrected, ELTs have the potential to measure proper motions of dwarfs galaxies around M 31 with 10 km/s accuracy over a baseline of 5 years...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of atmospheric turbulence heavily affects {{the resolution of}} images formed on large ground telescopes.

In this paper we formalize the problem of estimating such turbulence dynamic characteristics by using the measurements provided by a <b>multi-conjugated</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (MCAO) system. From a temporal dynamics point of view, the turbulence here is represented as the superposition of a finite set of layers, which are characterized by their velocities, energies and altitudes.

These observations were also intended to demonstrate the scientific capabilities of the <b>multi-conjugated</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> demonstrator (MAD) implemented at the ESO Very Large Telescope as a test-bench of <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> (AO) techniques. We perform accurate, deep photometry of the field using J and Ks band AO images of the central region of the galaxy. The near-infrared (IR) colour-magnitude diagrams clearly show the sequences of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, red supergiants, and red giant branch (RGB) stars down to ~ 1 mag below the RGB tip. Optical-near-IR diagrams, obtained by combining our data with Hubble Space Telescope observations, provide the best separation of stars in the various evolutionary stages. The counts of AGB stars brighter than the RGB tip allow us to estimate the star formation at intermediate ages.

40|$|One major {{disadvantage}} {{to ground}} based observations is the distortion of light as {{it enters the}} Earth's atmosphere. One way to overcome this is to send telescopes into space to avoid {{the effects of the}} atmosphere completely. This can be costly and much more cumbersome to repair and maintain. Another way to overcome the distortions from the atmosphere is to employ a process known as adaptive optics. Adaptive optics measures the induced distortions from the atmosphere and corrects for this effect continually throughout the observation in real time. The component of the adaptive optics system that measures the effects of the atmosphere is known as a wavefront sensor. Conventional adaptive optics greatly increases the resolution of ground based observations, but suffers from a small field of view. Another process called multiconjugate adaptive optics can increase the field of view from a conventional adaptive optics system. This involves a different kind of wavefront sensing method and correction process. Solar wavefront sensing methods for both systems are investigated in the following thesis. First, the theory behind conventional adaptive optics wavefront, including the use of Zernike polynomials to represent a wavefront and the reconstruction process of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, are discussed. Then a solar wavefront sensor is tested by using a sunspot on the sun to measure and reconstruct an incoming wavefront. This will show the viability of this wavefront sensor. Next, the theory behind <b>multi-conjugate</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> will be discussed to set up the testing of a <b>multi-conjugate</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> wavefront sensor. The previous wavefront sensor will be modified for use in <b>multi-conjugate</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics.</b> The software will be first tested to see if it can properly sense the necessary wavefronts, and then the algorithm used will be tested in a simulation to see if what the wavefront sensor is doing is conect.

Currently, GeMS/GSAOI at Gemini South is {{the only}} MCAO {{facility}} instrument at an 8 m telescope. Using real data {{and for the first}} time, we investigate the gain in depth and S/N when MCAO is employed for K_ s-band observations of distant galaxies. Our analysis is based on the Frontier Fields cluster MACS J 0416. 1 - 2403, observed with GeMS/GSAOI (near diffraction-limited) and compared against VLT/HAWK-I (natural seeing) data. Using galaxy number counts, we show that the substantially increased thermal background and lower optical throughput of the MCAO unit are fully compensated for by the wavefront correction, because the galaxy images can be measured in smaller apertures with less sky noise. We also performed a direct comparison of the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of sources detected in both data sets. For objects with intrinsic angular sizes corresponding to half the HAWK-I image seeing, the gain in S/N is 40 per cent. Even smaller objects experience a boost in S/N by a up to a factor of 2. 5 despite our suboptimal natural guide star configuration. The depth of the near diffraction limited images is more difficult to quantify than that of seeing limited images, due to a strong dependence on the intrinsic source profiles.

40|$|LINC-NIRVANA (LN) is a {{near-infrared}} image-plane beam combiner with advanced, <b>multi-conjugated</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> for the Large Binocular Telescope. Non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) {{between the}} near-infrared science camera and the wave-front sensor (WFS) are unseen by the WFS and therefore are not corrected in closed loop. This would prevent LN from achieving its ultimate performance. We use a modified phase diversity technique {{to measure the}} internal optical static aberrations and hence the NCPAs. Phase diversity is a methodology for estimating wave-front aberrations by solving an unconstrained optimization problem from multiple images whose pupil phases differ from one another by a known amount. We conduct computer simulations of the reconstruction of aberrations of an optical system with the phase diversity method.

40|$|The Durham <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> {{real-time}} controller is a generic, {{high performance}} real-time control system for astronomical <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> systems. It has recently had new features added {{as well as}} performance improvements, and here we give details of these, as well as ways in which optimisations {{can be made for}} specific <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> systems and hardware implementations. We also present new measurements that show how this real-time control system could be used with any existing <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> system, and also show that when used with modern hardware, it has high enough performance to be used with most Extremely Large Telescope <b>adaptive</b> <b>optics</b> systems.
