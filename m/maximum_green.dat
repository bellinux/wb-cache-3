5000|$|Green Extension: This {{strategy}} {{is used to}} extend the green interval by up to a preset maximum value if a transit vehicle is approaching. Detectors are located so that any transit vehicle that would just miss the green light ("just" [...] meaning {{by no more than}} the specified <b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> extension time) extends the green and is able to clear the intersection rather than waiting through an entire red interval. Green Extension provides a benefit to a relatively small percentage of buses (only buses that arrive during a short window each cycle benefit), but the reduction in delay for those buses that do benefit is large (an entire red interval).|$|E

30|$|Lower {{confidence}} limit (LSL) for green-ratio difference (ΔGR) {{shows that in}} the worst case the GR at the best point {{is equal to the}} start point, while at upper limit it reaches 9  % improvement. On the other hand, the index of carbon production difference (ΔCEI) in lower limit is negative near to zero, and shows becoming worse in production carbon, but it is so small, and in return, at the upper limit it is positive. For the best point the average of green less value is equal to 123 £. The maximum service level will take place with adding up 32  % to total costs and obtaining significant improvement in both factors of GR and CEI. This amount of adding cost is approximately four times of the first scenario. In this scenario, average expenses for reaching the <b>maximum</b> possible <b>greening</b> will be occurred by the price of green less value equal to 62 £. That is about half of the value for the former scenario. With increasing the average service levels up to possible <b>maximum</b> point, <b>green</b> factors at 95  % confidence level improves so that for the GR even at lower limit, 12  % increasing is showed.

40|$|One control {{objective}} at high-speed isolated intersections is {{to provide}} safe phase transition by minimizing the occurrence of high-speed vehicles in the dilemma zone before the phase is terminated. An upper limit for extending the green (<b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> time) is used to avoid an indefinite extension of the main-street green. Currently, the <b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> times are chosen by using engineering judgment. This approach does not ex-plicitly consider the trade-offs between safety and delay and hence often results in both unsafe and inefficient performance at the intersection under medium to heavy traffic volumes. The dilemma problem is recast as one of minimizing the num-ber of vehicles entering the upstream decision conflict zone (DCZ). An economic evaluation approach is proposed to max-imize both safety and efficiency at the intersection by consid-ering the problem in terms of marginal costs and benefits. Traf...|$|E
30|$|In a fully {{actuated}} control scheme, {{each stage}} runs from a minimum up to a <b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> time, if sufficient demand is present (max out operation), or terminates earlier (gap out operation) {{in case of}} a sufficient gap time in demand [14]. The minimum green time represents the least amount of time that a green signal indication will be displayed for a stage, while the <b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> time represents the maximum amount of time that a green signal indication can be displayed. Gap time is a parameter used to terminate the current stage, if actuated, when a gap in traffic is identified; vehicle calls extend green time of the current stage until a gap in detector occupancy is identified that is higher than the assigned gap time. In case of complete lack of demand, stages can also be omitted in a fully actuated control scheme.|$|E

40|$|Most modern {{traffic signal}} {{controllers}} contain “advanced ” {{features that are}} often not used but may improve traffic operations under certain conditions. This report documents the research conducted in investigating how diamond interchange operations can be improved by using advanced controller features. The project evaluated the features of traffic signal controllers meeting the current TxDOT traffic signal controller specification. The effectiveness of the advanced features provided by these controllers was evaluated using traffic simulation with real traffic control hardware. Eight potentially useful controller features were identified: (1) separate intersection mode, (2) diamond phasing sequence change by time of day, (3) conditional service, (4) dynamic <b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> times, (5) dynamic split, (6), volume-density control, (7) alternate <b>maximum</b> <b>green</b> and passage times, and (8) adaptive protected-permissive left turns.

40|$|Caustis blakei is an {{attractive}} cut foliage plant harvested from the wild in Australia and marketed {{under the name of}} koala fern. Previous attempts to propagate large numbers of this plant have been unsuccessful. The effect of four light irradiances on organogenesis from compact and friable callus of C. blakei was studied for 21 wk. Both callus types produced numerous primordial shoots but many failed to develop into green plantlets. However, significantly more primordial shoots and green plantlets developed on the friable callus than on the compact callus, and significantly more green plantlets were regenerated under the higher photon irradiances of 200 and 300 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1) than under the lower irradiances of 100 and 150 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1). The compact callus produced its <b>maximum</b> number of <b>green</b> plantlets early in the experiment (after 9 wk), while the friable callus continued to produce primordial shoots and green plantlets throughout the period of the experiment, and reached its <b>maximum</b> production of <b>green</b> plantlets at 21 wk under the irradiance of 300 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1).
