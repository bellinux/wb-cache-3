40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study are (1) to describe the categories <b>of</b> adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> (-ly form) in Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight, (2) to describe the realizations of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> (–ly form) in Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight in Bahasa Indonesia expressions by Lily Devita Sari, and (3) to assess the degree of meaning equivalence of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> (-ly form) in Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight and their Bahasa Indonesia expressions by Lily Devita Sari. The study used a descriptive qualitative approach to analyze the categories of –ly adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> on Twilight novel and their realizations in Bahasa Indonesia. The procedures of collecting data was conducted through the following steps: reading both ST and TT, selecting and underlining the –ly adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manners</b> in ST, identifying and underlining the translation of the chosen adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner,</b> and retyping them into a data sheet. The techniques {{used to analyze the}} data were: identifying the –ly adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> and the translations classifications according to the theory by Halliday, then analyzing and interpreting the realizations and determining the degrees of equivalence. The trustworthiness of data of research can be gained by discussing with the thesis consultants, reconfirming to any experts related in this field, and conducting data triangulation with several colleagues in linguistic field. According to the analysis, the –ly adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> are categorized into 4 types according to Halliday’s theory. Those types are (1) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> degree, (2) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> comparison, (3) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> means, and (4) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> quality. The findings show that most of the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> fit into the <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> quality category. It is followed by the categories <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> degree and the least one is <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> comparison. Unfortunately, the <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> means category does not emerge in the analysis. From the findings, the realizations can be categorized into: (1) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> degree realized into <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> degree, <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> comparison, <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> quality, and zero translation, (2) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> comparison realized into <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> degree, <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> comparison, <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> quality, noun, and zero translation, and (3) <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> quality realized into <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> degree, <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> comparison, adjective, verb, noun, clause, and zero translation. The fully equivalent category refers to the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> which are realized into the same adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner,</b> the partly equivalent category refers to the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> which are realized into the different manner category, the different meaning category refers to the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> which are realized into the different class, and the no-meaning category refers to the adverbs <b>of</b> <b>manner</b> which are realized into zero translation...|$|R

5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the <b>manners</b> <b>of</b> their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to <b>manners</b> <b>of</b> articulation in spoken language.|$|E

After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok sets his lair to self-destruct, Dan is rescued by Al-Zalam and the two escape, leaving Zarok's magical influence over the land thwarted. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber and ascends to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.|$|E

5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was {{anything}} but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and <b>manners</b> <b>of</b> past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E

Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E.

On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the jaganamohana, delightful scenes of monkeys playing all <b>manners</b> <b>of</b> pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection.
