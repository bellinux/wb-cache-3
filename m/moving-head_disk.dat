25|$|In particular, it is {{commonly}} used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the readâ€“write heads in a <b>moving-head</b> <b>disk</b> drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E
5000|$|OS/8 volumes had a {{very limited}} maximum storage size (4096 blocks) and the RK05 (2.4MB) <b>moving-head</b> <b>disk</b> {{exceeded}} this size. Because of this, RK05 cartridges {{were divided into two}} partitions. For example the first RK05 on a system would be known as both RKA0: (SY:) and RKB0:. This division was commonly thought to mean [...] "the upper surface" [...] and [...] "the lower surface" [...] but this was incorrect; it in fact was [...] "the outer cylinders" [...] and [...] "the inner cylinders".|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 305 RAMAC was {{the first}} {{commercial}} computer that used a <b>moving-head</b> hard <b>disk</b> drive (magnetic disk storage) for secondary storage. The system was publicly announced on September 14, 1956, [...] with test units already installed at the U.S. Navy and at private corporations. [...] RAMAC stood for [...] "Random Access Method of Accounting and Control", as its design was motivated by the need for real-time accounting in business.|$|R
5000|$|Born in San Francisco, California, Haanstra {{graduated}} from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949 {{with a degree in}} electrical engineering. In 1950 he went to work for IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York. During the Korean War he was recalled to serve in the Navy. Following his discharge he rejoined IBM in 1952 in the San Jose Laboratory. He was responsible for designing the RAMAC, [...] "the first commercial computer that used a <b>moving-head</b> hard <b>disk</b> drive", introduced in 1953.|$|R
50|$|The I/O systems {{underwent}} huge {{changes during}} the PDP-8 era. Early PDP-8 models used a front panel interface, a paper-tape reader and a teletype printer with an optional paper-tape punch. Over time I/O {{systems such as}} magnetic tape, RS-232 and current loop dumb terminals, punched card readers, and fixed-head disks were added. Toward {{the end of the}} PDP-8 era, floppy <b>disks</b> and <b>moving-head</b> cartridge <b>disk</b> drives were popular I/O devices. Modern enthusiasts have created standard PC style IDE hard disk adapters for real and simulated PDP-8 computers.|$|R
