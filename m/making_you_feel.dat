500|$|For this game, Dante {{was made}} young, {{consumed}} by hatred and inexperienced {{resulting in a}} fighting style similar to a street brawler rather {{than that of a}} skilled swordsman.

[...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and <b>making</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like a platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve".

On these occasions, we were not addressed by our Christian names; if we accidentally met him out of doors, he was sure to turn aside and avoid us; if we asked a question, it was answered in the briefest possible manner, as if we had been strangers.

6000|$|Besides man has {{one great}} natural virtue, that of pity, which precedes in him {{the use of}} reflection, and which indeed he shares {{with some of the}} brutes. Mandeville, who was forced to admit the {{existence}} of this admirable quality in man, was absurd in not perceiving that from it flow all the social virtues which he would fain deny. Pity is more energetic in the primitive condition than it is among ourselves. It is reflection which isolates one. It is philosophy which teaches the philosopher to say secretly at sight of a suffering wretch, Perish if it please thee; I am safe and sound. They may be butchering a fellow-creature under your window; {{all you have to do}} is to clap your hands to your ears, and argue a little with yourself to hinder nature in revolt from <b>making</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> as if you were in the case of the victim.[182] The savage man has not got this odious gift. In the state of nature it is pity that takes the place of laws, manners, and virtue. It is in this natural sentiment rather than in subtle arguments that we have to seek the reluctance that every man would feel to do ill, even without the precepts of education.[183] ...|$|E

His grey-headed mate, a first-rate sailor and a nice old chap with strangers, but in his {{relations}} with his commander the surliest chief officer I've ever seen, would tell the story with tears in his eyes. It appears that when he came on deck in the morning Brierly had been writing in the chart-room. [...] "It was ten minutes to four," [...] he said, [...] "and the middle watch was not relieved yet of course. He heard my voice on the bridge speaking to the second mate, and called me in. I was loth to go, and that's the truth, Captain Marlow--I couldn't stand poor Captain Brierly, I tell you with shame; we never know what a man is made of. He had been promoted over too many heads, not counting my own, and he had a damnable trick of <b>making</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> small, nothing but by the way he said 'Good morning.'

'We'll lay down her position,' says he, stooping over the chart, a pair of dividers in hand. By the standing orders, the officer going off duty would have done that at the end of his watch. However, I said nothing, and looked on while he marked off the ship's position with a tiny cross and wrote the date and the time. I can see him this moment writing his neat figures: seventeen, eight, four A.M. The year would be written in red ink at the top of the chart. He never used his charts more than a year, Captain Brierly didn't. I've the chart now. When he had done he stands looking down at the mark he had made and smiling to himself, then looks up at me.

6000|$|Matthew Henry W. {{was a very}} {{cultivated}} {{and accomplished}} young man [...] in Albany at the time I was growing up. He belonged to a highly [...] respectable family of booksellers and publishers and was himself [...] bred to the law; but had such a love of literature, and more [...] especially of the natural sciences, that he never devoted himself [...] strictly to his profession. He was the intimate friend of my dear [...] old tutor, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian, and of other [...] distinguished men of science; he corresponded with foreign [...] scientific bodies, and his contributions to science generally were [...] of so original a cast as to suggest great hopes of his future [...] eminence. He was a thorough gentleman, of perfect address and [...] perfect courage--utterly unegotistic, and one's wonder was how he [...] had ever grown up in Albany or resigned himself to living there. [...] One day he invested his money, {{of which he had}} a certain quantity, [...] in a scheme much favoured {{by the president of the}} bank in which he [...] deposited, and this adventure proved a fortune. There lived near us [...] as well a family of the name of K----, your cousin Mary Minturn [...] Post's stepmother being of its members; and this family reckoned [...] upon a great social sensation in bringing out their youngest [...] daughter, Lydia Sibyl, who had never been seen by mortal eye [...] outside her own immediate circle, save that of a physician who [...] reported that she was fabulously beautiful. She was the most [...] beautiful girl I think I ever saw, at a little distance. Well, she [...] made her sensation and brought Matthew Henry promptly to her feet. [...] Her family wanted wealth above all things for her; but here was [...] wealth and something more, very much more, and they smiled upon [...] his suit. Everything went merrily for a while--M. H. was deeply [...] intoxicated with his prize. Never was man so enamoured, and never [...] was beauty better fitted to receive adoration. She was of an [...] exquisite Grecian outline as to face, with a countenance like the [...] tender dawn and form and manners ravishingly graceful. But W. was [...] not content with his adventure--he embarked again and lost almost [...] all he owned. The girl's father--or her mother rather, being the [...] ruler of the family and as hard as the nether world at heart--gave [...] the cue to her daughter and my friend was dismissed. He couldn't [...] believe his senses, he raved and cursed his fate, but it was [...] inexorable. What was to be done? With a bitterness of heart [...] inconceivable he plucked his revenge by marrying at once a stout [...] and blooming jade who was to Lydia Sibyl as a peony to a violet, [...] absolutely nothing but flesh and blood. Her he bore upon his arm at [...] fashionable hours through the streets; her he took to church, [...] preserving his admirable ease and courtesy to everyone, as if [...] absolutely nothing had occurred; and her he pretended to take to [...] his bosom in private, with what a shudder one can imagine. [...] Everybody stood aghast. He went daily about his affairs, as serene [...] and unconscious apparently as the moon in the heavens. Soon his [...] poverty showed itself in certain economies of his attire, which had [...] always been most recherché. Soon again he broke his leg and went [...] about on crutches, but neither poverty nor accident had the least [...] power to ruffle his air of equanimity. He was always superior to [...] his circumstances, met you exactly as he had always done, impressed [...] you always as the best-bred man you knew, and left you wondering [...] what a heart and what a brain lay behind such a fortune. One [...] morning we all read in the newspaper at breakfast that Mr. M. H. W. [...] had appealed the day before to the protection of the police [...] against his wife, who had taken to beating him and whom as a woman [...] he couldn't deal with by striking back; and the police responded [...] properly to his appeal. He went about his affairs as usual that day [...] and every day, never saying a word to any one of his trouble nor [...] even indirectly asking sympathy, but <b>making</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that here if [...] anywhere was a rare kind of manhood, a self-respect so eminent as [...] to look down with scorn on the refuges open to ordinary human [...] weakness. This lasted five or six years. He never drank or took to [...] other vices, and lived a life of such decorum, so far as his own [...] action was concerned, a life of such interest and science and [...] literature, as to be the most delightful and unconscious of [...] companions even when his coat was at the last shabbiness and you [...] didn't dare to look at him for fear of betraying your own vulgar [...] misintelligence. Finally Lydia Sibyl died smitten with smallpox and [...] all her beauty gone to hideousness. He lingered awhile, his [...] charming manners undismayed still, his eye as undaunted as at the [...] beginning, and then he suddenly died. I never knew his equal for a [...] manly force competent to itself in every emergency and seeking none [...] of the ordinary subterfuges that men so often seek to hide their [...] imbecility.
