25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b> <b>And</b> when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
2500|$|Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{found the}} song to be [...] "galloping, out-of-place synth-rock number" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "even Adele can't save" [...] the song. Nick Freed of Consequence of Sound said that [...] "Set Fire to the Rain" [...] finds Adele at [...] "her strongest and most open." [...] He further called the song [...] "one of 21s angrier tracks" [...] and concluded: [...] "The chorus' hooks are crazy catchy, and by the final one Adele {{releases}} and her hurt slips through the anger {{to give you a}} damn real and forward show of emotion. I’d imagine seeing this song live or in a stripped down setting would make one bawl like a child. You’ll want to pump your fist and pound your chest. That’s a guarantee." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy praised the song saying, [...] "'It was dark and I was over/ Until you kissed <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> saved me,' she admits over a gloomy piano riff, before launching into a ballsy, hands-in-the-air chorus. 'I set fire to the rain/ and I threw us into the flames,' she belts with growly vocals against cinematic strings. Rounding out with a suitably breathtaking blast from her impressive pipes and the result sounds like classic, though it's anything but camp." ...|$|E

60|$|For all reply {{she raised}} her eyebrows in token of surprise; Canaples looked askance; I bit <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>and</b> an awkward silence followed, which, luckily, was quickly ended by the {{appearance}} of Andrea.|$|R

60|$|Brother Thomas moved stealthily to the door, {{and thrust}} in the wooden bolt. Then he sat him heavily {{down on my}} bed, and put his fiend's face close to mine, his eyes {{stabbing}} into my eyes. But I bit <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>and</b> stared right back into his yellow wolf's eyes, that shone like flames of the pit with evil and cruel thoughts.|$|R
60|$|I bent down, and I {{raised her}} hands to <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> kissed them.|$|E
60|$|And <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> {{eyes were}} touched once more, {{so that my}} sight and speech came back.|$|E
6000|$|Herewith {{she drew}} a kerchief across <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> I began, being most eager to {{instruct}} her innocence as to this accursed man-- ...|$|E
60|$|I bit <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>and</b> {{tried to}} smile back again. Absurd that a man should be made miserable about such a trifle; and yet I will freely confess that at that moment, {{in spite of my}} uncle's twelve hundred a year, I felt utterly wretched. I bowed to pretty little Ruby as well as I was able, and took a couple more turns by myself hurriedly around the terrace.|$|R
60|$|I {{had it on}} <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> to say, <b>and</b> then I remembered Mr. Wharton's injunction.|$|R

60|$|My mother, {{who until}} this time {{had made no}} change in her position, raised her hand up to <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> stopped me.|$|E
60|$|I coughed {{to cover}} up the exclamation of disbelief that rose to <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> remarked blandly that two {{thousand}} years was certainly a long time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring me my horse," [...] she said, so sternly that I {{crushed the}} answer on <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> the prayer {{that she would}} risk herself no more.|$|E
60|$|And so I {{sat there}} moodily, gnawing <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> <b>and</b> scowling darkly upon Pier Luigi and upon my cousin, {{who was as}} assiduous in his attentions as his master, and {{who seemed to be}} {{receiving}} an even greater proportion of her favours. One little thing there was to hearten me. Looking at the Lord of Pagliano, who sat at the table's head, I observed that his glance was dark as it kept watch upon his daughter--that chaste white lily that seemed of a sudden to have assumed such wanton airs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, he couldn't,--and wouldn't if he could. The {{bishop and}} Frank {{are the best}} friends in the world. But {{that has nothing to}} do with it. You mustn't abuse the chapel to Frank; just at this moment the subject is tabooed. My belief is that the whole edifice will have to come down, and that the {{confusion}} of Mr. Puddleham and the Marquis will be something more complete than ever was yet seen. In the meantime, I put my finger to <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>and</b> just look at Frank whenever the chapel is mentioned." ...|$|R

60|$|I was {{somewhat}} doubtful {{of the truth}} of this statement, but as nothing was to be gained by refuting it, I bit <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> <b>and</b> said nothing.|$|E

60|$|His kisses {{fell upon}} <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> my head fell upon his shoulder. Then I drew {{a sigh of}} deep content, and I felt that I had done well.|$|E
60|$|Next morning I {{could hardly}} {{crawl out of}} my sleeping-bag. My bones ached, my muscles protested excruciatingly, <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> burned <b>and</b> bled, and the cold I had {{contracted}} on the desert clung to me. A good brisk walk round the corrals, and then breakfast, made me feel better.|$|R

6000|$|She {{gives it}} me, not displeased; and I {{put it to}} <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> then into my breast. Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her hand through my arm, and says, 'Now {{take me back to}} Captain Bailey.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Emanuel Episcopal Church, the [...] "Little Chapel", on Great River Road, {{became a}} reality in 1862 when Mr. and Mrs. William Nicoll deeded {{one-half}} acre of land.

60|$|The words took {{my breath}} away. They were too horrible to realise. I {{positively}} couldn't speak. I {{went up to}} the bookstall, laid down my penny without moving <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>and</b> took the paper in my hand in tremulous silence.|$|E
