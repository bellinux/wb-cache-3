40|$|Plastic pipes {{are often}} {{exposed to a}} range of {{environmental}} conditions which may lead to their degradation. The most important influence factors are UV radiation, humidity and temperature. These can cause leaching of long-term and light stabilisers and finally oxidation of the polymer. In this study we demonstrate how the elemental steps of the photooxidative degradation of polyethylene pipes can be monitored by IR-microscopy. In detail the influence of UV radiation leads to a depletion of the phenolic long-term stabiliser, Irganox 1010. Calibration of the spectroscopic data enables IR-microscopy to be carried out in a quantitative manner and the rate constants for the stabiliser loss to be calculated for the first time. The results obtained from IR-microscopy are well in agreement with those obtained by <b>mechanical</b> <b>sample</b> preparation and measurement of the oxidative induction time (OIT) as well as extraction coupled with chromatographic analysis (HPLC). A mechanism based on Norrish type cleavage is proposed. Also the formation of trans-vinylidene groups as unsaturated degradation products of the PE can be observed.

40|$|Three {{different}} milk sampling {{techniques were}} evaluated during milk sampling: a direct aseptic collection from the udder through a sterile cannula {{was used as}} the reference technique, compared with either a manual or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>sampling</b> method. In this study 30 high-yielding Holstein-Friesian dairy cows at different stages of lactation and free of udder infection were used. For each milk sample, the influence of milk sampling techniques was determined for the following parameters: somatic cell count, milk composition, bacterial contamination, viability, in vitro phagocytosis and overall killing of Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305, and cellular chemiluminescence. Because milk sampling occurred throughout lactation, the differences between early, mid- and late lactation were estimated. It was concluded that bacterial contamination was not significantly different in manual milking samples and the reference technique; bacterial contamination was, however, significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in machine milking samples than in the reference technique. Among the different sampling techniques, no significant effects on SCC, milk composition, viability and functions of the cells isolated from milk were observed. It was found that viability, intracellular killing and cellular chemiluminescence of milk PMN were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in early lactation compared to mid- lactation. Phagocytosis was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in early lactation compared to mid- and late lactation, and no significant differences were observed between mid- and late lactation. From this study, it can be concluded that despite a higher bacterial contamination obtained with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sampling</b> method, the 3 milk sampling techniques described in this study can be used for the evaluation of milk cell functions...|$|E

For analyses of stable isotopes, radioisotopes such as radiocarbon and 137 Cs, and inorganic elements, a larger mass of wood is required and large-diameter cores (12  mm) are preferably used [4]. When density is measured {{with the water}} displacement method, large cores are preferred [5] because larger cores can provide density values with higher accuracy [6].

40|$|AbstractCell {{stiffness}} is {{a sensitive}} indicator of physiological and pathological changes in cells, with many potential applications in biology and medicine. A new method, real-time deformability cytometry, probes cell stiffness at high throughput by exposing cells to a shear flow in a microfluidic channel, allowing for mechanical phenotyping based on single-cell deformability. However, observed deformations of {{cells in the}} channel not only are determined by cell stiffness, but also depend on cell size relative to channel size. Here, we disentangle mutual contributions of cell size and cell stiffness to cell deformation by a theoretical analysis in terms of hydrodynamics and linear elasticity theory. Performing real-time deformability cytometry experiments on both model spheres of known elasticity and biological cells, we demonstrate that our analytical model not only predicts deformed shapes inside the channel but also allows for quantification of cell mechanical parameters.

While {{it provides an}} obvious way to observe incremental and aggregate displacement information, {{it seems likely that}} DIC data sets, which after all reflect the spatially-resolved response of a microstructure to loads, contain much richer information than has generally been extracted from them. In this paper, we demonstrate a machine-learning approach to quantifying the prior deformation history of a crystalline sample based on its response to a subsequent DIC test. This prior deformation history is encoded in the microstructure through the inhomogeneity of the dislocation microstructure, and in the spatial correlations of the dislocation patterns, which mediate the system's response to the DIC test load. Our domain consists of deformed crystalline thin films generated by a discrete dislocation plasticity simulation. We explore the range of applicability of machine learning (ML) for typical experimental protocols, and as a function of possible size effects and stochasticity. Plasticity size effects may directly influence the data, rendering unsupervised techniques unable to distinguish different plasticity regimes. Comment: 35 pages, 31 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{subcellular}} light-sheet {{fluorescence microscopy}} (LSFM) of adherent cells, glass substrates are advantageously rotated {{relative to the}} excitation and emission light paths to avoid glass-induced optical aberrations. Because cells are spread across the sample volume, three-dimensional imaging requires a light-sheet with a long propagation length, or rapid sample scanning. However, the former degrades axial resolution and/or optical sectioning, while the latter mechanically perturbs sensitive biological specimens on pliant biomimetic substrates (e. g., collagen and basement membrane). Here, we use aberration-free remote focusing to diagonally sweep a narrow light-sheet along the sample surface, enabling multicolor imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. Further, we implement a dithered Gaussian lattice to minimize sample-induced illumination heterogeneities, significantly improving signal uniformity. Compared with <b>mechanical</b> <b>sample</b> scanning, we drastically reduce sample oscillations, allowing us to achieve volumetric imaging at speeds of up to 3. 5  Hz for thousands of Z-stacks. We demonstrate the optical performance with live-cell imaging of microtubule and actin cytoskeletal dynamics, phosphoinositide signaling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, polarized blebbing, and endocytic vesicle sorting. We achieve three-dimensional particle tracking of clathrin-associated structures with velocities up to 4. 5 μm/s in a dense intracellular environment, and show that such dynamics cannot be recovered reliably at lower volumetric image acquisition rates using experimental data, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling...|$|R
