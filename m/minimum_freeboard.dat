40|$|The containership design problem {{involves}} optimizing a nonconvex {{objective function}} over a design space that is restricted {{by a set}} of constraints defined in terms of nonconvex functions. An application of standard nonlinear optimization methods to such a problem can at best attain a local optimum that need not be a global optimum. This thesis investigates the application of alternative modeling, approximation, and global optimization techniques for developing a multidisciplinary approach to the containership design problem. The problem involves five design variables, which prioritized according to their relative importance in the model are: design draft, depth at side, speed, overall length, and maximum beam. Five constraints are imposed on the design, viz., an equality constraint to enforce the balance between the weight and the displacement, a linear inequality constraint on the length to depth ratio that is implied by the lightship weight formulation for the design to be acceptable, an inequality constraint on the metacentric height to ensure that the design satisfies the Coast Guard wind heel criterion, an inequality on the freeboard to ensure the <b>minimum</b> required <b>freeboard</b> governed by the code of federa...|$|R
50|$|As {{weaknesses}} of the original rule became apparent, the Swedish Sailing Federation enacted a number of modifications from 1916 onwards. Construction standards became much more strict and classes had <b>minimum</b> <b>freeboard</b> and maximum lengths defined. The Rule also specified new minimum measurements for internal space, to ensure that boats would have adequate room for accommodations. This {{is in contrast to}} International Rule designs where cabins are not required. The final revision of the rule was issued in 1925. It is still in effect with only minor later changes.|$|E
40|$|Stability is one {{of safety}} {{parameters}} of ships in seaways {{as required by the}} International Maritime Organization (IMO) or national ship classification in order to get safety certificates. Therefore characteristics the ship stability should be initially controlled in design stage. In order to easily investigate the ship stability in design process, it is necessary to investigate relationship between the ship geometry and stability characteristics. This paper discuss effect of several geometry characteristics of ship, such as breadth and draft ratio as well as freeboard and breadth ratio. These geometries ratio are varied in a certain range and calculate righting arm of the ships. The obtained righting arms are evaluated using the IMO intact stability kriteria. Basec on the evaluation results, the minimum breadth and draft ratio as well as the <b>minimum</b> <b>freeboard</b> and breadth ratio can be obtained as function of vertical center of gravity and height ratio. These results show that the ship stability tends to increase when the breadth and draft ratio increases. The ships with larger draft have better stability than the smaller one for the same breadth and draft ration. The ship stability also increases when the freeboard and breadth ration increase. In cases of freeboard and breadth ration less than 0, 06 the difference of stability characteristics are not significant for all ships subject. A significant difference occurs when the ratio of freeboard and breadth is larger than 0, 10. This difference may caused by the hull form characteristics such as the block coefficient of the subject ships...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the {{feasibility}} of purchasing and converting the Rob Humphrey’s design Ocean Phoenix 77 (OP 77) into a luxury, disabled access, blue water cruising yacht, which is able to operate in unlimited areas. The vessel is presently {{for sale in the}} Mediterranean for offers around € 2, 900, 000 and is reported to be in near new condition. Built by Hamble Yacht Services in 2002 her hull is built to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) compliance and she is classed as Recreational Craft Directive (RCD) Category A with 3 watertight subdivisions which will not keep her afloat if her main saloon floods. The vessel is also just below the Large Yacht Code (LY 2) code required minimum length. The rules and guidelines of the relevant regulatory bodies will be examined and any loopholes and ramifications of these will be discussed. The feasibility study will assess the suitability of the vessel against the most pertinent stability and structural classification criteria. In order to comply with Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA) Small Commercial Vessel (SCV) unlimited operation requirements, the vessel will need to be fitted with at least one additional watertight subdivision to ensure compliance with the <b>minimum</b> <b>freeboard</b> requirement of 75 mm should the integrity of any one compartment be affected. The vessel’s suitability for the proposed usage will be examined as will the likely take up by disabled guests. The projected running costs and estimated price of conversion will establish a required financial return and the project {{will examine the}} possibility of a bespoke new build alternative. The paper will assess the specific requirements of guests with disabilities and will focus on ensuring that the vessel is as manageable and comfortable as possible whilst ensuring their dignity and retaining a degree of versatility which will not alienate able bodied guests. Access and safety are key issues and will be assessed with a view to making the vessel easier to operate for guests of differing abilities. The General Arrangement (GA) will be assessed and two different configurations will be proposed which comply with classification requirements whilst offering versatility and ease of use to the widest range of abilities. This assessment will include the rig and sail control systems with a view to making them as user friendly as possible with minimum disruption and cost. Stability and code compliance will be reassessed once precise details of the proposed alterations are known. The range will be assessed regarding fuel and fresh water supplies and the vessel’s powering and propulsion will be assessed to ensure that the current arrangements are still suitable for the converted vessel...|$|E

The {{objective was to}} study the effect of varying principal hull parameters including diameter and draft on the overall system’s hydrostatic and hydrodynamic performance. First, a spreadsheet was constructed, containing certain engineering simplifications to evaluate a number of floating geometries with varying drafts and diameters in an effective manner. These results formed the basis for selecting three potential floaters to be evaluated in comprehensive hydrodynamic simulations. However, frequency dependent added mass and damping matrices, displacement RAOs and load RAOs in the six degrees of freedom (DOFs) had to be established prior to running the simulations. The software HydroD was used for this purpose, which utilizes three-dimensional potential theory to calculate the aforementioned parameters. The parameters metacentric height, natural periods and static inclination angles were evaluated in the spreadsheet calculations to analyze the effect of varying principal hull parameters on the system’s hydrostatic performance. The evaluated floater geometries were established by varying the draft in increments of 25 meters and calculate the needed diameter to gain a displacement of 5300 tons. A new vessel was generated in OrcaFlex using the output gained from the HydroD analysis, where a total of two environmental conditions were evaluated. The first, referred to as EC 1, represented an operational condition at rated power output, while the second, referred to as EC 2, represented a full storm scenario. The sea state was modelled an irregular wave train generated form a JONSWAP wave spectrum with peakadness factor of 3. 3, while the wind was modelled as a point load acting {{at the center of the}} rotor blades. The simplified wind environment is a rather coarse approximation, but necessary nonetheless, as time was rather spent on obtaining an accurate hydrodynamic model. Performance parameters such as motions in the six DOFs, <b>minimum</b> <b>freeboard</b> and air-gap, effective tension in the mooring lines and arc-length to touchdown point were evaluated to analyze the effect of varying principal hull parameters on the system’s hydrodynamic performance. The results from the spreadsheet calculations revealed that a floater comprising of a higher draft and lower diameter features a higher metacentric height due to an overall greater rise in ̅��������̅̅��������̅ compared to the rise in ̅��������̅̅��������̅ associated with such a geometry. Since the studied floaters featured similar displacements, i. e. similar buoyancy force, the high draft and low diameter floaters also illustrated more favorable static inclination angles, as the increased ̅��������̅̅��������̅̅ led to a greater arm in the up-righting moment. Furthermore, all studied geometries featured suitable natural periods to avoid resonance motions with first-order wave effects. The dynamic simulation indicated that a floater comprising of a higher draft and lower diameter floater obtains the most favorable motion characteristic in surge, sway, heave, roll and pitch. The reduced surge, sway and heave translations were related to a reduced total force, i. e. force that gives net motions, in these DOF caused by the reduced diameter. The reduced roll and pitch motions were related to the increased up-righting moment due to the greater metacentric height associated with a long and slender floater. However, some cost considerations based on intuitive relations revealed that a higher draft would most probably lead to a more expensive floating system. Furthermore, a high draft may limit the number of operation sites suitable in accommodating the turbine system, as the site needs to feature sufficient depth to facilitate the draft and the mooring lines used for station keeping purposes. It is therefore believed that the optimum principal hull parameters combination will be a compromise of sufficient stability, cost and depth at location the turbine shall operate...|$|E
