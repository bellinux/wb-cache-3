5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> park today.|$|E
50|$|Historical {{information}} {{accounts that}} Egbu {{is the son}} of Ome. Egbu had 3 sons namely Okweke, Ubaeze and Ishiuzo. Okweke the first son of Egbu had 2 sons Ayalu and Amatu(ofeuzo).

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} that 55 Cancri e is a solid planet made of carbon-rich material rather than the oxygen-rich material that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> terrestrial planets in our solar system. In this case, roughly {{a third of the}} planet's mass would be carbon, much of which may be in the form of diamond {{as a result of the}} temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. Further observations are necessary to confirm the nature of the planet.|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. The {{first is}} much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is {{slightly}} heavier) <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N {{is one of the}} five stable odd–odd nuclides (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.|$|E

5|$|The Judd School (often known {{simply as}} Judd) is a grammar school in Tonbridge, Kent, {{southeast}} England. It was established in 1888 at Stafford House on East Street in Tonbridge, where it remained for eight years before moving to its present location on Brook Street, {{in the south of}} the town. Founded by the Skinners Company, it was named after 16th century merchant Sir Andrew Judde, whose endowment helped fund the school.

5|$|The Legal {{system in}} Japan has been {{historically}} influenced by Chinese law; developing independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. It has, however, changed during the Meiji Restoration, {{and is now}} largely based on the European civil law; notably, the civil code based on the German model still remains in effect. A quasi-jury system has recently came into use, and the legal system also includes {{a bill of rights}} since May 3, 1947.

5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language.

5|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> exterior of the home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E
5|$|The {{entire area}} {{underwent}} uplift during the Laramide orogeny between 70 and 40 {{million years ago}} which was {{also part of the}} Gunnison Uplift. This raised the Precambrian gneiss and schist that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> canyon walls. During the Tertiary from 26 to 35 million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in the area immediately surrounding the present day Black Canyon. The West Elk Mountains, La Sal Mountains, Henry Mountains, and Abajo Mountains all contributed to burying the area in several thousand feet of volcanic ash and debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common {{during the early}} epoch, {{and the majority of}} galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E
