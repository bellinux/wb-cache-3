It was rebuilt by the Lusignans in the 13th century, dismantled in 1570 by the Venetians who were unable to defend it against the Ottomans, who in their turn restored and strengthened it after capturing the island. Saranta Kolones, Kato Paphos, near the harbour, is a castle built {{in the first years}} of Lusignan rule (beginning of the 12th century) <b>maybe</b> <b>on</b> the site of a previous Byzantine castle.

500|$|Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{expressed}} interest in the role, but ABC executives felt she was not right for the part. Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Heather Locklear, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Cherry wrote the part with Parker in mind, but she rejected the offer, later explaining [...] "it just didn’t feel like I was gonna [...] serve {{it as well as}} someone else might". Teri Hatcher auditioned for the role in January 2004 and impressed Cherry immediately. After a second audition, Hatcher read for the role in front of network executives. Cherry praised her performance, saying [...] "it was the best audition I've ever seen in network". Hatcher later commented, [...] "I don't think they were hot to hire me for Susan... I was <b>maybe</b> <b>on</b> a B-list, certainly not an A-list". Despite her reservations, Hatcher was the third reported cast member to have been cast in the series on February 18, 2004.|$|E
500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except <b>maybe</b> <b>on</b> Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here", said Chris.|$|E

"For health," [...] said Christie, looking gloomily at me, [...] "ye maun ken {{little of}} the warld, sir, if ye dinna ken that {{the health of the}} poor man's body, as well as his youth and his strength, are all at the command of the rich man's purse. There never was a trade so {{unhealthy}} yet but men would fight to get wark at it for twa pennies a day aboon the common wage. But the bairns were reasonably weel cared for in the way of air and exercise, and a very responsible youth heard them their Carritch, and gied them lessons in Reediemadeasy ["Reading made Easy," [...] usually so pronounced in Scotland.] Now, what did they ever get before? <b>Maybe</b> <b>on</b> a winter day they wad be called out to beat the wood for cocks or siclike; and then the starving weans would maybe get a bite of broken bread, and maybe no, just as the butler was in humour--that was a' they got." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will see," [...] said Jeanie composedly; {{and going}} to the closet in which she kept her honey, her sugar, her pots of jelly, her vials of the more {{ordinary}} medicines, and which served her, in short, as a sort of store-room, she jangled vials and gallipots, till, from out the darkest nook, well flanked by a triple row of bottles and jars, which she was under the necessity of displacing, she brought a cracked brown cann, with a piece of leather tied over the top. Its contents seemed to be written papers, thrust in disorder into this uncommon secre'taire. But from among these Jeanie brought an old clasped Bible, which had been David Deans's companion in his earlier wanderings, and which he had given to his daughter when the failure of his eyes had compelled him to use one of a larger print. This she gave to Butler, who had been looking at her motions with some surprise, and desired him to see what that book could do for him. He opened the clasps, and to his astonishment a parcel of L50 bank-notes dropped out from betwixt the leaves, where they had been separately lodged, and fluttered upon the floor. [...] "I didna think to hae tauld you o' my wealth, Reuben," [...] said his wife, smiling at his surprise, [...] "till on my deathbed, or <b>maybe</b> <b>on</b> some family pinch; but it wad be better laid out on yon bonny grass-holms, than lying useless here in this auld pigg." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{are quite}} right, my dear lady, I was forgetting. The gentleman {{in the third}} floor back! cooking for him {{is not a great}} tax upon the kitchen fire. His breakfast, it is what, madam, we call plain, I think. His lunch he takes out. You may see him, walking round the quiet square, up and down the narrow street that, leading to nowhere in particular, is between twelve and two {{somewhat}} deserted. He carries a paper bag, into which at intervals, when he is sure nobody is looking, his mouth disappears. From studying the neighbourhood one can guess what it contains. Saveloys hereabouts are plentiful and only twopence each. There are pie shops, where meat pies are twopence and fruit pies a penny. The lady behind the counter, using deftly a broad, flat knife, lifts the little dainty with one twist clean from its tiny dish: it is marvellous, having regard to the thinness of the pastry, that she never breaks one. Roley-poley pudding, sweet and wonderfully satisfying, more especially when cold, is but a penny a slice. Peas pudding, though this is an awkward thing to eat out of a bag, is comforting upon cold days. Then with his tea he takes two eggs or a haddock, the fourpenny size; <b>maybe</b> <b>on</b> rare occasions, a chop or steak; and you fry it for him, madam, though every time he urges on you how much he would prefer it grilled, for fried in your one frying-pan its flavour becomes somewhat confused. But maybe this is the better for him, for, shutting his eyes and trusting only to smell and flavour, he can imagine himself enjoying variety. He can begin with herrings, pass on to liver and bacon, opening his eyes again for a moment perceive that he has now arrived at the joint, and closing them again, wind up with distinct suggestion of toasted cheese, thus avoiding monotony. For dinner he goes out again. Maybe he is not hungry, late meals are a mistake; or, maybe, putting his hand into his pocket and making calculations beneath a lamp-post, appetite may come to him. Then there are places cheerful with the sound of frizzling fat, where fried plaice brown and odorous may be had for three halfpence, and a handful of sliced potatoes for a penny; where for fourpence succulent stewed eels may be discussed; vinegar ad lib.; or for sevenpence--but these are red-letter evenings--half a sheep's head may be indulged in, which is a supper fit for any king, who happened to be hungry.|$|E
