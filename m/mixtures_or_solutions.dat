40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to assess the {{potential}} fate of CO 2 when it is injected in the deep subsurface for storage. In the coming year (2008), over 20 field geologic sequestration tests are being designed and scheduled for deployment in the United States. An additional 23 are ongoing or slated for deployment soon in other countries. For large-scale geologic sequestration to be deployed and sustainable over the long-term, a meaningful assessment of CO 2 trapping mechanisms is essential. Therefore, the chapters in this dissertation are each part of a detailed study of the physical and chemical processes associated with CO 2 trapping mechanisms. First, two integrated equations of state (EOS) algorithms were assembled to evaluate multiphase transport of carbon dioxide (CO 2). One integrated EOS is based on Redlich and Kwong’s original algorithm developed in 1949, and the other is based on a more recent algorithm developed by Span and Wagner in 1996. Both algorithms calculate solubility, compressibility factor, density, viscosity, fugacity, and enthalpy of CO 2 in gaseous and supercritical phases, and <b>mixtures</b> <b>or</b> <b>solutions</b> of CO 2 in water, as functions of pressure and temperature...|$|E

40|$|Several decalcifying {{mixtures}} or aqueous solutions of inorganic or {{organic acids}} are generally used for releasing algae {{growing in the}} shells of molluscs and barnacles, for instance dilute hydrochloric, nitric, citric, or acetic acid (4), a mixture of nitric acid, chromic acid and alcolhol (1), nitric acid and alcohol (9), chlorine dioxide and acetic acid (diaphanol) (3, 6, 11, 12), and formic acid and formiate (8). For a review see (7). Such <b>mixtures</b> <b>or</b> <b>solutions</b> generate carbondioxide bubbles that more or less disorganise the histological structure of the thallus. They also hydrolyse cell-contents and cell-wall material. Diaphanol and formiate appeared to be relatively useful for conserving the histological structure of the thalli. Recently (5, 10, 13) chelating agents, e. g. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) were introduced as histological decalcifiers. The fact that EDTA is widely used as a chelating ingredient of nutrient media for algal cultures suggested its possible use for releasing living algae growing in animal shells. However, the concentration necessary for decalcification is a multiple of that used in culture media (1 % to 5 % and 0. 0005 %. respectively).

40|$|The {{process of}} electrospinning is {{considered}} one of the most promising methods for the fabrication of poly- mer nanofibers. This essentially consists of applying a high electric field, which causes stretching of the polymer which exits through a capillary. Among the numerous applications of this process, electrospinning allows the fabrication of semiconductor and conductive nanofibers from <b>mixtures</b> <b>or</b> <b>solutions,</b> which have great potential for applications in sensors and the fabrication of scaffolds for cell growth. The aim of this work was to analyze the properties of the blend, produces by the electrospinning of the PCL and PLLA solu- tion, with the focus to generate a promissory scaffold. PCL is a semi-crystalline aliphatic polymer that has a slower degradation rate 12 - 24 months. It has a low glass transition temperature at – 60 ?C, a melting tem-perature at about 60 ?C, and a high thermal stability. Properties of PLA depend on the component isomers, processing temperature, annealing time and molecular weight. Thus were used PCL, from Aldrich, with Mw of 80, 000 g/mol, and PLLA, sintered in laboratory, with Mw of 240, 000 g/mol, were dissolved in chloroform (CHCl 3, Merck) and acetone (Synth) by stirring for 6 hours. The solution was electrospinning for 1 hour us- ing the equipment made in the laboratory, the voltage used was 13 kv, the rate of 0. 5 ml/h and an approxi- mate distance from the tip of the needle to the collector of 12 cm.

The use of the melting point and boiling point {{as a test of}} purity is based on the theory of the phase rule and has been of the greatest help in organic chemistry, {{but in the case of}} many substances such as the proteins, these properties cannot be used and it is necessary to make use of an entirely analogous property, the solubility.

At low or modest pressures fugacity coefficient can be estimated easily for very simple <b>mixtures</b> <b>or</b> ideal <b>solutions,</b> but for non-ideal mixtures, estimation of liquid phase activity coefficient is quite difficult. Experimental mixture data are required to calculate activity coefficient. Since the variety of chemical species is separated out in chemical process industry {{and it is not}} necessary to every physicochemical and VLE experimental data are available in open database. In this regard researchers developed a new ‘group contribution model which is able to predict the VLE data.

The particular promising method for calculating activity coefficient from group contributions method is provided by UNIFAC (universal quasi chemical functional group activity coefficient model). This method is a consequence of a model for activity coefficients called UNIQUAC (universal quasi chemical). The word UNIFAC stands for UNIQUAC functional group activity coefficients.

Methods The biopotencies of r-hFSH and r-hLH were determined following injection of female Sprague-Dawley rats with a mixture of follitropin alfa revised formulation female (RFF) and lutropin alfa (1 : 1, r-hFSH:r-hLH). Biopotencies of follitropin alfa RFF and lutropin alfa were measured using ovarian weight and ascorbic acid depletion assays, respectively, and compared with a reference standard. Stock mixtures of follitropin alfa RFF and lutropin alfa (1 : 1) were prepared within 1 h prior to each respective assay's injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. Separate low dose (follitropin alfa RFF 1. 5 IU/rat, lutropin alfa 2 IU/rat) and high dose (follitropin alfa RFF 3 IU/rat, lutropin alfa 8 IU/rat) treatments were prepared from stock <b>mixtures</b> <b>or</b> individual <b>solutions</b> by diluting with 0. 22 % bovine serum albumin saline solution and injected within 1 h of preparation.

Fractionation and solubility determinations show that these preparations are not <b>mixtures</b> <b>or</b> solid <b>solutions</b> of the original pepsin with an inactive derivative. A compound which contains three or four acetyl groups and which has lost all of its original primary amino groups can be isolated after short acetylation. It has the same activity as the original pepsin. A second derivative containing six to eleven acetyl groups has also been isolated. It has about 60 per cent of the activity of the original pepsin. A third derivative having twenty to thirty acetyl groups and about 10 per cent of the activity of original pepsin can be isolated after prolonged acetylation. The 60 per cent active derivative on standing in strong acid solution loses some of its acetyl groups and at the same time regains the activity of the original pepsin. The compound obtained in this way is probably the same as the completely active three acetyl derivative obtained by mild acetylation. These results show that acetylation of three or four of the primary amino groups of pepsin causes no change in the specific activity of the enzyme but that the introduction of acetyl groups in other parts of the molecule results in a marked loss in activity. The solubilities, amino nitrogen content, acetyl content, isoelectric point, and the specific activity have been determined by a variety of methods and found to be different from the corresponding properties of crystalline pepsin.

In addition, OA is very reactive and transforms to HA in contact with water vapor (HA reconstitution) (Gross et al. 1998).
