40|$|The {{impact of}} changes {{within a single}} land-use {{category}} or land-use intensity on microbial communities is poorly understood, especially with respect to fungi. Here we assessed how forest management regimes and a change in forest type affect the richness and community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi across Germany. We used molecular methods based on the length polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacers and the 5. 8 S rRNA gene to assess fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A cloning/ sequencing approach was used to identify taxonomic affinities of the fungal OTUs. Overall, 20 e 24 % and 25 e 27 % of native fungal OTUs from forest reserves and semi-natural forests became undetectable or were lost in managed and converted forests, respectively. Fungal richness was significantly reduced during a regeneration phase in age-class beech forests {{with a high level}} of wood extraction (P ¼ 0. 017), whereas fungal community structures were not significantly affected. Conversion of forests from native, deciduous to coniferous species caused significant changes in the fungal community structure (R ¼ 0. 64 e 0. 66, P ¼ 0. 0001) and could reduce fungal richness (P < 0. 05) which may depend on which coniferous species was introduced. Our results showed that Ascocoryne cylichnium, Armillaria sp., Exophiala <b>moniliae,</b> Hyphodontia subalutacea and Fomes fomentarius, all known for wood-decaying abilities were strongly reduced in their abundances when forests were converted from beech to coniferous. We conclude that changes within a single land-use category can be regarded as a major threat to fungal diversity in temperate forest ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Diverse {{groups of}} {{microscopic}} fungi {{are able to}} degrade polymeric plant tissues such as pectin. Biodegradation of these materials are mostly applicable in food industries. Materials and Methods: In the present study, the exopectinase producing fungus was isolated from decaying tangerine and its exopectinase activity was studied in submerged fermenting condition. Also, the enzyme production of the isolated fungus was compared to the industrial fungus, Aspergillus niger PTCC 5013. The exopectinase production and activity of the extracted enzyme solution with respect to pH, temperature, activity timing and substrate concentration were scrutinized. Results: According to the morphological macroscopic and microscopic features, the isolated fungus was identified as the genus <b>Monilia</b> in the Moniliaceae family. The best exopectinase production was in pH 7 and the best enzyme activity achieved at 50 °C, in 30 to 40 minute, 1. 5 % substrate and the 1 : 1 of the enzyme solution to the substrate solution ratio. The isolated fungus, <b>Monilia,</b> was fast growing and produced highly active exopectinase enzyme.

40|$|Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is an {{important}} cash crop in tropical climates {{such as that of}} Latin America. Over the past several decades, the infection of cultivated cacao by Moniliophthora roreri, known commonly as “monilia”, has significantly hindered cacao production in Latin America. Studies have proposed the use of Trichoderma sp. Fungi in biocontrol treatments to prevent and reduce <b>monilia</b> infection, yet tests of Trichoderma-containing spray treatments on cacao agroforests have produced mixed results. Researchers and agricultural workers have suggested that addition of soil, fly ash, or other carbon sources to a Trichoderma spray may improve its efficacy in fighting <b>monilia.</b> To test these suggestions, we designed a series of spray mixtures including Trichoderma cultures, soil, and all necessary controls. We applied the spray mixtures to 80 cacao trees (20 trees for each of four resistant-selected clones to <b>monilia)</b> at the FINMAC organic cacao plantation in Pueblo Nuevo de Guacimo, Limón Province, in northeastern Costa Rica in March-April 2013. Five treatments were applied (control, water, water plus sterilized soil, water plus Trichoderma, and water plus sterilized soil plus Trichoderma). Each treatment was applied to four trees of each clone. We monitored the incidence of moniliainfection under each spray treatment over the course of 35 d. We found that spraying entire cacao trees two times with a mixture containing Trichoderma and sterilized soil significantly reduced the incidence of <b>monilia</b> infection by 11 % (p< 0. 05) in only 35 d, ascompared to the control. This reduction in loss of cacao pods translates into an increase of plantation mean productivity of 1 500 kg dried beans/ha by 198 kg/ha up to 1 698 kg/ha or by a total increase over the whole 110 ha plantation by 21 780 kg. We propose that using such an antifungal spray over the whole course of a crop cycle (120 days) would decrease infection incidence even more. Application of this fungal control measure has the potential of revitalizing the production of cacao in the region. Rev. Biol. Trop. 62 (3) : 899 - 907. Epub 2014 September 01...|$|E
