40|$|Low cost {{approaches}} to the design and fabrication of blades for a two-bladed 200 kW wind turbine were identified and {{the applicability of the}} techniques to larger and smaller blades was assessed. Blade tooling was designed and fabricated. Two complete blades and a partial blade for tool tryout were built. The patented TFT process was used to wind the entire blade. This process allows rapid winding of an axially oriented composite onto a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel,</b> with <b>tapered</b> wall thickness. The blade consists of a TFT glass-epoxy airfoil structure filament wound onto a steel root end fitting. The fitting is, in turn, bolted to a conical steel adapter section to provide for mounting attachment to the hub.

This paper {{presents}} the numerical and {{experimental studies of}} the residual stresses in Al 2024 T 3 specimens due to cold hole expansion (CHE) using ball and <b>taper</b> <b>mandrel</b> techniques. A three dimensional, non-linear finite element analysis has been performed to simulate the CHE process and experiments were conducted to determine the residual stresses due to CHE with 2 - 6 % expansion of holes. The residual stresses were determined experimentally by employing strain gauges around the hole during the expansion. Experimental and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{results showed that the}} residual stresses increased up to 5 % of hole expansion and decreased further in both the techniques of CHE and the same were greater in case of <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> than that of ball mandrel method. At the optimum expansion of 5 %, the FE predictions and experimental results concurred with each other with a maximum deviation of 2 %...|$|R
40|$|Low cost {{approaches}} for production of 60 ft long glass fiber/resin composite rotor blades for the MOD-OA wind turbine {{were identified and}} evaluated. The most cost-effective configuration was selected for detailed design. Subelement and subscale specimens were fabricated for testing to confirm physical and mechanical properties of the composite blade materials, to develop and evaluate blade fabrication techniques and processes, and to confirm the structural adequacy of the root end joint. Full-scale blade tooling was constructed and a partial blade for tool and process tryout was built. Then two full scale blades were fabricated and delivered to NASA-LeRC for installation on a MOD-OA wind turbine at Clayton, New Mexico for operational testing. Each blade was 60 ft. long with 4. 5 ft. chord at root end and 2575 lbs weight including metal hub adapter. The selected blade configuration was a three cell design constructed using a resin impregnated glass fiber tape winding process that allows rapid wrapping of primarily axially oriented fibers onto a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel,</b> with <b>tapered</b> wall thickness. The ring winder/transverse filament tape process combination {{was used for the}} first time on this program to produce entire rotor blade structures. This approach permitted the complete blade to be wound on stationary mandrels, an improvement which alleviated some of the tooling and process problems encountered on previous composite blade programs...|$|R

40|$|Coldworking {{fastener}} holes is {{a mechanical}} method of strengthening materials by retarding crack growth around the holes. It expands the hole diameter {{by creating a}} radial plastic flow of material, thereby producing a large residual compressive stress zone around the hole. This zone, depending upon variables such as material and applied expansion levels, will extend approximately one radius {{from the edge of}} the hole. This zone acts as a barrier, retarding crack growth, thereby increasing the fatigue life of the part. In this paper the benefits of coldworking are discussed. Currently there are two fastener hole coldworking methods used widely, the split sleeve, and split mandrel processes. The split sleeve process utilizes a solid, <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> and an internally lubricated split sleeve. The sleeveless split mandrel process utilizes a hollow, <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> that is longitudinally slotted into quarters (making it collapsible). Details of each process are discussed. Coldworking research to date has been focused on either fatigue life enhancement, or stress zone measurements (both actual and computer simulated). Research of the differences between the split sleeve and split mandrel process has been very limited. West Coast Industries (WCI) has theorized that these differences are important in determining the correct process for a specific application. An example of the need for this process-application matching can be seen in the problems encountere...|$|R
5000|$|The Xpandrel {{method of}} {{expanding}} mandrels {{was introduced in}} the mid-1990s. This method uses basic mechanical principles of deformation to achieve expansion of a non-tapered mandrel. Using various methods of actuation, the body of the mandrel is deformed below the limit of elasticity to provide repeatable holding forces without typical deformation caused by pressing on <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrels.</b> Other commercial mandrels are very slightly tapered, and the hollow object slides down the taper until it [...] "sticks". The shop-made mandrel shown in the photo is designed to clamp a hollow tube or gear between the two tapered plugs. There is little about such a mandrel that can't be made right on the lathe on which it is to be used, so {{it is not uncommon for}} machinists to make a mandrel to hold a particular item and then set the mandrel aside hoping to use it again some day. Mandrels of this type are usually set in the lathe on centers and turned with a lathe dog.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} the {{development}} of a novel technique for cold expansion using a rotating <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> that friction processes the cylindrical wall of the fastener hole and simultaneously cold expands it. The developed technique, named as rotating tool cold expansion (RTCE), is experimentally and numerically investigated. A 3 D thermomechanical finite element model for predicting the compressive residual stress, responsible for delaying crack propagation from the edges of the holes, is introduced. The efficacy is that RTCE is assessed for varying degrees of cold expansion under different lubricating conditions at the tool-workpiece interface, such as dry, metal working fluid, and nanopowder. The plastic deformation combined with friction stirring at the tool-workpiece interface helps the RTCE in controlling the surface damage at entry and exit of the hole that is most often observed with the conventional cold expansion technique. Enhanced friction due to the nanopowder at the tool-workpiece interface helps in sustaining efficacy of the RTCE even at a higher degree of cold expansion which otherwise leads to surface damage with other medium...|$|R
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|R
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, the fastener holes are widely present because various mechanical parts {{need to be}} connected by rivets or bolts. These holes experience external forces which cause a tensile stress on the surface resulting in fatigue cracks and eventually fatigue failure of the structure. To alleviate this problem, cold expansion method {{has been used to}} improve the fatigue behavior of structures by inducing compressive residual stresses around the holes by forcing a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> through the fastener hole that is slightly smaller than the mandrel. In this study, finite element simulations had been carried out for cold expansion process {{in order to determine the}} residual stress fields around two cold-expanded holes by varying the centre distance between two holes and also the thickness of the material. Moreover, the effect of through thickness position has also been investigated by considering the residual stresses distribution at different positions such as at the entrance face, at the middle of the thickness and at the exit face of the material. Aluminium alloy 7075 -T 6 was used as the material for the model simulated in ANSYS. The results showed that as the distance between the adjacent holes increased, the residual stresses decreased. Moreover, the simulation also highlighted the effect of the plate thickness and the through thickness position on the residual stresses distribution. The compressive residual stresses increased as the plate thickness increased. Meanwhile, the results at the mid-thickness were higher than the results at the entrance and exit faces...|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{parts in}} industries are assembled by rivets, bolts, pins etc. These joints {{are more vulnerable}} to fatigue loadings and a crack is emanated. As structure is in use crack starts propagating {{over a period of}} time. Crack propagation can be obstructed by inducing a compressive residual stress zone around the vulnerable parts. Cold expansion hole (CEH) is one of the techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered pin or a large diameter ball into an undersized hole. As the oversized object is inserted into the hole, the surrounding material is elastically deformed and when the object comes out from the other side, the expanded material springs back to form tangential compressive residual stress around the hole. In most of the cases the crack origins on the surface, a good surface finish is also an important parameter for increasing the strength at the surface and stop crack emanation. However, good surface finish is not achieved by CEH. A novel technique called rotating tool cold expansion (RTCE) technique is developed where a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> is inserted into an undersized hole besides rotating it simultaneously. The tool rotation breaks down the coarse grains into fine grain structure achieving good surface finish. In this method, RTCE is performed with three undersized diameters, namely, 9. 2, 9. 5 and 9. 9 mm diameters to a maximum of 10 mm diameter. The tool material is high speed steel and the work piece material is commercial aluminium. The induced residual stresses are measured using X-ray diffraction method and compared for three different Cold expansion holes. Due to the rotation of the tool, heat is generated because of both friction at the interface and plastic deformation. A 3 -D thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in ANSYS FEA for different values of coefficient of friction and plastic deformation rate and validated with experimental results. Compared to the degree of cold expansion through conventional techniques (upto 4 %) the proposed technique is capable to produce good results up to 8. 69 % of cold expansion. Role of heat generated through friction and plastic deformation is critical to attain the best possible result, equal contributions of both are important...|$|R
40|$|Tube {{drawing is}} a well known process {{involving}} at room temperature the reduction of diameter and wall thickness to obtain specified values. The initial tube is drawn into a die of a smaller opening and its thickness achieved by use of a mandrel. Usually, the mandrel has a land area which diameter defines by sizing the inside diameter of the final tube. Some structural components found in cars, aircrafts and other vehicles require bent or hydroformed tubes of lower weight. It is of interest to have tubes of varying axial or circumferential thickness so that to reduce overweight in low stressed areas and reinforce it otherwise. However, the production of tubes of varying thickness is more difficult in reason notably of higher metal flow stresses in the deformation zone {{and the need to}} control precisely the mandrel position during drawing. Axial thickness variation is obtained using a mandrel with stepped lands or with a slight taper while circumferential variation is achieved with a mandrel of desired internal or external shape (e. g. oval). In this paper, two techniques for axial tube wall thickness variation and one technique for circumferential variations are introduced and tested. First, the techniques to produce drawn tubes with thickness variations are presented. For testing, a small (335 kN) instrumented tube drawing machine is used. Details on this machine, process lubrication, monitored data and on the tooling implemented are also presented. Initial tubes are mainly AA 6063 extrusions of 63. 5 mm O. D. and 2. 6 mm thick and the final outside diameter, i. e. the inside diameter of the die, is about 47. 5 mm. AA 6061 tubes are also drawn. Starting with drawing tests without mandrel, the natural flow of the tube and the drawing force involved are measured. Secondly, tubes of 4 different thicknesses are produced with a stepped mandrel and the strain hardening effect on mechanical properties established. Using a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel,</b> tubes of continuously varying wall thickness are tested. Higher local pressure in the die corner radius restricts proper lubrication in certain conditions but results are promising in most cases. We also study the effect of thickness rate of change along the tube. Finally, tests with a stepped oval mandrel provided good results for circumferential thickness variations. The dimensional quality is measured using a coordinate measuring machine and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests in both initial and drawn tubes. Finally, despite some minor problems, the techniques proposed can efficiently produce tubes with thickness variations and have a very strong potential for industrial use.

40|$|Airframe {{assemblers}} {{have long}} recognised {{that for a}} new aircraft to be successful it must use less fuel, have lower maintenance requirements, and be more affordable. One common tactic {{is the use of}} innovative materials, such as advanced composites. Composite materials are suited to structural connection by adhesive bonding, which minimises the need for inefficient mechanical fastening. The aim of this PhD project was to investigate the application of existing, yet immature Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques to adhesively bonded composite aerospace structures. The PhD study focused on two emerging SHM technologies - frequency response and comparative vacuum monitoring (CVM). This project aimed to provide missing critical information for each technique. This included determining sensitivity to damage, repeatability of results, and operating limitations for the frequency response method. Study of the CVM technique aimed to address effectiveness of damage detection, manufacture of sensor cavities, and the influence of sensor integration on mechanical performance of bonded structures. Experimental research work is presented examining the potential of frequency response techniques for the detection of debonding in composite-to-composite external patch repairs. Natural frequencies were found to decrease over a discrete frequency range as the debond size increased; confirming that such features could be used to both detect and characterise damage. The effectiveness of the frequency response technique was then confirmed for composite patch and scarf repair specimens for free-free and fixed-fixed boundary conditions. Finally, the viability of the frequency response technique was assessed for a scarf repair of a real aircraft component, where it was found that structural damping limited the maximum useable frequency. The feasibility of CVM technique for the inspection of co-cured stiffener-skin aircraft structures was explored. The creation of sensor cavities with <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrels</b> was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the stiffener, including crimping and waviness of fibres and resin-rich zones between plies. Representative stiffened-skin structure with two sensor cavity configurations (parallel and perpendicular to the stiffener direction) was tested to failure in tension and compression. While tensile failure strength was significantly reduced for both configurations (up to 25 %), no appreciable differences in compression properties were found. Two potential sensor cavity configurations were investigated for the extension of the CVM technique to pre-cured and co-bonded scarf repair schemes. The creation of radial and circumferential CVM sensor cavities was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the adhesive bond-line and the architecture of the repair material {{in the case of the}} co-bonded repair. These alterations changed the failure mode and reduced the tensile failure strength of the repair. A fibre straightening mechanism responsible for progressive failure (specific to co-bonded repairs with circumferential cavities) was identified, and subsequently supported with acoustic emission testing and numerical analysis. While fatigue performance was generally reduced by the presence of CVM cavities, the circumferential cavities appeared to retard crack progression, reducing sensitivity to the accumulation of fatigue damage. These outcomes have brought forward the implementation of SHM in bonded composite structures, which has great potential to improve the operating efficiency of next generation aircraft...|$|R

When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented.

It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3.

Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a <b>tapered</b> <b>mandrel</b> gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12.
