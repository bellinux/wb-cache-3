40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the way of <b>mounting</b> a <b>tube</b> diffuser, the design of an aeration tank and the presence of a fixed carrier on the operational parameters of aeration systems used in small wastewater treatment plants. It was found out that the vertically <b>mounted</b> <b>tube</b> diffuser decreased standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR) of the aeration system by approximately 20 % and standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTE) by 25 % comparing to the horizontally <b>mounted</b> <b>tube</b> diffuser. It was also defined that the design of the aeration tank might {{have an impact on the}} operation parameters of the aeration system: when the centre shell used to protect a diffuser was dismantled from a test tank, SOTR and SOTE increased by approximately 20 %. It was also established that the presence of the fixed carrier in the aeration tank did not have an impact on the performance of aeration systems. Finally, research was carried out to compare the operational parameters of two diffusers of different types offered on the market and used in small wastewater treatment plants. It was found out that the performance different type diffusers  might vary considerably. Article in Lithuanian</p...|$|R

The possibility has been considered to obtain optimum performance and efficiency by reducing clearance to a safe minimum {{with the aid of}} a closed-loop tip clearance control system, which utilizes a tip clearance sensor. The use of optical sensing methods appears to represent a potential solution to the tip clearance measurement problem. Principles of sensor operation are discussed along with dimensional considerations and diffraction limitations. A description is presented of the study of the feasibility of a certain sensor, taking into account the test rig system, the optical components, and the <b>mounting</b> <b>tube.</b> Attention is also given to the operation of the feasibility-study sensor, performance estimations, the optical fiber bundle, light beam refraction, and aspects of aircraft engine implementation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} filter oscillatory transients from measurements of a time series which were at least {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the signal to be measured. Based on a Kalman filter, it has an optimality property and a natural scaling parameter that allows to tune it to high resolution or low noise. 1 How transients can spoil measurements In her Matura thesis [5], Carmen Müller tried to measure the opening shock of small parachutes in the Ackeret wind tunnel of the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich (ETHZ). A specially constructed <b>mounting</b> <b>tube</b> ejected the parachute using a piston powered by a small black powder charge into the air stream. While this accurately reflected the way parachutes are usually ejected from small rockets, it also induced heavy oscillations in the measurement equipment and probably also excited waves within the wind tunnel. As a result, the data was almost unusable. The large amplitude transients were at least one order of magnitude larger than the effects to be measured (figure 1). Upon inspection of the data, two oscillatory components with frequencies of about 40 Hz and 12. 2 Hz were found. Assuming that the measured signal is a superposition of the actual force to be measured f(t) and a transient of period T, convolution with a function of constant value T − 1 on the interval [−T, 0], or equivalently a moving average over the samples that fit in an interval of length T, eliminated the transient. In this way, the two dominant transients could be removed, and an approximation to the opening shock force was obtained. Th...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase {{crossflow}} {{over heat}} exchanger tubes induces vibrations which contribute {{greatly to the}} wear on the tubes. Of the three mechanisms leading to two-phase flow-induced vibrations which have been identified, fluid-elastic instability has been recognized as that {{which leads to the}} vibrations with the largest amplitude. The mass damping parameter is used to predict the onset of fluid-elastic instability, and the mean drag coefficient is used to calculate the mass damping parameter. In this thesis, the drag coefficient measured over single tubes and tubes within array, in single-phase and two-phase flow at various Reynolds numbers, is discussed. The drag coefficient was measured by two methods. For flexibly <b>mounted</b> <b>tubes,</b> strain gages were mounted on cantilever beams which held the tube in place and allowed it to vibrate in the direction parallel to the flow only. For both rigidly and flexibly <b>mounted</b> <b>tubes,</b> pressure distributions were measured {{around the perimeter of the}} tube. Forces, and then the drag coefficient, could be calculated from this information. The drag coefficient was not found to depend upon the flexibility of the <b>tube</b> <b>mounting.</b> As the void fraction of the flow increases, the drag coefficient over the tube increases. This effect was found to be quite large at low Reynolds numbers, and weaker at higher Reynolds numbers, and a different effect was found at very high Reynolds numbers...|$|R

For visual observing, most notably on equatorial telescope <b>mounts,</b> <b>tube</b> orientation can put the eyepiece in a very poor viewing position, and larger telescopes require ladders or support structures to access it. Some designs provide mechanisms for rotating the eyepiece mount or the entire tube assembly to a better position. For research telescopes, counterbalancing very heavy instruments mounted at this focus has to be taken into consideration.|$|R

50|$|Star Series - These drums {{went into}} {{production}} briefly around 1987. They were solid shell drums (made from one solid piece of maple, stem bent into a circle). These had node mount retaining hoops (required for solid shell drums), node <b>mounted</b> <b>tube</b> lugs and diecast hoops. The most outwardly noticeable characteristic of these drums is their shallow depths, half {{the depth of}} most drums made in the 1980s, a necessity since they were bent in the same machine that produced their solid shell snare drums. Sizes were 6x10, 6x12, 6x13, 7x14, 8x16. Bass drums were normal depths since they were not made of solid shells, but were instead 6 ply maple.|$|R

In many works, each cone is located in a separate cell that can be isolated from the remaining cells if required for maintenance. Some works may have two cones to a cell and some large works may have 4 cones per cell.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} a {{two-dimensional}} fluid-solid vibration problem arising from nuclear engineering: the vibration of elastically <b>mounted</b> <b>tubes</b> immersed in a cavity filled with fluid. A convenient variational formulation of this problem, valid for compressible and incompressible fluids, is introduced. An hp finite element method is used for its discretization, {{which leads to a}} well posed matrix eigenvalue problem. Optimal order a priori error estimates are proved for eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Then, local a posteriori error indicators are defined and its efficiency and reliability are studied. An adaptive scheme driven by these indicators is proposed and numerically tested. Key words.

Images produced by the ray selectors are discussed in relation to the neural wiring of the apposition eyes in honeybees and, by applying image filtering to remove high spatial frequencies, a representation of how insects might view a vase of flowers as a coherent upright image is presented. This is the first photographic application of this biologically important optical principle.
