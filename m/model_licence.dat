5000|$|Although both {{coal and}} oil {{production}} were publicly owned in the past, coal, {{oil and gas}} extraction is performed today by private corporations under government licence. The largest entities include BP, Shell, but also now joined by entirely foreign firms such as Apache, Talisman, CNR, TAQA or Cuadrilla. This means that ordinary UK company law (or US corporate law) sets the governance rights {{of oil and gas}} corporations, with board of directors invariably removable only by shareholders (typically large asset managers). The Petroleum Act 1998 section 2, rights of land ownership do not equate to rights to oil and gas (or hydrocarbons) underneath. In Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd, the Supreme Court did hold that a landowner may sue a company for trespass if it drills under its land without permission, but a majority held that damages will be nominal. This meant that a landowner in Surrey was only able to recover £1000 when a licensed oil company drilled a diagonal well 800 to 2800 feet under its property, and not the £621,180 awarded by the High Court to reflect a share of the oil profits. Similarly, under the Continental Shelf Act 1964 section 1 rights [...] "outside territorial waters with respect to the sea bed and subsoil and their natural resources" [...] are [...] "vested in Her Majesty." [...] Since 1919, the Crown has prohibited searching and boring for oil and gas without a licence. Under the Energy Act 2016, licensing is managed by the Oil and Gas Authority. Under section 8, the OGA should hand out licences so as to minimise future public expense, secure the energy supply, ensure storage of carbon dioxide, fully collaborate with the UK government, innovation, and stable regulation to encourage investment. Overshadowing this is the duty in PA 1998 sections 9A-I on the Secretary of State for ‘maximising the economic recovery of UK petroleum’. The Secretary of State may give directions to the OGA in the interests of national security, or the public in exceptional circumstances, while the OGA is nominally capable of funding itself through fees on license applicants and holders. In the process of licensing, the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive Regulations 1995 require objective, transparent and competitive criteria to be applied by OGA. Under regulation 3, the OGA should consider an applicants technical and financial capability, price, previous conduct, and refuse all applications if none are satisfactory, while regulation 5 requires that all criteria to be applied are stated in the public notice for tenders. Under PA 1998 section 4, <b>model</b> <b>licence</b> clauses are prescribed by the Secretary of State, for instance in the Petroleum Licensing (Production) (Seaward Areas) Regulations 2008. Schedule 1's model clauses give the OGA discretion over the licence term, the licensee's obligation to submit its work programme, revocation on breach of a licence, arbitration for disputes, or health and environmental safety. For onshore oil and gas extraction, and particularly hydraulic fracturing (or [...] "fracking"), there are further requirements that must be fulfilled. For fracking, these include negotiating with landowners where a drill site is situated, getting the Mineral Planning Authority's approval for exploratory wells, consent from the council under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 section 57, getting permission for disposing of hazardous waste and inordinate water use, and finally consent from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In R (Frack Free Balcombe Residents Association) v West Sussex CC the resident group in Balcombe lost an action for judicial review of their Council's planning permission for Cuadrilla Balcombe Ltd to explore the potential to frack for shale gas. Large protests had opposed any steps toward fracking. However, Gilbart J held that the council had not been wrong in refusing to consider public opposition, and took the view would have acted unlawfully if it had considered the opposition.|$|E

40|$|The {{preservation}} of digital publications involves various technical, legal, economic and organization issues. Copyright law and licensing arrangements may prevent problems for libraries that wish to preserve digital {{resources in the}} long-term or even short term. Digital preservation strategies involve copying {{and it is not}} clear with copyright legislation in the UK and Europe will allow the sort of copying needed. The complex nature of digital publications and new publishing models present various problems including resource intensive rights clearance and reliance on publishers to continue to provide access and preserve digital publications. Extension of legal deposit laws may go some way to overcoming access versus ownership issues, but the issue of rights to copy deposited material remains. Other possible solutions include <b>model</b> <b>licence</b> agreements that that provide for preservation in some way. There is a need for research to clarify issues identified in the preservation and legal literature and to provide a clearer picture of the activities and perceptions of stakeholders in digital preservation, including authors, publishers and libraries...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} International Study on the Impact of Copyright Law on Digital Preservation was {{to review}} current {{copyright}} and related laws {{and their impact on}} digital preservation, as well as to make recommendations to help libraries, archives and other preservation institutions sustain digital works. Study partners are based in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The study found that, in many cases, digital works are not being preserved in a systematic way. This is partly because digital preservation entails more difficult copyright issues than preservation of non-digital material. All the surveyed countries have some form of exception for preservation activities. However, there is inconsistency in the details between the countries’ laws and uncertainty in how they apply in the digital environment. None of the countries surveyed have a uniform national system yet for collecting digital materials. Technological protection measures and licensing arrangements may, in some cases, present significant practical barriers to preservation. Current approaches to address these barriers are ad hoc and include requesting permissions from individual rights holders and some use of <b>model</b> <b>licence</b> terms that permit preservation. Moreover, as yet, there are no effective solutions to the general issue of orphan works. Recommendations of the study include suggestions for drafting national policies and adapting laws to allow digital preservation to be undertaken as necessary, in accordance with international best practice standards, and for promoting national systems for the collection of digital materials by relevant state and national collecting institutions...|$|E

40|$|The project {{aimed to}} map the JISC NESLi 2 Online Journals, Datasets, and Ebooks <b>model</b> <b>licences</b> into the ONIX for Publications Licenses (ONIX-PL) format, and to install the mapping into the ONIX-PL editing {{software}} that is being developed under a separate and parallel JISC-supported project. The first of the JISC <b>model</b> <b>licences</b> to be tackled was NESLi 2. A substantially complete first draft mapping was prepared manually and was sent to JISC Collections {{at the beginning of}} January 2007, accompanied by a list of queries that had arisen. At the same time, an examination of the Dataset and Ebooks sub-licences showed that there were unlikely to be further issues specific to those models, although there was some inconsistency between NESLi 2 and the others in the treatment of certain permitted usages. The whole of this work took place in parallel with, and has significantly influenced, the continuing development of the ONIX-PL format and the ONIX-PL Dictionary of terms used in licence expressions. It is noteworthy that the JISC licences include some quite specific permissions that were neither part of the existing ONIX-PL vocabulary, nor part of the DLF ERMI vocabulary on which some existing Electronic Resource Management (ERM) systems are based. The ONIX-PL vocabulary has been extended to include these permissions but it remains for future work to determine how such permissions can best be managed within a subscribing institution, whether through an ERM system or by other means...|$|R
