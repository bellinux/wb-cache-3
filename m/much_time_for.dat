5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with {{a penchant for}} humiliating and bullying others. She was touted as a new student for Hollyoaks High and was the first character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie never had <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers {{who had never been}} to Sydney {{would not be able to}} tell the difference.|$|E

The process occurs in several species of oviparous (egg-laying) killifishes which spawn in the normal way on the substrate, {{but in the process}} accidentally fertilize eggs which the female retains and does not spawn. These eggs are spawned later, usually without allowing <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> embryonic development.|$|E

The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the Boks {{left for}} Australia, where Bart {{took up the}} {{position}} of Director at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra. In their nine years in Australia, Bart established a graduate program at Stromlo, obtained funds from the Prime Minister of the time, Robert Menzies, for a new telescope at Stromlo, established a field observatory at Siding Spring, and laid the foundations {{for the creation of}} the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This did not leave <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> astronomy research; Priscilla spent many nights at the Stromlo telescopes observing and then analysing their data.

Diane and Jim are both given a totally new and fresh look and are reunited. Diane and Jim are also treated to some pampering from hair dresser, Richard Ward.|$|E

25|$|In 1884, London {{hosted the}} International Health Exhibition. This {{exhibition}} placed {{much emphasis on}} highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated {{that the purpose of}} this laboratory was to “show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.” The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order. First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured. One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets. The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} of Mysterion is never revealed in [...] "The Coon". After the episode aired, the question [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] became a frequently asked {{question at the}} FAQ for the official South Park website, South Park Studios. The answer posted at that site was that [...] "there is no answer", and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know. Parker said {{it was one of}} the most common questions he was asked about the show, along with the {{identity of}} Cartman's father, which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode [...] "201". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets. The superhero characters from [...] "The Coon" [...] returned in the fourteenth season episodes [...] "", [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] and [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Mysterion is revealed.|$|E
