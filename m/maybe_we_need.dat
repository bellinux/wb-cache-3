Moreover, in the context of the recent financial crisis, together with the post-M context of an ideological crisis in the MCP, there is certainly a contextual factor favouring the elective affinity between interculturalism and mainstreaming (Zapata-Barrero, 2017 c), to the point that we can say today that mainstreaming is a distinctive feature of the intercultural policy philosophy. I would even say that this interface provides interculturalism with a powerful policy tool, solving most of policymakers’ concerns regarding the MCP. As a result, this mainstreaming ICP designates a public-policy philosophy that emphasizes both the significance of promoting contact (the core concept of interculturalism) in all spheres of public life and basic structures of society and the importance of all the components of the diversity dynamics, including nationals and citizens (the core concept of mainstreaming).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{friction}} between fiction and technology, specifically the accelerationist energies of eighties cyberpunk as an instance of fiction as ‘low theory’ (Wark), theory which plays in the margins, untimely and speculative. Cyberpunk brushed the emergent technocapitalist control society against the grain, serving the fabulatory function of a visionary falsification of Californian ideology. It explored {{the condition of the}} technological nonconscious, the invasiveness of the ubiquitous bodily implant. In this, it elaborated the lessons of luminaries, Ballard and Burroughs. Ballard’s ‘novel’, The Atrocity Exhibition, imagined the erotic, visceral and inner devoured by a voracious mediasphere, rendering humans as affectless drifting mannequins. His protagonist(s) took flight to schizophrenia, extracting himself from media fictions of all kinds through the manipulation of events as hallucinations of another reality. Burroughs, for his part, described a frictionless pharmacological mode of control jacked directly into the nervous system, an addictive fabulatory power maintained through a general dependency on reality-producing patterns. In the wake of these nightmare fictions, the cyberpunk of Gibson and others gave us the hacker, a probe-head for non-capitalist, non-human futures. Today, however, it seems all too evident that technocapitalism has pre-empted such strategies with probe-heads of its own. Some commentators call for the persistence of the negative against a compromised accelerationism. But <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> don’t <b>need</b> to jettison cyberpunk and the hacker. Instead, ‘after the future’, cyberpunk might be employed in media-archaeological fashion to excavate the historical lines between hacking and hacktivism, generating perceptual fissures in the continuity of the present. It is through the vigilance of such friction-fiction that we might reverse-engineer the pre-emptive fabulations of capital; not now through processes of acceleration but {{on the basis of a}} collective circuit breaker, an ethical practice that remains non-moral but rejects the line of death.

Charles does a terrific job of correcting this libel. The Populists were the farthest thing from “backward-looking. ” By almost any contemporary measure, they were forward-looking. They favored market rationalization, labor organization, welfare, education, and even the emancipation of women. They also hated the Gold Standard, which is progressive in my book. There were some warts–the Populists generally favored racial segregation, which they viewed as progressive (so did a lot of other folks at the time).

The material for my work is articles found on the Internet in daily newspapers websites. From the analysis it has been revealed that there are certain stereotypes and preconceptions of female offenders. It shows that there are descriptions about the behavior and appearance which is considered remarkable in these women. The theory that I relate to my work are Yvonne Hirdman's thoughts on gender. She talks about that in the society it is the man that is the norm and woman stands as the opposite. Together with the concept of gender Hirdman talks about gender contract.

Eric Feigelson of Penn State University {{stumbled}} onto a connection one day while his thoughts were far from the solar system, turned toward the vibrant neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and caliginous dust of the Orion Nebula. This nebula, 1500 light-years away, is {{visible to the naked}} eye in the constellation Orion, a gem to behold with a good pair of binoculars or a telescope under dark skies. In Orion, Feigelson inadvertently found a possible solution to a long-standing mystery about our own solar system: the presence of exotic isotopes locked away in meteoroids. Scientists have assumed that these short-lived isotopes - special forms of atomic nuclei, such as aluminum- 26 and calcium- 41 - were transported here by a nearby supernova. Only tenuous evidence for such an explosion exists, but what else could have made the isotopes? The isotopes are about as old as the solar system, and the Sun couldn t possibly have been powerful enough to create them. Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to give the Sun a little more credit.

The rise in studentscollege attendance has brought about new challenges in the area of academic motivation depriving them from educational pursuit despite proper qualifications. This comparative-descriptive study has been designed in order to compare between military and non-military students in terms of educational adjustment and motivation power and their related subscales. Subjects were selected from four colleges in Tehran. 100 students from each college were selected through random sampling, subsequently the total sample were 400 college students. Half of whom were military college students and the other half was non-military college students. In order to collect data the Bells adjustment questionnaire and the questionnaire of educational motivation were used. Comparison between military and non-military students in terms of various aspects of adjustment showed that there is a meaningful difference between military and non-military students in terms of familial adjustment, hygienic adjustment and total adjustment (p&# 8804; 0. 01). Comparison between military and non-military students in terms of educational motivation power showed that there is meaningful difference in the level of p&# 8804; 0. 01 and was higher in military college students.

In order to prevent the upcoming problems in this issue we need a thorough studies in this field...|$|E
50|$|I {{honestly}} {{think we}} made some great records, and <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> will do again some day, but without the rose tinted glasses I probably had fixed to my face at the time, I realise there were definitely opportunities squandered. Too late in the bands life came the notion that throwing yourself around the stage and making a racket was great in a club but maybe didn't translate to an arena or stadium crowd. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> to be more ambitious with our shows. It wasn't just about having a laugh. Being a stadium band was an artform. One all too foreign to us.|$|R
40|$|Attack trees {{provide a}} formal, methodical way of {{describing}} {{the security of}} systems, based on varying attacks. Basically, you represent attacks against a system in a tree structure, with the goal as the root node [1]. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> a model of threats against computer systems. If we can understand all the {{different ways in which}} a system can be attacked, we can likely design countermeasures to thwart those attacks. And if we can understand who the attackers are - not to mention their abilities, motivations, and goals - <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can install the proper countermeasures to deal with the real threats [1]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fine! <b>We</b> <b>need</b> a hostess for {{the seventeenth}} of March. Wouldn't it be awfully {{original}} {{if you made}} it a St. Patrick's Day bridge! I'll be tickled to death {{to help you with}} it. I'm glad you've learned to play bridge. At first I didn't hardly know {{if you were going to}} like Gopher Prairie. Isn't it dandy that you've settled down to being homey with us! <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> aren't as highbrow as the Cities, but we do have the daisiest times and--oh, we go swimming in summer, and dances and--oh, lots of good times. If folks will just take us as we are, I think we're a pretty good bunch!" ...|$|R
