The completely randomized design {{was used to compare}} feed intake and nutrient digestibility of 24 male lambs aged seven months among four dietary treatments (crude brown propolis, propolis ethanol extract, <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium,</b> and control). Methods of feces collection were compared using a completely randomized split-plot design, with experimental diets corresponding to the main factor and the methods to estimate fecal production as the sub-factor. The diets had a roughage:concentrate ratio of 50 : 50, with Tifton- 85 bermudagrass hay (Cynodon spp.) as roughage, and ground corn, soybean meal and minerals as concentrate. The lambs fed diets with crude propolis had higher feed intake than those fed diets containing <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium.</b> The different diets did not affect dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, or acid detergent fiber digestibility, but crude propolis supplementation provided higher ether extract digestibility than <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium.</b> Nutrient digestibility, as indicated by indigestible neutral detergent fiber, indigestible acid detergent fiber and sequentially-determined indigestible acid detergent fiber, was lower than that found with the fecal collection method.

In this work, we demonstrate for monensin biosynthesis that, as well as ether formation, a late-stage hydroxylation step is crucial for the correct formation of the <b>sodium</b> <b>monensin</b> complex. We have investigated the last two steps in monensin biosynthesis, namely hydroxylation catalysed by the P 450 monooxygenase MonD and O -methylation catalysed by the methyl-transferase MonE.

40|$|Summary- <b>Monensin</b> <b>sodium,</b> an {{ionophore}} polyether antibiotic, {{has shown}} efficacy in controlling certain viral infections. We investigated the effea of <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium</b> in moderating the losses of an ePidemic outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritisvirus (TGEV) in an immunologicallynaive swine herd. An ePidemicofTGEV occurred on a continuous-farrowing, large industrial pig farm {{that had no}} previous exposure to TGEv. Monensin at the dosage of 100 ppm was used in creep feed and weanling pig diets until 2 months of age and in the gestation and lactation diets. Preweaning mortality in pigs < I week of age was reduced for litters of the sows that received monensin (20. 0 %) compared to the control group (57. 2 %), and total piglet mortality up {{to the age of}} 60 days was lower for the monensin group (24. 8 %) compared to the control group (73. 9 %). We conclude that monensin was very effective in reducing preweaning mortality during this TGE epidemic. Transmissiblegastroenteritis (TGE) is a contagious enteric diseasethat usually results in severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high neonatal mortality. Although pigs of all ages are susceptible to this viral infection, mortality is generally much lower in postweaning pigs. EpidemicTGEin non-immune herds can result in serious economi...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Since the {{legislation}} of European Union has prohibited {{the use of}} growth-promoting antibiotics such as: monensin, there is an interest in alternatives to manipulate the rumen fermentation. The use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal feeds is banned in Europe due to having potential risks such as the spread of antibiotic resistance genes or the contamination of milk or meat with antibiotic residues. Recently, probiotics have been increasingly evaluated to replace or facilitate reductions {{in the use of}} antibiotics. Thus, the aim of this study was investigating the comparison of antibiotic (<b>sodium</b> <b>monensin)</b> and probiotic (protexin) on the gas production parameters and organic matter digestibility of feedstuffs (alfalfa hay, barley grain, and alfalfa+ barley mixture) Materials and Methods Experimental treatments were included control (basal feeds without additive), basal feeds supplemented with <b>sodium</b> <b>monensin</b> or protexin probiotic at levels of 500 or 1000 mg per kg of DM in a rumen fungi culture. Ruminal fluid was collected from two fistulated sheep (49. 5 ± 2. 5 kg) and all samples were withdrawn 2 h after the morning ration had been consumed. Collected ruminal contents were strained through four layers of cheesecloth and brought immediately to the laboratory. To have a pure ruminal fungi culture, whole ruminal fluid was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min and added 0. 100 mg/ml antibacterial agent (streptomycin sulfate, penicillin G, and chloramphenicol (14, 35). Gas production technique was used to detect the fermentation parameters of the treatments (16). Three parallel syringes of each treatment were prepared in this experiment. To measure the total gas production (A) and the rate of gas production (c), cumulative gas production, organic digestibility and metabolizable energy of treatments until 120 h. Gas production was measured directly from the volume of the syringes at 0, 3, 6, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. Statistical analysis of data were statistically analyzed in a completely randomized design was performed by SAS (9. 1 version) and the least square of means. Results and Discussion Results showed the higher level of <b>sodium</b> <b>monensin</b> (1000 mg/kg) decreased fermentable fraction (b), organic digestibility and metabolizable energy of both alfalfa hay and barley grain compared with other treatments significantly.

A secondary objective was to explore potential sources of heterogeneity among the comparative effectiveness studies. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and industry reports was used to identify studies that included direct comparisons of these treatments in finishing steers in North America. Random-effects meta-analysis models of performance, carcass, and health-related outcomes were fitted with extracted data, consisting of a total of 17 data sets comprising a total of 135 pens and 13, 603 steers. Results showed that pens of steers fed LP had increased ADG (live and carcass adjusted), DMI, and HCW compared with those fed monensin (P 0. 05) were identified for FE or for health-related outcomes (overall and cause-specific mortality). There was a substantial amount of heterogeneity in outcomes among studies, and when pen size and type of production setting were included in mixed-effects metaregression models, they accounted for only a small proportion of the between-study heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis models. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting summary estimates in the presence of substantial heterogeneity. However, these results provide comprehensive information on the comparative effects of different ionophores across multiple studies and multiple years, states, and production settings. These unique results can enable quantitative and informed decisions by potential end users of these feed additives that are widely used in the U.

40|$|Plants have {{to survive}} in an {{environment}} where they are constantly under attack {{from a wide range of}} pathogens, and they utilise sophisticated, multi-layered defence mechanisms to resist infection. The Arabidopsis thaliana protein Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS 1), together with its signalling partners, Phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD 4) and Senescence associated gene 101 (SAG 101), constitutes a central regulatory hub in plant immunity. EDS 1 is essential for basal defence and for effector-triggered immune responses mediated via TIR-NB-LRR (Toll-Interleukin 1 receptor-Nucleotide Binding site-Leucine Rich Repeat) receptors. EDS 1 -dependent signalling can be divided into two branches: a salicylic acid (SA) -dependent branch and a SA-independent branch. Flavin-dependent mono-oxygenase 1 (FMO 1) is a marker gene for the EDS 1 -dependent, SA-independent signalling pathway. FMO 1 is dependent on EDS 1 and PAD 4, and plays a crucial role in basal defence and TIR-NB-LRR-mediated immune responses. However, the mechanistic details of FMO 1 signalling and other components involved modulation of EDS 1 -dependent, SA-independent defence signalling are unknown. I aimed at identifying some of these unknown components, using a chemical biology approach and screening for selective compounds that can be used as tools in applications complementing genetic approaches. The advantage of this method lies in its potential to circumvent problems generally encountered in genetic approaches, such as redundancy of gene function, lethality of mutants and pleiotropic effects. I developed a bi-directional screening procedure for chemicals activating or inhibiting FMO 1 accumulation, using a transgenic A. thaliana line expressing a YFP-tagged FMO 1 protein under control of the native FMO 1 promoter in a fmo 1 - 1 mutant background. Three compounds selectively activating FMO 1 expression were identified after screening and verification, from amongst a library of 1488 compounds. The selected chemicals; merbromin, <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt, and thaxtomin A, could induce expression of FMO 1, independent of SA accumulation, thus confirming the SA-independent nature of FMO 1 defence regulation. All three chemicals were extensively tested for their role in modulation of plant immune responses. Merbromin leads to the upregulation of several defence genes known to be linked to FMO 1, such as EDS 1, PAD 4 and Isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS 1). However, it does not induce accumulation of SA and expression of Pathogenesis related 1 (PR 1), suggesting that it causes perturbations at several points in the FMO 1 -related signalling pathway. <b>Monensin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt also leads to an increase in expression of EDS 1, PAD 4, ICS 1 and PR 1, along with SA accumulation. <b>Monensin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which could play a role in induction of FMO 1 expression. Thaxtomin A was the most specific modulator of FMO 1 signalling, and does not affect early defence responses such as MAPK activation and production of reactive oxygen species. It causes SA accumulation and enhances expression of EDS 1, PAD 4, ICS 1, and PR 1. Thaxtomin A-induced FMO 1 expression is dependent on EDS 1 and PAD 4. I found thaxtomin A to be a specific activator of PAD 4 expression, with enhanced PAD 4 mRNA accumulation, independent of EDS 1. There are also indications that PAD 4 may have an EDS 1 -independent role in thaxtomin A-induced FMO 1 upregulation. However, the presence of both, EDS 1 and PAD 4, is essential for maximum upregulation of FMO 1 by thaxtomin A. Identification of the molecular target of thaxtomin A may lead to unknown components involved in EDS 1 -dependent, SA-independent signalling and greater mechanistic knowledge of the signalling pathway. ...|$|E

In addition to such agonist, {{a variety of}} natural products that affect voltage-dependent sodium channels can markedly stimulate {{accumulation of}} [3 H]inositol phosphates. These include alkaloids that activate sodium channels, such as batrachotoxin, veratridine, and aconitine; peptide toxins that alter activation or slow inactivation of sodium channels, such as various scorpion toxins from Leiurus, Centruroides, and Tityus species; and agents that cause repetitive firing of sodium channel-dependent action potentials, such as pyrethroids and pumiliotoxin B. Ouabain, and agent that will increase accumulation of internal sodium by inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase, also stimulates formation of [3 H]inositol phosphates, as does <b>monensin,</b> a <b>sodium</b> ionophore. Tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin, specific blockers of voltage-dependent sodium channels, prevent or reduce the stimulatory effects of sodium channel agents and ouabain on phosphatidylinositol turnover, while having lesser or no effect, respectively, on receptor-mediated or monensin-mediated stimulation. Removal of extracellular sodium ions markedly reduces stimulatory effects of sodium channel agents, while removal of extracellular calcium ions with EGTA blocks both receptor-mediated and sodium channel agent-mediated phosphatidylinositol turnover. The results provide evidence for a hitherto unsuspected messenger role for sodium ions in excitable tissue, whereby neuronal activity and the resultant influx of sodium will cause activation of phospholipase systems involved in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositols, thereby generating two second messengers, the inositol phosphates, which mobilize calcium from internal stores, and the diacylglycerols, which activate protein kinase C...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de dietas suplementadas com monensina ou produtos à base de própolis, nas populações de protozoários ciliados no rúmen de bovinos (Bos taurus) e bubalinos (Bubalus bubalis). Quatro bovinos da raça Holandesa e quatro búfalos da raça Murrah adultos, fistulados no rúmen, foram distribuídos em delineamento quadrado latino (4 x 4). A dieta constituiu-se de 50 % de silagem de milho e 50 % de concentrado à base de milho em grãos e farelo de soja, com adição de monensina sódica ou aditivo à base de própolis LLOSA 2 ou LLOSC 1. As amostras do conteúdo ruminal foram coletadas duas horas após a alimentação. O gênero Entodinium foi o mais representativo em todos os tratamentos, para ambas as raças de ruminantes. Em búfalos, foi observado o efeito redutor do tratamento LLOSC 1 nas populações do gênero Entodinium, além do efeito redutor dos tratamentos monensina e LLOSA 2 sobre os gêneros da subfamília Diplodiniinae. A média de ciliados foi maior em bubalinos (56 x 10 (4) mL- 1) do que em bovinos (26 x 10 (4) mL- 1). Houve aumento do pH ruminal dos bovinos no tratamento com monensina. O extrato de própolis LLOSC 1 reduziu os ciliados do rúmen em bubalinos. The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of diets supplemented with monensin or with extracts of propolis, on the population of ciliate protozoa in the rumen of cattle (Bos taurus) and water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Four Holstein cattle and four Murrah buffalo, fistulated in the rumen, were distributed in 4 x 4 Latin square design. The diet was constituted by 50 % corn silage and 50 % concentrate based on corn grain and soybean meal, and the supplementation of <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium</b> or propolis extracts LLOSA 2 or LLOSC 1. Samples of ruminal contents were collected two hours after feeding. The genus Entodinium {{was the most common}} in all treatments for both cattle and buffalo. The LLOSC 1 treatment reduced the populations of the genus Entodinium in buffalo. <b>Monensin</b> <b>sodium</b> and LLOSA 2 reduced protozoa of the genera of the Diplodiniinae subfamily in buffalo. The average concentration of ciliates was higher in buffalo (56 x 10 (4) mL- 1) than in cattle (26 x 10 (4) mL- 1). There was ruminal pH increase in cattle treated with monensin.

The sensitivity of the method allows quantification and confirmation for all coccidiostats below target concentration. The method was in-house validated and meets all criteria of European legislation (2002 / 657 /EC). The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set. Finally, the expanded uncertainty U was calculated with data obtained within the laboratory while applying the method during validation and in routine tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of rumen fermentation was studied in lambs and wethers using 14 experimental rations {{with and without}} <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium.</b> The 7 pairs of rations (the first a control diet, the second a monensin treated one) consisted of hay and concentrate at ratios of 60 : 40, 40 : 60, 100 : 0, 50 : 50 (lambs), 100 : 0, 75 : 25 and 50 : 50 (wethers), respectively. The molar % of acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids were taken into stoichiometric calculations of rumen fermentation. In most of the rations monensin increased rumen fermentation efficiency. Of all lamb and wether rations the highest efficiency was recorded in the monensin treated ones consisting of 40 % hay and 60 % concentrates and 50 % hay and 50 % concentrates, respectively. The high fermentation efficiency was {{probably due to the}} lowest methane production observed with these rations. This means that monensin increased the amount of metabolizable energy by decreasing methane energy losses. The increase in fermentation efficiency is associated with a high production of propionic acid and in wethers also with an increase in the gross {{efficiency of}} feed conversion...|$|E
40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (<b>monensin,</b> lasalocid <b>sodium,</b> salinomycin, narasin, maduramicin and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (robenidine, decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|R
40|$|Rhythmically active, {{locomotor}} {{networks of}} {{the spinal cord}} are subject to both neuromodulation and activity-dependent homeostatic regulation. I first show that the neuromodulator dopamine exerts potent inhibitory effects on the central pattern generator (CPG) circuit controlling locomotory swimming in post-embryonic Xenopus tadpoles. Dopamine, acting endogenously on spinal D 2 -like receptors, reduces spontaneous fictive swimming occurrence and shortens, slows and weakens swimming. The mechanism involves a TTX-resistant hyperpolarisation of rhythmically active CPG neurons, mediated by the direct opening of a K+ channel with GIRK-like pharmacology. This increases rheobase and reduces spike probability. I next explore how sodium pumps contribute to the activity-dependent regulation of the Xenopus swim circuit, and possible interactions of the pumps with modulators, temperature and ionic conductances. I characterise the pump-mediated ultra-slow afterhyperpolarisation (usAHP), and show that <b>monensin,</b> a <b>sodium</b> ionophore, enhances pump activity, converting the usAHP into a tonic hyperpolarisation; this decreases swim episode duration and cycle frequency. I also characterise a ZD 7288 -sensitive Ih current, which is active in excitatory dIN interneurons and contributes to spiking. Blocking Ih with ZD 7288 decreases swim episode duration and destabilises swim bursts. Both Ih and the usAHP increase with temperature, which depolarises CPG neurons, decreases input resistance, and increases spike probability; this increases cycle frequency, but the enhanced usAHP shortens swimming. I also show that the usAHP is diminished by nitric oxide, but enhanced by dopaminergic signalling. Finally, I explore sodium pumps in the neonatal mouse. The sodium pump blocker ouabain increases the duration and frequency of drug- and sensory-induced locomotion, whilst monensin has opposite effects. Decreasing inter-episode interval also shortens and slows activity, a relationship abolished by ouabain, implicating sodium pumps in a feedforward motor memory mechanism. Finally, I show {{that the effects of}} ouabain on locomotion are dependent on dopamine, which enhances a TTX- and ouabain-sensitive usAHP in spinal neurons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMonensin is {{a carrier}} of cations through lipid {{membranes}} capable of exchanging sodium (potassium) cations for protons by an electroneutral mechanism, whereas its ethyl ester derivative ethyl-monensin {{is supposed to}} transport sodium (potassium) cations in an electrogenic manner. To elucidate mechanistic details of the ionophoric activity, ion fluxes mediated by monensin and ethyl-monensin were measured on planar bilayer lipid membranes, liposomes, and mitochondria. In particular, generation of membrane potential on liposomes was studied via the measurements of rhodamine 6 G uptake by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. In mitochondria, swelling experiments were expounded by the additional measurements of respiration, membrane potential, and matrix pH. It can be concluded that both monensin and ethyl-monensin can perform nonelectrogenic exchange of potassium (sodium) ions for protons and serve as electrogenic potassium ion carriers similar to valinomycin. The results obtained {{are in line with}} the predictions based on the crystal structures of the <b>monensin</b> complexes with <b>sodium</b> ions and protons (Huczyński et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1818 (2012) pp. 2108 – 2119). The functional activity observed for artificial membranes and mitochondria can be applied to explain the activity of ionophores in living systems. It can also be important for studying the antitumor activity of monensin...|$|R

Chicks were fed a corn-soy or a corn-soy-pea basal diet containing 0. 73 % and 0. 62 % total sulfur amino acids (TSAA), respectively. Levels of 0 to 0. 45 % DL-methionine were added, with and without 0. 01 % <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium.</b> In two experiments, the chicks were inoculated at two weeks of age {{with a mixture of}} oocysts of E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. tenella, E. necatrix and E. brunetti. Lesion scores on the intestines and ceca, and blood carotenoid levels were determined at three weeks. The experiments were terminated at four weeks. A level of methionine greater than 0. 47 % and of TSAA greater than 0. 83 % was necessary to obtain maximum growth rate in uninoculated chicks. No evidence of dermatitis was observed. Growth rate and feed efficiency of chicks infected with coccidiosis were more severely depressed when the diet was not supplemented with methionine. Infections of coccidia and low levels of methionine, which in themselves did not produce any significant change in weight gain, did give a significant weight depression in combination.

40|$|A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated to determine six polyether ionophores (lasalocid sodium, <b>monensin</b> <b>sodium,</b> salinomycin sodium, narasin, maduramicin ammonium alpha, and semduramicin sodium) in feed samples. The method developed was very straightforward, involving extraction with 84 % acetonitrile of the coccidiostats from the feed samples and filtration of the raw extract prior to chromatographic analysis. Method validation included the determination of selectivity, linearity, specificity, repeatability, the limit of detection, limit of quantification, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), and recovery. Feed samples from the Finnish national feed control programme and suspected carry-over samples from a feed manufacturer were analysed in parallel with an existing liquid chromatography method coupled with ultraviolet detection. All feed control samples were negative in LC-UV, but with the developed MS method, monensin, salinomycin, and narasin were detected at concentrations of < 0. 025 – 0. 73 [*]mg/kg, < 0. 025 – 0. 027 [*]mg/kg, and < 0. 025 – 1. 6 [*]mg/kg, respectively.

Five floor pen studies on turkeys for fattening were provided by the applicant. In four studies, growth and feed to gain ratio was improved, after four weeks, by 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin® kg- 1 complete feedingstuff. In the following four-week period, comparable effects could be observed for growth rate, but not for feed to gain ratio. Clinical endpoints, indicative for coccidiosis control, were with one exception (intestinal lesion score seven days after inoculation in two studies) not influenced. Coccidiosis in turkey is commonly milder than in chicken, this may contribute to explaining the lack of conclusive clinical data in these studies. Cumulative data (after 84 days for female and 112 days for male turkeys) showed positive effects for 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin ® kg- 1 complete feedingstuff for growth and feed to gain ratio in one study, for feed to gain ratio and reduced mortality in another study, and reduced mortality alone in a third study.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the levels of <b>sodium</b> <b>monensin</b> on lactating cows and their effects on productive performance and milk protein fraction composition. It was used 12 Holstein cows, distributed in four balanced 3 &# 215; 3 Latin squares, and fed three diets: one control without monensin, and two diets with monensin at the levels of 24 or 48 mg/kg DM added to the concentrate. Milk production was daily measured throughout the entire experimental period. The samples used for analysis of milk composition were collected on two alternated days from the two daily milking. Non-protein nitrogen, total nitrogen and non-casein nitrogen contents were directly evaluated in the milk, and casein, whey protein and true protein contents were indirectly determined. The use of monensin in the rations reduced dry matter and nutrient intake, especially when diet with 48 mg/kg of dry matter was given. The ration with 24 mg/kg of DM increased milk production, with or without correction, and also fat and lactose yield, and it improved productive efficiency. The levels of monensin in the ratios did not influence contents of milk crude protein, non-protein nitrogen, non-casein nitrogen, true protein, casein, casein/true protein ratio, whey protein, and of all those fractions expressed as percentage of crude protein. The utilization of monensin in the ratio at the dose of 24 mg/kg of DM influences positively the productive performance of lactating cows, {{and it does not}} influence the composition of milk protein fractions...|$|R

The dosed heifers were each given controlled release capsules, designed to deliver 200 to 250 mg/day of Rumensin over 150 days or 300 mg/day over 100 days. The heifers were managed to grow at about 0. 6 to 0. 7 kg/day until first calving. They were weighed every two months while body condition scores and wither heights were recorded at the time of dosing. Following calving, about half of each treatment group were dosed with a further Rumensin capsule, with the remainder undosed. Milk yields and milk composition were monitored throughout the first lactation. Rumensin treatment had few significant effects on the performance of growing heifers. In two studies, Rumensin increased liveweight gain and body condition for parts of the growth phase.

The cows were assigned to a 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments: i) ground maize, soybean meal, mineral and vitamin supplements, and ground canola seeds (CG); ii) CG concentrate with 31. 5 mg of monensin added per kg of dry matter (DM); iii) CG pelleted concentrate; iv) CG concentrate with monensin addition pelleted. There was no difference in milk production and composition. The addition of monensin increased milk concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), the PUFA/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio, and omega 6. The pelleting increased the concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids, the PUFA/SFA ratio, and the omega 6 /omega 3 ratio, but decreased the concentration of SFA. The association between pelleting and the addition of monensin increased the concentration of conjugated linoleic acids by 46. 9 %. The physical characteristics of butter were not affected by the evaluated diets.
