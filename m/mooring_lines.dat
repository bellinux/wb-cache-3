5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose <b>mooring</b> <b>lines.</b> When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, 1928 William S. Grattan {{responded to}} the oil barge James F. Cahill, loaded with 5,000 barrels of crude oil, that was aflame. After burning 17 hours, the barge's <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> gave way and the barge began to drift. William S. Grattans crew {{attempted}} to attach tow lines to the drifting barge but it struck a dock at an oil company where the empty oil tanker B.B. McColl was moored. The fumes on the B.B. McColl ignited causing an explosion and fire that engulfed William S. Grattan. Captain Thomas Hylant along with his crew abandoned ship and swam through the flames to shore. Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The unattended boilers on William S. Grattan soon ran dry and exploded, leaving the ship burned out and heavily damaged.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used <b>mooring</b> <b>lines</b> to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of safety against free drift (loss of position) of semi-submersibles, the mooring system of a semi-submersible is introduced, and the <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tension is looked into based on the laboratory model test and the numerical simulations of Veslefrikk B platform. The work is mostly about the prediction of the <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions. Based on the model tests data, the characteristic <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tension is obtained, the breaking strength is the characteristic <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tension multiplied by safety factor. Then both 10 - 2  and 10 - 4 annual extreme <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions are estimated. By fitting the maximum 10 - 2  and 10 - 4  annual extreme <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions to a Gumbel distribution, the probability of any extreme <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tension can be obtained according to the Gumbel distribution. Thus the single <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure probabilities for different given safety factors can be determined. In the time domain simulation program SIMO (MARINTEK), the <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions are simulated under the same environmental conditions as the model tests, and the same analysis procedure is carried out to the numerical simulations. At last, the full long term analysis is {{carried out by the}} numerical simulations. Large numbers of sea states are simulated. For every sea state, there are 10 seeding tests, and the 3 -hour extreme <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions are fitted to Gumbel. Then the response surfaces of Gumbel parameters are defined by the MATLAB 4 gird data method. The long term wave statics of the Veslefrikk field are given in the Veslefrikk Metocean Desgin Basis report [10]. After that, the long term probability for certain <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions can be calculated by integrating the conditional distribution of the 3 -hour maximum <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions for the given wave characteristics times the joint distribution function of the significant wave characteristics in the critical area of Hs and Tp. The long term distribution of the extreme <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tensions is finally determined. And the 100 -year and 10000 -year extreme values are estimated. </p...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{responses}} of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> serve important {{functions in the}} station keeping of a floating wind turbine (FWT). <b>Mooring</b> <b>line</b> damping significantly influences the global motions of a FWT. This study investigates the estimation of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> damping {{on the basis of}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 [*]MW offshore wind turbine model that is mounted on the ITI Energy barge. A numerical estimation method is derived from the energy absorption of a <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> resulting from FWT motion. The method is validated by performing a 1 / 80 scale model test.

40|$|Floating {{offshore}} wind turbines {{have the potential}} to become a significant source of affordable renewable energy. However, their strong interactions with both wind-and wave-induced forces raise a number of technical challenges in both modelling and design. This thesis takes aim at some of those challenges. One of the most uncertain modelling areas is the <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> dynamics, for which quasi-static models that neglect hydrodynamic forces and <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> iner-tia are commonly used. The consequences of using these quasi-static <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> models as opposed to physically-realistic dynamic <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> models was studied through a suite of comparison tests performed on three floating turbine designs using test cases incorporating both steady and stochastic wind and wave conditions. To perform this comparison, a dynamic finite-element <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> model was coupled to the floating wind turbine simulator FAST. The results of the comparison study indicate the need for higher-fidelity dynamic mooring models for all but the most stable support structure configurations...|$|R

The model {{is based on}} time domain mooring analysis techniques which permit simulation of: (1) nonlinear <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> load characteristics and (2) <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> loads associated with second order wave drift forces. Numerical model results are compared to physical model tests (Torum, 1989) and prototype measurements (Nelson and Broderick, 1986). These comparisons demonstrate that the numerical model provides good estimates of floating breakwater <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> forces. Accordingly, it is concluded that the numerical model serves as a useful engineering tool for analysis and design of floating breakwater mooring systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} the {{construction}} of a mathematical model of the multi-segment <b>mooring</b> <b>line,</b> based on the work-energy variational method. The equations of motion in both Cartesian and Lagrange local coordinate systems are derived. Meanwhile, with the catenary theory applied, the static equilibrium configuration of the multi-segment <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> is determined. Furthermore, Galerkin?s finite element method is used to generate mass, stiffness and damping coefficient matrices of a single <b>mooring</b> <b>line.</b> The coefficient matrices in the Lagrange local coordinate system are shown to be diagonal, which means the motions in the three directions of this coordinate system are uncoupled. With this information, the eigenvalue problem is solved to obtain the natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of a <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> in both coordinate systems. By approximating the <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> as a linear system, the modal superposition approach allows computationally efficient modeling of dynamics in the frequency domain, including estimation of extreme value statistics using Rice?s theory for Gaussian processes. The accuracy of the modal superposition approach is demonstrated through comparison with results from nonlinear time domain simulations using OrcaFlex. This approximate modeling approach is useful for optimizing the design of a mooring system in the preliminary phases of design...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a polyester <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> is non-linear and its elongation {{plays a significant role}} in the dynamic response of an offshore moored structure. However, unlike chain, the tension-elongation relationship and the overall behavior of elastic polyester ropes are complex. In this paper, by applying an enhanced stiffness model of the <b>mooring</b> <b>line,</b> the traditional elastic rod theory has been extended to allow for large elongations. One beneficial feature of the present method is that the tangent stiffness matrix is symmetric; in non-linear formulations the tangent stiffness matrix is often non-symmetric. The static problem was solved by Newton-Raphson iteration, whereas a direct integration method was used for the dynamic problem. The computed <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> tension was validated against the proprietary OrcaFlex software. Results of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> top tension predicated by different elongations are compared and discussed. The present method was then used for a simulation of an offshore floating wind turbine <b>moored</b> with taut <b>lines.</b> From a comparison between linear and non-linear formulations, it is seen that a linear spring model under-estimates the mean position when the turbine is operating, but over-estimates the amplitude of the platform response at low frequencies when the turbine has shut down...|$|R

The difference in the required safety factors and the environment return period between ISO 19901 - 7 (2005) Annex B and the ANCHORING REGULATION 09   has been evaluated. The effect of this difference on the annual probability of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure is investigated Chapter 4. In Chapter 3, two ways of estimating the annual probability of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure is discussed. One {{of them is the}} environmental line contour method. The method is used for the probability estimates performed in the following chapters of the report. In Chapter 4, the annual probability of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure is estimated based on model test results for the Midgard platform model. In Chapter 5, SIMO is used to analyze the line tensions of the Midgard platform. From the line tensions found by SIMO, the annual probability of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure is estimated for various safety factors. The results are compared with the results found in Chapter 4. The chapter also discusses the joint occurrence of environmental storm values. In Chapter 6, the effect of water depth on the annual probability of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure is discussed by using SIMO. Chapter 7 addresses problems raised while working on the previous chapters; The determination of the sea state which produces the largest line tensions is further discussed after first raising the topic in Chapter 2. The effect of changing the 90 % fractiles used in the environmental contour line method for deciding the annual probability of <b>mooring</b> <b>line</b> failure is investigated by using the model test results. The effect of changing the wave heading on the annual probability estimates is investigated by using SIMO after not having enough model test results of the worst sea sate in Chapter 4. The SIMO results found in Chapter 5 for 100 year environment are not a match to the results found in Chapter 4. The increase in values found by increasing the return period to 10 000 years is also not a match. The last discussion of chapter 7 is therefore the effect of the lack of matching increase. </p...|$|R
