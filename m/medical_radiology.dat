30|$|The <b>medical</b> {{physicist}} in <b>radiology</b> {{is essential}} for enabling the practice of safe, state-of-the-art medical imaging. <b>Medical</b> physicists in <b>radiology</b> {{are members of the}} multi-disciplinary clinical teams that are responsible for radiology services to patients. Their role is to provide critical scientific input on the physical processes and technology that underpin the whole radiology service. Generally, the <b>medical</b> physicists in <b>radiology</b> design and develop the framework of medical imaging, image processing, image distribution, image storage, radiation dosimetry, quality assurance of the imaging equipment, information and communication technology (ICT) aspects of the imaging process, and radiation protection of the patient and operator. Specifically, the <b>medical</b> physicists in <b>radiology</b> provide expert advice on the development, implementation, and improvement of imaging techniques and processes. They also provide expert input for applications of medical imaging outside the <b>radiology</b> department. <b>Medical</b> physicists in <b>radiology</b> have {{a leading role in the}} strategic planning, testing, safe use, and optimization of advances in medical imaging technologies and techniques.|$|R
