40|$|Congenital {{complete}} {{absence of}} the left pericardium is a rare cause of clinical and radiological cardiovascular abnormalities. We describe a patient in whom this diagnosis was made coincidentally when she presented with another problem. CASE HISTORY A 20 -year-old female sought advice for diarrhoea and vomiting which followed a holiday in Majorca. She had no other symptoms. Apart from investigation of a cardiac murmur when she was six, past medical history was unremarkable. On examination she appeared healthy, with no fever or dehydration. Her abdomen was normal. Pulse was 100 /min, regular, and blood pressure 110 / 60. Her apex beat was not displaced and of normal character. On auscultation there was wide but variable splitting of the second sound with a loud pulmonary component, and a grade 3 / 6 <b>mid-systolic</b> <b>murmur</b> heard in the pulmonary area only. Her first heart sound was normal and no other murmurs or bruits were heard. Electrocardiograph (Fig 1) showed right axis deviation and clockwise rotation. Chest X- ray (Fig 2) showed an abnormal cardiac outline, consistent with leftward rotation. The trachea was central, and lung fields and pulmonary vascularit...|$|E
40|$|Degenerative valvular {{disease or}} endocardiosis {{is the most}} common {{cardiovascular}} pathology in dogs. It is characterized by regurgitation of blood into the atria with decreased cardiac output, leading to volume overload with eccentric hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. This report describes the clinical and autopsy findings of a dog, suggestive of valvular endocardiosis. The patient was admitted to the outpatient Veterinary Clinic “Carlos Martínez Hoyos” at the University of Nariño (Pasto, Colombia). His owner said the dog was sick for two months, with signs of respiratory disease, weight loss, and decay. Clinical examination showed very pale mucous membranes, inspiratory dyspnea, rale, split S 2, grade 4 <b>mid-systolic</b> <b>murmur</b> of regurgitation, and abdominal dilatation with sign of positive shock wave. Necropsy evidenced plenty of translucent watery material in the abdominal, chest and pericardium cavity, severely enlarged and rounded heart with thickened atrioventricular valves, moderate reduction in liver size and signs of lobulation, severely diminished and pale kidneys with irregular surface showing the presence of multiple cystic areas in corticomedullary region. Samples were taken from these tissues and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin to be processed for histopathological analysis at the Laboratory of Pathology at the University of Nariño, using hematoxylin and eosin stain. This way, degenerative valvular disease was diagnosed...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{patients}} with billowing mitral valves have been studied. In 11 the abnormality was not accompanied by significant cardiac disability. In three, severe mitral insufficiency required mitral valve replacement. Pathological {{examination of the}} excised mitral valves showed myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve substance and chordae tendineae. Inhalation of amyl nitrite by the nine {{patients with}} late systolic murmurs resulted in a change from late systolic to pansystolic murmur in seven and to <b>mid-systolic</b> <b>murmur</b> in two. On {{the basis of the}} known effects of amyl nitrate, this response gives support to the concept that the critical pathogenetic factor is the degree of elongation of chordae tendineae. Additional Indexing Words: Marfan's syndrome Mural cusp STUDIES OF PATIENTS with late sys-tolic murmurs have revealed that what was once considered an innocent cardiac murmur is not innocent, but caused by mitral valve insufficiency. 1 - 5 This condition is char-acterized by the presence of huge leaflets which appear to have partially prolapsed into the left atrium. The present paper attempts to describe this lesion in 14 patients who, while having identical mitral valve deformity, showed wide variation in valvular dysfunc-tion. Clinical Information The 14 patients were 16 to 57 years of age, seven of whom were women. One patient had the typical appearance of Marfan's syndrome, while six others were tall and thin. One woman had Turner's syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Auscultatory and echocardiographic and phonocardiographic {{studies were}} {{performed}} on 26 patients who had a total of 11 Lillehei-Kaster, 16 Björk-Shiley, and 18 St Jude heart valve prostheses functioning normally in the aortic or mitral positions or both. With all types and positions of prostheses a distinct closing sound was always detected. It was frequently heard in two parts which, according to echocardiographic and phonocardiographic studies, resulted from the onset and completion of the valve closure. An opening sound could be heard from all Björk-Shiley and St Jude valves but from only four of the 11 Lillehei-Kaster valves. The opening sounds due to mitral prostheses consisted of two to three closely spaced clicks detected as a faint early diastolic crackle on auscultation. Echocardiography with phonocardiography {{indicated that they were}} related to the onset and termination of the disc opening excursion. In the aortic position the valves always produced early to <b>mid-systolic</b> <b>murmurs,</b> and a soft early diastolic murmur was also heard in seven of 23 patients. A mid-diastolic rumble was heard in 12 of 22 patients with mitral prostheses. Normally functioning tilting disc valve prostheses produce characteristic auscultatory findings, and familiarity with these findings will be useful in clinical evaluation of patients with these prostheses...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mid-systolic</b> {{ejection}} <b>murmurs</b> are due {{to blood}} flow through the semilunar valves. They occur {{at the start of}} blood ejection — which starts after S1 — and ends with the cessation of the blood flow — which is before S2. Therefore, the onset of a midsystolic ejection murmur is separated from S1 by the isovolumic contraction phase; the cessation of the murmur and the S2 interval is the aortic or pulmonary hangout time. The resultant configuration of this murmur is a crescendo-decrescendo murmur. Causes of midsystolic ejection murmurs include outflow obstruction, increased flow through normal semilunar valves, dilation of aortic root or pulmonary trunk, or structural changes in the semilunar valves without obstruction.|$|R
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} system was examined in 19 cases of familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

40|$|Anomalous {{origin of}} the left {{coronary}} artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare congenital cardiovascular defect with an incidence of 1 in 300, 000 live births. It {{is the most common}} anomaly of the coronary vasculature, with a frequency of 0 - 5 % of all congenital cardiac defects. When presenting in infancy it is known as the Bland-White-Garland syndrome. The mortality rate among infants and children without operation is between 80 % and 90 %. 1 Of 14 adults with the condition who survived to between 16 and 60 years, ten died suddenly and unexpectedly, associated with sudden physical exertion. We present a 55 -year-old woman whom we believe to be only the fifth patient over the age of 50 with this condition in whom the diagnosis was made during life; successful bypass grafting was achieved using the left internal mammary artery. CASE REPORT. A 55 -year- old woman was referred for evaluation of a five year history of exertional chest pain. Apart from a 15 year history of hypertension there was no other significant past medical history. She had undergone five pregnancies without complications. There was a grade 3 / 6 <b>mid-systolic</b> <b>murmur</b> at the cardiac apex. Electrocardiograph showed left ventricular hypertrophy with T wave inversion in the lateral leads. Chest X- ray showed cardiomegaly. She exercised for 12 minutes on the treadmill (modified Bruce protocol) without chest pain, and showed minimal ST segment changes in the lateral leads. Selective right coronary angiography showed a tortous dilated (10 - 12 mm) vessel supplying collaterals to the left coronary artery (Figure). The contrast material then flowed into the pulmonary artery. The left ventricle was dilated with a hypokinetic antero-lateral wall, and mild mitral regurgitation was present. Cardiac catheterisation data was consistent with impaired left ventricular function...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A 60 {{year old}} man was {{admitted}} with acute back pain followed by hoarseness. An aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus Botalli was diagnosed and an operation was recommended {{because of the high}} risk of complications such as rupture, embolism, or infection. The patient and his family refused surgery, however. The patient died suddenly of a rupture of the aneurysm a year later; necropsy confirmed the diagnosis. Several diagnostic methods were used and enhanced computed tomography gave the best representation of the aneurysm as it was seen at necropsy. This case indicates that enhanced computed tomography is probably the most useful investigation in patients with this type of aneurysm and it confirms the importance of an aneurysmectomy. An aneurysm of the ductus arteriosus Botalli is an uncommon cardiovascular anomaly. Cases in adults are rare; only 22 had been reported by 1984. 1 2 We report a case of an aneurysm of a non-patent ductus arteriosus in an adult. In this case the diagnosis was made clinically but surgery was refused and death occurred suddenly about one year after diagnosis. Necropsy showed a left haemothorax caused by a ruptured aneurysm of a non-patent ductus arte-riosus. This case raises several important issues-such as the most useful diagnostic methods and the importance of surgery. Case report A 60 year {{old man was}} admitted with acute severe back pain followed by hoarseness in January 1983. Five days before admission he had had acute back pain lasting all day. He visited the otolaryngological department of our hospital because of hoarseness, and left recurrent nerve paralysis was diagnosed. He was referred to the cardiovascular department because of an abnormally large aortic shadow on the chest x ray. He had a 10 year history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which were well con-trolled. There was no history of chest trauma. At admission blood pressure was 142 / 90 mmHg and a grade 3 / 6 <b>mid-systolic</b> <b>murmur</b> was audible at the pulmonary area (the second intercostal spac...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Deficiency of glucose- 6 -phosfate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) is a X-linked {{recessive disease}} characterized by susceptibility to hemolysis due to low or undetectable enzime levels. The {{reduction of the}} enzime activity impairs red blood cell toleration of oxidative stress. Clinical presentation depends on the variant of the disease: the Mediterranean variant presents often with acute severe hemolysis; in black populations hemolysis is usually mild and chronic. In both the cases oxidant drugs have been implicated in the etiology of the hemolytic events. Naphthalene, commonly used at home for clothes storage, was firstly related with hemolysis in G 6 PD deficiency in 1964 because of its oxidative properties. In the following years the association of naphthalene domestic use and hemolysis in G 6 PD deficiency was confirmed in numerous cases, both for ingestion and inhalation. Case report Nigerian female infant diagnosed with G 6 PD deficiency at born. She remained well {{until the age of}} 40 days when she was admitted to the hospital because of feeding difficulty, vomiting and mild respiratory distress in the last 4 days.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] 46 -year-old White man had a 2 -year history of frequent atypical chest pain associated with palpitations and presyncope. Clinical examination revealed an intermittent mid-systolic non-ejection click followed by a blowing mid-to-late systolic murmur indicative of the billowing mitral leaflet syndrome (BMLS) (primary mitral valve prolapse (MVP); Barlow's syndrome). This diagnossis was confirmed on cardiac catheterization, left ventricular cine angiography showing mild mitral insufficiency. M-mode and cross-sectional echocardiograms failed to show the MVP, although phonocardiography documented the intermittent non-ejection click and <b>mid-systolic</b> apical <b>murmur.</b> Ambulatory Holter monitoring showed symptomatic inferolateral myocardial ischaemia, and maximal stress-testing elicited asymptomatic ischaemia in the same zone. Selective coronary angiography delinated a normal left coronary artery and an insignificant fixed obstructive lesion {{in the second part}} of the dominent right coronary artery (RCA). Provocation with ergometrine (ergonovine) maleate gave rise to severe coronary vasospasm superimposed on the insignificant lesion in the RCA. This spasm provoked myocardial ischaemia resulting in symptomatic ventricular fibrillation which was successfully reserved. The patient's symptoms have been fairly well controlled by nitrates and nifedipine. As far as I am aware this is the first documentation of coronary vasospasm in the BMLS. In this syndrome coronary artery spasm has often been postulated to be responsible for acute myocardial infarction with a normal appearance of the coronary arteries on angiography. This mechanism has also been incriminated in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in cases of primary MVP. These various contentious and important issues are reviewed. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|Mitral {{regurgitation}} is {{a relatively}} common finding in coronary heart disease. In this series of 127 patients, selected {{with a view to}} coronary or left ventricular surgery on the basis of severity of symptoms, the incidence was 39 (31 %). Mitral regurgitation is significantly more common in patients with a history or electrocardio-graphic evidence ofprevious myocardial infarction. Clinically it may present as a pan- or late systolic or even a <b>mid-systolic,</b> ejection type <b>murmur</b> at the apex or at the left sternal edge; but in 39 per cent of the patients with angiographic mitral regurgitation no murmur was present. Angiographically important mitral regurgita-tion (grades 2 - 4 / 4) was usually associated with a systolic murmur; this finding was independent of ejection fractions. Left ventricular enlargement clinically or radiographically is likely to accompany mitral regurgita-tion but left atrial enlargement (electrocardiographically or on chest x-ray) is a more reliable pointer to mitral regurgitation and pulmonary venous hypertension is even more strongly suggestive of its presence. The electro-cardiographic signs of papillary muscle infarction were rare in this series (15 %) and were not related to angiographic mitral regurgitation. There was no difference in the incidence of mitral regurgitation in associa-tion with anterior or inferior myocardial infarction or in distribution of coronary artery disease.

40|$|Prolapsing {{mitral valve}} {{is a common}} cardiac condition, {{occurring}} in approximately 16 {{million people in the}} United States alone. Primary prolapsing mitral valve may be familial or nonfamilial and may be associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets, such as occurs in Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders. Secondary forms may be associated with such entities as rheumatic fever (especially after commissurotomy) and coronary artery disease (in the presence of ruptured chordae tendineae), and with such congenital conditions as interatrial defect and primary cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction. Prolapsing mitral valve is characterized by late systolic <b>murmur,</b> <b>mid-systolic</b> click, or both. Arrhythmias occur in the form of benign premature atrial contraction, premature nodal contraction, and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. As the patient ages, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation tend to develop. In some chronic cases, especially those involving atrial fibrillation, systemic emboli may occur. Rare premature ventricular contractions may be largely benign, whereas more frequent premature ventricular contractions may lead to severe arrhythmic complexes such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. With advancing age, atrioventricular conduction defects of varying degrees or sick sinus syndrome may necessitate a pacemaker installation. About one quarter of prolapsing mitral valve cases progress, with increasing mitral insufficiency and increasing enlargement of the left atrium and left ventricle, which at times leads to congestive heart failure. Coronary artery disease may occur with the severity commensurate with the patient's age group. About three quarters of patients with prolapsing mitral valve syndrome lead normal lives...|$|R
