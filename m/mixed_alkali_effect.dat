These medieval lead glasses, on the other hand, show very similar compositions to the high lead glass flakes with only traces of alkali and calcium oxides investigated here (I/ 18, I/ 34, I/ 59; Fig.  4; Table  3) [12]. In contrary, eighteenth century glass flakes used in plaster decorations from Germany were mainly <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> glass without lead (Weissenstein Castle 1722) or high lead with low potassium and calcium content (Grotto hall Dresden 1714) [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|PbO-SiO 2 系及びPbO-SiO 2 -K 2 O-Na 2 O系ガラス中のMn 3 +イオンの光吸収スペクトルとガラスの屈折率を測定し、ガラス組成と吸収ピーク波数及び屈折率の関係を調べた。PbO-SiO 2 系にMnO 2 を添加したガラス中のMn 3 +の吸収ピーク波数はMnO 2 添加量が増加するとともに低波数側へシフトした。屈折率はMnO 2 添加量が 1. 0 mol%まではほぼ一定となった。PbO-SiO 2 -K 2 O-Na 2 O系ガラス中のMn 3 +の吸収ピーク波数は[K 2 O]/[K 2 O+Na 2 O]の値の増加とともに低波数側へシフトし、混合アルカリ効果ははっきりとは現れない。屈折率は[K 2 O]/[K 2 O+Na 2 O]の値の増加とともに直線的に減少し、混合アルカリ効果は明確には認められない。Absorption {{spectra of}} Mn 3 + ions in PbO-SiO 2 and PbO-SiO 2 -K 2 O-Na 2 O glasses and {{refractive}} indices of these glasses were measured, {{and the effect}} of chemical composition was studied. The peak wave numbers of Mn 3 + ion shifted toward the lower wave numbers with increasing Mno 2 addition in PbO-SiO 2 glasses. The refractive indices of PbO-SiO 2 glasses were nearly constant. The peak wave numbers of Mn 3 + ions in PbO-SiO 2 -K 2 O-Na 2 O glasses shifted toward the lower wave numbers with increasing [K 2 O]/[K 2 O+Na 2 O] ratio. The <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>effect</b> was not observed in the relation between peak wave number of Mn 3 + and composition. The refractive indices shifted linearly toward the lower values with increasing [K 2 O]/[K 2 O+Na 2 O] ratio. No <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>effect</b> was observed clearly in the refractive index...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBorate {{glasses with}} the {{composition}} xK 2 O-(25 -x) Na 2 O- 12. 5 MgO- 12. 5 BaO- 50 B 2 O 3 (x= 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mol%) were {{prepared by the}} melt-quenching technique and were characterized using X-ray diffraction at room temperature. From the optical absorption spectra, the direct forbidden, direct allowed, indirect allowed, and indirect forbidden energy gaps; Urbach energy; refractive index (n); dielectric constant (ɛ); reflection loss (R); molar refraction (Rm); and molar polarizability (αm) values {{of all of the}} glass samples were evaluated. Rm, αm and Λth increase with the increase of the K 2 O content. The values of R, ɛ and n increase up to x= 10 mol% and then decrease above x= 10 mol%, which {{may be due to the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>effect.</b> The density and molar volume values show the opposite behaviour and vary nonlinearly with the K 2 O content, which manifests the <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>effect</b> in the present glass system. The infrared (IR) spectra of the borate glasses reveal the existence of 3 - and 4 -coordinated boron atoms. The specific vibrations of the Na-O, K-O, Mg-O, and Ba-O bonds were observed in an IR study...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of whether glass continues to relax at low temperature is of fundamental and practical interest. Here, we report a novel atomistic simulation method allowing us to directly access the long-term dynamics of glass relaxation at room temperature. We find that the potential energy relaxation follows a stretched exponential decay, with a stretching exponent β = 3 / 5, as predicted by Phillips' diffusion-trap model. Interestingly, volume relaxation is also found. However, it is not correlated to the energy relaxation, but is rather {{a manifestation of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} friction and the dielectric losses of Na-K metaphosphate glasses have been investigated. A single <b>alkali</b> and a <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> {{internal friction}} peak were observed. The single alkali peak shifted to higher temperatures with increasing {{concentration of the}} second alkali and eventually disappeared. The activation energy of this peak increased with the <b>alkali</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio. As in silicate and borate glasses, the single alkali peak correlates closely with the dielectric loss. The mixed peak showed {{a dramatic increase in}} size with the addition of the second alkali, but the activation energy was practically independent of the <b>alkali</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio. The large reduction in height of the mixed peak, observed on annealing, is discussed together with the influence of water...|$|R
30|$|Early English lead crystal {{was found}} to be potassium-lead-silica with {{increasing}} lead contents {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century (12 – 40  wt%) [16, 19]. [16] also found <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> glasses, which however contained no lead. Ravenscroft may have used potash instead of the expensive borax, and after the expiration of his patent other glass makers probably adopted his technology [14, 16].|$|R
30|$|All flakes {{were made}} of lead glass with lead {{contents}} in the range between 18 to over 70 wt%. One group showed <b>mixed</b> <b>alkali</b> compositions, probably from potash, lime and nitre, the other contained sodium, potassium and calcium oxides only in trace, if at all. Colouring elements were cobalt, copper, iron, manganese and gold resulting in blue, green, yellow and violet.|$|R
