Carbonyl sulfide is a potential alternative fumigant to <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> and phosphine. In some cases, however, residues on the grain result in flavours that are unacceptable to consumers, e.g. barley used for brewing. Carbonyl sulfide is readily converted to the gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide by carbonic anhydrase enzymes in plants and mammals. Because of this chemistry, the release of carbonyl sulfide from small organic molecules has been identified as a strategy for delivering hydrogen sulfide in different biological contexts.|$|E

40|$|With <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide's</b> phase-out, most growers {{have turned}} to {{alternative}} fumigants, particularly 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) and chloropicrin. These alternatives are tightly regulated because they are classified as toxic air contaminants and volatile organic compounds; the latter combine with other substances to produce ground-level ozone (smog). Two ambient air monitoring studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of totally impermeable film (TIF) to reduce emissions from shank applications of chloropicrin and 1, 3 -D. In 2009, a study demonstrated that TIF reduced chloropicrin and 1, 3 -D peak emissions by 45 % and 38 %, respectively, but TIF did not reduce total emissions when it was cut after 6 days. In 2011, increasing the tarp period from 5 to 10 days decreased chloropicrin and 1, 3 -D peak emissions by 88 % and 78 %, and their total emissions by 64 % and 43 %, respectively.
