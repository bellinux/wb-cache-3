500|$|Narcissi {{are well}} suited for {{planting}} under small thickets of trees, {{where they can be}} grouped as 6–12 bulbs. They also grow well in perennial borders, especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading. [...] A number of wild species and hybrids such as [...] "Dutch Master", [...] "Golden Harvest", [...] "Carlton", [...] "Kings Court" [...] and [...] "Yellow Sun" [...] naturalise well in lawns, but {{it is important not to}} <b>mow</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season. Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at the same time as narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike Tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.|$|E
