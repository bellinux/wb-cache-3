He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of <b>medium</b> <b>height.</b> Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

In this paper the effects of patent height are studied in a duopoly where firms compete in product improvements. Minimal steps of improvements, determined by the height, limit the strategy space of competitors who want to invent around a patent. It is shown that low patents do not affect the natural market equilibrium. A patentholder can lose with <b>medium</b> patent <b>heights,</b> but he becomes a pure monopolist if patents are high.

Although in no sense athletic, he made some sort of exercise in the open air each day almost a religious duty. At one time this took the form of bicycle rides, though he soon gave these up in favor of walking. His rule was to cover at least four miles a day, rain or shine, and there was no part of the less congested portions of New Haven and its environs over which he had not many times traveled as he walked unhurriedly alone, stooping somewhat, buried in thought, compelled by poor eyesight to keep his gaze fixed upon his path a few feet ahead of him. This methodical exercise he kept up until, in his last years, injuries received as the result of a fall confined him to his home.|$|E

Histomorphometric analysis of the luminal and glandular epithelial cell heights, glandularlumen diameter, glandular density, percentage of glands with apparent lumen and with intraluminal secretion, and a descriptiveanalysis of the endometrium was made in 65 endometrial biopsies. Samples were collected during estrus (n= 30) and diestrus(n= 35), fixed in Bouin’s solution, embedded in paraffin HxE and classified according to Kenney and Doig (1986) categories. Groups of IIa category obtained the greatest <b>medium</b> cell <b>heights</b> for luminal and glandular epithelium, and groups of III categoryobtained the smallest values, during estrus and diestrus. The <b>medium</b> <b>heights</b> of luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium andglandular lumen diameter of samples collected during estrus were greater than those collected during diestrus.

25|$|Shoes were {{narrow and}} often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a <b>medium</b> <b>height</b> heel.

Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur {{to stave off the}} winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter. At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. Shoes were commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having boots made of seal skin was most common for people in a higher social class. Seal skin boots were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and other fabrics, and shoes were starting to incorporate a fabric topping.|$|E

30|$|The {{positive}} {{values in}} Fig.  10 represent lower efficiency {{in using the}} optimized PSO algorithm compared with not using it. According to the results, the J 3, J 4, J 2, J 6, J 7 criteria illustrate positive effects of using algorithm control to control short buildings for both the external excitation zones. On the other hand, for the J 1 and J 5 criteria, not using the PSO algorithm in the installed actuators led to a better performance in the defined criteria. The overall {{results showed that the}} criteria of J 3, J 4, J 6, J 7, J 2 were reduced by 20, 11.11, 5, 5.9 and 5  %, on average, respectively, for all the earthquakes in the short buildings. Furthermore, except for the J 3 criterion, the other performance criteria for the structures with <b>medium</b> <b>heights</b> have better performance in the buildings with optimized actuators compared to those with unoptimized actuators. The J 1, J 2, J 4, J 5, J 6, J 7 criteria led to average reductions of 21.28, 14.66, 15.32, 21.74, 4.99 and 14.99  %, respectively, for the structures with <b>medium</b> <b>heights</b> for both types of external excitation zones. The adopted control algorithm for the tall buildings completely depends on the type of the external excitation zone. All the introduced criteria except J 6 showed a good performance in the structure in which the control algorithm was used in comparison with the case in which no control algorithm was used. Therefore, the J 1, J 2, J 3, J 4, J 5, J 7 criteria were reduced on average by 39.59, 11.21, 1.93, 6.25, 19.23 and 4.39  %, respectively, under all applied earthquakes. By monitoring the input force to each actuator and the uncontrolled base shear, the input force for each actuator to control the buildings is determined.|$|R
40|$|A {{very long}} neck is a {{characteristic}} feature of most sauropod dinosaurs. In the genus Mamenchisaurus, neck length is extreme, greater than 40 {{percent of total}} body length. However, the posture, utilization, and selective advantage of very long necks in sauropods are still controversial. An excellently preserved skeleton of Mamenchisaurus youngi, including a complete neck, {{provides an opportunity for}} a comprehensive biomechanical analysis of neck posture and mobility. The biomechanical evidence indicates that Mamenchisaurus youngi had a nearly straight, near horizontal neck posture and browsed at low or <b>medium</b> <b>heights.</b> The results differ from the findings for some other sauropod species, like Euhelopus, Diplodocus, and Giraffatitan (Brachiosaurus) that had been analyzed in previous studies with similar methods. The selective advantage of extreme neck length in sauropods is likely advantageous for different feeding strategies...|$|R

He bowled from sideways on, and according to his Wisden obituary, had [...] "a rhythmical run-up and full follow-through". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow described Allen in 1943: [...] "Of no more than <b>medium</b> <b>height,</b> he has a solid yet elastic strength, every unit of which {{is used in the}} delivery and in a follow-through which is the finest I have ever seen." [...] Robertson-Glasgow continued: [...] "His bowling, though it varies from piercing accuracy to almost ludicrous irrelevance, has often touched greatness."

[...] Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: [...] "I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales {{on the back of}} a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open." [...] His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a [...] "militant paleontologist". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, [...] " [...] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, were we bolder".|$|E
500|$|Manley {{describes}} Headley as {{just under}} <b>medium</b> <b>height</b> with sloping shoulders. His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field; his cap was usually at a slight angle and his sleeves were buttoned {{down to the}} wrist. Wisden noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect. Exceptionally quick on his feet, he watched the ball onto the bat {{more than any other}} batsman. According to Wisden, all his shots were equally good but most notable was his on drive played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was very difficult to get out. He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often, but R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed his square cut, late cut, and hook were exceptionally good. Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets. C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39.85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets. According to James's reckoning, Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once, and averaged 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game. He stated: [...] "On a bad wicket, it was you and the bowler...no nonsense." ...|$|E

A significant advantage for the German fighter was its fuel injected engine, which allowed it to perform negative-G maneuvers without the engine cutting-out. The Spitfire and Hurricane lacked this capability. The twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110 had performed well in the earlier campaigns. It was well-armed and had the range to escort the bombers deep into enemy territory, which the Bf 109 lacked. Its fatal flaw was that in comparison to the British fighters it was unmaneuverable and therefore vulnerable.|$|R

40|$|Cantilever {{sheet pile}} walls are used {{routinely}} to retain <b>medium</b> <b>heights</b> of earth in geotechnical practice. Earth pressures developed {{on either side}} of the sheet pile wall ensure its moment and force equilibrium. Cantilever sheet pile walls suffer rotation about a pivot point close to the base and generate passive and active earth pressures. Earlier methods to determine the pivot point either use iterative procedures or rely on centrifuge data or finite element analyses. In this paper a new method based on minimization of the moment ratio is proposed to determine the location of the pivot point. This method is applicable to both cohesionless and cohesive backfills. Consideration of moment equilibrium is sufficient to determine the pivot point and force equilibrium is automatically satisfied. The location of the pivot point obtained by this approach compared satisfactorily with the centrifuge and laboratory test data. The shear strength demand computed for these tests could predict when sheet pile walls became unstable. Finally the shear strength demand was linked to the shear strains and hence to the wall deflections that compare satisfactorily with experimental wall deflections...|$|R
