2500|$|Though born in Leicester, Crawford {{was brought}} up in Surrey where his father had become {{chaplain}} at the Cane Hill mental hospital at Coulsdon. He was an outstanding schoolboy cricketer at Whitgift School, and played for Surrey in 1896 as a 17-year-old while still at school. At school and in early club cricket, according to a tribute to him written in the 1923 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack by his Surrey colleague Digby Jephson, he was regarded primarily as a fast bowler, and he took eight wickets in an innings for 35 runs against the full Surrey side in a minor match in 1895. The following year, according to the same source, he hit 218 before lunch in a match for Surrey's Young Amateurs side against the Young Professionals: [...] "the sort of innings <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> tramp long, weary miles to see," [...] Jephson wrote.|$|E

We had a regular daily {{competition}} to guess the vessel's progress; and twelve o'clock, when the result was published in the wheel-house, came to be a moment of considerable interest. But the interest was unmixed. Not a bet was laid upon our guesses. From the Clyde to Sandy Hook I never heard a wager offered or taken. We had, besides, romps in plenty. Puss in the Corner, which we had rebaptised, in more manly style, Devil and four Corners, was my own favourite game; but there were many who preferred another, the humour of which was to box a person's ears until he found out who had cuffed him.|$|R
60|$|And yet I {{believe we}} ought to think of it, and, by God's help, I will one day preach you a sermon, asking you all round this fair question:--If Jesus Christ came {{to you in the}} shape of a poor man, whom nobody knew, should YOU know him? should you admire him, fall at his feet and give {{yourself}} up to him body and soul? I am afraid that I, for one, should not--I am afraid that too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here <b>would</b> not. That comes of thinking more of religion than we do of godliness--in plain words, more of our own souls than we do of Jesus Christ. But you will want to know what is, after all, the difference between religion and godliness? Just the difference, my friends, that there is between always thinking of self and always forgetting self--between the terror of a slave and the affection of a child--between the fear of hell and the love of God. For, tell me, what you mean by being religious? Do you not mean thinking a great deal about your own souls, and praying and reading about your own souls, and trying by all possible means to get your own souls saved? Is not that the meaning of religion? And yet I have never mentioned God's name in describing it! This sort of religion must have very little to do with God. You may be surprised at my words, and say in your hearts almost angrily, 'Why who saves our souls but God? therefore religion must have to do with God.' But, my friends, for your souls' sake, and for God's sake, ask yourselves this question on your knees this day:--If you could get your souls saved without God's help, would it make much difference to you? Suppose an angel from heaven, as they say, was to come down and prove to you clearly that there was no God, no blessed Jesus in heaven, that the world made itself, and went on of itself, and that the Bible was all a mistake, but that you need not mind, for your gardens and crops would grow just as well, and your souls be saved just as well when you died.|$|R

60|$|Given, then, our new polity, {{with its}} new waggon-load of laws, what headmarks must we look for in the life? We chafe a good deal at that {{excellent}} thing, the income-tax, because it brings into our affairs the prying fingers, and exposes us to the tart words, of the official. The official, in all degrees, is already something of a terror to <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> I <b>would</b> not willingly {{have to do with}} even a police-constable in any other spirit than that of kindness. I still remember in my dreams the eye-glass of a certain attaché at a certain embassy--an eye-glass that was a standing indignity to all on whom it looked; and my next most disagreeable remembrance is of a bracing, Republican postman in the city of San Francisco. I lived in that city among working folk, and what my neighbours accepted at the postman's hands--nay, what I took from him myself--it is still distasteful to recall. The bourgeois, residing in the upper parts of society, has but few opportunities of tasting this peculiar bowl; but about the income-tax, as I have said, or perhaps about a patent, or in the halls of an embassy at the hands of my friend of the eye-glass, he occasionally sets his lips to it; and he may thus imagine (if he has that faculty of imagination, without which most faculties are void) how it tastes to his poorer neighbours who must drain it to the dregs. In every contact with authority, with their employer, with the police, with the School Board officer, in the hospital, or in the workhouse, they have equally the occasion to appreciate the light-hearted civility of the man in office; and as an experimentalist in several out-of-the-way provinces of life, I may say it has but to be felt to be appreciated. Well, this golden age of which we are speaking will be the golden age of officials. In all our concerns it will be their beloved duty to meddle, with what tact, with what obliging words, analogy will aid us to imagine. It is likely these gentlemen will be periodically elected; they will therefore have their turn of being underneath, which does not always sweeten men's conditions. The laws they will have to administer will be no clearer than those we know to-day, and the body which is to regulate their administration no wiser than the British Parliament. So that upon all hands we may look for a form of servitude most galling to the blood--servitude to many and changing masters, and for all the slights that accompany the rule of jack-in-office. And if the Socialistic programme be carried out with the least fulness, we shall have lost a thing, in most respects not much to be regretted, but as a moderator of oppression, a thing nearly invaluable--the newspaper. For the independent journal is a creature of capital and competition; it stands and falls with millionaires and railway bonds and all the abuses and glories of to-day; {{and as soon as the}} State has fairly taken its bent to authority and philanthropy, and laid the least touch on private property, the days of the independent journal are numbered.

For even if any witness appeared against us, the man had been killed in self-defence whilst trying to bring about our deaths at the hands of Basutos. I could see now that I was foolish not to have taken this line from the first, but as I think I have already explained, what weighed with me was the terror of involving these young people in a scandal which might shadow all their future lives. Also some fate inch by inch had dragged me into Zululand.

6000|$|But {{social science}} {{is by no}} means always content with the normal human soul; it has all sorts of fancy souls for sale.

[...] Now in bodily ills there is none of this difference about the ultimate ideal. The patient may or may not want quinine; but he certainly wants health. No one says [...] "I am tired of this headache; I want some toothache," [...] or [...] "The only thing for this Russian influenza is a few German measles," [...] or [...] "Through this dark probation of catarrh I see the shining paradise of rheumatism." [...] But exactly the whole difficulty in our public problems is that some men are aiming at cures which other men would regard as worse maladies; are offering ultimate conditions as states of health which others would uncompromisingly call states of disease. Mr. Belloc once said that he would no more part with the idea of property than with his teeth; yet to Mr. Bernard Shaw property is not a tooth, but a toothache. Lord Milner has sincerely attempted to introduce German efficiency; and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> as soon welcome German measles.

6000|$|People to whom cold means misery, {{who hate}} to be braced, and shudder at the word [...] "seasonable," [...] can have little {{difficulty}} in accounting for {{the origin of the}} sports of winter. They need only adapt to the circumstances that old Lydian tradition which says that games of chance were invented during a great famine. Men permitted themselves to eat only every second day, and tried to forget their hunger in playing at draughts and dice. That is clearly the invention of a southern people, which never had occasion to wish it could become oblivious of the weather, as too <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> like to be in England. Such shivering and indolent folks may be inclined to say that skating and curling and wildfowl-shooting, and the other diversions which seduce the able-bodied from the warm precincts of the cheerful fire, were only contrived to enable us to forget the state of the thermometer. Whether or not that was the purpose of the first northerner who fixed sheep-bones beneath his feet, to course more smoothly over the frozen sound, {{there can be no doubt}} that winter sports answer their presumed purpose. They keep up that glow which only exercise in the open air can give, and promote the health which shows itself in the complexion. It is the young lady who interprets literally the Scotch invitation [...] "come into the fire," [...] and who spoils the backs of library novels by holding them too near the comfortable hearth, she it is who suffers from the ignoble and unbecoming liberties that winter takes with the human countenance. Happier and wiser is she who studies the always living and popular Dutch roll rather than the Grecian bend, and who blooms with continual health and good temper. Our changeful climate affords so few opportunities of learning to skate, that it is really extraordinary to find so much skill, and to see feats so difficult and graceful. In Canada, where frost is a certainty, and where the covered [...] "rinks" [...] make skating an indoor sport, it is not odd that great perfection should be attained. But as fast as Canadians bring over a new figure or a new trick it is picked up, and critics may dispute as to whether the bold and dashing style of the English school of skaters is not preferable to the careful and smooth, but somewhat pretty and niggling manner of the colonists. Our skating stands to the Canadian fashion somewhat as French does to English etching. We have the dash and the chic with skates which Frenchmen show with the etching-needle, and the Canadian, on the other hand, is apt to decline into the mere prettiness which is the fault of English etchers.|$|E
