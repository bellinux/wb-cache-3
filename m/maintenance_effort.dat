50|$|A common {{perception}} of maintenance {{is that it}} merely involves fixing defects. However, one study indicated that over 80% of <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort</b> is used for non-corrective actions. This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system. More recent studies put the bug-fixing proportion closer to 21%.|$|E

50|$|The {{survey showed}} that around 75% of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort</b> was {{on the first two}} types, and error {{correction}} consumed about 21%. Many subsequent studies suggest a similar magnitude of the problem. Studies show that contribution of end user is crucial during the new requirement data gathering and analysis. And this is the main cause of any problem during software evolution and maintenance. So software maintenance is important because it consumes {{a large part of the}} overall lifecycle costs and also the inability to change software quickly and reliably means that business opportunities are lost.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1934 the {{maintenance}} shop of Zurich {{was responsible for}} the care of the locomotive. Later the responsibility went over to {{the maintenance}} shop of Yverdon. This shop warned the Traction and Maintenance Department of the SBB in Bern 1942 that the commutators of the motors were almost fully worn. In the same time Yverdon remarked that a replacement of the winding of the transformers was necessary. Since the locomotive did not require a very extensive <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort</b> compared with other locomotives the Lucerne depot did not consider the call as dramatic.|$|E

This was the most modern large mass-produced car in Europe during the immediate pre-and postwar years. Competitive Mercedes models with flat, upright, one piece windscreen and external headlamps seemed from another age {{in spite of their}} greater prestige value. The result was that this solidly built and comfortable car lost rapidly in value and <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort,</b> with few second-hand buyers being able to afford to tax and insure a 2.5 Litre engine at the time.|$|E
50|$|While JMF is {{considered}} a very useful framework, the freely available implementation provided by Oracle is suffering {{from a lack of}} updates and maintenance. JMF does not get much <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort</b> from Oracle; the API has not been enhanced since 1999, and the last news item on JMF's home page was posted in September 2008. While JMF is built for extensibility, there are few such third-party extensions. Furthermore, content editing functionality in JMF is effectively non-existent. You can do simple recording and playback for audio and video, but the implementation provided by Oracle can do little else.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{typically}} begins {{from the}} destination {{to which the}} water will be delivered into the soil and works toward the source (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated along the route, separated {{at a distance of}} 20-35 m. The separation of the shafts is a balance between the amount of work required to excavate them and the amount of effort required to excavate the space between them, as well as the ultimate <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort.</b> In general, the shallower the qanat, the closer the vertical shafts. If the qanat is long, excavation may begin from both ends at once. Tributary channels are sometimes also constructed to supplement the water flow.|$|E

50|$|The 29.61 m high {{tower of}} {{reinforced}} concrete has nine storeys with panorama {{windows and a}} platform which {{can be reached via}} 126 steps. Along with its auxiliary buildings it reflects a modern approach in contrast to the eclecticism of the previous construction and is an early example of DDR architecture in the style of socialist classicism. The gastronomy area includes a restaurant, a wine tavern and sun terraces. The new tower again became a centre of attraction for Berlin’s populace, with an average of 240,000 visitors annually. Especially on holidays such as Pentecost there were large crowds in the tower and gastronomy area. A lack of <b>maintenance</b> <b>effort</b> continues to plague the area. In 1996 the tower itself was fully renovated with EU financing amounting to one million DM, but more work remains to be done.|$|E
