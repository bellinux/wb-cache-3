40|$|We {{present a}} {{time-dependent}} {{model for the}} generation of repeated intraplate earthquakes that incorporates a weak lower crustal zone within an elastic lithosphere. Relaxation of this weak zone after tectonic perturbations transfers stress to the overlying crust, generating a sequence of earthquakes that continues until the zone fully relaxes. Simulations predict large (5 to 10 <b>meters)</b> <b>slip</b> events with recurrence intervals of 250 to 4000 years and cumulative offsets of about 100 meters, depending on material parameters and far-field stress magnitude. Most are consistent with earthquake magnitude, coseismic slip, recurrence intervals, cumulative offset, and surface deformation rates in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Computed interseismic strain rates may not be detectable with available geodetic data, implying that low observed rates of strain accumulation cannot be used to rule out future damaging earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Exhumed strike-slip faults {{exposed in}} the Neves {{area of the}} Tauern Window (Eastern Alps, South Tyrol, Italy) formed in the lower brittle crust under hydrous {{conditions}} within effectively intact granodiorite. Faults initiated as segmented en-echelon shear fractures delineating conjugate sets, with segmentation occurring over scales of millimeters to hundred of <b>meters.</b> <b>Slip</b> accumulation on these initial segments was accommodated at contractional stepovers by more distributed faulting of the host rock. Laserscan mapping of a decametric contractional stepover along a fault (Mesule Fault), exposed on a glaciated surface with a rough topography, has allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} structural details and of the kinematic evolution of structures with increasing slip along the segmented fault. In the initial low slip stages, transfer of displacement was accommodated on a set of antithetic faults in the stepover, allowing a decrease in offset toward the tips of the overstep faults. This mechanism was only effective for relatively small fault slip. Further displacement was accommodated by the development of synthetic, sigmoidal by-pass faults providing a hard linkage between overstepped faults, which consistently crosscut deactivated earlier antithetic fault set within the relay ramp. This second stage of evolution is documented in the Mesule Fault, which has a current maximum offset of ca. 20 m. Hard linkage allowed the propagation of seismic fractures, as recorded by pseudotachylyte localized at by-pass contractional bends...|$|R

An 11 station regional GPS network located directly onshore of the rupture demonstrates consistent vertical subsidence verified by tide gauge data and southwest-directed extension, with measured displacements reaching 1 meter.

40|$|The dynamic {{strength}} (tau_f) of faults during coseismic slip {{is a major}} {{unknown in}} earthquake mechanics, though it has crucial influence on rupture properties, dynamic stress drop, radiated energy and heat produced during slip. In order to provide constraints on tau_f, High-Velocity Rock Friction Experiments (HVRFE) are conducted on natural rocks with rotary shear apparatuses, reproducing <b>slip</b> (several <b>meters)</b> and <b>slip</b> rate (0. 1 – 3 m s- 1) typical of large earthquakes. Among the various weakening mechanisms possibly activated during seismic slip, we focus on melt lubrication. Solidified, friction-induced melts (pseudotachylytes) decorate some exhumed seismic faults, showing that melt can occur on natural faults, though its frequency is still a matter of debate. In the presence of melt, tau_f undergoes an initial strengthening stage, followed by a dramatic weakening stage (thermal runaway). Field estimates based on pseudotachylyte thickness and experimental measures of tau_f suggest large stress drops once thermal runaway is achieved. These estimates of tau_f are compatible with large dynamic stress drops and high radiation efficiency, as observed for some earthquakes. Moreover, the threshold for the onset of thermal runaway might explain differences between the mechanics of small (M < 4) and large earthquakes. A simple mathematical model coupling melting, extrusion and thermal diffusion reproduces some observed experimental features such as {{the duration of the}} weakening stage and the convergence to a steady-state...|$|R
40|$|The {{most costly}} American {{earthquake}} since 1906 struck Los Angeles on 17 January 1994.

The fault appears to be truncated by the fault that broke in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake at a depth of 8 kilometers. Of these two events, the Northridge earthquake caused many times more damage, primarily because its causative fault is directly under the city. Many types of structures were damaged, but the fracture of welds in steel-frame buildings was the greatest surprise. The Northridge earthquake emphasizes the hazard posed to Los Angeles by concealed thrust faults and the potential for strong ground shaking in moderate earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVolcanic {{systems are}} highly dynamic environments that {{comprise}} rocks and magmas, which, {{in the process}} of strain localisation (e. g., in catastrophic flank collapse or dome-building events), are candidate materials for the occurrence of frictional melting and the formation of pseudotachylytes. We evaluate the frictional behaviour of a plagioclase-, two-pyroxene- and glass-bearing andesite and introduce an approach to constrain the rheology of frictional melts. Frictional slip at a rate of 1. 3 m/s under an axial stress of 1. 5 MPa induces heating at a rate approximating 130 °C per <b>meter</b> of <b>slip</b> and frictional melting of the andesite occurs at > 1000 °C, which corresponds to a peak in shear stress. With continuing displacement, the shear stress decreases by ∼ 25 % from the peak strength and stabilises while the temperature equilibrates to 1230 - 1290 °C. The shear stress for the system is congruent with a non-Arrhenian temperature-dependent frictional melt rheology exhibiting a non-Newtonian viscosity evolving from approximately 104. 2 to 103. 4 Pa*s. Post-experiment analysis show a gradation from 1) the host rock, to 2) an extraordinary zone of unmelted, yet viscously-deformed material, to 3) a thin, outer region of chemically heterogeneous protomelts, and to 4) an inner region of chemically homogeneous frictionally generated/modified melt in the core of the slip zone. We discuss the role and identification of frictional melting in volcanic systems and the implication of viscous remobilisation of magmatic plugs during frictional slip of glass-bearing volcanic materials...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of geomorphic offset measurements for calculating earthquake probabilities, little {{attention has been paid to}} either the uncertainties in the interpretation of offset geomorphic features, or the effects of these uncertainties on fault models and estimates of seismic hazard. Interpretation of offsets along the San Andreas fault in the Carrizo Plain have been the basis of hypotheses of a strong Carrizo fault segment which regularly breaks in great earthquakes several centuries apart with dextral surface slip on the order of 10 m per event. The smallest geomorphic offset measurements along a 6 km stretch of the fault southeast of Wallace Creek vary between 6. 5 m and 10 m. A 3 -D excavation of alluvial deposits at the Phelan fan shows that at least 6. 6 to 6. 9 m of dextral slip occurred during the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, and that the penultimate earthquake occurred several centuries prior to 1857. Thus, either the amount of surface <b>slip</b> varied several <b>meters</b> over a 2 - 3 km stretch of the fault in 1857, or 2 to 3 <b>meters</b> of <b>slip</b> in a penultimate earthquake was followed by 7 m of slip in 1857. Two monuments from an 1855 survey which spans the San Andreas fault in the Carrizo Plain have been displaced 11. 0 ± 2. 5 m right-laterally by the great earthquake of 1857. This magnitude of offset is consistent with geomorphic indications that slip across the fault during the 1857 earthquake and associated foreshocks and aftershocks varied from 6. 6 to 10 m over 2. 6 km along this section. Comparison of recent geodetic measurements with the late Holocene slip rate at Wallace Creek shows that fault slip rates determined from short-term wide aperture measurements are indistinguishable from rates determined from long-term narrow aperture measurements. Using radiocarbon dates of the penultimate large earthquake and measurements of slip in 1857, we calculate an average slip rate for the last complete earthquake cycle that is at least 25...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of earthquake failure sequences along a discrete cellular fault zone are performed for a three-dimensional (3 -D) model representing approximately the central San Andreas fault. The model {{consists of an}} upper crust overlying a lower crust and mantle region, together defining an elastic half-space with a vertical half-plane fault. The fault contains a region where slip is calculated on a uniform grid of cells governed by a static/kinetic friction law and regions where slip is prescribed so as to represent tectonic loading, aseismic fault creep, and adjacent great earthquakes. The computational region models a 70 -km-long and 17. 5 -km-deep section of the San Andreas fault to the NW of the great 1857 rupture zone. Different distributions of stress drops on failing computational cells are used to model asperity ("Parkfield asperity") and nonasperity fault regions. The model is "inherently discrete " and corresponds to {{a situation in which}} a characteristic size of geometric disorder within the fault (i. e., cell size, here a few hundreds of meters) is much larger than the "nucleation size " (of the order of tens of centimeters to tens of <b>meters)</b> based on <b>slip</b> weakening or state evolution slip distances.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. 2017 The September 16, 2015 Mw 8. 3 Illapel Earthquake occurred on a locked segment of the South American subduction in Chile. This segment ruptured during comparable size earthquakes in the past, in 1880 and 1943, suggesting a somehow regular pattern of characteristic Mw 8 + earthquakes occurring every 60 to 80 years. This recurrence is {{in agreement with the}} accumulation of elastic deformation in the upper plate due to the Nazca-South America subduction at a constant rate of 6. 5 cm/year, leading to a deficit of ~ 4. 5 <b>meters</b> of <b>slip</b> to be released every 70 years. Previous studies consistently imaged the distribution of co-seismic slip along the fault based on geodetic, seismological and far field tsunami data and all described a significant amount of shallow slip resulting in a large tsunami. In addition, some models highlighted an apparent mismatch between the modeled rake of slip and the direction of plate convergence, suggesting the buildup of large strike-slip deficit. Some of these important questions remain open. Is shallow slip really well resolved and substantiated ? Is the apparent principal direction of slip during the earthquake really required by the geodetic data ? Here, using a comprehensive analysis of continuous GPS sites (including high rate and static displacements) and new survey data from acquired over more than 50 pre-existing sites, complemented with InSAR data, we show that the 2015 rupture overlaps very well the 1943 rupture, with the absence of significant slip south of 32 °S and north of 30. 2 °S (peninsula Lingua de Vaca). Despite the wealth of geodetic data, the shallowest part of the subduction interface remains poorly resolved. We also show that the rake of the earthquake is fully compatible with the oblique plate convergence direction (rather than perpendicular to the trench), meaning that no subsequent trench-parallel motion is required by the data. We propose that the large Low Coupling Zone (LCZ) at the latitude of La Serena revealed by present day coupling distribution is stable over at least two seismic cycles. Inside the coupled area, peak coseismic slip is located precisely offshore the highest coastal topography and elevated terraces, adding weight to a potential correlation between the seismic cycle and long term permanent deformation. Finally, we show that early post-seismic after-slip occurs mostly down-dip of co-seismic asperity(ies), extending north and south of the 2015 rupture area...|$|R
40|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that several <b>meters</b> of lateral <b>slip</b> along the San Andreas fault accompanied the great 1857 earthquake {{in central and}} southern California. These records, together with dendrochronological evidence, suggest that the rupture occurred along 360 to 400 + km of the fault, including several tens of kilometers of the currently creeping reach in central California. Geomorphic expressions of late Holocene right-lateral offsets are abundant along the 1857 rupture. Along 300 kilometers of the 1857 rupture, between Cholame and Wrightwood, the youngest discernible offset ranges from 3 to 9 1 / 2 meters. Dormancy of the fault since 1857 almost certainly indicates that this latest offset was created in 1857. Fault slip apparently associated with the 1857 earthquake varies in a broadly systematic way along the trace of the fault. It is relatively uniform along each of several long segments, but changes rather abruptly in value between these segments. This nonuniform displacement pattern may imply that some segments of the fault rupture more frequently or experience a slower long-term slip rate than others. The 1857 offsets indicate a seismic moment, m_o, between 5. 3 and 8. 7 × 10 ^(27) dyne-cm, assuming a 10 - to 15 -km depth of rupture and relatively uniform slip {{as a function of}} depth.

40|$|In a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} career, George Plafker has made fundamental advances in understanding of megathrust tectonics, tsunami generation, paleoseismology, crustal neotectonics, and Alaskan geology, all by means of geological field observations. George discovered that giant earthquakes result from tens of <b>meters</b> of seismic <b>slip</b> on subduction thrusts, and he did this before the theory of plate tectonics had become a paradigm. The discovery was founded on George's comprehensive mapping of land-level changes {{in the aftermath of}} the 1964 earthquake in Alaska, and on his similar mapping in the region of the 1960 earthquakes in Chile. The mapping showed paired, parallel belts of coseismic uplift largely offshore and coseismic subsidence mostly onshore [...] a pattern now familiar as the initial condition assumed in computer simulations of subduction-zone tsunamis. George recognized, moreover, that splay faulting can play a major role in tsunami generation, and he also distinguished carefully between tectonic and landslide sources for the multiple tsunamis that accounted for nearly all the fatalities associated with the 1964 Alaska earthquake. George's classic monographs on the 1964 earthquake include findings about subduction-zone paleoseismology that he soon extended to include stratigraphic evidence for cyclic vertical deformation at the Copper River delta, as well as recurrent uplift evidenced by flights of marine terraces at Middleton Island. As a geologist of earthquakes, George also clarified the tectonics and hazards of crustal faulting in Alaska, California, and overseas. All the while, George was mapping bedrock geology in Alaska, where he contributed importantly to today's understanding of of how terranes were accreted and modified...|$|R

It is strongly linked with food security, poverty alleviation, rural {{development as a}} means to achieve bigger goals including employment led economic growth through its linkages and multiplier effects. The agriculture sector, however, faces some crucial and critical challenges. Pakistan population during the last three decades has increased from 65 million to 162 million at present, and is expected to increase to 234 million by 2025, reaching 357 million by 2050. This buildup of massive population momentum will place immense pressure on agriculture resource base calling for substantial increase in food production. Worldwide arable land is already less than 0. 2 ha per capita at present, and is expected to further shrink to 0. 15 in 2050. Situation is extremely alarming in Pakistan, where per capita land availability has progressively declined to 0. 15 ha at present, shrinking further to 0. 06 ha by 2050. Similarly, the per capita water availability has dropped from 5600 cu meters to 1200 cu <b>meters,</b> which could <b>slip</b> further to the water-deficient level i. e. below 1000 cu meters per year by 2010 onwards. Therefore, the potential and the capability to meet growing demands for food in the form of technology adaptability need to be rationally embarked upon with a firm commitment and dedication. The greatest challenge lying ahead is to increase food and fiber production while maintaining the ecosystem stability and rehabilitation of the environment. The problems being arising out of this scenario are to be overcome in such a manner, so that; everyone can be adequately and nutritiously fed without over-exploiting the natural resources. Hydroponics is one such valuable means of growing fresh vegetables and fruits including flowers not only in countries having shrinking land and water resources but also those having large populations.

The EOG developed this project for the "Festival della Scienza", organized in Genoa, Italy, in October - November, 2007, which was a parade of over 200 events, including scientific and technological exhibitions, workshops, meetings, lectures, books and video presentations. In this museum visitors can successively see many posters and movies and play with interactive exhibits. A little 3 D-movie shows the Big Bang, the formation of Solar System and, in particular {{the formation of the}} Earth. Many interactive exhibits illustrate why, where and when earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur around the world and allow to introduce the visitor to the plate tectonics theory. A 3 D magnetic plate tectonic puzzle can be put down and reconstructed by visitors to understand the Earth’s surface configuration. Then two other 3 D Earth models show what drives the plates and the inner Earth structure. An interactive program illustrates where and when earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in accelerated time on maps of various areas around the world. Playing with a block diagram it is possible to produce an earthquake along a 1 <b>meter</b> long strike <b>slip</b> fault in a destroying all the man-made constructions close to it. A little movie introduces to volcanoes’ world. Two small interactive exhibits allow visitors to understand the mechanism for the explosive and the effusive eruptions. Two other exciting interactive exhibits allow visitors to “create” two different eruptions: the explosive and the effusive ones. It is possible to get inside a volcano (a 2 meter high interactive exhibit) to attend an eruption from the magmatic chamber to the Earth surface. A big hall is completed dedicated to Italian volcanoes (Vesuvio, Campi Flegrei, Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano, Colli Albani); some of them are reproduced with 3 D models or described by short movies. The museum finishes with the visit of the volcanic survey hall of Stromboli, seeing - in real time - seismic data, three different webcams, geochemical and strain data.
