40|$|The broad {{involvement}} of miRNAs in critical processes underlying development, tissue homoeostasis and disease {{has led to}} a surging interest among the research and pharmaceutical communities. To study miRNAs, it is essential that the quantification of microRNA levels is accurate and robust. By comparing wild-type to small RNA deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we revealed a lack of accuracy and robustness in previous published multiplex qRT-PCR techniques. Here, we describe an optimized method, including purifying away excessive primers from previous <b>multiplex</b> <b>steps</b> before singleplex real time detection, which dramatically increases the accuracy and robustness of the technique. Furthermore, we explain how performing the technique on a microfluidic chip at nanoliter volumes significantly reduces reagent costs and permits time effective high throughput miRNA expression profiling...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} the verification of nonclassical light which is independent of the complex interaction between the generated light and the material of the detectors. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} multiplexing arrangement. Its theoretical description yields that the coincidence statistics of this measurement layout is a mixture of multinomial distributions for any classical light field and any type of detector. This allows us to formulate bounds on the statistical properties of classical states. We apply our directly accessible method to heralded multiphoton states which are detected with a single <b>multiplexing</b> <b>step</b> only and two detectors, which are in our work superconducting transition-edge sensors. The nonclassicality of the generated light is verified and characterized through the violation of the classical bounds without the need for characterizing the used detectors.

40|$|The {{principle}} of Angular Multiplexing to realise independent communication channels {{in a relatively}} short step-index plastic optical fibre is described. This concept of Mode Group Diversity Multiplexing is based on the principle that the axial angle of light propagating in a step index multimode fibre is preserved over relative short distances. By using an array of lasers each launching light into the fibre at different axial angles and by detecting the light of different angle areas by an array of photo detectors at the receiver side, independent transmission channels are created in a single step index fibre. Moreover, these individual channels will have a higher bandwidth because each channel uses fewer modes. First experiments with 25 m step index plastic fibre with a diameter of 1 mm already show the feasibility of this principle. With Angular Mode Group Diversity <b>Multiplexing</b> in <b>step</b> index plastic fibre high capacity, transparent, lowcost, easy-to-install in-house multimedia networks can be realised...|$|R

A total 600 samples, including cloacal swabs and intestinal samples were collected from chickens, turkeys and ducks in Assiut Governorate in Upper Egypt. Using conventional phenotypic methods for isolation and identification, Arcobacter species could be isolated and identified with percentage 25. 5 % in chickens, 9. 5 % in turkeys and 14 % in ducks.

40|$|Food {{products}}, such as {{milk and}} meat products including cheese, milk powder, fermented milk, sausage, etc. {{are susceptible to}} the contamination by pathogenic and deteriorative bacteria. These bacteria include Listeria monocytogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coil O 157 :H 7, Salmonella spp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas fluorescens, etc. Traditional methods {{for the detection of}} these microorganisms are laborious and time consuming. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. In this study, we designed the DNA probes and PCR primers for the detection of aforementioned microorganisms. By using two sets of multiplex PCR, followed by a chromogenic macroarray system, these organisms in milk or other food products could be simultaneously detected. When the system was used for the inspection of milk or meat homogenate containing 10 (0) target cells per milliliter or gram of the sample, all these bacterial species could be identified after an 8 h pre-enrichment step. The system consisting of a <b>multiplex</b> PCR <b>step</b> followed by macroarray allowed us to detect multiple target bacterial species simultaneously without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared to the commonly used multiplex PCR method, this approach has the additional advantage of detecting more bacterial strains because some bacterial strains generate PCR products with the same molecular sizes which can be differentiated by macroarray but not by electrophoresis.

Overall sensitivity was initially low (70. 0 %) but increased to 96. 7 % when a <b>multiplex</b> PCR preamplification <b>step</b> was added. We then tested stored Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive stained smears prepared from 297 patients' sputum samples. Species identification and drug susceptibility testing (DST) has been performed at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. Overall, the performance of the MTBDRplus assay applied to slide DNA was similar to that obtained in other studies with DNA extracted from clinical specimens. With the ready availability of stained smears in routine diagnostic laboratories, and their easy transport and storage at room temperature, this approach should be useful for optimizing the treatment of MDR-TB and for conducting resistance surveys aimed at identifying hot-spot regions and breaking chains of transmission...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was}} to apply a multiplex PCR targeting serogroups A, B, C 1, D, E and Vi-positive strains of Salmonella enterica commonly found in Malaysia. A separate H-typing multiplex PCR which identified flagellar antigen “a”, “b ” or “d ” was also optimized to confirm clinical serotypes, S. Paratyphi A and S. Typhi. Methodology: Sixty-seven laboratory Salmonella enterica strains were tested. Six sets of primers targeting defined regions of the O antigen synthesis genes (rfb gene cluster) and Vi antigen gene (viaB) were selected and combined into a multiplex PCR for O-grouping. Four primers (H-for, Ha-rev, Hb-rev and Hd-rev) were used in the second <b>step</b> <b>multiplex</b> PCR for H-typing.

We present a High-Power Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexer (HP-DWDM) with an average channel spacing of 1. 7 (1. 5) nm and a subsequent external cavity mirror to provide feedback for frequency stabilization and <b>multiplexing</b> in one <b>step.</b> The "self-optimizing" <b>multiplexing</b> unit consists of four reflective Volume Bragg Gratings (VBGs) with 99 % diffraction efficiency and seven dielectric mirrors to overlay the radiation of five input channels with an adjustable channel spacing of 1 - 2 nm. In detail, {{we focus on the}} analysis of the overall optical efficiency, the change of the beam parameter product and the spectral width. The performance is demonstrated using five 90 μm multimode 9 xx single emitters with M 2 ≤ 17. Because of the feedback the lateral (multimodal) spatial and angular intensity distribution changes strongly and the beam parameter product decreases by a factor of 1. 2 to 1. 9. Thereby the angular intensity distribution is more affected than the width of the beam waist. The spectral width per emitter decreases to 3 - 200 pm (FWHM) depending on the injection current and the reflectance of the feedback mirror (0. 75 %, 1. 5 %, 4 %, 6 % or 8 %). The overall optical multiplexing efficiency ranges between 77 % and 86 %. With some modifications (e. g. enhanced AR-coatings) we expect 90 - 95 %...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Biochemistry) Cholera, {{the highly}} {{epidemic}} diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) infection, continues to devastate many developing countries. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method to identify pathogenic V. cholerae biotypes is imperative. Literature highlighted {{the sensitivity of}} matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and high resolution melt curve analysis (HRM) for this purpose. It is necessary to develop these methods based on the virulence proteins/genes themselves {{in order to be}} future diagnostic tools capable of detecting distinct strains of V. cholerae and to determine their pathogenicity. Such virulence proteins/genes would require significant sequence variation among different strains of V. cholerae. The toxin-coregulated pilus protein A (TcpA) is a key player in V. cholerae infection and displays significant sequence variation at both the genetic and protein level. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} the variation in the TcpA/tcpA protein and gene, respectively, can be used to differentiate between V. cholerae biotypes by using MALDI-TOF MS and/or HRM methods. The objectives were first to investigate established methods for the rapid isolation of surface proteins that would yield a high enough concentration of whole pili or TcpA subunits for future MS biotyping techniques. Two methods were evaluated: a) pili isolation by mechanical shearing b) crude extraction of the outer membrane proteins and associated surface proteins. Secondly, HRM-compatible oligonucleotides were designed for specific amplification of the variable regions within the tcpA gene in V. cholerae. The efficacy of these oligonucleotides was tested on V. cholerae reference strains and environmental isolates. Lastly, a current standard procedure for V. cholerae typing was evaluated. Pili were successfully isolated from bacterial cell colonies, but large quantities of starting material were required and much of the cell content was isolated with the pili. Alternative isolation and enrichment methods have been proposed and may prove promising for future MALDI-TOF MS biotyping. The current standard procedure for V. cholerae typing with multiplex PCR revealed some discrepancies between the <b>multiplex</b> PCR <b>steps.</b> Therefore, the current multiplex PCR procedure may result in inaccuracies during typing. The designed HRM-compatible oligonucleotide set designated Contig 1 successfully amplified a 101 bp region within the tcpA gene in Vibrios. This Contig 1 oligonucleotide set could possibly be used in future studies to differentiate between Vibrio species with HRM. Further studies would be needed for the development of MALDI-TOF/MS or HRM as future rapid and specific environmental monitoring systems based on the TcpA/tcpA protein or gene, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Detection of {{respiratory}} viruses in veterinary species has traditionally relied on virus detection by isolation or immunofluorescence and/or detection of circulating antibody using ELISA or serum neutralising antibody tests. Multiplex real time PCR is increasingly used to diagnose respiratory viruses in humans and {{has proved to}} be superior to traditional methods. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) {{is one of the most}} common causes of morbidity and mortality in housed cattle and virus infections can play a major role. We describe here a one <b>step</b> <b>multiplex</b> reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (mRT-qPCR) to detect the viruses commonly implicated in BRD. Results A mRT-qPCR assay was developed and optimised for the simultaneous detection of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV- 1) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPI 3 i & ii) nucleic acids in clinical samples from cattle. The assay targets the highly conserved glycoprotein B gene of BoHV- 1, nucleocapsid gene of BRSV and nucleoprotein gene of BPI 3. This mRT-qPCR assay was assessed for sensitivity, specificity and repeatability using in vitro transcribed RNA and recent field isolates. For clinical validation, 541 samples from clinically affected animals were tested and mRT-qPCR result compared to those obtained by conventional testing using virus isolation (VI) and/or indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Conclusions The mRT-qPCR assay was rapid, highly repeatable, specific and had a sensitivity of 97 % in detecting 10 2 copies of BRSV, BoHV- 1 and BPI 3 i & ii. This is the first mRT-qPCR developed to detect the three primary viral agents of BRD and the first multiplex designed using locked nucleic acid (LNA), minor groove binding (MGB) and TaqMan probes in one reaction mix. This test was more sensitive than both VI and IFAT and can replace the aforesaid methods for virus detection during outbreaks of BRD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{serotype}} epidemiology {{is essential}} since serotype replacement {{is a concern}} when introducing new polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines. A novel PCR-based automated microarray assay was developed {{to assist in the}} tracking of the serotypes. Autolysin, pneumolysin and eight genes located in the capsular operon were amplified using <b>multiplex</b> PCR. This <b>step</b> was followed by a tagged fluorescent primer extension step targeting serotype-specific polymorphisms. The tagged primers were then hybridized to a microarray. Results were exported to an expert system to identify capsular serotypes. The assay was validated on 166 cultured S. pneumoniae samples from 63 different serotypes as determined by the Quellung method. We show that typing only 12 polymorphisms located in the capsular operon allows the identification at the serotype level of 22 serotypes and the assignation of 24 other serotypes to a subgroup of serotypes. Overall, 126 samples (75. 9 %) were correctly serotyped, 14 were assigned to a member of the same serogroup, 8 rare serotypes were erroneously serotyped, and 18 gave negative serotyping results. Most of the discrepancies involved rare serotypes or serotypes that are difficult to discriminate using a DNA-based approach, for example 6 A and 6 B. The assay was also tested on clinical specimens including 43 cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with meningitis and 59 nasopharyngeal aspirates from bacterial pneumonia patients. Overall, 89 % of specimens positive for pneumolysin were serotyped, demonstrating that this method does not require culture to serotype clinical specimens. The assay showed no cross-reactivity for 24 relevant bacterial species found in these types of samples. The limit of detection for serotyping and S. pneumoniae detection was 100 genome equivalent per reaction. This automated assay is amenable to clinical testing and does not require any culturing of the samples. The assay will be useful for the evaluation of serotype prevalence changes after new conjugate vaccines introduction...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a complete, comprehensive and stepwise approach of translational molecular research. Starting from whole-genome bioinformatics analyses {{based on the}} embryonic stem (ES) cell hypothesis, a three-gene signature was identified, validated {{with the goal of}} clinical application in order to optimize treatment decision based on improvement of overall survival estimation. In Paper I, we hypothesized that gene signatures of embryonic stem (ES) cells may have prominent importance to determine the tumor subtypes and may be associated with the prognosis of various cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). Using published microarray datasets, 641 embryonic stem cell gene predictors (ESCGPs) were identified. Using gene expression patterns of these 641 ESCGPs tumor subtypes of different cancers can be stratified, particularly for prostate cancer. We further analyzed the gene expression levels of selected ESCGP genes in fresh-frozen fine needle aspiration biopsy samples taken from a Swedish cohort of 189 prostate cancer patients. The registry follow-up period for these patients was up to 18 years, where 97. 9 % patients had overall and cancer-specific survival data. As a result, a three-gene signature (VGLL 3, IGFBP 3 and F 3) was identified sufficient to categorize the patients into high-risk, intermediate-risk and low-risk subtypes directly correlated with the overall and cancer-specific survival. Currently, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostate core needle biopsy material is the most common sample material available in clinical practice, on which Gleason grading for prostate cancer diagnosis is usually conducted. Since each patient typically has multiple biopsy samples, and since Gleason grading is an operator dependent procedure known to be difficult, the impact of the operator’s choice of biopsy was evaluated in paper II. We analyzed expression levels of the three-gene signature identified in paper I, using a four <b>multiplex</b> one- <b>step</b> RT-qPCR kit specially designed and optimized for measuring the three-gene expression signature in 127 FFPE prostate core needle biopsy samples taken from 43 patients. Our results show that the assessment of expression levels of two highly expressed genes (IGFBP 3 and F 3) in prostate cancer tissue is independent of Gleason patterns. These findings indicate that the impact of operator’s choice of biopsy is low. In paper III, we carried out a new cohort study including 241 prostate cancer patients with 6 - 9 years of registry follow up in order to verify the prognostic value of the three-gene expression signature in FFPE prostate core needle biopsy tissue samples. The cohort consisted of four patient groups with different survival times and cause of death (COD). We observed that supplementing readily available clinical data with gene expression levels of IGFBP 3 and F 3 in FFPE PCa biopsy tissues could improve survival prediction for PCa patients at time of diagnosis. Based on the above work, a so-called Prostatype test system has been industrially designed and developed for clinical application. It integrates a robust multiplex RT-qPCR kit to measure expression levels of the three-gene signature and, a database of reference patients with accurate clinical documentation using a kNN-algorithm called CPMA (Classification of Prostatic Malignancy Algorithm). The survival prediction in relation to different treatment modalities can greatly assist both clinicians and patients to make an individualized treatment decision...|$|R
