40|$|Izmir {{is a large}} {{metropolitan}} city {{with a population of}} 3, 114, 860. The city consists of 27 townships, each township has a population of not less than 10, 000 inhabitants. The two major solid waste disposal sites are in the townships of Uzundere and Harmandali. The amount of solid waste that is disposed at each of these sites is about 800 and 1800 t/day, respectively. In Uzundere, compost is produced from the organic fraction of urban solid wastes while the residual material is deposited at a disposal site with a remaining capacity of 700, 000 m 3 as of 2001. Gas <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurements</b> were carried out at the disposal site in Uzundere. For this purpose, nine sampling wells were drilled on selected locations. Each well was furnished with perforated metal pipes suitable for gas <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>measurements.</b> The following gases were monitored: O 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2, and H 2 S. The most important finding was that the concentrations of CH 4 in the wells ranged from 7 to 57 %.
