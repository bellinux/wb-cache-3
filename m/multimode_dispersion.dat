50|$|Modal {{dispersion}} is a distortion mechanism {{occurring in}} multimode fibers and other waveguides, {{in which the}} signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal {{is not the same}} for all modes. Other names for this phenomenon include multimode distortion, <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion,</b> modal distortion, intermodal distortion, intermodal dispersion, and intermodal delay distortion.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion</b> measurement {{has been developed}} by employing fully non-linear waveform inversion for a path-specific 1 -D profile using a neighbourhood algorithm (NA). One-dimensional models derived from waveform inversion are quite sensitive to the model parametrization and the reference model used to start the inversion. With different approaches to the parametrization of the shear wave speed profile, we can find models with significant differences in velocity variation with depth, which provide similar levels of fit to the observed waveforms. Although the models differ, the calculated phase dispersion {{for the first few}} modes of the surface waves are very close indeed. We therefore regard the 1 -D models derived from the multimode waveform inversion as an implicit description of the path-specific dispersion for each of the modes. The inversion procedure using NA samples a substantial number of models and we select the 1 -D wave speed model that achieves minimum misfit. Phase speeds for each mode branch are then calculated from the model parameters with the minimum misfit. Because we use the 1 -D models as a summary of the average <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion</b> along the path, we do not need to make assumptions concerning the nature of anisotropy. We can employ simple isotropic models and the method can be applied to both Rayleigh and Love waves independently. The new method is applied to sets of paths in the Australian region and provides stable measurements of <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion</b> from a single seismogram. The multimode phase speeds measured using the NA inversion can be used to retrieve phase velocity maps as a function of frequency for higher-mode branches as well as the fundamental mode, which will be crucial constraints on 3 -D Earth models...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that ultrabroadband ultrashort-pulse white light supercontinua {{can be used}} to track the group velocity of photons in optical waveguides using a Kerr gate technique. Results on silicon nitride slab waveguides show both polarization birefringence and <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion,</b> which vanish at critical wavelengths. When photonic crystals are embedded in the waveguides, the higher order modes are excited within the band-gap region, demonstrating the need to control their dispersion to make effective use of photonic crystal waveguide devices...|$|E
40|$|A three-stage {{inversion}} {{scheme for}} surface wave tomography working with <b>multimode</b> phase <b>dispersion</b> {{as a function}} of frequency provides a means of combining a wide range of data in a common framework. The phase average approximation is applied directly to phase slowness and {{there is no need to}} invoke perturbation arguments for the interpretation of path-averaged velocity models derived from waveform inversion of surface waves. By treating such wave speed profiles as summaries of path specific dispersion behaviour it is possible not only to combine results from different style of inversion but also to provide maximum exploitation of Love and Rayleigh wave information. Inversions of all suitable waveforms can be undertaken in terms of isotropic models. Dispersion information from all paths is combined to form multimode phase speed distributions {{as a function of}} frequency in linearized inversion which takes account of path bending and finite frequency effects. The final inversion for 3 -D wave speed structure is based on a cellular inversion of the <b>multimode</b> frequency <b>dispersion</b> including angular effects in terms of a local stratified model including anisotropy. The smoothing from inclusion of finite frequency effects and damping of the linearized inversion for the phase speed distributions will control the smoothness of the 3 -D shear wave speed model...|$|R

40|$|Obtaining temporal/spatial {{resolution}} in guided wave measurements {{comparable to that}} of bulk wave measurements is impeded by the complicating effects of <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Transport of signals by multiple dispersive modes of propagation can transform an initially compact transient into an extended, visually unintelligible wavetrain. Guided mode inspections therefore tend to restrict measurements to regimes for which a single mode can be generated with minimal dispersion, consequently restricting the achievable temporal/spatial resolution of the measurement. The objective of the work reported here is to remove such restrictions, through implementation of wavefield measurements which accommodate the total complexity of multimode dispersed signals. Temporal and spatial Fourier analysis of guided wave fields enables a full identification of individual mode contributions. It is therefore conceivable that, given measurements taken over an appropriate spatial array, processing could be implemented to effectively remove the effects of <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion,</b> enabling operation in frequency regimes currently associated with bulk wave measurements. This paper will report on work which is exploring this possibility. Results will be presented demonstrating array-based MHz regime plate wave measurements, generating 10 or more modes, in which individual modes are isolated, effects of dispersion are removed, and temporal resolution of the original transmitted pulse is restored. Examples of application will be presented, and factors determining the effectiveness of temporal resolution restoration will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome {{pioneering}} {{studies have}} shown the clinical feasibility of long bones evaluation using ultrasonic guided waves. Such a strategy is typically designed to determine the dispersion information of the guided modes to infer the elastic and structural characteristics of cortical bone. However, {{there are still some}} challenges to extract <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion</b> curves due to many practical limitations, e. g., high spectral density of modes, limited spectral resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. Recently, two representative signal processing methods have been proposed to improve the dispersion curves extraction. The first method is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) with advantages of multi-emitter and multi-receiver configuration for enhanced mode extraction; the second one uses linear Radon transform (LRT) with high-resolution imaging of the dispersion curves. To clarify the pros and cons, a face to face comparison was performed between the two methods. The results suggest that the LRT method is suitable to separate the guided modes at low frequency-thickness-product (fh) range; for multimode signals in broadband fh range, the SVD-based method shows more robust performances for weak mode enhancement and noise filtering. Different methods are valuable to cover the entire fh range for processing ultrasonic axial transmission signals measured in long cortical bones...|$|E
40|$|Guided {{ultrasonic}} waves {{provide a}} highly efficient method for the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and the structural health monitoring (SHM) of solids with finite cross-sectional dimensions (waveguides). Compared to the widely used ultrasonic bulk waves, guided waves provide larger monitoring ranges and the complete {{coverage of the}} waveguide cross-section. Compared to global vibrations, guided waves offer increased sensitivity to smaller defects due to the smaller wavelengths involved. These advantages can be fully exploited only once the complexities of guided wave propagation (<b>multimode,</b> <b>dispersion,</b> frequency-dependent attenuation) are unveiled and managed for the given test structure. This doctoral dissertation is aimed at developing a Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method for modeling wave propagation in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. The method requires the finite element discretization of the cross- section of the waveguide, and assumes harmonic motion along the wave propagation direction. The general SAFE technique was extended to account for viscoelastic material damping by allowing for complex stiffness matrices for the material. The dispersive solutions are obtained in terms of phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped media), energy velocity (for damped media), attenuation, and cross-sectional mode shapes. Once the dispersive properties are computed, the wave motion can be interpreted and the forced response can be predicted. The proposed SAFE formulation was applied to enhance the use of ultrasonic guided waves {{in a number of}} applications and to interpret the corresponding experimental results. The following three applications were considered : defect detection in adhesively-bonded joints found in the wing skin-to-spar assemblies of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; defect detection in railroad tracks; load monitoring and defect detection in seven-wire steel strands used in cables and prestressed concrete structure...|$|E
40|$|Laser beam {{deflection}} {{in combination with}} optical heterodyne diffraction is used to detect surface acoustic waves that are generated by impulsive laser light on a Sn-CuxSny-Cu-Si multilayer structure with layer thicknesses {{of the order of}} 1 mu m. The acoustic phase velocity dispersion curves of the lowest two-surface acoustic wave modes are determined by spectral analysis of the experimental signals. The sensitivity of the dispersive behavior to the thickness and elastic properties of the individual layers is analyzed {{on the basis of the}} experimental data and of simulated data with noise added. The elastic parameters of the CuxSny intermetallic alloy are determined. Statistical least squares and most squares uncertainties on all best fitting material parameters are determined, giving a quantitative measure of the feasibility of parameter extraction by this method.

40|$|Abstract—Multimode fibers (MMF) are {{generally}} used in short and medium haul optical networks {{owing to the}} availability of low cost devices and inexpensive packaging solutions. However, the performance of conventional multimode fibers is limited primarily {{by the presence of}} high modal dispersion owing to large core diameters. While electronic dispersion compensation methods improve the bandwidth-distance product of MMFs, they do not utilize the fundamental diversity present in the different modes of the multimode fiber. In this paper, we draw from developments in wireless communication theory and signal processing to motivate the use of vector intensity modulation and signal processing to enable high-data rates over MMFs. Further, we discuss the implementation of a closed-loop system with limited channel state feedback to enable the use of precoding at the transmitter, and show that this technique enhances the performance in a 10 Gb/s MMF link, consisting of 3 km of conventional multimode fiber. Experimental results indicate that vector intensity modulation and direct detection with with two modulators and detectors, along with the use of limited feedback results in a 50 % increase over the single laser and detector case.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of shallow seismic shear wave velocity profiling, we propose a minimally invasive hybrid surface-and-borehole method that enhances the detection of higher modes of Rayleigh wave dispersion data. The new method combines techniques from the multichannel analysis of surface waves and multichannel simulation with one receiver (MSOR) methods to record components of Rayleigh wave motion at the surface {{as well as at}} shallow depths within the soil mass. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through computational and experimental studies. We show that individual modes of Rayleigh waves can exhibit different dominant depths at which their motion is most significant. This is demonstrated through a numerical study of eigenvectors of layered soil profiles via the stiffness matrix method, and confirmed by a finite element simulation of the apparent dispersion trends recorded at shallow depths using MSOR. Upon superimposing dispersion data recorded via the receivers at various depths, the resulting <b>multimode</b> <b>dispersion</b> data is used in a multi-objective inverse analysis, for which the difference between experimental and theoretical dispersive phase-velocity spectra are minimized for multiple modes simultaneously. In the numerical study, we demonstrate that the resulting inverted profiles and theoretical dispersion data have improved accuracy relative to single-mode inversion. Preliminary field tests are performed using the new hybrid method, and the results are shown to support the conclusions of the numerical study and confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique. Although the use of multiple modes in surface wave testing is not new, the proposed hybrid method can provide more accurate and complete multimodal dispersion data than achieved with surface-only Rayleigh wave methods. As a result, errors because of misidentification or partial measurement of higher modes may be minimized, thus reducing statistical uncertainty in the inverted profiles...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Earlier {{work on the}} {{interpretation}} of Sa for continental structures is completed by including theoretical seismograms in {{the interpretation}}, along with <b>multimode</b> Love wave <b>dispersion,</b> attenuation and source excitation. Further, it is demonstrated that Sa is not a low-velocity zone channel wave by generating theoretical seismograms, which include this phase, with a structure containing no low-velocity zone. Sa is a seismic phase {{which seems to be}} influenced primarily by the abrupt velocity increase at a depth in the 400 - 450 -km region. This interpretation is evaluated by computing eigen-functions, group velocities, and source excitations for a model with a single layer over a high velocity region; the results compare favourably with those for the realistic model of the Earth...|$|R

Specifically, the multimode longitudinal ultrasonic guided waves are excited in terms of characteristics of radical distribution of the normalized average energy flow density (NAPFD) in a wire. Furthermore, the complex defect scattered signals are difficult to interpret, which are attributed to <b>multimode,</b> multipath and <b>dispersion,</b> but are considered to enhance the focused energy through the TRM while the different depths of defect are explicitly identified by the normalized amplitudes of reconstructed wave packets. Finally, {{in contrast to the}} traditional monitoring approach relying on the amplitude of defect echo, the proposed method in this study is demonstrated to have a higher sensitivity to recognize the progressive increase of corrosion depth...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} predict modal noise in short {{distance}} (30 m), high temporal bandwidth (hundreds of MHz) multimode optical links is proposed. In order to accommodate low cost, mechanical alignment, the link medium is modified from {{single mode fiber}} (used routinely in telecommunication systems) to <b>multimode</b> fiber. Modal <b>dispersion</b> in <b>multimode</b> fiber calls for a reduction in link length to preserve a relatively high temporal bandwidth. The source is a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), which is well suited for the high packaging density, high temporal bandwidth, and low power dissipation requirements of short distance optical communication systems. Coherence properties of several different types of VCSELs are experimentally examined with constant and modulated injection current with a bandwidth typical of that used in data communications systems. A fluctuation in the spatial irradiance output pattern of the VCSEL is identified as the dynamic component responsible for significant modal noise effects. The effect of finite system coherence length {{has been applied to}} the simulation process. The reduction in output fiber face speckle contrast, due to a broader source power spectrum and/or due to fiber modal dispersion with increasing fiber length, mitigates the effect of modal noise in the transmission link...|$|R
30|$|Intermodal {{dispersion}} (also called modal dispersion) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that the group}} velocity of light propagating in a multimode fiber (or other waveguide) depends {{not only on the}} optical frequency (chromatic dispersion) but also on the propagation mode involved. The strength of intermodal dispersion can be quantified as the differential mode delay (DMD). It depends strongly on the refractive index profile of the fiber in and around the fiber core. For example, for a step-index profile the higher-order modes have lower group velocities, and this can lead to differential group delays of the order of 10 ps/m = 10 ns/km. It is then hardly possible to realize data rates of multiple Gbit/s in an fiber-optic link with a kilometer length. In systems for optical fiber communications based on <b>multimode</b> fibers, intermodal <b>dispersion</b> can severely limit the achievable data transmission rate (bit rate). In order to avoid strong signal distortion, it is usually necessary to keep the pulses long enough to maintain a reasonable temporal overlap of components from different modes, and this unavoidably sets a limit on the data rate. The natural way of eliminating intermodal dispersion is to use fiber links based on single-mode fibers, but intermodal dispersion can also be minimized by using multimode fibers with a parabolic refractive index profile, where intermodal dispersion is minimized. In case of graded index fiber, critical angle condition is satisfied at different distances from the axis of the core for different modes as refractive index is decreasing from the axis up to core cladding interface. The wave which is internally reflected near axis travel less distance but will also have low velocity due to higher refractive index. On the other hand, wave reflected near the interface will travel more distance but with higher velocity due to smaller refractive index. Hence, the time to reach the other end will be same for these waves which means no intermodal dispersion.|$|R
