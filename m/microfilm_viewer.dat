500|$|Vannevar Bush ( [...] March 11, 1890â€“ June 28, 1974) was an American engineer, {{inventor}} {{and science}} administrator, who during World War II headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), through which almost all wartime military R was carried out, including initiation and early {{administration of the}} Manhattan Project. He is also known in engineering {{for his work on}} analog computers, for founding Raytheon, and for the memex, a hypothetical adjustable <b>microfilm</b> <b>viewer</b> with a structure analogous to that of hypertext. In 1945, Bush published the essay [...] "As We May Think" [...] in which he predicted that [...] "wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified". The memex influenced generations of computer scientists, who drew inspiration from its vision of the future. [...] He was chiefly responsible for the movement that {{led to the creation of}} the National Science Foundation.|$|E
50|$|The {{library was}} built in 1907 with funds donated by the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The library has been modernised, with a new <b>microfilm</b> <b>viewer,</b> and reels of the Batley News dating back over 120 years. The {{newspaper}} was founded by James Fearnsides - a local printer. His grandson Clement, later became the mayor of Batley. There was coal mining in Batley at this time. The first records of coal mining in Batley {{date back to the}} 16th century at White Lee; the last pit in the town closed in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Among the 35 small, {{everyday}} items placed inside Time Capsule I were {{a fountain}} pen and an alphabet block set. Time Capsule I also contained 75 types of fabrics, metals, and plastics. Modern literature, contemporary art, and news {{events of the}} twentieth century were recorded on a microfilm [...] "Micro-File" [...] for placement in Time Capsule I; the [...] "Micro-File" [...] holds over ten million words and a thousand pictures, and has a small microscope for viewing. There are also instructions included on how to make both a large <b>microfilm</b> <b>viewer</b> and a motion picture projector for the newsreels.|$|E
50|$|In 1857 John Benjamin Dancer's microfilms were {{exhibited}} in Paris {{for the first}} time and Dagron immediately saw their potential. He used the concept of microphotography to produce simple <b>microfilm</b> <b>viewers</b> which he would later manufacture and incorporate into novelties and souvenir products as well as other applications. Soon after that, Dagron encountered problems with imitators and people infringing on his patents.|$|R
40|$|Two {{new designs}} for <b>microfilm</b> <b>viewers</b> are described. Both viewers are front {{projection}} viewers utilizing matte surface display screens. One viewer with an adjustable horizontal screen has a normal magnification rate and {{is mounted on}} a desk top. The other viewer has a high (4 x) magnification rate in a mini-theater configuration with remote microfiche positioning controls. The matte surface screen {{is believed to be}} an improvement over conventional screens. Both viewers utilize conventional projection optics to maintain image contrast in controlled lighting environments. Interference between the user and the projected light is virtually eliminated by oblique projection achieved by simple, practical techniques. A survey of users shows a marked preference for the mini-theater viewer over conventional near projection viewers. Two control modes for positioning microfiche were developed for the mini-theater viewer: a velLcity-control system and a position-contro...|$|R
5000|$|A microfilmer is {{a machine}} {{used by the}} {{document}} management industry to create microfilm. These machines are also often called [...] "imagers" [...] in the industry. A microfilmer is a camera {{that is used to}} photograph documents to create a more compact and permanent record of the original in the form of roll-film or microfiche. Once the information contained on a paper document has been recorded onto microfilm, the information can be viewed later on a <b>microfilm</b> reader or <b>viewer,</b> or reproduced in paper form on a microfilm reader-printer.|$|R
