Flight Lieutenant George Stainforth flew it over a <b>measured</b> <b>mile</b> course for a top speed of 351.3mph and a ratified world absolute speed record, averaged over four runs of 336.3mph. This record was held only briefly, as a later run by Squadron Leader Augustus Orlebar in the S.6 managed to raise it over 350mph. During the final Schneider Trophy in 1931, the Gloster VI was still in service with the High Speed Flight as a trainer.|$|E
25|$|The {{builders}} {{had tested}} the hull form {{in their own}} tank, and hoped to attain a speed of 20 knots (37.04km/h) with the turbine machinery. On 14 June the first steam trial was supervised personally by C. A. Parsons and John Williamson, then on 17 June during manoeuvring trials in calm weather the mean speed of two runs over the <b>measured</b> <b>mile</b> at Skelmorlie was 18.66 knots (34.56km/h). After full hull cleaning at Scott's of Greenock a further series of trials took place on 24 June: in seven return runs over the mile, the best mean speed attained was 19.7 knots (36.48km/h). On {{the next day at}} the Pointhouse yard of A. & J. Inglis the central propeller of 4ft (1.22 m) diameter was exchanged for one of 4ft 9inches (1.45 m) diameter, and the outer propellers of 2ft 10inches (0.86 m) diameter were exchanged for propellers 3ft 4inches (1.02 m) diameter. Trials on 26 June with smooth sea conditions and a light breeze achieved a mean of 20.48 knots (37.93km/h) and a fastest single run at 20.57 knots (38.1km/h). At the official trial on 28 June, invited guests came aboard off Craigendoran, and the ship then sailed to Campbeltown with intermediate visits to Dunoon, Rothesay, Largs, Fairlie and Lochranza, where Duchess of Hamilton waited with a special party of members of the Institute of Naval Architects. The two ships raced down Kilbrannan Sound and King Edward passed the paddle steamer without difficulty. A dinner in the after saloon was presided over by Peter Denny, who with other speakers commented on the speed and smoothness of the turbine steamer, in contrast to the rhythmic surging motion and vibration associated with all paddle steamers.|$|E
