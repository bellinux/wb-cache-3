60|$|At last {{there came}} a day when a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>cipher</b> from Roland Clewe {{delivered}} itself on board the Dipsey, and from that moment a hitherto unknown sense of security seemed to pervade the minds of officers and crew. To be sure, there was no good reason for this, for if disaster should overtake them, or even threaten them, there was no submarine boat ready to send to their rescue; and if there had been, it would be long, long before such aid could reach them; but still, they were comforted, encouraged, and cheered. Now, if anything happened, they could send news {{of it to the}} man in whom they all trusted, and through him to their homes, and whatever their far-away friends had to say to them could be said without reserve.|$|E

[...] He was surprised while eating, and overcome by four menJacob Fulmer, John Cory, James Cory, and Francis Perkinsand taken prisoner. He was given permission to smoke, but while getting his tobacco was observed to throw an object into the fire. This was retrieved and {{turned out to be a}} small lead box containing a paper with a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>cipher.</b> Later, this was determined to be a message to the British commander in New York. Bettys offered 100 guineas to be allowed to burn the message, and also offered money for his release, but his offers were refused. He was sent to Albany, where he was tried, found guilty as a spy and traitor, and executed that year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In cryptography, {{confusion}} and diffusion {{are very important}} to get confidentiality and privacy of <b>message</b> <b>in</b> block <b>ciphers</b> and stream ciphers. There are two types of network to provide {{confusion and}} diffusion properties of <b>message</b> <b>in</b> block <b>ciphers.</b> They are Substitution- Permutation network (S-P network), and Feistel network. NLFS (Non-Linear feedback stream cipher) is a fast and secure stream cipher for software application. NLFS have two modes basic mode that is synchronous mode and self synchronous mode. Real random numbers are non-deterministic. R-box (random box) based on the dynamic properties and it performs the stochastic transformation of data that can be used effectively meet the challenges of information is protected from international destructive impacts. In this paper, a new implementation of stochastic transformation will be proposed. Keywords—S-P network, Feistel network, R-block, stochastic transformatio...|$|R

50|$|In 1890, Louis Gendron, a French {{military}} historian, {{came across}} some coded letters and passed {{them on to}} Etienne Bazeries in the French Army's cryptographic department. After three years Bazeries managed to read some <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> the Great <b>Cipher</b> of Louis XIV. One of them referred to a prisoner and identified him as General Vivien de Bulonde. One of the letters written by Louvois made specific reference to de Bulonde's crime.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of the digital devices, computers and networks, our world relies more and more on the digital data. In many cases, storing data safely is a very big concern. These data have to be protected so as to prevent the possible unauthorized access. Many technologies have been used to improve the security of the data storage. Encryption is a process of coding information which could either be a file or mail <b>message</b> <b>in</b> into <b>cipher</b> text a form unreadable without a decoding key in order to prevent anyone except the intended recipient from reading that data. Decryption is the exactly opposite process of converting encoded data to its original un-encoded form which is nothing but plaintext. Here we are introducing some encryption algorithms...|$|R

The <b>message</b> was <b>in</b> <b>cipher,</b> and, the signs being interpreted, it ran thus: [...] "From Lydia Gwilt to Maria Oldershaw.--Good news! He is coming back. I mean to have an interview with him. Everything looks well. Now I have left the cottage, I have no women's prying eyes to dread, and I can come and go as I please. Mr. Midwinter is luckily out of the way. I don't despair of becoming Mrs. Armadale yet.

60|$|Mr. Warner, who was {{the partner}} of Mr. Worlington Dodds, and who was {{suffering}} from the same eclipse, had gone down to the Stock Exchange, but had found little consolation there, for the European system was in a ferment, and rumours of peace and of war were succeeding each other with such rapidity and assurance {{that it was impossible}} to know which to trust. It was obvious that a fortune lay either way, for every rumour set the funds fluctuating; but without special information it was impossible to act, and no one dared to plunge heavily upon the strength of newspaper surmise and the gossip of the street. Warner knew that an hour's work might resuscitate the fallen fortunes of himself and his partner, and yet he could not afford to make a mistake. He returned to his office in the afternoon, half inclined to back the chances of peace, for of all war scares not one in ten comes to pass. As he entered the office a telegram lay upon the table. It was from Dunsloe, a place of which he had never heard, and was signed by his absent partner. The <b>message</b> was <b>in</b> <b>cipher,</b> but he soon translated it, for it was short and crisp.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the ease}} of {{detectability}} of an acrostic can depend on the intention of its creator. In some cases an author may desire an acrostic {{to have a better}} chance of being perceived by an observant reader, such as the acrostic contained in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (where the key capital letters are decorated with ornate embellishments). However, acrostics may also be used as a form of steganography, where the author seeks to conceal the message rather than proclaim it. This might be achieved by making the key letters uniform in appearance with the surrounding text, or by aligning the words in such a way that the relationship between the key letters is less obvious. This is referred to as null <b>ciphers</b> <b>in</b> steganography, using the first letter of each word to form a hidden <b>message</b> <b>in</b> an otherwise innocuous text. Using letters to hide a <b>message,</b> as <b>in</b> acrostic <b>ciphers,</b> was popular during the Renaissance, and could employ various methods of enciphering, such as selecting other letters than initials based on a repeating pattern (equidistant letter sequences), or even concealing the message by starting at the end of the text and working backwards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first half}} of 1942 was the [...] "Second Happy Time" [...] for the German U-boats, with renewed success in attacking Allied shipping. This {{was due to the}} {{security}} of the new Enigma, and their ability to read Allied convoy <b>messages</b> sent <b>in</b> Naval <b>Cipher</b> No. 3. Between January and March 1942, German submarines sank 216 ships off the US east coast. In May 1942 the US began using the convoy system and requiring a blackout of coastal cities so that ships would not be silhouetted against their lights, but this yielded only slightly improved security for Allied shipping. The Allies' failure to change the cipher for three months plus the fact that Allied messages never contained any raw Enigma decrypts (or even mentioned that they were decrypting messages), helped convince the Germans that their messages were secure. Conversely, the Allies learned that the Germans had broken the naval cipher almost immediately from Enigma decrypts, but lost many ships due to the delay <b>in</b> changing the <b>cipher.</b>|$|R

40|$|Current {{needs of}} human {{communication}} came to status, {{when most of}} transferred messages are considered as private and transition over non-secured communication lines in open form is not possible. That originated {{a lot of different}} methods for securing of <b>messages</b> and transfers <b>in</b> <b>ciphered</b> form. Two mainstreams were established, symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography. Second of mentioned groups is based on usage of two information – keys, when one of then is broadly known and is public and second, well protected and private. Using a public key it is possible to establish a cryptogram of message, but for deciphering it is necessary to know private key. Asymmetric methods are based on mathematical problems, for which there is not an effective computing algorithm. This thesis are focused for asymmetric cryptosystems based on discrete logarithm problem, where ciphering of message using public key is very easy and quick, but deciphering without knowledge of private key is extremely time consuming process. Work describes a mathematical base of discrete logarithm problem, its’ properties and methods developed for solving of this problem. Descriptions of particular cryptosystems are given, i. e. ElGamal cryptosystem, Diffie-Hellman protocol and DSA. Second part of thesis is focused for web application developed as study support of discrete logarithm problem and of cryptosystems using this problem. It describes functional and graphical interface, work with it and options given to user working with application. Mentions also lessons for user which should help with understanding of described problems and practicing...|$|R
