5|$|The Western Allies {{were divided}} in {{their vision of}} the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals – {{military}} victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, {{and the creation of}} a world peace organization – were <b>more</b> <b>global</b> than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of Iraq had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on the one side}} and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, one about the military contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a <b>more</b> <b>global</b> role.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a <b>more</b> <b>global</b> perspective on the double burden.|$|E

5|$|<b>More</b> <b>global</b> {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
25|$|According to Piaget, {{children}} use {{the process}} of assimilation and accommodation to create a schema or mental framework for how they perceive and/or interpret what they are experiencing.

25|$|However, {{there is}} {{considerable}} debate regarding the particular configuration of the global network of influenza, with one hypothesis suggesting a metapopulation in East and Southeast Asia that continually seeds influenza {{in the rest of}} the world, and another hypothesis advocating a <b>more</b> <b>global</b> metapopulation in which temperate lineages often return to the tropics at the end of a seasonal epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Flexibility. Poor mental flexibility, as {{demonstrated}} in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some {{research has suggested that}} individuals with autism experience a sort of ‘stuck-in-set’ perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a <b>more</b> <b>global</b> perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{determination}} of cross-dressing is largely socially constructed.

In cultures where men have traditionally worn skirt-like garments such as the kilt or sarong, these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming <b>more</b> <b>global</b> in nature, both men's and women's clothing are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.|$|E

Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.|$|E
