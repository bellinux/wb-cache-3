50|$|Other {{problems}} include (for example) {{issues with}} the quality of data, consistent classification and identification of data, and data-reconciliation issues. <b>Master</b> <b>data</b> management of disparate data systems requires data transformations as the data extracted from the disparate source data system is transformed and loaded into the <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management hub. To synchronize the disparate source <b>master</b> <b>data,</b> the managed <b>master</b> <b>data</b> extracted from the <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management hub is again transformed and loaded into the disparate source data system as the <b>master</b> <b>data</b> is updated.

40|$|Abstract—In recent past, {{there seems}} to have an {{increased}} demand for improvements in current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions. One potential area is enhancing existing <b>master</b> and transaction <b>data</b> models in ERP. This paper presents an integrated approach to represent both <b>master</b> and transaction <b>data,</b> which in turn helps improving applications within ERP system environment. <b>Master</b> and transaction <b>data</b> are modeled using unitary structures, integrating individual data elements and structures and associated functions. Functional tasks of transaction data are incorporated at structural level for improved planning and scheduling of components, such as component allocation and goods receipt processes in the production order cycle. Further, enhancement of <b>master</b> and transaction <b>data</b> can allow for forward planning of many components involved in various functional applications in ERP. Thus, potential improvements include simultaneous planning of many components (materials, resources, operations and project activities), forward planning across many applications and finite loading of resources as part of overall planning. The implementation of unitary structures in an ERP system {{can be carried out}} using additional links between existing data models. Once developed and implemented in an ERP system, data and information are visible and transactions associated with them are more flexible...|$|R
50|$|<b>Master</b> <b>data</b> is {{also called}} Master {{reference}} data.

50|$|<b>Master</b> <b>data</b> {{management}} (MDM) is {{a comprehensive}} method of enabling an enterprise to link all of its critical data to one file, called a master file, that provides a common point of reference. When properly done, <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management streamlines data sharing among personnel and departments. In addition, <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management can facilitate computing in multiple system architectures, platforms and applications.|$|E
50|$|For <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management, {{it helps}} {{organizations}} develop authoritative <b>master</b> <b>data</b> by {{enabling them to}} understand where and how information is stored across systems, and to consolidate disparate data into a single, reliable record.|$|E

50|$|The {{selection}} of entities considered for <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management depends somewhat {{on the nature}} of an organization. In the common case of commercial enterprises, <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management may apply to such entities as customer (customer data integration), product (product information management), employee, and vendor. <b>Master</b> <b>data</b> management processes identify the sources from which to collect descriptions of these entities. In the course of transformation and normalization, administrators adapt descriptions to conform to standard formats and data domains, making it possible to remove duplicate instances of any entity. Such processes generally result in an organizational <b>master</b> <b>data</b> management repository, from which all requests for a certain entity instance produce the same description, irrespective of the originating sources and the requesting destination.|$|E
