Video footage and blinded voting were used to determine <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> task performance. RESULTS: Eight tasks were identified in combination with role-specific variations, task simulations suitable for use in a physical demands analysis, and corresponding <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> performance. CONCLUSIONS: The bespoke steps highlighted here allow structured identification of task-specific minimum performance standards and simulations from which physical employment standards could be based.

The analysis {{is based on an}} outdoor-to-indoor measurement campaign, where the secondary network is deployed indoor and senses the signals received from an outdoor primary base-station. By considering a <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> detection probability of 0. 95, the use of diversity increases the range of acceptable sensing up to 18 meters. The <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced up to 14 dB. As expected, the best performance is reached with maximum ratio combining. However, the detection performance is only slightly decreased with square law combining (SLC). As an example, for the multi-polarized reception scenario, SLC increases the <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> SNR by less than 2 dB and decreases the range of acceptable sensing by less than 3 meters. Finally, we show that polarized sensing is a good performance trade-off in realistic scenario where the polarization of the primary transmitter is unknown...|$|R

This paper explores the relationship of these factors, along with individual level socio-economic variables, to dietary adequacy among children below 6  years of age, a proximate determinant of child malnutrition. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Patharpratima block of the Sundarbans in West Bengal, India, using a two-stage, 30 cluster random sampling design. In 1200 sampled households, we used a structured questionnaire to interview mothers of children below 6  years of age on their child’s nutritional intake. We also interviewed household heads to assess perceived community cohesion using a nine item scale, membership in any community self-help organization, and other socio-economic determinants. We used a logistic regression model to assess their association with a <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet among children between 6  months to 6  years. Results Only 9. 33  % children between 6 and 71  months of age received a <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet. With each increase in the perceived community cohesion score (scale 0 - 9), a child is 1. 31 {{times more likely to have}} <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet (95  % CI 1. 14, 1. 50). The odds of <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet were also higher among children whose mothers had primary education (2. 09, 95  % CI 1. 03, 2. 94) as compared to illiterate mothers and in households with surplus food resources (2. 72, 95  % CI 1. 32, 5. 58) as compared to those without surplus or deficit. In contrast, registering at an Anganwadi (government early child development) centre (odds ratio 1. 34 95  % CI 0. 69, 2. 60) and community membership (odds ratio 0. 93, 95  % CI 0. 59, 1. 46) were not associated with <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet. Conclusion The results are consistent with what is known about the importance of maternal education and access to food resources in ensuring that children have a <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet.

40|$|Adequate diet is {{of crucial}} {{importance}} for healthy child development. In food insecure {{areas of the}} world, the provision of adequate child diet is threatened in the many households that sometimes experience having no food at all to eat (household food insecurity). In the context of food insecure northern Ghana, this study investigated the relationship between level of household food security and achievement of recommended child diet as measured by WHO Infant and Young Child Feeding Indicators. Using data from households and 6 - 23 month old children in the 2012 Feed the Future baseline survey (n = 871), descriptive analyses assessed the prevalence of minimum meal frequency; minimum dietary diversity, and <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} examine the association of <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet with household food security, while accounting for the effects of child sex and age, maternal -age, -dietary diversity, -literacy and -education, household size, region, and urban-rural setting. Household food security was assessed with the Household Hunger Scale developed by USAID's Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project. Forty-nine percent of children received minimum recommended meal frequency, 31 % received minimum dietary diversity, and 17 % of the children received <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet. Sixty-four percent of the children lived in food secure households, and they were significantly more likely than children in food insecure households to receive recommended <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet [O. R = 0. 53; 95 % CI: 0. 35, 0. 82]. However, in 80 % of food secure households, children did not receive a minimal acceptable diet by WHO standards. Children living in food secure households were more likely than others to receive a <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet. Yet living in a food secure household was no guarantee of child dietary adequacy, since eight of 10 children in food secure households received less than a <b>minimum</b> <b>acceptable</b> diet. The results call for research into factors besides household food security in the search for determinants of child diet adequacy. In this study at least, household food security was a very weak marker of child diet adequacy. This finding is of significance to public health practice, since it calls into question any assumption that having enough food in a household necessarily results in adequately fed children...|$|R
