500|$|According to Sánchez, on Friday, November 6, 2009, she {{and three}} others were taken in her own {{neighborhood}} by men working for the Cuban government. She {{said that she was}} heading to an anti-violence demonstration and was forcefully put into a car along with another Cuban blogger, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo (she stated that the other two were placed into another car). She characterizes the event on her blog, Generation Y, as a [...] "kidnapping" [...] and describes the event in detail. [...] Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street, [...] "The curious crowded around and I shouted, 'Help, these <b>men</b> <b>want</b> to kidnap us,' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation, 'Don’t mess with it, these are counterrevolutionaries.'" [...] Sánchez said that she was put into the backseat of the car and received blows to her head, legs and buttocks as she was pinned down. [...] The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> to hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E

[...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> to be" [...] and [...] "something like a Casanova." [...] Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans." [...] He also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again. Another change was to air The Simpsons in 720p high-definition television with the episode [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] on February 15, 2009. With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence. It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction {{since the beginning of the}} show's second season in 1990; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro. This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over Springfield.|$|E

[...] contest, in which fans could submit their own ideas for a new, and possibly recurring, Simpsons character. Over 25,000 entries were sent in. The winner of the contest was Peggy Black from Orange, Connecticut, who created the character Ricardo Bomba. She described Ricardo as [...] "someone that all the women love and all the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> to be". Black's inspiration for the character came from {{the fact that there were}} no characters like him on The Simpsons, and she thought Springfield needed [...] "something like a Casanova". As part of the winning prize, Black was sent to work with the show's producers in Los Angeles. She worked with the animators to bring the character to life. In an interview with the Associated Press, Black stated she [...] "described the character and they drew him so I could see if that was my vision of him". She continued, [...] "It's amazing to see how they captured what I imagined. He's over the top." [...] Executive producer Al Jean was one of the judges of the contest, which he described as [...] "a thank you to loyal fans". Jean also noted that there is a possibility the Ricardo character might appear on the show again although this seems unlikely since the character appears to have been killed in a fiery car crash.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the musical}} sequence, Mulan {{is taken to}} various shops and stores in the village, in which several women take turns {{painstakingly}} bathing, dressing and applying makeup to the character, one of whom compares her to a [...] "sow's ear". Mulan tries her best to remain calm and demure throughout the entire process while learning about the requirements for being a girl who honors her family, as her mother and grandmother give her a make over. The women advise Mulan that she will successfully find a husband by focusing on her physical appearance and striving to be an obedient housewife, instructing her that primping is a key ingredient in their [...] "recipe for instant bride" [...] and teaching her that marrying well {{is the only way}} for a girl to honor her family. The song also reinforces the idea that the best way for Mulan to impress her future in-laws is by serving them tea and eventually giving birth to a son, teaching Mulan that <b>men</b> <b>want</b> a wife who is calm while boasting an attractive hairstyle and waistline. At times Mulan does resist her transformation, appearing to look uncomfortable in her own body. Salons Jenn Shreve described Mulan as [...] "clumsy in her woman's body, caught in that awkward limbo where the body belongs to an adult but the child inside hasn't quite caught up." [...] In an effort to make her granddaughter even more appealing, Grandmother Fa bestows traditional Chinese gifts upon her. The sequence also features a prayer from Mulan to her ancestors, during which she asks that they help her not disappoint them or herself.|$|E

Too Wise Wives, and What Do <b>Men</b> <b>Want?</b> However, as the United States entered the Jazz Age in the 1920s, Weber, {{came to be seen}} as passé, in part because of her [...] "propensity for didacticism", but also because her [...] "values became increasingly archaic; her moralising, propagandistic tone was unsuited to the era of the 'flapper' girl and a hedonism that seemed all the more urgent".|$|E
2500|$|Cutolo had {{established}} himself as a ringleader, when Antonio Spavone, known as [...] "'o Malommo" [...] (The Badman), was transferred to Poggioreale prison. He challenged Spavone to a knife fight in the courtyard (a practice called o dichiaramento, the declaration), but Spavone refused. The challenged boss allegedly limited himself to a reply: [...] "Today's young <b>men</b> <b>want</b> to die young by whatever means." [...] Spavone was released from prison shortly after this event. From his prison cell, Cutolo ordered the murder of Spavone. A hitman, allegedly Cutolo's friend, shot Spavone in the face from short range with a shotgun. Spavone survived the ambush, but the shotgun blast left considerable damage to his facial structure, which required plastic surgery. Spavone immediately resigned from his highly visible role as a Camorra boss.|$|E
2500|$|Gail Dines, {{writing in}} Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality, {{describes}} the money {{shot of a}} man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as [...] "one of the most degrading acts in porn". To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body [...] "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold as saying, [...] "I'd like to really show what I believe the <b>men</b> <b>want</b> to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have."

2500|$|Author Lisa Moore {{suggests}} that Dworkin's explanation {{does not take}} into account that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think <b>men</b> <b>want</b> their semen to be wanted. Women's activist Beatrice Faust argued, [...] "since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism." [...] She goes on to say [...] "Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture." [...] Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University, notes in his book Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide that adult industry actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.|$|E

2500|$|Erica's {{first two}} marriages, first to Jeff Martin in 1971 {{and then to}} Phil Brent in 1975, end because both <b>men</b> <b>want</b> her as a {{housewife}} instead of a career woman. Also, Erica {{is more interested in}} marrying them to spite Tara. Lucci described Jeff as a [...] "trophy" [...] and gaining Phil as [...] "a matter of pride for Erica." [...] The marriage to Jeff ends when she leaves him for her modeling manager, Jason Maxwell, who Mona later kills in self-defense. Erica and Phil marry to give the baby they conceive a name. In the 1970s, pregnancy on a soap opera was romanticized so it was more influenced by the emotions and actions of the characters than by modern medicine. Since Phil and Erica do not conceive their baby for love, they are [...] "rewarded" [...] with a miscarriage, which was typical of loveless unions in that time. Phil wants a divorce after their baby's stillbirth. Though her interest turns to pursuing richer men like Linc Tyler, she refuses to let him go because she does not want Tara to have him. Erica agrees to divorce Phil after his father, Nick Davis, offers her a job as a hostess at his restaurant, the Chateau, in exchange for letting his son go. Erica and Nick develop a romance. The relationship displays antagonistic yet loving qualities. It is the first time Erica meets her match in a man. Erica sees Nick as both a father figure and a lover. Though he loves her, he refuses to marry her, which infuriates Erica. She begins a romance with Tom Cudahay (Richard Shoberg) in the hopes of making Nick jealous. Even though it works, Nick fails to act on his jealousy and instead moves to Chicago. On Erica and Tom's wedding day she hopes he will come back to interrupt the ceremony, but he does not.|$|E
