40|$|Forty {{patients}} who had taken overdoses of paracetamol were treated with <b>mercaptamine.</b> Twenty-three patients given <b>mercaptamine</b> within 10 hours of poisoning had normal liver function tests at follow-up, and one could not be traced. In 16 patients mecraptamine was begun more than 10 hours after ingestion of paracetamol ("late" <b>mercaptamine).</b> Eight of these patients developed severe liver damage, which in six was moderate or severe before <b>mercaptamine</b> administration. Acute renal failure occurred in two patients; in one other renal function was temporarily severely impaired. At follow-up two patients were not available, and one admitted moribund had died soon after admission. The remaining 13 all had normal liver function tests. It is concluded that late <b>mercaptamine</b> is not dangerous and may prevent further liver damage...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and {{biochemical}} {{data obtained}} from 163 patients who had taken an overdose of paracetamol were examined to determine which factors or measurements were of value in predicting the severity of ensuing liver damage early after ingestion of tablets. Although the overall severity of hepatic necrosis was found to increase with the dose of paracetamol ingested, correlation was not sufficiently close to provide an accurate prognostic index in individuals. Severe hepatic damage was less likely if the patient had vomited or had a stomach wash-out within 6 hr of overdose. The plasma concentrations of paracetamol, measured at known times after overdose, distinguished those who developed hepatic dysfunction from those who did not, {{but there was a}} poor correlation, particularly in the first 6 hr after ingestion of tablets, between these values and the severity of ensuing liver damage. Estimates of early plasma paracetamol half-lives from three or more samples taken within 4 hr of admission showed that all patients developing moderate or severe liver damage had half-lives greater than 4 hr, but this was also the case in nearly one-third of those with minimal liver lesions only. It is concluded that there is no completely reliable early prognostic test for individual patients with paracetamol overdose. If each patient is selected for treatment with cysteamine (<b>mercaptamine)</b> or other agents on the basis of plasma paracetamol levels, up to 30 % may receive this agent who are at risk from trivial hepatic damage only...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Trefoil factors (TFFs) are {{peptides}} {{produced by}} mucus-secreting {{cells in the}} gastrointestinal tract. A functional association between these peptides and mucus, leading to stabilisation of the viscoelastic gel overlying the epithelia, has been suggested. Both oral and parenteral administration of the peptides increase {{the resistance of the}} gastric mucosa.  AIM—To study the effect in rats of oral and parenteral porcine trefoil factor 2  (pTFF 2) on the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcerations and to clarify the distribution and metabolism of orally administered pTFF 2 in the gastrointestinal tract.  METHODS—Gastric ulcers were induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by indomethacin and duodenal ulcers by <b>mercaptamine.</b> The rats were treated for up to seven days with oral or subcutaneous pTFF 2. Ulcer size after treatment was assessed by stereomicroscopy after whole mount staining with periodic acid-Schiff stain. 125 I-labelled pTFF 2 was given orally to rats, and tissues were investigated by gamma counting of samples and by autoradiography of paraffin embedded sections.  RESULTS—pTFF 2 accelerated gastric ulcer healing after both oral and subcutaneous administration. Duodenal ulcers were aggravated by both treatments. After oral administration of 125 I-pTFF 2, intact peptide was recovered from the superficial part of the mucus layer in the stomach; it passed through the small intestine but was degraded in the caecum. Only a minor part of the labelled pTFF 2 entered the colon and was excreted in the faeces. Most of the label was excreted in the urine.  CONCLUSIONS—Oral as well as parenteral pTFF 2 accelerates the healing of gastric ulceration and aggravates duodenal ulcers. Oral pTFF 2 binds to the mucus layer of the stomach and the small intestine but does not reach the colonic mucosa.    Keywords: trefoil factors; spasmolytic polypeptide; ulcer healing; gastric ulcer; duodenal ulcer; ra...|$|E
40|$|Confusion between look-alike and sound-alike (LASA) {{medication}} names (such as <b>mercaptamine</b> and mercaptopurine) {{accounts for}} up to one in four medication errors, threatening patient safety. Error reduction strategies include computerized physician order entry interventions, and 'Tall Man' lettering. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the medication name designation process, to elucidate properties that may prime the risk of confusion. We analysed the formal and semantic properties of 7, 987 International Non-proprietary Names (INNs), in relation to naming guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) INN programme, and have identified potential for errors. We explored: their linguistic properties, the underlying taxonomy of stems to indicate pharmacological interrelationships, and similarities between INNs. We used Microsoft Excel for analysis, including calculation of Levenshtein edit distance (LED). Compliance with WHO naming guidelines was inconsistent. Since the 1970 s there has been a trend towards compliance in formal properties, such as word length, but longer names published in the 1950 s and 1960 s are still in use. The stems used to show pharmacological interrelationships are not spelled consistently and the guidelines do not impose an unequivocal order on them, making the meanings of INNs difficult to understand. Pairs of INNs sharing a stem (appropriately or not) often have high levels of similarity (< 5 LED), and thus have greater potential for confusion. We have revealed a tension between WHO guidelines stipulating use of stems to denote meaning, and the aim of reducing similarities in nomenclature. To mitigate this tension and reduce the risk of confusion, the stem system should be made clear and well ordered, so as to avoid compounding the risk of confusion at the clinical level. The interplay between the different WHO INN naming principles should be further examined, to better understand their implications for the problem of LASA errors...|$|E
40|$|In tissue culture, {{protection}} against X irradiation {{by a number}} of cysteamine derivatives was studied and the results were compared with data obtained in mice. Compounds with a covered SH group, like WR 638, cysteamine phosphate, WR 2721 and AE AE 48527, showed practically no protection when dissolved in tissue culture medium, but developed a protective activity wehn dissolved in rat blood. Thiol measurements demonstrated that in rat blood the compounds were partly hydrolysed to thiols. C 511 was also hydrolysed in culture medium and was slightly less effective than cysteamine in culture medium. Cysteamine phosphate was hydrolysed more easily than cysteamine sulphate and the protective activity in rat blood was better. WR 2721 was also partly hydrolysed in rat blood. The in vitro protection of this compound was disappointing when compared with results in vivo. Its SH form (WR 1065) also showed less protection than expected from in vivo experiments. Thus, the little protection by WR 2721 in vitro in rat blood is not only due to its incomplete conversion into its thiol. Longer incubation times and the use of rat blood as a solvent brought the protective activity of WR 1065 almost up to the level of cysteamine. This may indicate that WR 1065 penetrates the cells poorly. WR 1065 was the only compound we studied whose protective activity in vitro was improved appreciably by dissolving it in rat plasma.
