40|$|The <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> Neomys fodiens {{is one of}} Britain’s least known {{mammals and}} its habitat {{requirements}} are poorly understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine occurrence and associated habitat preferences of <b>water</b> <b>shrews,</b> a species of conservation concern, by comparing populations in central England freshwater habitats. Bait tube surveys were undertaken at 32 freshwater sites to establish <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> presence, half of which were found to contain <b>water</b> <b>shrews.</b> Habitat surveys were undertaken and, in addition to <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> presence/absence data, were used to develop habitat suitability index models by means of artificial neural networks. Management intensity (occasional or frequent bankside management) was identified as the most important predictor of <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> presence and, when combined with dissolved oxygen (0 - 2. 99 mg l- 1) and water depth (< 25 cm), created the highest performing model. These models will allow sites to be rapidly assessed for <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> presence without labour intensive and costly live-trapping techniques.

40|$|The Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Neomys fodiens) is a {{semi-aquatic}} predator {{of freshwater}} invertebrates. As water quality affects {{the diversity and}} abundance of aquatic invertebrates, <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> could potentially {{be used as a}} vertebrate bio-indicator of water quality. To date, no detailed studies have empirically examined the impacts of water quality on Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> occurrence. Bait-tube surveys were undertaken in winter and summer over 3 years at 26 different wetland locations across Sussex, UK, which varied in water quality. Bait tubes were used to confirm <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> presence at specific sites and derive an index of activity using frequency of occurrence of faeces within tubes. Water quality was measured using six direct physical and chemical indicators (dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, ammonia, nitrate and phosphate) and two derived indices of biological indicators based on aquatic invertebrate composition. We found no linear relationship between any physical, chemical or biological water quality indicators and <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> occurrence. Generalized linear models indicate that <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> presence and frequency of occurrence are more affected by site and season than water quality. Thus, <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> may be more tolerant of poor water quality than previously envisaged. Overall, our study indicates that <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> are not suitable vertebrate bio-indicators of water quality...|$|R

40|$|As it was {{previously}} stated by Asselberg (1971), {{two species of}} the <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> occur in Belgium. In fact, they are not easily distinguished from each other. That is why the author studied the frequency distribution of the mandibular length and {{the height of the}} ramus mandibulae in his Neomys samples. All of them were taken from barn owl pellets originating from southern Belgium. This morphological study shows that the mandidular height is a valuable discriminant character since 99. 95 % of the <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> mandibles are higher than 4. 50 mm and 99. 5 of the Miller's <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> ones are smaller than this value. The taxonomical status of the Belgian populations of N. anomalus is discussed with the clinal (N to S) size variation of this species in the mind. Finally, distribution maps are presented. The <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> is widespread all over Belgium and Luxemburg whereas the Miller's <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> distribution area is restricted to the Ardennes (cambro silurian and low devonian substrates) eastern of the river Meuse.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>shrews</b> (Sorex palustris) depend {{heavily on}} their {{elaborate}} whiskers to navigate their environment and locate prey. They have small {{eyes and ears}} with correspondingly small optic and auditory nerves. Previous investigations have shown that <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> neocortex is dominated by large representations of the whiskers in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S 1 and S 2). Flattened sections of juvenile cortex processed for cytochrome oxidase revealed clear borders of the whisker pad representation in S 1, but no cortical barrels. We were therefore surprised to discover prominent barrelettes in brainstem of juvenile <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> in the present investigation. These distinctive modules {{were found in the}} principal trigeminal nucleus (PrV), and in two of the three spinal trigeminal subnuclei (interpolaris [...] SpVi and caudalis [...] SpVc). Analysis of the shrew's whisker pad revealed the likely relationship between whiskers and barrelettes. Barrelettes persisted in adult <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> PrV, but barrels were also absent from adult cortex. Thus in contrast to mice and rats, which have obvious barrels in primary somatosensory cortex and less clear barrelettes in the principal nucleus, <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> have clear barrelettes in the brainstem and no barrels in the neocortex. These results highlight the diverse ways that similar mechanoreceptors can be represented in the central nervous systems of different species...|$|R
5|$|The marsh shrew and the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex pallustris) {{share many}} {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh shrew to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the Pacific <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized {{that in the early}} Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf shrew (S. nanus), the southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate shrew (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh shrew and the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined the nature of the relationships between marsh <b>shrews,</b> Pacific <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh shrew are shown below in detail.|$|R

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Biologia Evolutiva), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2014 The Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Neomys anomalus) is a {{semi-aquatic}} {{species with}} a wide but fragmented distribution across southern and center Europe and Asia Minor. This species {{is one of the}} least studied small mammal species not only of the Portuguese but also of the whole European fauna. As such, it is still unclear what are the major factors determining the fragmentation of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> populations. The present work intended to better understand the influence of climate and other ecological factors on the distribution of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> by following a time-scaled multidisciplinary approach, that included: i) the study of the evolutionary history of the species; ii) the analysis of ecological and behavioural aspects determining its current niche space; and iii) the determination of the effects of future climate changes on the species’ distribution. Two factors were identified as significantly contributing to the current distribution pattern of the Mediterranean water shrew: severe climatic alterations, that were extremely important in the evolutionary history of the species and that are also projected to have a significant impact in its future distribution, and the interspecific competition with a congeneric species, {{which is one of the}} main factors regulating the current habitat preferences of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew.</b> The followed multidisciplinary and time-scaled approach provided relevant insights on the ecological factors determining the presence of the Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>shrew,</b> ultimately defining its geographical distribution.

Insectivores (or soricomorphs) have been largely ignored as being important in the evolutionary dynamics of hantaviruses, despite the isolation of Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) from the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) (1, 2) and the detection of hantavirus antigens in tissues of the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), alpine <b>shrew</b> (<b>S.</b> alpinus), Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Neomys fodiens), and common mole (Talpa europea) (3). Recently, genetically distinct hantavirus sequences have been found by reverse transcription–PCR in the Therese shrew (Crocidura theresae) in Guinea (4) and the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) in the United States (5).
