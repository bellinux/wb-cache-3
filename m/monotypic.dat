5|$|Aniliidae is a <b>monotypic</b> family {{created for}} the <b>monotypic</b> genus Anilius, which {{means that there is}} only one species in the entire family. This species is A.scytale, found in South America.|$|E
5|$|Various <b>monotypic</b> taxa, {{including}} the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).|$|E
5|$|Manicaria is a <b>monotypic</b> genus of pinnate-leaved palms. The sole species, M. saccifera {{is found}} from Belize to Brazil and Peru. Its {{distribution}} is patchy, but usually {{more common in}} coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|Pandionidae is {{a family}} of {{fish-eating}} birds of prey possessing a very large, powerful hooked beak for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight. The family is <b>monotypic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between these forms are small and clinal, and the species could be possibly considered as <b>monotypic.</b> The fossil record includes Pleistocene deposits from the UK and the Carpathian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted kiwi {{was first}} {{described}} as Apteryx haastii by Thomas Potts, in 1872, {{based on a}} specimen from Westland, New Zealand. It is a <b>monotypic</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The striped honeyeater {{was first}} {{described}} by English ornithologist and bird artist, John Gould, in A Synopsis of the Birds of Australia and the Adjacent Islands, published in 1838. It {{is a member}} of the family Meliphagidae, the honeyeaters, and the sole member of the <b>monotypic</b> genus Plectorhyncha. Molecular studies indicate that genus is closely allied to the <b>monotypic</b> genus Grantiella, though dissimilar in appearance. The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) and the striped honeyeater are part of a subclade that includes also Philemon and Xanthotis.|$|E
5|$|Leucothrinax is a <b>monotypic</b> genus of fan palms {{which is}} native to the {{northern}} Caribbean. The species was split from the genus Thrinax after phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion in Thrinax would render that genus paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|The family Lipotidae {{is another}} <b>monotypic</b> taxon, {{containing}} only the baiji. Fossil records suggest the dolphin first appeared 25 {{million years ago}} and migrated from the Pacific Ocean to the Yangtze River 20 million years ago. The species was declared functionally extinct in 2006 after an expedition to record population numbers found no specimens.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} is <b>monotypic,</b> lacking any subspecies. Birds {{in the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed subspecies, P. d. monticola, but the differences are very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|The limpkin {{is a large}} bird in a <b>monotypic</b> family. It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the rails, but skeletally it {{is closer to the}} cranes. It is found in marshes and gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{looks like}} Peromyscus, and was once placed as a <b>monotypic</b> {{subgenus}} in the genus Peromyscus The greater size and distinctive coloration of Podomys floridanus {{distinguish it from}} the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) and oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus), which also occur in Florida.|$|E
5|$|The ruffed lemurs of {{the genus}} Varecia are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and the largest extant lemurs within the family Lemuridae. Like all living lemurs, they are found only {{on the island of}} Madagascar. Formerly considered to be a <b>monotypic</b> genus, two species are now recognized: the black-and-white ruffed lemur, with its three subspecies, and the red ruffed lemur.|$|E
5|$|This clade {{is part of}} {{the order}} Columbiformes and {{contains}} the <b>monotypic</b> genera Pezophaps and Raphus. The former contains the species Pezophaps solitaria (the Rodrigues solitaire), the latter the dodo, Raphus cucullatus. These birds reached an impressive size as a result of isolation on islands free of predators, in accordance with Foster's rule.|$|E
5|$|Velodona togata is {{a species}} of octopus in the <b>monotypic</b> genus Velodona. First {{described}} by Carl Chun in 1915, with a second subspecies discovered by Guy Coburn Robson in 1924, it was named for the distinctive membranes on its arms.|$|E
5|$|Václav Jan Staněk {{proposed}} a variety capillisporum in 1958, {{which has been}} sunk back into synonymy with the species. M.coliforme is the sole species in Myriostoma, making the genus <b>monotypic.</b> Because the original type material has been lost, in 1989 Sunhede suggested that Dickson's illustration in his 1776 publication (tab. III: 4a & b) {{be used as the}} lectotype.|$|E
5|$|When Philip Sclater first {{described}} the black catbird in 1858, from a specimen collected in Omoa Honduras, he assigned {{it to the}} <b>monotypic</b> genus Melanoptila, which he created at the same time. At least one subsequent ornithologist assigned the species to the genus Turdus, believing {{it to be a}} thrush, but most agreed with Sclater's assessment. DNA studies have since shown that it is most closely related to various endemic Antillean mimids and the gray catbird, and it is sometimes included with the latter species in the genus Dumetella. Although some taxonomists place the birds from Mexico's Cozumel Island in a separate subspecies (M. g. cozumelana), most authorities do not feel that such distinction is warranted and the species is generally regarded as <b>monotypic</b> throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Cotinga species, the purple-throated cotinga differs from them in {{that it has a}} heavier, stubbier bill, distinctive pale fringing on the back feathers, and barred underparts in the female. While it is still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species, recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy-dwelling cotingas, specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus Procnias, the cotingas of the genus Carpodectes, the black-faced cotinga of the <b>monotypic</b> genus Conioptilon, and the bare-necked fruitcrow of the <b>monotypic</b> genus Gymnoderus. Of these genera, the molecular analysis suggested that the purple-throated cotinga was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds. This cotinga does not have a recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|While it was {{formerly}} considered a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus {{is now considered}} to belong its own <b>monotypic</b> oofamily, Cairanoolithidae. It belongs to the dinosauroid-spherulitic basic type, a group including sauropod eggs and ornithischian eggs, but paraphyletically excluding theropod eggs.|$|E
5|$|Zombia is a <b>monotypic</b> genus of fan palms {{which is}} endemic to Hispaniola. Individuals {{are up to}} 3m (10ft) tall and grow in dry, hilly regions. It is {{restricted}} to serpentine soils, {{at least in the}} Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{named for}} Ridgway include the buff-collared nightjar, Caprimulgus ridgwayi (once known as Ridgway's whip-poor-will); the {{turquoise}} cotinga, Cotinga ridgwayi; the Caribbean subspecies of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus ridgwayi; a Big Island subspecies of the elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis ridgwayi; Ridgway's hawk, Buteo ridgwayi; {{and many other}} species and subspecies. The <b>monotypic</b> genus Ridgwayia is named for him; it consists of Aztec thrush, R. pinicola.|$|E
5|$|Dendrocollybia is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Tricholomataceae of the order Agaricales. It is a <b>monotypic</b> genus, {{containing}} the single species Dendrocollybia racemosa, {{commonly known as the}} branched Collybia or the branched shanklet. The somewhat rare species is found in the Northern Hemisphere, including the Pacific Northwest region of western North America, and Europe, where it is included in several Regional Red Lists. It usually grows on the decaying fruit bodies of other agarics—such as Lactarius and Russula—although the host mushrooms may be decayed {{to the point of being}} difficult to recognize.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a <b>monotypic</b> family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista. A 2001 molecular study supported {{the inclusion of}} Mycenastrum corium in the Lycoperdales, where it was traditionally placed. In a more recent (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a <b>monotypic</b> genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of the devastation caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing <b>monotypic</b> species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the <b>monotypic</b> family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also <b>monotypic,</b> as it {{contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Polytolypa is a <b>monotypic</b> genus of fungus {{containing}} the single species Polytolypa hystricis. First {{classified in the}} Onygenaceae family, as of 2008 it {{is considered to be}} in the Ajellomycetaceae, although there is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera. This species is only known from a single specimen derived in the laboratory from a specimen of dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum, collected in Ontario, Canada. Polytolypa hystricis contains bioactive compounds that have antifungal activity.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a <b>monotypic</b> genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the {{subfamily}} Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now been relegated to a junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E
5|$|The Congo serpent eagle (Circaetus spectabilis) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, and is {{sometimes}} placed in the <b>monotypic</b> genus Dryotriorchis by some taxonomic authorities. This species is found in western and central Africa, with its range stretching from Sierra Leone south to Angola and west to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It occurs in upper and lower Guinean forests, which are dense rainforests. This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests’ dark understories. It has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and Dryotriorchis spectabilis batesi. Though <b>monotypic,</b> {{it appears to be}} very closely related to Circaetus. This hawk is a medium-sized bird with distinctive short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is varying shades of brown on its back and has a slight crest. Its breast is white with variable amounts of a rufous wash and, in the nominate subspecies, is covered in round, blackish spots. The subspecies D. s. batesi only has these dots on its flanks. The Congo serpent eagle closely resembles Cassin's hawk-eagle, and some ornithologists believe that this likeness is a rare example of avian mimicry. It is a very vocal raptor, and often {{is one of the most}} heard species in its habitat.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy {{mountain}} mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo (Monticolomys koopmani) is a rodent {{within the}} subfamily Nesomyinae {{of the family}} Nesomyidae, and {{is closely related to}} Macrotarsomys. It is <b>monotypic</b> within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof.|$|E
5|$|The Thamnophilidae {{contains}} {{several large}} or very large genera and numerous small or <b>monotypic</b> ones. Several, which {{are difficult to}} assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds. The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in Myrmotherula and Myrmeciza, need to be assigned to other genera. Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such {{a large number of}} often poorly known species, the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate <b>monotypic</b> genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, {{it will be necessary to}} reclassify the rorquals.|$|E
5|$|The snoring rail {{was first}} {{classified}} as Rallus plateni by German ornithologist August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius in 1860, but {{was moved to}} its current <b>monotypic</b> genus Aramidopsis by English zoologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1893. Following Taylor (1998), it {{was considered to be}} more similar to the Inaccessible Island and white-throated rails than to members of the Rallus genus, but a 2012 mitochondrial gene study suggests that it should actually be placed in Gallirallus, with Lewin's rail and the slaty-breasted rail as its closest relatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{currently}} regarded as <b>monotypic.</b> Three varieties of Ficus obliqua were recognised until 2001—F. obliqua var. petiolaris, F. obliqua var. obliqua, and F. obliqua var. puberula from Western Australia. A {{revision of the}} group led {{to the conclusion that}} F. obliqua var. petiolaris belonged in the species F. rubiginosa. F. obliqua var. puberula was found to be more distantly related to obliqua than rubiginosa and hence has been reclassified as a separate species, Ficus brachypoda.|$|E
5|$|The unrooted {{cladogram}} to {{the right}} shows the relationship between various subgenera and classes {{as defined by the}} analysis of Rivadavia et al. in 2002. The <b>monotypic</b> section Meristocaulis {{was not included in the}} study, so its place in this system is unclear. More recent studies have placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E
5|$|The various fish groups {{account for}} more than half of {{vertebrate}} species. There are almost 28,000 known extant species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 sharks, rays, and chimeras and about 108 hagfish and lampreys. A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are Cyprinidae, Gobiidae, Cichlidae, Characidae, Loricariidae, Balitoridae, Serranidae, Labridae, and Scorpaenidae. About 64 families are <b>monotypic,</b> containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.|$|E
