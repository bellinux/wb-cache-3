40|$|Background: Catheter {{ablation}} (CA) of paroxysmal {{atrial fibrillation}} (PAF) {{is an effective}} treatment. However, the frequency of asymptomatic AF recurrence after CA in patients with PAF and sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is not clear. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the real AF recurrence after CA in patients with PAF and a pacemaker for SSS. Methods and results: Fifty-one consecutive patients (mean age 66. 6  ±  7. 0 years, male 34) with PAF and SSS and pacemakers underwent CA. All patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the CA using a 12 -lead ECG, Holter-ECG, and 1 -month event recorder as a conventional follow-up. In addition, the pacemakers were interrogated every 12 months. During a 5 -year follow-up after the final CA procedure, AF recurrences were observed in 7 patients (13. 7 %) with a conventional follow-up, including 1 (2. 0 %) asymptomatic patient. Pacemaker-interrogation revealed another 10 patients (19. 6 %) with asymptomatic AF recurrences. Ultimately, the conventional follow-up plus pacemaker-interrogation provided a higher incidence of AF recurrences (P =  0. 009). <b>Multiple</b> <b>CA</b> procedures contributed to a significant increase in the AF-free survival rate at 5 years: 58. 6 % after a single CA and 86. 0 % after <b>multiple</b> <b>CA</b> procedures with a conventional follow-up, but which decreased to 40. 6 % and 60. 9 % with a conventional follow-up plus a pacemaker interrogation, respectively.

In a wired network, this CRL is stored in a centralized Certificate Authority (CA) and can be accessed easily by users.

40|$|The {{security}} of TLS depends on trust in certificate authorities, and that trust stems from {{their ability to}} protect and control {{the use of a}} private signing key. The signing key is the key asset of a certificate authority (CA), and its value is based on trust in the corresponding public key which is primarily distributed by browser vendors. Compromise of a CA private key represents a single point-of-failure that could have disastrous consequences, so CAs {{go to great lengths to}} attempt to protect and control the use of their private keys. Nevertheless, keys are sometimes compromised and may be misused accidentally or intentionally by insiders. We propose splitting a CA's private key among multiple parties, and producing signatures using a generic secure multi-party computation protocol that never exposes the actual signing key. This could be used by a single CA to reduce the risk that its signing key would be compromised or misused. It could also enable new models for certificate generation, where <b>multiple</b> <b>CAs</b> would need to agree and cooperate before a new certificate can be generated, or even where certificate generation would require cooperation between a CA and the certificate recipient (subject).

40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. In {{the process of}} CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA (“spacers”) are {{acquired}} from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. It so far remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of “self ” is mediated by the RecBCD dsDNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that in E. coli, acquisition of new spacers depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of dsDNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, {{in combination with the}} higher number of forks on the foreign DNA.

Using the motility of Plasmodium berghei ookinetes as a signalling paradigm, we show that the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) -dependent protein kinase, PKG, maintains the elevated level of cytosolic Ca 2 + required for gliding motility. We find that the same PKG-dependent pathway operates upstream of the Ca 2 + signals that mediate activation of P. berghei gametocytes in the mosquito and egress of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites from infected human erythrocytes. Perturbations of PKG signalling in gliding ookinetes have a marked impact on the phosphoproteome, with a significant enrichment of in vivo regulated sites in multiple pathways including vesicular trafficking and phosphoinositide metabolism. A global analysis of cellular phospholipids demonstrates that in gliding ookinetes PKG controls phosphoinositide biosynthesis, possibly through the subcellular localisation or activity of lipid kinases.

Case mothers with DM- 1 associated with a higher risk of total rate of CAs in their offspring (OR with 95 % CI: 1. 5, 1. 1 - 2. 0) compared to the total rate of CAs in the offspring of non-diabetic case mothers. This higher risk can be explained by four specific types/groups of CAs: isolated renal a/dysgenesis; obstructive CA of the urinary tract; cardiovascular CAs; and <b>multiple</b> <b>CAs,</b> namely caudal dysplasia sequence. However, there was no higher rate of total CAs in the children of pregnant women with DM- 1 after folic acid supplementation; in addition, neural-tube defect and renal a/dysgenesis did not occur.

40|$|The SymGrid-Par {{framework}} {{is being developed}} {{as part of the}} European FP 6 SCIEnce project (I 3 - 026133) to provide a standard skeleton-based framework for parallelising large computational algebra problems in the Maple, GAP, Kant and Mupad systems. The computational algebra community uses a number of domain speciﬁc high level languages each with speciﬁc capabilities, for example GAP specialises in computations over groups. The community are keen to develop standards, to improve interoperability between computer algebra systems (CAS), and to avoid duplicating implementation effort. Algebraic computations are challenging to parallelise as they are symbolic rather than numeric, and hence require a relatively rich set of data structures. Parallel tasks are often generated dynamically, and are of highly irregular size, e. g. varying in size by 5 orders of magnitude. SymGrid-Par orchestrates sequential computational algebra (CA) components into a parallel, and possibly grid-enabled application. It provides a native skeleton-based interface to the CA programmer, so for example a GAP programmer might invoke a parallel GAP map function. There are both generic skeletons like map and reduce, and domain speciﬁc skeletons like orbit and transitive closure. The skeletons are implemented by a coordination server that distributes the work to multiple instances of the sequential CAS on multiple processors; dynamically manages load distribution; and reassembles the results for return to the invoking CAS. The coordination server exploits the dynamic parallelism and load management capabilities of the Eden and GpH parallel Haskells. Invocations between SymGrid-Par components use our new standardised SCSCP protocol, currently supported by 7 CAS, and mathematical objects are represented in the standard XML-based OpenMath format. The generic SymGrid-Par framework delivers performance comparable with, and typically better than, a specialised parallel CAS implementation like ParGAP. Many CA problems have large task granularity, and hence SymGrid-Par gives good performance on both cluster and multicore architectures. Moreover, the standardised interface can be exploited to orchestrate <b>multiple</b> <b>CAS</b> to solve problems that cannot be solved in a single CAS...|$|E

Methods 3 D-TOF-MRA, 4 D-TRAK and 3 D-DSA were performed sequentially in 52 patients with suspected CAs. 4 D-TRAK was acquired {{using a combination of}} sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and CE timing robust angiography (CENTRA) k-space sampling techniques at a contrast dose of 10 ml at 3 T. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 4 D-TRAK and 3 D-TOF-MRA were calculated and compared for the detection of CAs on patient-based and aneurysm-based evaluation using 3 D-DSA as a reference. Results The overall image quality of 4 D-TRAK with a contrast dose of 10 ml was in the diagnostic range but still cannot be compared with that of 3 D-TOF-MRA. In 52 patients with suspected CAs, fifty-eight CAs were confirmed on 3 D-DSA finally. Fifty-one (with 2 false-positives and 9 false-negatives) and 58 (with 1 false-positive and 1 false-negative) CAs were visualized on 4 D-TRAK and 3 D-TOF-MRA, respectively. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on patient-based evaluation of 4 D-TRAK and 3 D-TOF-MRA were 92. 31 %, 93. 33 %, 85. 71 % and 98. 08 %, 100 %, 85. 71 %, respectively, and 74. 07 %, 75. 00 %, 66. 67 % and 96. 30 %, 95. 83 %, 100 % on aneurysm-based evaluation in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>CAs,</b> respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that for 19 very small CAs (maximal diameter Conclusion 4 D-TRAK at a lower contrast dose of 10 ml with a combination of SENSE and CENTRA at 3 T could provide similar diagnostic accuracy rate for CAs with maximal diameter[*]≥[*] 3 mm, and a better characterization of morphology for larger CAs with maximal diameter[*]≥[*] 10 mm compared to 3 D-TOF-MRA. However, further study is still needed to improve the “vascular edge” artifact and the compromise in spatial resolution in depiction of CAs with maximal diameter< 3 mm. </p...|$|E

40|$|Many {{physiological}} {{processes are}} controlled by a great diversity of Ca 2 + signals. Within cell, Ca 2 + signals depend upon Ca 2 + entry and/or Ca 2 + release from internal Ca 2 + stores. The control of Ca 2 +-store mobilization is ensured by a family of messengers comprising inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate, cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). From recent works, new concepts have emerged where activation of the cells by outside stimuli, acting at the plasma membrane, results in the synthesis of <b>multiple</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +-releasing messengers which may interact and shape complex Ca 2 + signals in the cytosol {{as well as in}} the nucleus. This contribution will cover the most recent advances on NAADP signalling with some emphasis on neurons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{concentration}} of neuroendocrine terminals in the neurohypophysis facilitates {{the identification and}} localization of Ca 2 + channel subtypes near neuroendocrine release sites. Immunoblots of rat neurohypophysial tissue identified the α 11. 3, α 12. 1, α 12. 2, and α 12. 3 Ca 2 + channel subunits. Immunofluorescence staining of axon terminal plasma membranes was weak, suggesting that Ca 2 + channels are dispersed. This contrasts with the highly punctate α 12. 2 immunoreactivity in bovine chromaffin cells; the neurohypophysial terminals may therefore lack the specialized release zones found in those cells. Immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling identify dense core granule-like structures in the terminal cytoplasm containing <b>multiple</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + channel types. Ca 2 + channels in internal membranes may {{play an important role}} in channel targeting and distribution in neuroendocrine cells...|$|R
