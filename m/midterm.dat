5|$|Menem {{supported}} the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented {{by a series}} of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special relations with the United States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 <b>midterm</b> elections allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition that won the 1997 <b>midterm</b> elections and the 1999 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center.

5|$|McClellan then {{resisted}} the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders {{to move the}} Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 <b>midterm</b> elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the {{disastrous}} results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections.

Cordray defeated Republican Mike Crites, 57%-38%.|$|E
5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile {{in a dispute over}} the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner told him that he had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc in the Congress in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 <b>midterm</b> elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa.

She ran again for senator in the 2001 <b>midterm</b> elections.|$|E

5|$|Clark campaigned heavily {{throughout}} the 2006 <b>midterm</b> election campaign, supporting numerous Democrats {{in a variety}} of federal, statewide, and state legislature campaigns.

Clark was the most-requested surrogate of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee {{throughout the}} 2006 campaign, and sometimes appeared with the leadership of the Democratic Party when they commented on security issues.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 <b>midterm</b> {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved {{himself in}} New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 <b>midterm</b> congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 <b>midterm</b> elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1998 <b>midterm</b> elections, where the GOP lost five House seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the Senate, House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia stood down for the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term.
