40|$|Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} tumor of the bone. The major cause of death in osteosarcoma is the increase in metastatic potential, and the ezrin expression has been correlated with the metastasis development. Ezrin interacts with RhoGDI by dissociating it from RhoGTPases, which allow GTPases to load with GTP, activate RhoA to increase cell migration, and invasion. RhoGTPases have been found to contribute to pathologic processes including cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis and overexpression of either the GTPase itself or some elements of Rho signaling that have been detected in many human tumors, including Rac 1 and RhoA. We have analyzed Rac 1 and RhoA expression in the osteosarcoma tissues to understand the role of the ezrin-Rho family pathway in <b>osteosarcoma</b> <b>metastatic</b> progression. Moreover, we have blocked the ezrin expression using siRNA assay to investigate a possible correlation with RAC 1 and RHOA expression in the osteosarcoma cell lines. Our immunohistochemical data showed that many osteosarcomas presented cytoplasmatic positivity for both Rac 1 and RhoA and cases, both ezrin positive than ezrin negative, revealed the protein expression of Rac 1 and RhoA. The results obtained by ezrin siRNA transfection showed that ezrin expression in the osteosarcoma cell lines might modulate, mainly, the Rac 1 expression. It is possible that the mechanism of cell motility mediated by Rac 1 and RhoA is maintained in osteosarcomas, and since the expression of ezrin, Rac 1 and RhoA do not correlate with <b>metastatic</b> progression in <b>osteosarcoma.</b> However, osteosarcomas without metastasis displayed a positivity for Rac 1 and RhoA expression compared with <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> and this could be a protective factor...|$|R

40|$|Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} bone neoplasia occurring in young patients in the first two decades of life, and represents 20 % of all primitive malignant bone tumours. At present, treatment of <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> is unsatisfactory. High-dose chemotherapy followed by CD 34 + leukapheresis rescue may improve these poor results. Neoplastic cells contaminating the apheresis may, however, contribute to relapse. To identify markers suitable for detecting osteosarcoma cells in aphereses we analysed the expression of bone-specific genes (Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) and Osteocalcin) and oncogenes (Met and ErbB 2) in 22 patients with <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> and six healthy stem cell donors. The expression of these genes in aphereses of patients affected by <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> was assessed by RT–PCR and Southern blot analysis.

Moreover, 18 % of patients showed a strong and significantly positive (seven to 16 times higher than healthy stem cell donors) ErbB 2 expression. In all positive cases, neoplastic tissue also expressed ErbB 2.

40|$|Focal {{adhesion}} kinase (FAK) {{is important}} for tumor cell survival and metastasis in various cancers. However, its expression and prognostic value in patients with <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> remain unknown. We investigated the expression of FAK and its phosphorylated form (pFAK-Y 397) in osteosarcoma tissues from 53 patients by immunohistochemistry and evaluated their correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes. The prognostic values were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. Total FAK and pFAK-Y 397 were overexpressed in 48 (90. 6 %) and 33 (62. 3 %) cases, respectively. pFAK-Y 397 overexpression was correlated with poor histologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma regardless {{of the presence of}} metastasis or not. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that patients with <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> with pFAK-Y 397 overexpression had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than those with non-overexpression (P = 0. 044). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed pFAK-Y 397 overexpression as an independent prognostic predictor for OS and post metastases OS (PMOS) (P = 0. 017, P = 0. 006, respectively). Age at diagnosis was also an independent indicator for PMOS (P = 0. 003).

Original {{articles}} and abstracts published between January 1991 and January 1997 were selected according to specified criteria and reviewed to provide answers to five interesting {{questions about the}} systemic treatment of <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma.</b> Results. (1) In patients with metastatic disease at presentation, what is the outcome after intensive multi-agent chemotherapy? Historically, survival has been poor, but may be improving {{with the use of}} ifosfamide-containing regimens. (2) Can response to new agents be evaluated better in patients who have received no previous chemotherapy? Based on limited data, this is probably true. (3) Is the response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, as determined by histopathology, similar for the primary tumor and synchronous pulmonary metastases? With intensive multi-agent chemotherapy, good histological response rates are in the range 70 - 90 % for both groups. (4) What is the outcome, after intensive combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and surgery, in patients relapsing with metastases after previous adjuvant chemotherapy, and what are the important prognostic factors? Outcome is highly variable, but 5 -year survival ranges between 25 and 50 % and a good outcome is more likely if recurrent disease is limited to resectable lung metastases. (5) Can a biological agent (L-MTP-PE) prolong the time to relapse in patients with resected <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma?</b> Preliminary data suggest that this is possible, but more studies are required.

At the protein level, the secreted form generated from the intact cadherin- 11 is present. We examined the expression of the intact and the variant forms of cadherin- 11 in 23 primary and <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> from 22 patients by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, revealing that all 23 tumors in the patients expressed the variant form and three of them expressed it prominently. On the other hand, Western blot analyses of six tumors showed that the secreted form was strongly expressed, and furthermore, expression of N-cadherin was extremely low. Overexpression of the intact cadherin- 11 cDNA in osteosarcoma cell lines demonstrated that the secreted form is derived from the intact form of cadherin- 11 in osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemically, cadherin- 11, N-cadherin, and β-catenin were expressed at the cell surface of fetal osteoblasts, whereas in osteosarcoma cells, they were expressed only focally or weakly in the cytoplasm.

40|$|Despite {{intensive}} {{chemotherapy and}} surgery treatment, lung and bone metastasis develop in about 30 % {{of patients with}} osteosarcoma. Mechanisms for this preferential metastatic behavior are largely unknown. We investigated {{the role of the}} chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR 4) /stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF- 1) system to drive the homing of osteosarcoma cells. We analyzed the expression of the CXCR 4 and SDF- 1 proteins on several osteosarcoma cell lines and the effects of SDF- 1 on migration, adhesion, and proliferation of these cancer cells. In vitro assays showed that the migration of osteosarcoma cells expressing CXCR 4 receptor follows an SDF- 1 gradient and that their adhesion to endothelial and bone marrow stromal cells is promoted by SDF- 1 treatment. Moreover, the production of matrix metalloproteinase- 9 is increased after SDF- 1 exposure. We finally proved in a mouse model our hypothesis of the CXCR 4 /SDF- 1 axis involvement in the <b>metastatic</b> process of <b>osteosarcoma</b> cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyaluronan (HA) plays crucial {{roles in}} the tumourigenicity of many types of {{malignant}} tumours. 4 -Methylumbelliferone (MU) is an inhibitor of HA synthesis. Several studies have shown its inhibitory effects on malignant tumours; however, none have focused on its effects on osteosarcoma. METHODS: We investigated the effects of MU on HA accumulation and tumourigenicity of highly <b>metastatic</b> murine <b>osteosarcoma</b> cells (LM 8) that have HA-rich cell-associated matrix, and human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG- 63 and HOS). RESULTS: In vitro, MU inhibited HA retention, thereby reducing the formation of functional cell-associated matrices, and also inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Akt phosphorylation was suppressed by MU (1. 0 mM). In vivo, although MU showed only a mild inhibitory effect on {{the growth of the}} primary tumour, it markedly inhibited (75 % reduction) the development of lung metastasis. Hyaluronan retention in the periphery of the primary tumour was markedly suppressed by MU. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that MU suppressed HA retention and cell-associated matrix formation in osteosarcoma cells, resulting in a reduction of tumourigenicity, including lung metastasis. 4 -Methylumbelliferone is a promising therapeutic agent targeting both primary tumours and distant metastasis of osteosarcoma, possibly via suppression of HA retention...|$|R

Following treatment, we observed decrease in tumor growth of subcutaneous xenografts (p= 0. 0374) and prolongation of survival in mice with orthotopic (p< 0. 0001) and pulmonary <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> tumors (p= 0. 0207). Expression of the NIS transgene in MV-NIS infected tumors allowed for SPECT-CT and PET-CT imaging of virus infected tumors in vivo. Our data support the translational potential of MV-based virotherap...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epigenetics is {{the study}} of changes in gene {{expression}} or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. It is widely accepted that cancer has genetic and epigenetic origins. The idea of epigenetic reprogramming of cancer cells by an embryonic microenvironment possesses potential interest from the prospect of both basic science and potential therapeutic strategies. Chick embryo extract (CEE) has been used for the successful expansion of many specific stem cells and has demonstrated the ability to facilitate DNA demethylation. Questions/purposes: The current study was conducted to compare the status of DNA methylation in highly metastatic and less <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> cells and to investigate whether CEE may affect the epigenetic regulation of tumor suppressor genes and thus change the metastatic phenotypes of highly <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> cells. Methods: K 7 M 2 murine OS cells were treated with CEE to determine its potential effect on DNA methylation, cell apoptosis, and invasion capacity. Results: Our current results suggest that the methylation status of tumor suppressor genes (p 16, p 53, and E-cadherin) is significantly greater in highly metastatic mouse ostoesarcoma K 7 M 2 cells in comparison with less metastatic mouse osteosarcoma K 12 cells. CEE treatment of K 7 M 2 cells caused demethylation of p 16, p 53, and E-cadherin genes, upregulated their expression, and resulted in the reversion of metastatic phenotypes in highly <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> cells. Conclusions: CEE may promote the reversion of metastatic phenotypes of osteosarcoma cells and can be a helpful tool to study osteosarcoma tumor reversion by epigenetic reprogramming. Clinical Relevanc e: Demethylation of tumor suppressor genes in osteosarcoma may represent a novel strategy to diminish the metastatic potential of this neoplasm. Further studies, both in vitro and in vivo, are warranted to evaluate the clinical feasibility of this approach as an adjuvant to current therapy. © The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons® 2013...|$|E
40|$|Hypocalcemia {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of osteosarcoma, having been described in only 4 reports. We present {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old male with <b>metastatic</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> of the right humerus who was found to have severe asymptomatic hypocalcemia. Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood revealed a microdeletion in band 22 q 11. 2. Following amputation of the tumor-bearing extremity, the patient's calcium levels increased, but did not normalize. These findings suggested that the etiology of his hypocalcemia was osteoblastic utilization of calcium by the tumor, exacerbated by 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Osteosarcoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{malignant}} tumors of childhood and adolescence that is often resistant to standard chemo- and radio-therapy. Geldanamycin and geldanamycin analogs have been recently studied as potential anticancer agents for osteosarcoma treatment. Here, for the first time, we have presented novel anticancer mechanisms of geldanamycin biological activity. Moreover, we demonstrated an association between the effects of geldanamycin on the major heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the overall survival of highly <b>metastatic</b> human <b>osteosarcoma</b> 143 B cells. We demonstrated that the treatment of 143 B cells with geldanamycin caused a subsequent upregulation of cytoplasmic Hsp 90 and Hsp 70 whose activity is at least partly responsible for cancer development and drug resistance. On the other hand, geldanamycin induced upregulation of Hsp 60 gene expression, and a simultaneous loss of hyperacetylated Hsp 60 mitochondrial protein pool resulting in decreased viability and augmented cancer cell death. Hyperacetylation of Hsp 60 seems to be associated with anticancer activity of geldanamycin. In light of the fact that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the apoptotic signaling pathway, the presented data may support a hypothesis that Hsp 60 can be another functional part of mitochondria-related acetylome being a potential target for developing novel anticancer strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the clinical characteristics and treatment results of osteosarcoma in pediatric patients during the past 30 years. Trends in survival rates and long-term toxicity were analyzed. Procedure. 130 pediatric patients under the age of 20 years with primary localized or <b>metastatic</b> high-grade <b>osteosarcoma</b> were analyzed regarding demographic, treatment-related variables, long-term toxicity, and survival data. Results. Comparison of the different time periods of treatment showed that the 5 -year OS improved from 58. 6 % for children diagnosed during 1979 - 1983 to 78. 6 % for those diagnosed during 2003 - 2008 (P = 0. 13). Interestingly, the basic treatment agents including cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate remained the same. Treatment reduction due to acute toxicity was less frequent in patients treated in the last era (7. 1 % versus 24. 1 % in patients treated in 1979 - 1983; P = 0. 04). Furthermore, late cardiac effects and secondary malignancies can become evident many years after treatment. Conclusion. We elucidate the prevalence of toxicity to therapy of patients with osteosarcoma over the past 30 years. The overall improvement in survival may in part be attributed to improved supportive care allowing regimens to be administered to best advantage with higher tolerance of chemotherapy and therefore less chemotherapy-related toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{dogs with}} histopathologically {{confirmed}} primary (n= 15) or <b>metastatic</b> (n= 5) <b>osteosarcoma</b> (n= 14) or fibrosarcoma (n= 6) of the vertebral column {{were treated with}} surgery (n= 4), radiation therapy and chemotherapy (n= 6), surgery and chemotherapy (n= 2), or surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (n= 8). All dogs died due to their disease; 15 died due to local failure, and five died due to nonvertebral metastasis. Overall median survival time was 135 days, {{with a range of}} 15 to 600 days. Of the factors evaluated, only postoperative neurological status had a significant influence on outcome by multivariate analysis. This study supports the overall guarded prognosis for dogs with vertebral neoplasia. Better combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remain to be defined for this difficult subset of animal cancer...|$|R
