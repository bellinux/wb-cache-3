5|$|If {{the church}} from the <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be {{conclusively}} dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E
5|$|John Komnenos was {{a rather}} {{unimportant}} figure in the court, and in a <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> dating to the late 13th century, Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos, who briefly became emperor during Constantinople's final siege by the Fourth Crusade, was named as the real mastermind behind the coup. He was certainly supported by a wider circle of nobles from the Komnenian era, possibly even the brothers Alexios Komnenos and David Komnenos, who later founded the Empire of Trebizond. Thus the historian Michael Angold traces the coup's inception {{to the events of}} early 1199, when Alexios III married his two daughters Irene and Anna to Alexios Palaiologos and Theodore Laskaris respectively. This marriage not only spoke of increasing confidence for the Emperor, but also provided for the imperial succession and began the establishment of a separate aristocratic power-base, which must have displeased many noble families.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis Philological <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> in John's Gospel of Blahoslav's Translations of New Testament {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of the philological <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> in John's Gospel of Blahoslav's New Testament from the year 1564 and 1568. The life of Jan Blahoslav, the information about Blahoslav's New Testament and the history of the research about his translation of New Testament are summarised in the thesis as well as the tradition of Bible commentary and <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> in their European and Czech contexts. In the practical part the thesis presents the number of philological <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> explored in both editions, the number of variants in <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> and their word class distribution. It tries to find possible sources for the text in <b>marginal</b> <b>notes.</b> It uses Czech printed translations of the Bible (Klaudyán's New Testament, Lukáš's New Testament, Optát's New Testament, Melantrich's Bible of 1556 - 1557) and Latin translations by Erasmus and Beza and their annotations and Vulgate. As a supplement to the thesis there is also a list of excerpted philological <b>marginal</b> <b>notes</b> from both editions of Blahoslav's New Testament and corresponding places in Bible translations examined...|$|R

40|$|This work proposes an {{application}} {{of the concept of}} <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> to journalistic texts, and more specifically, their utilization for the characterization of Readers´ Comments in Cyberjournalism as an emerging form of Memory. The concept of <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> is discussed in its classical sense and then transposed to the situation of journalistic production. The idea of journalistic <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> is also associated with the topic of the War of the Memories, but what is basically distinguished is the value of the preservation of these comments as possible indicators of a Zeitgeist to be possibly recovered, from a specific historical distance. Some examples of <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> in journalism in online media are furnished. Attention is called to the need for understanding <b>Marginal</b> <b>Notes</b> as a “text”, in the broad sense of the word, since all the (multi) media formats incorporated as readers´ contributions {{should be included in the}} concept, and consequently efforts should be made for their preservation for future uses. </p...|$|R

In a <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> in his copy of Georg Meier's In Iudaeorum Medicastrorum Calumnias (1570), he compared Kranich to the Queen's physician, Doctor Lopez, whom he termed 'none of the learnedest or expertest physicians in the court, {{but one that}} maketh as great account of himself as the best'. Harvey added: 'Doctor Burcot was in a manner such another; who so bold as blind Bayard?'.|$|E
25|$|That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were {{confirmed}} in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> in a 1477 printing of a volume {{written by the}} ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo {{was at that time}} working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.|$|E

25|$|Manuscripts also differ. Usually the {{differences}} are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, {{as in the case}} of the Comma Johanneum, a clause in the First Epistle of John that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian Trinity, but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a <b>marginal</b> <b>note.</b> A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the Septuagint and Masoretic descriptions of the battle of David and Goliath: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of Saul asking who David is as though he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.|$|E

500|$|Another {{possible}} {{reference to}} the church {{may be in a}} <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> from 1358 to a copy of the Acts of the Apostles.

Scholar Bistra Nikolova believes this to be an allusion to the Patriarchal Cathedral, which may have patronised the project. Alternatively, the copy could have been made at the cathedral's scriptorium, where Laloe may have worked.|$|E

500|$|Another Ecgberht, Ecgberht II of Kent, {{ruled in}} that kingdom {{throughout}} the 770s; he is last mentioned in 779, in a charter granting land at Rochester.

[...] This {{is supported by the}} genealogical preface from the A text of the Chronicle, which gives Ecgberht's father's name as Ealhmund without further details. The preface probably dates from the late ninth century; the <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> is on the F manuscript of the Chronicle, which is a Kentish version dating from about 1100.|$|E
500|$|A {{contemporary}} of Shakespeare's, Gabriel Harvey, wrote a <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> in his {{copy of the}} 1598 {{edition of}} Chaucer's works, which some scholars use as dating evidence. Harvey's note says that [...] "the wiser sort" [...] enjoy Hamlet, and implies that the Earl of Essex—executed in February 1601 for rebellion—was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the [...] "sense of time is so confused in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date [...] ". This is because the same note also refers to Spenser and Watson {{as if they were}} still alive ("our flourishing metricians"), but also mentions [...] "Owen's new epigrams", published in 1607.|$|E
500|$|If Article 73(a) was {{intended}} to be an empowering provision, its exclusion would have disempowered the Parliament from legislating within Singapore, an absurd result which could not have been intended. Instead, the Court held that the provision was a provision regulating the [...] "relations between the Federation and the States", as the title of Part VI of the Malaysian Constitution states. This was supported by the text found in the <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> ("extent of federal and state laws") and the relevant chapter ("distribution of legislative powers"). Additionally, the opening words to Article 73(a) – [...] "In exercising the legislative powers conferred on it by this Constitution ..." [...] – already indicated that it was presupposed that extraterritorial powers had been conferred. As Article 73(a) was not an empowering provision, it had been excluded merely because it was irrelevant to the RSIA and it did not disempower the Parliament of its extraterritorial legislative powers.|$|E

2500|$|Representing the {{contrary}} view, Richard Carrier {{argues that the}} words [...] "the one called Christ" [...] likely resulted from the accidental insertion of a <b>marginal</b> <b>note</b> added by some unknown reader.

The Jews get angry at this. Complaints and demands are made. The King removes Ananus from being High Priest. Jesus ben Damneus is then made high priest.|$|E
