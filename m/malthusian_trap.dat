40|$|This paper uses new {{estimates}} of the dates on which different countries have experienced their demographic transition to address two empirical questions. First, I study the importance of different socioeconomic variables on the timing of these transitions. Second, I distinguish between countries that have experienced early and late demographic transitions and compare their relative income around the transition date. My {{results indicate that the}} size of a country’s urban population plays a crucial role in triggering its demographic transition. In particular, after controlling for income and total population, more urbanized countries tend to experience an earlier demographic transition. Moreover, countries that experience an early demographic transition (before 1950) are much richer than latecomers, suggesting that urbanization plays a more important role than income in the latter. One interpretation of these results is that a country’s level of income and rate of urbanization are substitutable factors that trigger the country’s demographic transition. Finally, if one accepts the premise that urban agglomerations enhance both technological progress and the demand for human capital, the results provide indirect support for theories that highlight these factors as triggers of the demographic transition or the escape from <b>Malthusian</b> <b>traps.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] The {{importance}} of health improvements {{for economic growth}} has been underlined by {{a growing number of}} theoretical and empirical papers. This thesis contributes to the literature by analysing a specific mechanism that underlies this relationship, namely the complementarity of child health and learning ability. Health status is a constitutive component of human capital and, in addition, has a significant multiplier effect on its accumulation. Favourable health status affects practically all of the abilities and skills that children are capable of developing positively. As a direct result, school-based human capital investment provides an optimal channel for enhancing economic growth. Conversely, poor physical health constitutes a major constraint, that only serves to exacerbate deprivation. The analysis carried out in this thesis is both empirical and theoretical. Most of the empirical exercises, which explore the relationship between health and education, have required the use of instrumental variable techniques in order to assess the question of endogeneity that arises when considering the two variables simultaneously. Theoretical models rely on the OLG framework, which allows for considering intergenerational linkages and the temporal evolution of the interest variables. Throughout this thesis it is shown that parents tend to be the agents that transmit child health status, i. e. it is parents that are responsible for the investment of child-health human capital. This dynamic is instrumental in dictating both child learning capacity and the level of schooling investments. These findings have been included in a theoretical 7 model in order to explain the possible emergence of multiple equilibria in the temporal evolution of human capital. In addition, the consequences of a particular policy aimed at improving the condition of the poor, namely balanced school meals as a means of ensuring basic alimentation, have been investigated by means of a numerical simulation. If poor health causes poverty traps to emerge, substantial health improvements are needed to escape from the bear-pit of deprivation. In copying some of the processes that led the currently developed countries to escape from the <b>Malthusian</b> poverty <b>trap</b> to the Modern Growth regime, a renewed effort to enhance health conditions is required in order to break the cycle of poverty. [Resumen] La tesis analiza un mecanismo que relaciona la malnutrición y la persistencia de la pobreza en los países en desarrollo. En particular, se demuestra que el estado nutricional afecta a la capacidad de aprendizaje de los niños y por lo tanto, influye en la acumulación de capital humano. Además, se establece la existencia de una relación intergeneracional entre estado de salud de los padres y estado de salud de los hijos. Teniendo en cuenta estos resultados, se desarrolla un modelo de generaciones solapadas con fertilidad endógena que permite explicar la formación de trampas de pobreza. Finalmente, se discute el papel de los avances en ámbito sanitario en la salida del ciclo de pobreza analizada...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap</b> is the {{putative}} lack of sustainability of improvements in a society's {{standard of living}} because of population growth. It is named for Thomas Robert Malthus, who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable population growth, which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level. Some economists contend that since the industrial revolution, mankind has broken out of the trap. Others argue that the continuation of extreme poverty indicates that the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap</b> continues to operate. Others further argue that {{due to lack of}} food availability coupled with excessive pollution, developing countries show more evidence of the trap.|$|E
50|$|In 1798, Thomas Malthus {{published}} An Essay on the Principles of Population wherein {{he argued}} that population growth was necessarily limited by the means of substinence; because he assumed that the land could never produce nor provide sufficient food for everyone, population growth will inevitably lead to famine, starvation and death. This {{became known as the}} <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{view that}} a [...] "breakout" [...] from the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap</b> {{has led to}} an era of {{sustained}} economic growth is explored by [...] "unified growth theory". One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
50|$|The theory captures in {{a single}} {{analytical}} framework the main characteristics {{of the process of}} development: (i) the epoch of Malthusian stagnation that characterized most of human history, (ii) the escape from the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap,</b> (iii) the emergence of human capital formation in the process of development, (iv) the onset of the demographic transition, (v) the origins of the contemporary era of sustained economic growth, and (vi) the divergence in income per capita across countries.|$|E

The book argues that England and Japan, both relatively large but non-remote islands, were each positioned to develop an autonomous culture while still profiting from nearby continental influence. Through different means, both Japan and England overcame the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap,</b> keeping birth and mortality rates under control, thus providing a demographic impetus for the rise of capitalism and prosperity.|$|E

When the bodies of children are deprived of the nutrients they need to grow, brain development is also unlikely to reach its full potential, so these larger, better-off people may also have been smarter, further adding to economic growth and speeding up the virtuous circle.

50|$|French {{physician}} Antoine Parmentier {{studied the}} potato intensely and in Examen chymique des pommes de terres ("Chemical examination of potatoes") (Paris, 1774) showed their enormous nutritional value. King Louis XVI and his court eagerly promoted the new crop, with Queen Marie Antoinette even wearing a headdress of potato flowers at {{a fancy dress}} ball. The annual potato crop of France soared to 21 million hectoliters in 1815 and 117 million in 1840, allowing a concomitant growth in population while avoiding the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap.</b> Although potatoes had become widely familiar in Russia by 1800, they were confined to garden plots until the grain failure in 1838-39 persuaded peasants and landlords in central and northern Russia to devote their fallow fields to raising potatoes. Potatoes yielded from two to four times more calories per acre than grain did, and eventually came to dominate the food supply in Eastern Europe. Boiled or baked potatoes were cheaper than rye bread, just as nutritious, and did not require a gristmill for grinding. On the other hand, cash-oriented landlords realised that grain was much easier to ship, store and sell, so both grain and potatoes coexisted.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Professor James Meade {{painted a}} bleak {{picture of the}} {{economic}} prospects of Mauritius, which then had a population of 650,000. All the disadvantages associated with smallness of island states weighed heavily in his conviction that Mauritius {{was caught in a}} <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap</b> and, therefore, if economic progress could at all be achieved, it would be to a very limited extent. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order of 4% to 4%. This compares very favourably with other sub-Saharan African countries and is largely due to sustained progress in economic conditions; between 1977 and 2008, growth averaged 4.6% compared with a 2.9% average in sub-Saharan Africa. Also important is that it has achieved what few fast growing economies achieve, a more equitable income distribution and inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) fell from 45.7 to 38.9 between 1980 and 2006. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on expanding local financial institutions and building a domestic information telecommunications industry. Mauritius has attracted more than 9,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India and South Africa, and investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised {{to take advantage of the}} Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of oil rent on {{development}} using a unique panel dataset describing worldwide oil discoveries and extractions. First, we revisit the so-called curse of oil, which contends that oil rent hinders economic development. Exploiting cross-country variations in the timing of oil discoveries {{and the size of}} initial oil in place, we find that, contrary to the oil-curse hypothesis, there is little robust evidence of a negative relationship between oil endowment and economic performance, even after controlling for initial income. Second, based on both cross-country and panel evidence, we find a robust association between oil abundance and population growth, which might suggest a Malthusian effect which reduces the economic growth measured in per capita GDP. We find some evidence that oil abundance increases fertility. On an accounting basis, however, migration plays an even more prominent role in explaining the oil-induced population growth. Furthermore, we show that focusing on material gain may understate the welfare gain from oil abundance, because relative to non-oil countries, oil-rich countries gain more in health improvements. These results suggest that despite the positive oil effect on population growth, oil-rich countries do not suffer from the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap,</b> and overall oil abundance is an economic blessing rather than a curse. resource curse, <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap,</b> oil discoverie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{established}} {{knowledge in}} demography {{and in the}} economic research {{is based on the}} concept of Malthusian stagnation and on the associated concept of the escape from the <b>Malthusian</b> <b>trap.</b> These two fundamental concepts were gradually enforced by numerous other related postulates all aimed at explaining the mechanism of the historical growth of population and of the historical economic growth. Examples of publications based on the established knowledge are closely examined. They are used to show why the established knowledge is scientifically unacceptable. It is also pointed out that the established knowledge is contradicted by data and by their analyses. Interpretations of the historical economic growth and of the historical growth of population has to be based on accepting hyperbolic growth. However, the discussed examples point to a more serious problem in these two fields of research. It is a fundamental systemic problem, the problem associated with the way research is conducted. Doctrines, interpretations and declarations used by the established knowledge have to be accepted by faith. Data are either ignored or manipulated to support preconceived ideas. Contradicting evidence is methodically ignored.   To be recognised as science, demographic and economic research has to adhere to the scientific rules of investigation. Keywords.
