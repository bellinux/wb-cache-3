2500|$|In 1933, Hughes made a {{purchase}} of an unseen luxury steam yacht named the Rover, which was previously owned by British shipping magnate Lord Inchcape. [...] "I {{have never seen}} the Rover but bought it on the blue prints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd's surveyors. <b>My</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> that the English are the most honest race in the world." [...] Hughes renamed the yacht Southern Cross and later sold her to Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren.|$|E

Perusing his note of dissent, President Abu Sayeed Chowdhury asked the Education Minister to convince Prime Minister about Khan's points. In this connection, Dr. Khan said, [...] "Every time I did not like or felt something that was against the law, I gave written notes, and in most cases, <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> saying it {{was bound to be}} accepted".|$|E
2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I think people who spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. <b>My</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go in and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} my {{account of what}} I did in a decade of advising governments and {{teaching}} judicial seminars on commercial law matters in Central and Eastern Europe, beginning in 1991. This article contains my individual reflections on {{more than a dozen}} visits to developing countries in Central and Eastern Europe to advise governments and to educate their judges, and several visits of judges from some of those countries to the United States. In many ways, <b>my</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> typical of United States judges who have done the same kind of work in developing countries. In some ways, <b>my</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> unique. A review of these experiences offers a window on the legal development of developing countries for the past ten or twelve years and on what United States bankruptcy judges have contributed to that effort...|$|R
