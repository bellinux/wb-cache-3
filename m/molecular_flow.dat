25|$|Molecular {{distillation}} is {{vacuum distillation}} below {{the pressure of}} 0.01 torr. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free <b>molecular</b> <b>flow</b> regime, i.e. the mean free path of molecules {{is comparable to the}} size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.|$|E

50|$|The {{definition}} of a free <b>molecular</b> <b>flow</b> depends on the distance scale under consideration. For example, in the interplanetary medium, the plasma is in a free <b>molecular</b> <b>flow</b> regime in scales less than 1 AU; thus, planets and moons are effectively under particle bombardment. However, on larger scales, fluid-like behavior is observed, because the probability of collisions between particles becomes significant.|$|E

Polariscope imaging allowed to evaluate the birefringence change inside the micro-droplets. Directional actuation of the trapped droplet was achieved by cycling laser power with the direction defined by the polarization of the tweezing beam. Micro-actuation resulted from optically-induced birefringence; i. e., a nonlinear optical effect was utilized for mechanical manipulation of the micro-droplet.

It is concluded that: (1) optical outflows are not always accompanied by <b>molecular</b> <b>flows,</b> (2) optical outflows show a higher degree of collimation than their molecular counterparts, and (3) the Herbig-Haro phenomenon is not restricted to low-mass young stellar objects...|$|R

The exact binary collision integral, in the first order Knudsen iteration, is expanded {{as a function of}} Hermite polynomials in molecular velocity. The drag of a sphere at free stream temperature with molecular diffuse reflection is calculated. The results agree well with Millikan's measured values over a wide range of Knudsen number (0. 5 < λ∕d < 10). It is found that the sphere drag of the almost‐free <b>molecular</b> <b>flows</b> normalized by the corresponding collisionless drag is essentially independent of the speed ratio for the present range of calculations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Deep imaging in the 1 - 0 S(1) line of {{molecular}} hydrogen {{was used to}} search for parsec-scale molecular outflows in L 1448, NGC 2071, and NGC 7129. Apart from seven parsecscale flows, 21 other, shorter molecular outflows were found. This means that on average 25 % of the <b>molecular</b> <b>flows</b> are of parsec-scale length, with a variation from 17 to 50 % in the three observed regions. For the 28 outflows, only eight driving sources could be identified with near-infrared sources or nebulosity in our images. Six further sources likely are known deeply embedded Class 0 objects, while for 14 flows no sources could be identified. Therefore, these objects presumably are also deeply embedded, and are good Class 0 candidates. We find no evidence for different absolute lengths of the parsec-scale <b>molecular</b> <b>flows</b> from known Class 0 and Class I sources in the observed regions, i. e. the length of these flows is not indicative of their true age. These flows have broken out of their cloud cores and likely are moving through a medium too tenuous to produce further visible shock emission. Moreover, even for the flows from the Class 0 sources we derive kinematical ages of up to 2 × 10 4 years, comparable to the lifetime of these sources, and indicating that outflow activity must start {{very early in the}} Class 0 phase of star formation, or even before.

Gaede used the name diffusion pump since his design was based on the finding that gas cannot diffuse against the vapor stream, but will be carried with it to the exhaust. However, the principle of operation might be more precisely described as gas-jet pump, since diffusion plays a role also in other high vacuum pumps. In modern text books, the diffusion pump is categorized as a momentum transfer pump.|$|E

Results of measurements of H in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere and of H and D in the thermosphere were used to derive upward fluxes through the daytime thermosphere, showing that the upward fluxes exceeded the corresponding Jeans evaporative escape rates by factors of about 5 for H, and greater than 500 for D...|$|R

This approach proved to be remarkably useful to give new insight on these issues, such as density dependence of the diffusion coefficient.
