5|$|Krembo is a chocolate-coated <b>marshmallow</b> treat {{sold only}} in the winter, and is a very popular {{alternative}} to ice cream. It comes wrapped in colorful aluminum foil, and consists of a round biscuit base covered {{with a dollop of}} <b>marshmallow</b> cream coated in chocolate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marshmallow</b> fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called <b>Marshmallow</b> Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake <b>Marshmallow</b> Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake <b>Marshmallow</b> Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake <b>Marshmallow</b> Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's <b>Marshmallow</b> Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet <b>Marshmallow</b> Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name <b>Marshmallow</b> Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and <b>marshmallow</b> fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a <b>marshmallow</b> and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E

5000|$|Nougats and marshmallows:Nougats and <b>marshmallows</b> are {{confectionery}} foams, full of air. [...] In {{the final}} product, {{there is often}} as much air, or even more, than sugar; for <b>marshmallows,</b> a ratio of 5 parts air to two parts syrup by volume is typical. Chemically, they may be single-phase or two-phased. <b>Marshmallows</b> are stabilized by a colloid like gelatin. Compared to nougats, <b>marshmallows</b> have higher moisture content, are softer and more rubbery, and dry out more easily.|$|R
5000|$|Doumak Inc. {{began its}} marshmallow-making journey in 1921, {{producing}} cast mold <b>marshmallows</b> in Los Angeles, CA. In 1954, Alex Doumakes invented and patented the extrusion process of manufacturing <b>marshmallows.</b> This breakthrough innovation allowed the mass production of <b>marshmallows</b> in a cost-efficient manner. <b>Marshmallows</b> {{went from being}} an expensive confection to an everyday sweet treat and favorite ingredient for many recipes. In 1961, the Doumakes family moved the company to its current location outside Chicago, IL. In 2003, Doumak acquired the Campfire® brand and opened its second manufacturing facility in the Chicago area.|$|R
5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other foods that feature peanut butter and <b>marshmallow</b> fluff, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces <b>Marshmallow</b> Fluff, a brand of <b>marshmallow</b> fluff, produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, frosting, pie and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured peanut butter and <b>Marshmallow</b> Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and <b>marshmallow</b> fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter {{can also be used to}} describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and <b>marshmallow</b> fluff.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{was first}} {{created in the}} early twentieth century after <b>marshmallow</b> creme, a sweet marshmallow-like spread, was invented in Massachusetts. During World War I, a recipe for a peanut butter and <b>marshmallow</b> creme sandwich, the earliest known example of the sandwich, was published. The term “fluffernutter” was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market the sandwich.|$|E

Northwestern archivist Patrick Quinn says {{that students were}} likely [...] "trying {{to get them into}} the tubas, and then started throwing them at each other", leading to the tradition of throwing <b>marshmallows</b> at the field.

50|$|<b>Marshmallows,</b> {{like most}} sweets, are {{sweetened}} with sucrose. They are currently {{prepared by the}} aeration of mixtures of sucrose and proteins to a final density of about 0.5 g/ml. The molecular structure of <b>marshmallows</b> is very basic. It is a sugar solution blended with stabilizing structure agents such as gelatin, xanthan gum, or egg whites. The aforementioned structural components is what prevent the air from escaping and collapsing the <b>marshmallows</b> during aeration.|$|R

5|$|The {{sandwich}} has {{close ties}} to New England, particularly to Somerville, Massachusetts, where Archibald Query invented <b>Marshmallow</b> Fluff, and to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades. Somerville holds an annual festival called What the Fluff? based around celebrating <b>Marshmallow</b> Fluff and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games and a cooking contest based around Fluff and Fluffernutters. In 2011, NASA astronaut Richard Michael Linnehan, {{who was born in}} Lowell, Massachusetts, and ate a Fluffernutter while aboard the International Space Station, acted as one of the contest judges.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} <b>marshmallow</b> fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched <b>marshmallow</b> fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|Marketing {{included}} an MS-DOS computer game, {{part of an}} increasing trend of game tie-ins to movies. J.M. Dillard wrote the film's novelization, which was on The New York Times Best Seller list for four weeks. Paramount sold Star Trek-branded apparel through catalogues, and Kraft made a Star Trek-branded <b>marshmallow</b> dispenser. While Star Trek had a built-in fan market, marketing tie-ins were risky {{at the time and}} even high-grossing films could not guarantee success of related merchandise. Unlike other summer blockbusters, Star Trek had no mass-market appeal and no major food or beverage promotions, but sold pins and posters in theaters, bypassing retailers.|$|E

5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are <b>marshmallow</b> color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the <b>marshmallow</b> experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Marge's absence is {{felt at home}} as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's <b>marshmallow</b> squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E

5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that winds through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each sneeze, who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper <b>Marshmallow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Serendipity 3 was a 1950s style diner, {{featuring}} burgers, {{fries and}} ice cream delicacies. Portions were extremely large. The ice cream parlor themed restaurant, which was {{a branch of the}} New York City Serendipity 3 establishment, opened in 2009. In addition to seating in the dining area and counter seating, there was a patio with views of the Strip and the Caesars Palace fountains. Besides its giant hamburger, the restaurant was known for its Triple Decker Grilled Cheese sandwich and a The Hangover omelet made with bacon, cheese, French fries, and mushrooms. Ice cream sundaes featured a choice of toppings including butterscotch sauce, chocolate sauce, hot fudge, <b>marshmallow</b> sauce, Oreo kisses, peanut butter sauce, rainbow sprinkles, raspberry sauce, etc. Other options included Fried Twinkies, brownies, and the Golden Opulence sundae, an indulgent $1,000 US sundae, which holds the Guinness World Record for the Most Expensive Ice Cream Sundae in the World.

40|$|AIM: Anecdotally, many ostomates {{believe that}} eating <b>marshmallows</b> can reduce {{ileostomy}} effluent. There is a plausible mechanism for this, as the gelatine contained in <b>marshmallows</b> may thicken small bowel fluid, {{but there is}} currently no evidence that this is effective. METHOD: This was a randomized crossover trial. Adult patients with well-established ileostomies were included. Ileostomy output was measured for 1  week during which three <b>marshmallows</b> were consumed three times daily, and for one control week where <b>marshmallows</b> were not eaten. There was a 2 -day washout period. Patients were randomly allocated to whether the control or intervention week occurred first. In addition, a questionnaire was administered regarding patient 2 ̆ 7 s subjective experience of their ileostomy function. RESULTS: Thirty-one participants were recruited; 28 completed the study. There was a median reduction in ileostomy output volume of 75  ml per day {{during the study period}} (P =  0. 0054, 95...|$|R
