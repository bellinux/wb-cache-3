40|$|Popular {{methods of}} {{decision-making}} in <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> condition management {{do not fully}} consider peculiarities of their up-to-date operation. These approaches do {{not take into account}} the kinds of uncertainty occurring at a building designing stage and taking place while monitoring. It leads to the decrease in building targeted application efficiency and increase of controlling organization costs. The following approach suggests the improvement in the decision-making support systems by integration of expert knowledge and experience with tool and visual <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> control results. The purpose of the paper is effective decision-making aimed at uncertainty level decrease in the process of detection of operational impacts on <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> for the required durability provision.

The basic equations for the identification of time-varying structural parameters and unknown excitations of a semi-active damper-controlled <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> are first presented. The basic equations for semi-active vibration control of the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> with time-varying structural parameters and unknown excitations are then put forward.
