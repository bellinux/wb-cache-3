One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E

5|$|More {{than half}} of the American {{battalion}} was lost during its first engagement. Only 354 members of the battalion, including some walking wounded, were able to report for duty the next day. A captured North Korean soldier reported that around 100 men had been captured at Hadong. A later search uncovered 313 American bodies, most along the river and in the rice paddies south of the pass. Official casualties for the Americans in the battle were 242 killed, 135 wounded, 51 captured, and 67 <b>missing,</b> <b>for</b> a total of 495 casualties.

5|$|On 20 June, Company C, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry (C/2-503) {{discovered}} {{the bodies of}} a Special Forces CIDG unit that had been <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> four days on Hill 1338, the dominant hill mass south of Dak To. Supported by A/2-503, the Americans moved {{up the hill and}} set up for the night. At 06:58 the following morning, Alpha Company began moving alone up a ridge finger and triggered an ambush by the 6th Battalion of the 24th PAVN Regiment. Charlie Company was ordered to support, but heavy vegetation and difficult terrain made movement extremely difficult. Artillery support was rendered ineffective by the limited range of visibility. Close air support was impossible for the same reasons. Alpha Company managed to survive repeated attacks throughout the day and night, but the cost was heavy. Of the 137 men that comprised the unit, 76 had been killed and another 23 wounded. A search of the battlefield revealed only 15 dead North Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels {{include two}} sceptres {{originally}} made for Mary of Modena, {{the wife of}} JamesII, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband GeorgeVI in 1937. For the coronation of MaryII, the wife and joint sovereign of WilliamIII, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> several decades, only {{to be found in}} 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.|$|E
