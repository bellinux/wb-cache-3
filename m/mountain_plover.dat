50|$|The {{population}} of plovers in Wyoming {{is lower than}} that of other states, but Wyoming’s {{population of}} <b>mountain</b> <b>plovers</b> and mostly intact expanses of grazed rangeland will probably become much more important in the coming years as urban and agricultural development continues in contiguous states.|$|R
5000|$|Vast {{majority}} of Charadriidae have a socially monogamous mating system. Some, such as Northern lapwings, are polygynyous, others, such as <b>mountain</b> <b>plovers</b> have a rapid multiple-clutch {{system that can}} be accompanied by sequential polyandry. In Eurasian dotterels, females compete for males and males provide all parental care. [...] While breeding, they defend their territories with highly visible aerial displays.|$|R
50|$|Around late July, <b>mountain</b> <b>plovers</b> {{leave their}} {{breeding}} range {{for a period}} of post-breeding wandering around the southern Great Plains. Little is known about their movements at this time, although they are regularly seen around Walsh, Colorado and on sod farms in central New Mexico. By early November, most move southward and westward to their wintering grounds. Spring migration is apparently direct and non-stop.|$|R

5000|$|The word plover {{came from}} a Latin world pluvia which means [...] "rain". In Medieval England some migratory birds became known as plovers because they {{returned}} to their breeding grounds each spring with rain. In 1832 American naturalist John Kirk Townsend spotted a species of unknown bird near the Rocky Mountains, and assumed that all these birds live in mountains. The plover comes back each spring to its breeding grounds, and so the wrong name <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> {{was given to the}} species. The <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> is 8 to 9.5 inches (20 to 24 cm) long and weighs about 3.7 ounces (105 grams). Its wingspread is 17.5 to 19.5 inches (44.5 to 49.5 cm). The mountain plover's call consists of a low, variable whistle. Both sexes are of the same size. In appearance it is typical of Charadrius plovers, except that unlike most, it has no band across the breast. The upperparts are sandy brown and the underparts and face are whitish. There are black feathers on the forecrown and a black stripe from each eye to the bill (the stripe is brown and may be indistinct in winter); otherwise the plumage is plain. The <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> is much quieter than its relative the killdeer. Its calls are variable, often low-pitched trilled or gurgling whistles. In courtship it makes a sound much like a far-off cow mooing.|$|E
50|$|A 2005 report {{details that}} in a study {{conducted}} by Stephen J Dinsmore, Gary C White, and Fritz L Knopf, the populations of mountain plovers and prairie dogs in southern Phillips County in north-central Montana were observed in the effort to provide clues about the ecosystem and <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> preservation. Mountain plovers like to build their habitats in prairie dog colonies, meaning that an increase in prairie dogs will coincide with an increase in mountain plovers. This knowledge can be useful in <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> conservation efforts. The loss of prairie dog colonies is a huge threat to mountain plovers in Montana; if prairie dog colonies can be preserved, there is a greater chance that mountain plovers can be saved. Other proposed plans of preservation include protecting remaining breeding and wintering habitats, and stopping the conversion of grasslands for agricultural purposes.|$|E
50|$|High {{above the}} desert floor, the Ferris Mountains and Green Mountains rim the Red Desert to the northeast. The mountains' boreal {{environment}} reaches {{as high as}} 10037 ft, {{in the case of}} Ferris Peak, and supports snowshoe hares, red squirrels, and pockets of big horn sheep. The high elevation with its cooler summer range attracts elk and mule deer. Prairie falcons, northern harriers and other raptors soar along mountain ridges and canyon rims looking for feed such as migratory <b>mountain</b> <b>plovers,</b> a small ground bird.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} circulating plasma prolactin (PRL) {{levels in}} incubating <b>Mountain</b> <b>Plovers,</b> a shorebird of conservation concern with an uncommon parental care system where {{males and females}} tend to separate nests. We modeled PRL related to {{the sex of the}} incubating bird and examined how it varied throughout incubation and the nesting season. PRL levels were similar for incubating male and female <b>Mountain</b> <b>Plovers.</b> The mean circulating plasma PRL concentration for incubating female plovers was 32. 40 ng/ml (n = 33) and ranged from 7. 33 to 78. 04 ng/ml. The mean for males was 29. 36 ng/ml (n = 36) and there was greater variation in the samples with the lowest measured at 5. 18 ng/ml and highest at 140. 86 ng/ml. There was no relationship between day of incubation and the concentration of circulating PRL for either incubating female plovers or male plovers and day of incubation did not explain a significant proportion of the variance in PRL concentration for either sex (R 2 = 0. 002 and 0. 034 respectively). There was no relationship between the Julian day of nesting season and concentration of circulating PRL for either sex and day of season did not explain a significant proportion of the variance for either females (R 2 = 0. 047) or males (R 2 = 0. 001). This study provides further information about the relationship between parental care and circulating PRL and the breeding biology of a shorebird of conservation concern...|$|R

50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius montanus) is a {{medium-sized}} ground {{bird in the}} plover family (Charadriidae). It is misnamed, as it lives on level land. Unlike most plovers, it is usually not found near bodies of water or even on wet soil; it prefers dry habitat with short grass (usually due to grazing) and bare ground.|$|E
50|$|In Oklahoma, 90% of mapped <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> {{locations}} are in cultivated fields, often bare and flat. Their preferred land areas contain clay loam soils, as the sandier soils are less reliable when sand {{can easily be}} blown around, covering nests, obscuring vision, and irritating eyes. Additional study is needed to help ensure the continued presence of mountain plovers in Oklahoma.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> is one {{of three}} species {{protected}} by the Endangered Species Act present in the Red Desert. The bald eagle and the black-footed ferret are also listed. However, the bald eagle is seldom seen in the desert {{because of the lack of}} streams or lakes with accompanying fish. Black-footed ferrets, which feed upon prairie dogs, are also rare.|$|E
50|$|The {{connection}} between <b>mountain</b> <b>plovers</b> and prairie dogs is particularly strong in Montana, but less {{so in the}} grasslands of Colorado and the grasslands and shrub-steppe habitats of Wyoming. In places where prairie dogs aren’t as prominent in the ecosystem, fire or grazing can act as substitutes for prairie dogs in creating suitable plover nesting because they maintain low vegetation. In the construction of suitable plover habitats, more success would be found in short-grass prairie habitats. However, concerning conservation, {{a large portion of}} the overall plover population breeds near the northern limit of their range in Montana, and it would be wise to make this area a conservation priority.|$|R

50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>plovers</b> nest on {{bare ground}} {{in early spring}} (April in {{northern}} Colorado). The breeding territory must have bare round with short, sparse vegetation. Plovers usually select a breeding range that they share with bison and black tailed prairie dogs. These animals are grazers that keep vegetation short. Plovers like to nest among prairie dog colonies because the foraging and burrowing that these animals do expose even more bare soil which creates an ideal habitat for plover nest sites. It is believed that plovers like to nest on bare soil because they blend into the land hiding them from birds that may pray on them and the short vegetation allows them to easily detect predators on the ground. It is also believed {{it is easier for}} them to spot insects to eat.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>plover</b> populations should {{continue}} to be monitored and investigated so as to understand how to support their survival. Plovers are important to the ecosystem at large because they are considered indicators of the health of their respective habitats. Local population managers can best help the plovers by protecting the land and prairie dog colonies from human disturbances such as mining, and monitoring the size and health of suitable plover habitat in each region.|$|E

Endangered reptiles in the valley includes Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the terms}} 'keystone' and 'engineer' are used interchangeably, {{they are not}} synonyms. In North America, the prairie dog is an {{ecosystem}} engineer. Prairie dog burrows provide the nesting areas for <b>mountain</b> <b>plovers</b> and burrowing owls. Prairie dog tunnel systems also help channel rainwater into the water table to prevent runoff and erosion, and can also serve to change {{the composition of the}} soil in a region by increasing aeration and reversing soil compaction that can be a result of cattle grazing. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators. Even grazing species such as plains bison, pronghorn, and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs. It is believed that they prefer the plant community which results after prairie dogs have foraged through the area.|$|R
40|$|This {{summer was}} marked by {{continuing}} high water tables along the Missouri River and good water levels in the eastern Rainwater Basin. As a result, American and Least Bitterns, King Rail, Common Moorhen, and several American Coot nests in Sarpy Co were reported. However, Great and Snowy Egrets were scarce, and Black-necked Stilts were absent from the eastern Rainwater Basin after several good breeding years there. First breeding records for the state are always exciting; Lesser Goldfinch finally took the plunge this year in Banner Co. Also encouraging were increased reports of Black-billed Cuckoo (9) and both Black-billed Magpie and Black-capped Chickadee. <b>Mountain</b> <b>Plovers</b> are present in southwest Kimball Co in surprising numbers, with excellent conservation work being done there. The group responsible for the effort has an excellent Facebook site (see species account). Significant breeding records were made for Burrowing Owl, Long-eared Owl, and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Blackbird. Strangely, three species of migrant warblers were found in midsummer: Orange-crowned, Nashville, and Blackburnian, {{as well as a}} late June White-crowned Sparrow.

50|$|It breeds in {{the high}} plains of North America from extreme southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan to {{northern}} New Mexico and the Texas panhandle, {{as well as an}} isolated site in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. About 85 percent of the population winters in the San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys in California. Its winter range also extends along the U.S.-Mexican border, more extensively on the Mexican side. The <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> needs about 70 acres of territory for breeding, and about 25 acres for survival in non-breeding times.|$|E
50|$|In {{the species}} that incubate, the work is divided {{differently}} between the sexes. Possibly the most common pattern is that the female does all the incubation, as in the canary and the Indian robin, or most of it, as is typical of falcons. In some species, such as the whooping crane, the male and the female take turns incubating the egg. In others, such as the cassowaries, only the male incubates. The male <b>mountain</b> <b>plover</b> incubates the female's first clutch, but if she lays a second, she incubates it herself. In hoatzins, some birds (mostly males) help their parents incubate later broods.|$|E

40|$|On 18 May 1995 I {{observed}} two adult <b>Mountain</b> <b>Plovers</b> 5 mi {{west and}} 1. 25 mi north of Bushnell in southwest Kimball county. The birds {{were in an}} area of short-grass prairie interspersed with clumps of prickly pear and bare ground. I observed both birds almost continuously from 1 - 2 p. m. MDT. The first bird was along the road south of the fenceline, just after the road climbs on top of the plateau. The second bird was about 0. 1 mi to the north {{on the west side of}} the road. Both birds were medium-sized, plain shorebirds, similar in shape and posture to a Killdeer. The crown, nape, mantle, and upperwings were pale brown. The forehead and lores were white with a narrow black band separating them from the brown crown. The underparts were white with some buffy wash on the flanks. The legs were long and pale-colored. The posture was very upright, unlike other plovers. At approximately 1 : 45 p. m. I located the nest of the first bird. It contained three eggs and was 15 m east of the road on top of the plateau. The nest was a shallow depression in the ground, lined with small pebbles.

40|$|There {{was much}} of {{interest}} this spring. Early and late dates, early breeding, {{even a few}} rarities, are scattered through the species accounts. A few highlights are mentioned here. Mark Brogie found 6 species of Gallinaceous birds in one hour in Knox Co—quite a feat. Glossy Ibis reports continue to increase, and Mississippi Kites were found in new areas. Cranes made news: a leucistic Sandhill, another Common, and good numbers of Whoopings. Piping Plovers may be spreading out a bit, given {{the disappearance of the}} expanses of sand at L McConaughy, and amazing finds are being made by the team studying <b>Mountain</b> <b>Plovers</b> in Kimball County. Several shorebird species made a huge push 30 Apr: check out the accounts, beginning with American Avocet. The shorebird star had to be Bailey, the transmitter-wearing Long-billed Curlew, who made a rapid transit from wintering to summering grounds. Not far behind was XN, a banded Hudsonian Godwit seen on Chiloe Island, Chile, and next in Dakota Co, Nebraska. Black-billed Magpies have been hit hard in recent years and their progress is mixed, but Carolina Wrens took a beating last winter. A few survived, however, and we will watch their progress. A Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Wren was a rarity in the southwest, but there was no doubt that the top rarity for the season was the Hermit Warbler photographed at Crescent L NWR; it was Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s second. Additional rare Parulids found were Pine and Hooded Warblers.

50|$|Prairie {{dogs were}} once the most {{abundant}} animals in the short grass prairie, living in colonies across a range that historically spanned 11 states.
