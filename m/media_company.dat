Our research question is Does {{the emergence of new}} terminals generate significant imact on the telecommunications carriers and the TV <b>media</b> <b>companies?</b> The results show that the impacts of new terminals appear differently on telecommunications carriers and on TV <b>media</b> <b>companies.</b> 1) Regarding telecommunications carriers, some of the smartphone and tablet PCs generate significant positive imapct or no impact on smartphoner (or tablet PC) -affiliated telecom carriers, but generate significant negative impact on non-smartphone (or tablet PC) -related telecom carriers, 2) Regarding TV <b>media</b> <b>companies,</b> tablet PCs and smart TVs do not generate any significant impact on any researched TV medeia companies.
