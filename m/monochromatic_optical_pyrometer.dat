40|$|INGENIERIE+FRMThe {{temperature}} prevailing in {{the catalyst}} bed {{of three different}} IR spectroscopic reaction cells was assessed by means of thermocouples, an <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> and reaction rate measurements. One of the cells was a custom-made transmission FT-IR cell for use with thin wafers and the two others were commercial Harrick and Spectra-Tech diffuse reflectance FT-IR (DRIFTS) cells used {{for the analysis of}} powdered samples. The rate of CO methanation measured over a 16 wt% Ni/alumina catalyst was used as a means to derive the effective temperature prevailing in the IR cells from that existing in a traditional (non-spectroscopic) reactor having a well-controlled temperature. The sample bed of these three IR cells exhibited a significantly lower temperature than that of the corresponding measure thermocouple, which was yet located in or close to the sample bed. The comparison of Arrhenius plots enabled us to determine a temperature correction valid over a large temperature range. The use of an <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> was assessed with a view to determining the temperature of the surface of the powdered beds and that at the centre of the wafer. The <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> proved useful {{in the case of the}} catalyst powder, which behaved as a black non-reflecting body. In contrast, the temperature reading was inaccurate in the case of the pressed wafer, probably due to the shiny surface and minute thickness of the wafer, which led to a significant portion of the IR radiation of the surroundings being reflected by and transmitted through the wafer. The <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> data showed that the temperature of the surface of the powdered beds was significantly lower than that of the bulk of the bed, and that the total flow rate and composition did not affect this value. This work emphasises that the effective bed temperature in spectroscopic cells can be significantly different from that given by measure thermocouples, even when located in the vicinity of the sample, but that the calibration curves derived from rate measurements can be used to overcome this problem...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{pyrometry}} is the sensing {{of thermal}} radiation emitted from an object using a photoconductive device to convert photons into electrons, {{and is an}} important diagnostic tool in shock physics experiments. Data obtained from an <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> {{can be used to}} generate a blackbody curve of the material prior to and after being shocked by a high speed projectile. The sensing element consists of an InGaAs photodiode array, biasing circuitry, and multiple transimpedance amplifiers to boost the weak photocurrent from the noisy dark current into a signal that can eventually be digitized. Once the circuit elements have been defined, more often than not commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are inadequate to satisfy every requirement for the diagnostic, and therefore a custom application specific design has to be considered. This thesis outlines the initial challenges with integrating the photodiode array block with multiple COTS transimpedance amplifiers onto a single chip, and offers a solution to a comparable <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> that uses the same type of photodiodes in conjunction with a re-designed transimpedance amplifier integrated onto a single chip. The final design includes a thorough analysis of the transimpedance amplifier along with modeling the circuit behavior which entails schematics, simulations, and layout. An alternative circuit is also investigated that incorporates an approach to multiplex the signals from each photodiode onto one data line and not only increases the viable real estate on the chip, but also improves the behavior of the photodiodes as they are subjected to less thermal load. The <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for shock physic experiments includes a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a 100 kΩ gain operating at bandwidth of 30 MHz, and an input-referred noise RMS current of 50 nA that is capable of driving a 50 Ω load...|$|R

25|$|For {{refractory}} materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely {{high melting point}} (typically considered to be above, say, 1800°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer.</b> For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body {{is known to be}} a function of its temperature. An <b>optical</b> <b>pyrometer</b> matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck's law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.|$|R

Silver paste was used as an adhesive to join the ends of the CNT structures and the copper electrodes. Combustion was initiated by tungsten Joule heating at {{the leading edge of the}} CNT/fuel structures.
