5000|$|In December 1953 the FCC {{unanimously}} approved what is {{now called}} the NTSC color television standard (later defined as RS-170a). The compatible color standard retained full backward compatibility with existing black-and-white television sets. Color information was added to the black-and-white image by introducing a color subcarrier of precisely 315/88 MHz (usually described as 3.579545 MHz or 3.58 MHz). The precise frequency was chosen so that horizontal line-rate <b>modulation</b> <b>components</b> of the chrominance signal would fall exactly in between the horizontal line-rate <b>modulation</b> <b>components</b> of the luminance signal, thereby enabling the chrominance signal to be filtered out of the luminance signal with minor degradation of the luminance signal. Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits at the time the color standard was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz. [...] The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz = 9/572 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by existing television receivers.|$|E

The adaptation paradigm paired a 0. 2 Hz sinusoidal rotation about an earth vertical axis with a 0. 2 Hz optokinetic stimulus that was deliberately mismatched in peak velocity or phase and was designed to produce short-term changes in the COR. Preadaptation and postadaptation OOR tests occurred at a constant velocity of 60 degrees/sec {{in the dark and}} produced a <b>modulation</b> <b>component</b> of the slow phase velocity with a frequency of 0. 16 Hz due to otolithic stimulation by the sinusoidally changing gravity vector.
