40|$|The {{study of}} <b>metal</b> <b>partition</b> {{patterns}} in the tidal flats of the Marennes Oleron Bay shows that the <b>metal</b> <b>partition</b> {{patterns in the}} superficial sediments indicate that the {{major part of the}} mobile fraction of metals is associated with Fe-Mn oxides.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the behaviour of Fe and Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn in acid sulfate soil materials. Acid sulfate soil chemistry is strongly affected by Fe, and Fe mineralogy is highly dependent on the redox conditions. Under reducing conditions Fe(II) minerals such as pyrite dominate soil mineralogy, whereas under oxic conditions Fe(III) minerals such as schwertmannite and jarosite dominate. Ideally, any method used to assess <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> should be able to distinguish the Fe(II) and Fe(III) mineral pools present under both oxidising and reducing conditions. A novel sequential extraction procedure was developed, assessed, and then used to examine <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> in acid sulfate soil materials. The procedure employs six steps to quantify (i) “labile” (magnesium chloride extractable) (ii) “acid-soluble” (hydrochloric acid extractable) (iii) “organic-bound” (pyrophosphate extractable) (iv) “crystalline oxide” (citrate buffered dithionite extractable) (v) “pyritic” (nitric acid extractable) and (vi) “residual” (acid/peroxide digestible) pools of Fe and trace elements. The sequential extraction procedure was shown to adequately <b>partition</b> <b>metals</b> into operationally defined fractions of environmental significance in ASS landscapes, including Fe associated with pyrite, a key mineral in acid sulfate soil chemistry. Standard laboratory methods use dried and ground soil on which to perform routine analysis, procedures which greatly alter the redox conditions of reduced acid sulfate soil materials, potentially altering solid-phase <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning.</b> To address these potential artifacts of oxidation, <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> was examined in both the oven-dried and ground and field condition soil samples. Extensive partitioning changes occurred for many metals in the oven-dried and ground soil compared to soil in field condition. Consequently, field condition soils were analysed during all subsequent <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> studies. <b>Metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> changes during short-term oxidation and acidification of ASS materials were also examined in detail. In general, it was found that oxidation resulted in the repartitioning of metals from oxidisable fractions (i. e. “pyritic” and “organic”) to the “acidsoluble” fraction. Following the onset of extremely acid conditions, metals associated with the “acid-soluble” were fraction were re-partitioned into the “labile” (i. e. environmentally available) fraction. Finally, the sequential extraction procedure was used to determine how metals were repartitioned in an acidic ASS landscape following the re-introduction of tidal inundation. The acidified soil profile displayed extensive mobilisation of Cu, Mn and Ni, whilst sequestration of these same metals was observed in the tidally re-inundated site. The majority of the metals were sequestered in the “acid-soluble” fraction, which is dominated by poorly ordered Fe(III) minerals, although there was also an observable increase in both the “organic” and “pyritic” fractions following the shift to reducing, circum-neutral geochemical conditions. The new sequential extraction procedure provides an important tool to examine the partitioning of iron and trace elements in acid sulfate soil landscapes. Furthermore, it is a simple and routine means able to evaluate likely trace element partitioning behaviour under the dynamic redox conditions that characterise many acid sulfate soil environments...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{equilibrium}} modelling {{provides a}} mechanistic {{tool for the}} prediction of <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> in soils, which is important in predicting the fate and effects of metals in soil systems. In order {{to set up an}} equilibrium model of <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> in soil systems, thermodynamic data for all processes influencing metal fate in soil systems are needed. In this work, the adsorption of the metals nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead by δ-MnO₂ is investigated. This was done in order to provide thermodynamic data for an important adsorption phase in soils systems. Before this work, consistent adsorption data for only one adsorption phase, hydrous ferric oxide, were available. This precluded the inclusion of manganese dioxide in equilibrium models of metal fate in soil systems. Surface complexation properties of a synthetic manganese dioxide were investigated using glass electrode potentiometry. Experimental data were interpreted according to the surface complexation model in conjunction with the diffuse double layer model of the solid/solution interface. Adsorption constants were derived using the non-linear optimization program FITEQL. The surface complexation parameters determined in this fashion were validated against results obtained from the open literature. Following this, the surface complexation parameters were included in a chemical equilibrium model of soil systems. This model was used to predict the partitioning of nickel, copper, zinc, lead and cadmium in a number of soil samples collected in The Netherlands. Contrary to results presented by other workers, it was found that a non-homogeneous surface site model was needed to explain the potentiometric data obtained for proton and metal adsorption by manganese dioxide. Best fits of alkalimetric titration data were obtained with a two-site, three surface-species model of the δ-MnO₂ surface. Site concentrations of 2. 231 x 10 ⁻³ mol. g⁻¹ and 7. 656 x 10 ⁻⁴ mol. g⁻¹ were obtained.

In this Paper I {{of a series of}} three, we derive results, mainly at z= 0, on the temperature and entropy profiles of the ICM, its X-ray luminosity, the cluster cold components (cold fraction as well as mass [...] to [...] light ratio) and the metal distribution between ICM and stars. In general, models with efficient super-winds, along with a top-heavy stellar IMF, are able to reproduce fairly well the observed L_X-T relation, the entropy profiles and the cold fraction. Observed radial ICM temperature profiles can be matched, except for the gradual decline in temperature inside of r∼ 0. 1 R_vir. Metal enrichment of the ICM gives rise to somewhat steep inner iron gradients; yet, the global level of enrichment compares well to observational estimates after correcting for the stars formed at late times {{at the base of the}} cooling flows; also the <b>metal</b> <b>partition</b> between stars and ICM gets into good agreement with observations.

40|$|Environmental {{protection}} {{agencies are}} now looking to biomarkers to enhance current environmental impact assessment procedures and monitoring programmes. The quantification of levels of metallothionein (MT) induction is proposed as a biological indicator for metal exposure. Concentrations of MT in the gill tissues of Mytilus edulis from various sites within Plymouth Sound and Estuaries SAC/SPA and the Fal and Helford SAC were quantified using differential pulse polarography (DPP). In an attempt to enhance this technique sub-cellular <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> was examined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). DPP highlighted significant differences in MT concentrations, which ranged from 0. 57 mg g'^ dw to a maximum value of 2. 86 mg g"^ dw. Of the four metals tested, it appears that Cu, Cd and Ag, but not Zn, {{may be responsible for}} the elevated levels of MT found in this study. Some evidence from the <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> analysis of MT affinity relationships and the spill-over model are discussed. These results show that analysis of levels of MT induction in mussel gill tissue is capable of detecting anthropogenic metal contamination in estuarine conditions; however, further work is suggested to improve definition in the results.

40|$|Salt marshes provide {{environmental}} {{conditions that are}} known to affect metal speciation in sediments. The elevational gradient along the marsh and consequent differential flooding {{are some of the}} major factors influencing halophytic species distribution and coverage due to their differential tolerance to salinity and submersion. Different species, in turn, also have distinct influences on the sediment's metal speciation, and its metal accumulation abilities. The present work aimed to evaluate how different halophyte species in two different salt marshes could influence <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> in the sediment at root depth and how that could differ from bare sediments. Metal speciation in sediments around the roots (rhizosediments) of Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia fruticosa and Spartina maritima was determined by sequentially extracting operationally defined fractions with solutions of increasing strength and acidity. Ros ario salt marsh generally showed higher concentrations of all metals in the rhizosediments. <b>Metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> was primarily related to the type of metal, with the elements' chemistry overriding the environment's influence on fractionation schemes. The most mobile elements were Cd and Zn, with greater availability being found in non-vegetated sediments. Immobilization in rhizosediments was predominantly influenced by the presence of Fe and Mn oxides, as well as organic complexes. In the more mature of both salt marshes, the differences between vegetated and non-vegetated sediments were more evident regarding S. fruticosa, while in the younger system al...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was conducted}} of trial burn, feed, and waste {{data from the}} Department of Energy-Oak Ridge Toxic Substances Control Act Incinerator (TSCAI) to determine if metal concentrations in the ash could be predicted from known feed data and operating conditions. The data suggest that even non-volatile <b>metals</b> may not <b>partition</b> to ash if solids are not {{a component of the}} waste feed. Ash partitioning coefficients were calculated for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and uranium for the time period September 1995 to September 1997. The amount of <b>metal</b> <b>partitioning</b> to ash was less than expected for arsenic, chromium, and uranium and more than expected for cadmium. The amount of lead and mercury partitioning to ash were approximately what was expected. Predictions of metal concentrations in the ash on a monthly basis were not possible due to the variability of the data...|$|R
