40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the automation of tests of the thermostats developed by the company Honeywell. The first chapter presents a problem of self-testing of thermostats, followed by a discussion of possible approaches to solutions. Attention is paid to testing the functionality of the HMI of thermostats, especially to the part of the system, that deals with activation of touchscteen, but no other part of the problem are omitted in the text. Discussions of the problematic passes into the design and implementation of specific design solutions. The selected design of 3 D-router, which moves in three orthogonal coordinates and resembles to a coordinate drill for example. First, it describes the basic concepts of mechanic and electronic part of equipment, and subsequently is designed and implemented control electronics for <b>mechanical</b> <b>activator</b> HMI. Each of the electronics components are described in detail and values of parts are based on the calculation with the exception of finished parts. The proposal of the electronics follows the possibility of maximization of universality module for applications in similar applications. The functionality of the electronics is controlled by a microprocessor with a custom program that is described in the work. Source code of some the programs is not available because it is know-how of the company. Next part of the thesis deals with optimization of the moving of axes, optimization is done empirically by measuring. An important issue is compliance with the accuracy required position, also part of the work is devoted to the issue of calibration position. Finally is solved the continuity on the superior system. It is designed and implemented the upper layer of the communication protocol used in the company. Work is the solution of specific corporate award thesis. Although it is a very specific role of the works are generally applicable for other applications. In particular, the proposed electronic represents relatively universal controller for stepper motor control...|$|E
50|$|It was {{important}} for the investigation to establish {{the position of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>activators</b> on the flaps, since the fact that they weren't activated was a fundamental cause of the accident. A special investigation was carried out to establish what had happened with the flaps. The extended flaps alter the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft, giving the aircraft lift to get off the ground at a lower speed over a shorter distance than would be possible without flaps. Even if it had been possible to reach the take-off speed without flaps {{before the end of the}} runway, it would still have been necessary to have enough runway. This is why in practice, there are no runways that would allow the take-off of medium- to large- size aircraft without flaps.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. After the {{processes}} of crushing, screening and grinding, abandoned mortar powder {{can be used as}} a mineral admixture to replace cement. Physical-activating, alkali-activating and compound-activating have been used to stimulate the activity of abandoned mortar power. To get the mechanical properties and microstructure, compressive strength, flexural strength, XRD, TG-DTA and SEM were used. The results show that: <b>Mechanical</b> grinding and <b>activator</b> can greatly improve the activity of mortar power. Stimulating effect of compound activator was better than signal activator and it could promote further hydration of cement. The mortar which is stimulated by compound activator had higher strength than mortar by single activator. It can be seen from micro-test that the mortar with compound activator had more ettringite and other hydration products, and with compact structure...|$|R
40|$|This {{innovation}} {{consists of}} a pyrotechnic initiator and piezoelectric initiation system. The device will be capable of being initiated mechanically; resisting initiation by EMF, RF, and EMI (electromagnetic field, radio frequency, and electromagnetic interference, respectively); and initiating in water environments and space environments. Current devices of this nature are initiated by the mechanical action of a firing pin against a primer. Primers historically are prone to failure. These failures {{are commonly known as}} misfires or hang-fires. In many cases, the primer shows the dent where the firing pin struck the primer, but the primer failed to fire. In devices such as "T" handles, which are commonly used to initiate the blowout of canopies, loss of function of the device may result in loss of crew. In devices such as flares or smoke generators, failure can result in failure to spot a downed pilot. The piezoelectrically initiated ignition system {{consists of a}} pyrotechnic device that plugs into a <b>mechanical</b> system (<b>activator),</b> which on activation, generates a high-voltage spark. The activator, when released, will strike a stack of electrically linked piezo crystals, generating a high-voltage, low-amperage current that is then conducted to the pyro-initiator. Within the initiator, an electrode releases a spark that passes through a pyrotechnic first-fire mixture, causing it to combust. The combustion of the first-fire initiates a primary pyrotechnic or explosive powder. If used in a "T" handle, the primary would ramp the speed of burn up to the speed of sound, generating a shock wave that would cause a high explosive to go "high order. " In a flare or smoke generator, the secondary would produce the heat necessary to ignite the pyrotechnic mixture. The piezo activator subsystem is redundant in that a second stack of crystals would be struck at the same time with the same activation force, doubling the probability of a first strike spark generation. If the first activation fails to ignite, the device is capable of multiple attempts. Another unique aspect is {{in the design of the}} pyrotechnic device. There is an electrode that aids the generation of a directed spark and the use of a conductive matrix to support the first-fire material so that the spark will penetrate to the second electrode...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Endovascular {{mechanical}} thrombectomy may be {{used during}} acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel intracranial occlusion. First-generation MERCI devices achieved recanalization rates of 48 % and, when coupled with intraarterial thrombolytic drugs, recanalization rates of 60 % have been reported. Enhancements in embolectomy device design may improve recanalization rates. Methods—Multi MERCI was an international, multicenter, prospective, single-arm trial of thrombectomy in patients with large vessel stroke treated within 8 hours of symptom onset. Patients with persistent large vessel occlusion after IV tissue plasminogen activator treatment were included. Once the newer generation (L 5 Retriever) device became available, investigators were instructed to use the L 5 Retriever to open vessels and could subsequently use older generation devices and/or intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator. Primary outcome was recanalization of the target vessel. Results—One hundred sixty-four patients received thrombectomy and 131 were initially treated with the L 5 Retriever. Mean ageSD was 6816 years, and baseline median (interquartile range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 19 (15 to 23). Treatment with the L 5 Retriever resulted in successful recanalization in 75 of 131 (57. 3 %) treatable vessels and in 91 of 131 (69. 5 %) after adjunctive therapy (intraarterial tissue plasminogen <b>activator,</b> <b>mechanical).</b> Overall, favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2) occurred in 36 % and mortality was 34 %; both outcomes {{were significantly related to}} vascular recanalization.

40|$|In acute {{myocardial}} infarction, myocardial salvage {{is dependent}} on rapid restoration of blood flow. Pharmacologic (streptokinase, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen <b>activator),</b> <b>mechanical</b> (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, guide wire perforation) or combined forms of reperfusion therapy can accomplish this goal, but their effects on infarctcd myocardium and vessel occlusion site have not been compared at necropsy. The heart of 19 necropsy patients who had received various forms of acute reperfusion therapy was studied: 14 had pharmacologic or combined forms of reperfusion therapy (13 streptokinase and 1 tissue-type plasminogen activator, including 4 with combined balloon angioplasty) and 5 had had purely mechanical (balloon angioplasty) reperfusion therapy. Reperfusion was initially clinically successful in all 19 patients with the average time from onset of symptoms to reperfusion being 3. 7 hours. Necropsy observations separated the 19 patients into distinct subgroups based on changes in the myocardium and infarct-related coronary arteries. Of the 19 patients, 14 (74 %) had hemorrhagic myocardial infarction and they all received pharmacologic or combined forms of reperfusion therapy. The remaining five patients (26 %) had nonhemorrhagic (anemic) infarction and were treated with balloon angioplasty therapy alone. Increased luminal cross-sectional area was present in 8 of 9 patients with acute balloon angioplasty but severe coronary atherosclerotic plaque remained in 9 of 10 patients without acute balloon angioplasty. Severe hemorrhage surrounded angioplasty sites in all four patients who also received streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator. Severe bleeding at the angioplasty site compromised the dilated coronary lumen in one patient. No patient with angioplasty alone had intraplaque bleeding. Thus, acute coronary balloon angioplasty reperfusion therapy alone appears to avoid the potentially adverse effects of myocardial and intraplaque hemorrhage while simultaneously increasing luminal cross-sectional area {{at the site of}} acute occlusion...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:Purpose and Study Design: Prospective {{cohort study}} {{to explore the}} {{clinical}} treatment effect of mechanical vs. manual manipulation for acute low back pain. Methods: 92 patients {{with a history of}} acute low back pain were recruited from three private chiropractic offices. Two of these offices utilized manual lumbar manipulation and one used <b>mechanical</b> instrument manipulation (<b>Activator)</b> as their primary modes of treatment. The chiropractors used a "treatment as usual" protocol with the participants for a maximum of eight visits or four weeks, which ever occurred first. Primary and secondary outcome measures were the differences in pain and Oswestry scores from baseline to four weeks, respectively. Results: Socio-demographic characteristics of the two cohorts at baseline were not found to show any significant differences between the groups except for age. The Activator cohort had a significantly higher utilization of adjunctive modalities and x-rays, with a mean number of office visits about twice that of the manual manipulation cohort at four weeks. The pain scores decreased in both groups with the manual manipulation group showing a slightly greater amount of pain reduction at four weeks, but this difference did not reach statistical significance after controlling for baseline pain. The manual manipulation group also showed a slightly greater reduction in Oswestry scores from baseline to four-weeks, but this difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for baseline Oswestry score. Conclusions: In this observational study of treatment-as-usual there was no significantly greater reduction in pain scores or Oswestry scores between the manipulation and Activator groups at four weeks. There were many differences between the Activator and manual manipulation groups with respect to treatment beliefs and expectations, modality usage, and frequency/duration of care, which are potential sources of confounding in the interpretation of these results. This study provides important pilot data and research issues for the design of a future randomized clinical trial that can control for these issues of confounding variables...|$|R
