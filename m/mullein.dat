5|$|Verbascum thapsus (great <b>mullein</b> or common <b>mullein)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>mullein</b> native to Europe, {{northern}} Africa, and Asia, and introduced in the Americas and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great <b>mullein</b> feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include <b>mullein</b> thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the <b>mullein</b> moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great <b>mullein,</b> including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the <b>mullein</b> plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark <b>mullein),</b> Verbascum lychnitis (white <b>mullein)</b> and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved <b>mullein).</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{common names}} include cuy lippe, herb peter, paigle, peggle, key flower, key of heaven, fairy cups, petty <b>mulleins,</b> crewel, buckles, palsywort, plumrocks, tittypines.|$|R

5000|$|The flowers can be {{deep purple}} in color (violetta) to pink (rosetta) and white (flush of white). The {{variation}} in shades for V. phoeniceum makes it ideal for hybridization with other <b>mulleins.</b> Hybrids may have flower colors ranging from white to various shades {{of pink and}} plum; {{as well as the}} advantage of a longer growing season due to its perennial nature. [...] In the center of each flower are fuzzy golden-yellow stamens. [...] The height of V. phoeniceum is shorter than most <b>mulleins</b> but can range between 0.9m - 1.2m in an herbaceous habit.|$|R
5|$|Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), common <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) {{have been}} {{identified}} as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} used for herbal remedies, with {{well-established}} emollient and astringent properties. <b>Mullein</b> remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in topical applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make dyes and torches.|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great <b>mullein</b> was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
50|$|V. phoeniceum is pollinated by hoverflies and bees {{although}} it is suspected that moths also take part in pollinating the <b>mulleins.</b> The flowers expel a fragrance {{early in the day}} believed to attract moths and close up midday.|$|R
50|$|There aren't as many known {{uses for}} Verbascum phoeniceum {{compared}} to other <b>mulleins,</b> however {{in a study by}} Tatli et al. 2006, the mentholic extracts taken from the leaves and flowers of V. phoeniceum and other verbascum plants showed strong antimicrobial activity.|$|R
50|$|In {{gardening}} and landscaping, the <b>mulleins</b> are valued for their tall narrow stature and for flowering {{over a long}} period of time, even in dry soils. Many cultivars are available, of which 'Gainsborough','Letitia' and 'Pink Domino' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
5|$|Great <b>mullein</b> {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and {{breathing}} ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains mucilage, several saponins, coumarin and glycosides. Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung {{and it is now}} widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included dyeing and making torches.|$|E
5|$|Great <b>mullein</b> most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great <b>mullein</b> contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, {{a number of}} new hybrid cultivars have come out that have {{increased}} flower size, shorter heights, and a tendency to be longer-lived plants. A number have new colors for this genus. Many <b>mulleins</b> are raised from seed, including both the short-lived perennial and biennial types.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{valley is}} home to 77 species of plants, which include oak woods (acidophilous and {{temperate}} type), hornbeam, beech, and alder. Some of the perennial flowering species are cyclamen, <b>mulleins,</b> and pasque flower. The upper plateau, which was denuded by logging and converted to cultivable land, contains grasslands. Along the river beds, reed-beds or willow shrubs are noted. Eighteen species of orchids have been recorded.|$|R

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, <b>mullein,</b> cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|Because it cannot {{compete with}} {{established}} plants, great <b>mullein</b> {{is no longer}} considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can {{be very difficult to}} completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and regionally controlled in several others).|$|E
5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control <b>mullein.</b> Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E
50|$|Other {{parts of}} the lowland (on the south and north east slopes) are used as pasture. As a result of grazing by cattle, horses and sheep this area, {{as well as the}} former arable fields, have {{developed}} into a calcareous grassland. Its typical plants are the cowslip, houndstooth, cheat grass, wild strawberry, the rare field gromwell, the poisonous common corncockle, smooth rupturewort, field parsley, biting stonecrop, various <b>mulleins,</b> viper's bugloss, long-headed poppy, Centaurium, ragwort and carline thistle.|$|R
60|$|Ah, how he {{had loved}} it! The green garden path, the tufts of flowers, purple and white columbines, and great oriental red poppies with their black chaps and <b>mulleins</b> tall and yellow, this flamy garden which had been a garden for a {{thousand}} years, scooped out in the little hollow among the snake-infested commons. He had made it flame with flowers, in a sun cup under its hedges and trees. So old, so old a place! And yet he had re-created it.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{observation}} of self-incompatibility in plants {{was made on}} V. phoeniceum in the late 18th centuryand published by Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter. Unlike other <b>mulleins</b> V. thapsus and V. lychnitis which are able to self-pollinate, V. phoeniceum pollinated with their own pollen do not set seed but are cross-fertile; this had been attributed to the allotetraploidy of the plant. [...] Despite perfect flowers, individual V. phoeniceum flowers are shown to display either extreme male or extreme female characteristics, yielding more successful pollinations when used as such. [...] V. phoeniceum have 2n= 32, 36 chromosomes.|$|R
5|$|Great <b>mullein</b> is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (moth <b>mullein),</b> after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great <b>mullein</b> rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
60|$|The scenery of {{the road}} along which the two were riding was wild and bare. Only savins and <b>mulleins,</b> with their dark pyramids or white spires of velvet leaves, diversified the sandy wayside; but out at sea was a wide sweep of blue, {{reaching}} far to the open ocean, which lay rolling, tossing, and breaking into white caps of foam in the bright sunshine. For {{two or three days}} a northeast storm had been raging, and the sea was in all the commotion which such a general upturning creates.|$|R
25|$|Like other Zonotrichia sparrows, the golden-crowned sparrow {{feeds on}} the ground, where it forages by pecking and scratching. It also {{occasionally}} leaps {{into the air}} after insects or gleans them from foliage. Its diet, particularly in the winter, consists primarily of plant material; items include seeds, berries, flowers and buds, {{as well as the}} occasional crawling insect. The species is an important destroyer of weed seeds on the Pacific Slope, with various ryegrasses, fescues, bromes, pigweeds, chickweeds, <b>mulleins,</b> filarees, common knotweed and poison oak among its known food sources. Paired birds commonly forage together, with the male following the female.|$|R
6000|$|Whole {{weeks and}} months of my summer life slide away in thin volumes like mist and smoke, till at length, some warm morning, perchance, I see a sheet of mist blown down the brook to the swamp, and I float as high above the fields with it. I can recall to mind the stillest summer hours, in which the {{grasshopper}} sings over the <b>mulleins,</b> {{and there is a}} valor in that time the bare memory of which is armor that can laugh at any blow of fortune. For our lifetime the strains of a harp are heard to swell and die alternately, and death is but [...] "the pause when the blast is recollecting itself." ...|$|R
500|$|V.thapsus {{is known}} {{by a variety}} of names. European {{reference}} books call it [...] "great mullein". In North America, [...] "common mullein" [...] is used while western United States residents commonly refer to <b>mullein</b> as [...] "cowboy toilet paper".|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes natural {{remedies}} are {{all that}} is available in certain remote areas. [...] Examples include horses in certain tropical nations who have sprained tendons or ligaments are treated with rachette (Nopalea cochenillifera), castor bean leaves (Ricinus communis), aloes (Aloe vera) or leaves of wonder of the world (Kalanchoe pinnata). [...] Natural remedies are also used to treat exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) with lungwort (Pulmonaria officinalis). Other plants used in combination with conventional medications included liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) root, aerial parts of <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum thapsus) or mallow (Althea), and comfrey (Symphytum officinalis) root.|$|E
2500|$|Tansley, Shaffer and Hart (1933) {{attribute}} {{the practice of}} drying a species of <b>mullein</b> and mixing it with kinnikinic (bearberry) to replace tobacco to John Edwards, a prospector from Flint Creek, in the 1860s. He also gave the name to the hills in which the root was found. [...] Kinnikinic, as {{the name of a}} mixture and not the bearberry plant, was a leaf-bark mixture, including sumac and dogwood leaves, smoked by Indians and pioneers in the Ohio Valley in the 18th Century. [...] It was probably {{more or less the same}} as the “larb” mentioned above.|$|E
50|$|Verbascum phoeniceum is a dicot {{plant that}} begins with rosette growth in late spring and into summer. The initial lower rosette shows whorled basal leaves with pinnate venation and as growth continues, simple leaves grow in an {{alternating}} fashion on the stem. The shape of the leaf blades of the V. phoeniceum can be elliptical, ovate, chordate or lanceolate depending on {{the environment in which}} it grows in. Five-petaled flowers appear when in bloom, where it grows as an inflorescence with multiple flowers on a spike starting with the first blooms {{on the bottom of the}} spike and newer ones upwards of the spike. V. phoeniceum exhibits pentamerous growth of perianth and corolla that is characteristic of the dicotyledonus <b>mulleins.</b>|$|R
60|$|Winifred {{would never}} meet him {{again at the}} cottage--only in London, where the world was with them. But {{sometimes}} he came alone to Crockham perhaps when friends were staying there. And then he would work awhile in his garden. This summer still it would flame with blue anchusas and big red poppies, the <b>mulleins</b> would sway their soft, downy erections in the air: he loved mulleins: and the honeysuckle would stream out scent like memory, when the owl was whooing. Then he sat by the fire with the friends and with Winifred's sisters, and they sang the folk-songs. He put on thin civilian clothes and his charm and his beauty and the supple dominancy of his body glowed out again. But Winifred was not there.|$|R
