5|$|Genjurō's pottery {{is also a}} <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> in the film. Professor Wood argues his pottery evolves {{in three}} phases, {{reflecting}} Mizoguchi's changing approach to filmmaking. Genjurō begins making the pottery for commercial reasons, shifts to pure aesthetics while isolated with Lady Wakasa, and finally moves on to a style that reflects life and strives to understand it.|$|E
5|$|Henry VI, {{the three}} parts {{considered}} {{together in one}} chapter, is not, for Hazlitt, on a level with the other history plays, but, in a long comparison of King Henry VI with King Richard II, he finds occasion to reinforce his <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of the fine discrimination of superficially similar characters.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of East End {{history has}} been that of migration; both inward and outward. The area had a strong pull on the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E

5|$|Cox {{has also}} said {{that there is a}} massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a {{religion}} so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality. In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay. Nevertheless, a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of Latter Days is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.|$|E
5|$|M.I.A. {{named the}} album after her mother, in {{contrast}} to her first album Arular, which was named after her father, and stated that her mother's struggles in life are a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of the recording. She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world, including India, Jamaica, Australia, Liberia and Trinidad. Planned sessions in the United States failed to occur, after M.I.A. was refused a long-term work visa to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|Shea Ohmsford, the protagonist, Flick's adopted {{brother and}} the only {{remaining}} descendant of Jerle Shannara. Shea must find an ancient magical sword, the Sword of Shannara, {{and use it to}} destroy the antagonist, the Warlock Lord. A <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of this novel revolves around Shea—part of his quest includes finding a belief in himself. This is a search that every subsequent Brooks protagonist must undergo.|$|E
50|$|One of Danger Along the Ohio <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> {{is about}} how the {{struggle}} for land against the newly founded United States of America vs. the Native Americans. Also, one of its <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> is how the Europeans wanted to own land and how the Native Americans wanted people to share their land.|$|R

5|$|Survival horror {{refers to}} a subgenre of horror video games. The player {{character}} is vulnerable and under-armed, which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving and evasion, rather than violence. Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition. Another <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> throughout the genre is that of isolation. Typically, these games contain relatively few non-player characters and, as a result, frequently tell much of their story second-hand through the usage of journals, texts, or audio logs.|$|E
5|$|The Transfiguration was a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> in Eastern Christian art, {{and every}} Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} {{had to prove}} his craft by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they {{are thought to be}} powerful channels of divine grace. The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> in the Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war {{featured in}} the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea was the idea of prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E

5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters– especially young Rastignac, {{who grew up in}} the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E

5000|$|Gerald Clarke {{points out}} that within the story Randolph is the {{spokesperson}} for the novel's <b>major</b> <b>themes.</b> Clarke asserts that the four <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> of Other Voices, Other Rooms are [...] "the loneliness that afflicts all but the stupid or insensitive; the sacredness of love, whatever its form; the disappointment that invariably follows high expectations; and the perversion of innocence." ...|$|R
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of {{the game}} is heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} {{of the game}} where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} as governor, Wilkinson {{returned}} to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of public financing that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published his memoir entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among the investors in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began shortly {{after the release of}} Final Destination 2 (2003), though Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the {{franchise}} and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for Final Destination 3. In contrast to the previous film, which was a direct sequel to the original, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel, with the idea of featuring a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster coming from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan placed control as a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> in the film. Casting began in March 2005, with Winstead and Merriman landing the lead roles, and concluded in April. Final Destination 3 was filmed in Vancouver, as with the previous two installments, over a three-month period; the first two weeks were spent entirely on filming the roller-coaster's derailment.|$|E

5|$|Fauré's major sets of piano {{works are}} {{thirteen}} nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across {{the decades of}} his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, {{by way of a}} turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B <b>major,</b> <b>Thème</b> et variations in C major, and Huit pièces brèves. For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C <b>major</b> <b>theme,</b> this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a <b>major</b> <b>theme</b> in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
