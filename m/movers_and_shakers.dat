500|$|The social {{environment}} {{created by the}} publicity of the Payne Fund Studies and religious protests reached such a fever pitch that {{a member of the}} Hays Office described it as a [...] "state of war". However, newspapers including The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), New Orleans Times Picayune, Chicago Daily News, Atlanta Journal, Saint Paul Dispatch, the Philadelphia Record and Public Ledger, the Boston American and New York's Daily News, Daily Mirror, and Evening Post all lambasted the studies. When discussing the Supreme Court's 1915 decision, film historian Gregory Black argues that the efforts of reformers might have been lessened had [...] "filmmakers been willing to produce films for specialized audiences (adults only, family, no children) … but the <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakers</b> of the industry wanted or needed the largest possible market." [...] The most provocative pictures were the most profitable, with the 25% of the motion picture industry's output that was the most sensational supporting the cleaner 75%.|$|E
500|$|Alan Simpson, the co-writer of Hancock, enjoyed {{writing for}} Jacques, {{and thought that}} she was [...] "almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn't write for her {{thinking}} she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but the <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakers</b> of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

2500|$|... banchi grossi ("great banks"): {{the largest}} {{financial}} institutions in Florence, {{though not the}} most numerous (only 33 in 1469 according to Benedetto Dei). They were the major <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakers</b> in the European economy. They had vast accumulations of capital, multi-generational projects, and were a mainstay of the Florentine economy, because {{not only did they}} deal in time deposits, demand deposits, and discretionary deposits (deposits a discrezione), they expended most of their efforts in funneling their capital into commerce and bills of exchange. Such bills could be a hidden and legal method to create loans bearing interest. The Medici Bank was such a bank. One Medici branch manager (Tommaso Portinari) said: [...] "The foundation of the [...] business rests on trade in which most of the capital is employed." [...] Similarly, the articles of association frequently said {{something along the lines of}} the purpose for the partnership being [...] "to deal in exchange and in merchandise with the help of God and good fortune." [...] Under Cosimo, the Bank had interests in wool, silk, alum and merchant vesselsentirely separate from the many financial instruments and relations it managed. Despite their membership in the Arte del Cambio (assuming they bothered to run a local bank in Florence itself), these merchant banks' focus were determinedly international in scope, where profits could be found, local markets being very competitive. Sometimes these banks were referred to as gran tavoli ("big table") or variants thereof, due to their origins as banchi in mercato; the difference between them and banchi grossi was more one of degree than kind.|$|E

[...] In no time it was lined with various mills and factories. [...] The buzzing Town of Sheridan incorporated in 1886. The subsequent discovery of natural gas on West 3rd Street in 1888 boosted the town’s growth even further as several additional industries chose to locate there. [...] Sheridan’s <b>movers</b> <b>and</b> <b>shakers</b> eagerly expanded their holdings {{to take advantage of this}} inexpensive fuel, which, unfortunately, as [...] in [...] the several [...] other [...] “gas [...] boom” counties of Indiana, soon ran out. [...] But for a time, Sheridan even boasted both glass factory and a cannery along with a large brickworks, the Thistlethwaite Tile and Brick plant. [...] Several smaller brick manufacturers, along with numerous other industries, including Indiana Condensed Milk—a company purchased by Wilson’s Milk, a leader in canned condensed milk. [...] Despite the waning gas supply, many industries remained. [...] Sheridan, around the turn of the twentieth century had become the second largest town in the county with a thriving commercial district along Main Street. [...] Included were a large variety of stores, several hotels, banks, and lodges still sharing the street with a few dwellings. [...] Many of these buildings survive, including the two large commercial buildings on Main—the Golden Rule general merchandise store and the dry goods store of Stanley Brothers. [...] Both were constructed in the 1890s. [...] The town applied to Andrew Carnegie for funds to build a library, a structure completed in 1912.|$|E
