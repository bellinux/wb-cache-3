5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure,</b> with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
25|$|Ecological risk {{assessment}} aims to {{source of contamination}} to exposure to a toxicity endpoint. This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways. Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> pathways. There is also a need in {{risk assessment}} to understand the bioaccumulation of chemicals4, {{as well as a}} direct estimation of bioavailability. Modeling food web exposure is difficult in risk assessment and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue. Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological risk assessment and human health risk assessment.|$|E
25|$|David Malin pioneered <b>{{multiple}}</b> <b>exposure</b> {{using multiple}} filters for astronomical photography, recombining {{the images in}} the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately. For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultra-violet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate {{the extent of the}} display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters. Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites. It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.|$|E

2500|$|Méliès {{directed}} {{over 500}} films between 1896 and 1913, ranging in length {{from one to}} forty minutes. In subject matter, these films are often similar to the magic theatre shows that Méliès had been doing, containing [...] "tricks" [...] and impossible events, such as objects disappearing or changing size. These early special effects films were essentially devoid of plot. The special effects were used only to show what was possible, rather than enhance the overall narrative. Méliès' early films were mostly composed of single in-camera effects, used for {{the entirety of the}} film. For example, after experimenting with <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure,</b> Méliès created his film The One-Man Band in which he played seven different characters simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|Napoléon is a 1927 silent French epic film written, produced, and {{directed}} by Abel Gance that {{tells the story of}} Napoleon's early years. On screen, the title is Napoléon vu par Abel Gance, meaning [...] "Napoleon as seen by Abel Gance". The film is recognised as a masterwork of fluid camera motion, produced in a time when most camera shots were static. Many innovative techniques were used to make the film, including fast cutting, extensive close-ups, a wide variety of hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple-camera setups, <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure,</b> superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen and mosaic shots, multi-screen projection, and other visual effects. A revival of Napoléon in the mid-1950s influenced the filmmakers of the French New Wave.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike optical lithography, {{there are}} <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> limits, {{identified}} as the top dose, bottom dose, and critical dose, whose values must be determined experimentally for a proper exposure. [...] The exposure must be sufficient {{to meet the requirements}} of the bottom dose, the exposure under which a photoresist residue will remain, and the top dose, the exposure over which the photoresist will foam. [...] The critical dose is the exposure at which unexposed resist begins to be attacked. [...] Due to the insensitivity of PMMA, a typical exposure time for a [...] thick PMMA is six hours. [...] During exposure, secondary radiation effects such as Fresnel diffraction, mask and substrate fluorescence, and the generation of Auger electrons and photoelectrons can lead to overexposure.|$|E

40|$|Ascaris spp. {{infection}} affects 800 {{million people}} worldwide, {{and half of}} the world population is currently at risk of infection. Recurrent reinfection in humans is mostly due to the simplicity of the parasite life cycle, but the impact of <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> to the biology of the infection and the consequences to the host's homeostasis are poorly understood. In this context, single and <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> in mice were performed in order to characterize the parasitological, histopathological, tissue functional and immunological aspects of experimental larval ascariasis. The most important findings revealed that reinfected mice presented a significant reduction of parasite burden in the lung and an increase in the cellularity in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) associated with a robust granulocytic pulmonary inflammation, leading to a severe impairment of respiratory function. Moreover, the <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> to Ascaris elicited an increased number of circulating inflammatory cells as well as production of higher levels of systemic cytokines, mainly IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 17 A and TNF-α when compared to single-infected animals. Taken together, our results suggest the intense pulmonary inflammation associated with a polarized systemic Th 2 /Th 17 immune response are crucial to control larval migration after <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> to Ascaris...|$|R
