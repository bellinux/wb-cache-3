25|$|Given the inhumanity of his crimes, Hitler {{was early}} on linked with “psychopathy”, a severe {{personality}} disorder whose main symptoms {{are a great}} or complete lack of empathy, social responsibility and conscience. The biologically determined concept still {{plays a role in}} the psychiatric forensic science, but it is no longer found in the modern <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> systems (DSM-IV and ICD-10). Today, corresponding clinical pictures are mostly classified as signs of an antisocial personality disorder. However, the symptomatology is rare, and unlike in popular discourse – where the classification of Hitler as a “psychopath” is commonplace –, psychiatrists have only occasionally endeavored to associate him with psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|The first {{classification}} {{systems for}} para-alpine skiing {{were developed in}} Scandinavia, with early systems designed for skiers with amputations. At the time, equipment {{had yet to be}} developed to allow participation for skiers with spinal cord injuries. The goal of the early classification systems was to be functional but ended up being <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> systems. At the first Winter Paralympics in 1976, there were two classifications for the sport. By the 1980s, classification existed for skiers with cerebral palsy. At that time, with inspiration from wheelchair basketball classification, efforts were made to make classification more of a functional system. Ten classes existed by the 1980s, and since then, efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of classification by reducing the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Maintaining <b>Medical</b> <b>Classifications</b> in XML – ClaML redefined for {{use with}} WHO-FIC classifications The Schema {{described}} in this paper is designed to contain all the information needed to maintain and publish <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> such as ICD- 10. It was derived from {{an early version of}} ClaML (CEN/TS 14463) and after a detailed process of adjustment of this standard towards ClaML and vice versa, ClaML (and therefore this schema as well) is expected to become an ISO-standard. Primarily this schema was created to match the needs of official WHO <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> such as ICD- 10. Still, we do think that with this schema {{it will be possible to}} maintain a broad variety of <b>medical</b> <b>classifications.</b> This document will give some explanation of the elements of the schema and examples on how the schema will be used. The examples mostly show the usage of the schema for ICD- 10...|$|R

25|$|Although Honner {{took the}} {{decision}} to disband the 39th Battalion hard, six days after he was appointed to command of the 2/14th Battalion, having been asked for personally by Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, commander of the 21st Brigade of which the 2/14th was a part. Honner subsequently led the 2/14th early in the campaign in the Ramu–Markham Valley before being seriously wounded by a gunshot to his hip after leaving the battalion's main defensive perimeter to conduct a reconnaissance during the advance on Dumpu. After being evacuated to Australia, Honner had surgery on his hip during which a metal plate was inserted into it. In early 1944, after being deemed only fit for duties of an administrative nature, he was posted as General Staff Officer Grade 1, Directorate of Military Training, G Branch, at Land Headquarters in Melbourne, where {{he worked on the}} creation of training manuals. In late 1944 Honner's <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> was downgraded further as his hip injury worsened, and as a result in January 1945, he was discharged.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{classification}} involved {{being examined}} in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles {{with their hands}} and with pins. [...] The system had no built-in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not ensured privacy during <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> nor with their medical records.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} {{additional}} classes, S11, S12 and S13, for visually impaired swimmers. The lower number indicates {{a greater degree}} of impairment: class S11 swimmers are blind or nearly blind, and compete in blacked-out goggles. They each have a [...] "tapper" [...] who uses a pole or [...] "bonker" [...] to warn the swimmer that they are approaching the end of the pool. [...] The visual classifications are based on <b>medical</b> <b>classification,</b> and not on functional mobility. A final class, S14, is for intellectually disabled swimmers. This class was not contested at the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Paralympics after the IPC dropped all intellectual disability events following the basketball ID controversy at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, but was restored for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.|$|E
5000|$|During 2015, the Council of Europe, and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights {{called for}} a review of <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> that {{unnecessarily}} medicalize intersex traits an end to medical interventions without consent, and improved disclosure. The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner recommended: National and international <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> which pathologise variations in sex characteristics should be reviewed with a view to eliminating obstacles to the effective enjoyment, by intersex persons, of human rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of health.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} web data resources in medicine, especially through <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> made available using the principles of Linked Data, to support the interpretation of patterns mined from patient care trajectories. Interpreting such patterns is naturally a challenge for an analyst, as it requires going through large amounts of results and access to sufficient background knowledge. We employ linked data, especially as exposed through the BioPortal system, to create a navigation structure within the patterns obtained form sequential pattern mining. We show how this approach provides a flexible way to explore data about trajectories of diagnoses and treatments according to different <b>medical</b> <b>classifications...</b>|$|R
500|$|The move north came in January 1944, as the 35th Battalion {{had been}} {{earmarked}} {{for a role}} in the Huon Peninsula campaign in north-eastern New Guinea. Accordingly, Gibbs embarked from Cairns on 18 January, arriving at Finschhafen after a week's voyage. Gibbs' experience in New Guinea, however, was brief: the day of his arrival, Gibbs broke his left leg in an accident. After seventeen days at the 2/5th Australian General Hospital, he was transported to Brisbane aboard the hospital ship Manunda. The break necessitated an extended period of hospitalisation in Australia, and led to a downgrading in his <b>medical</b> <b>classification.</b> Gibbs was subsequently discharged from the 2nd AIF on 28 December 1944 to resume his work with AGL, regarded as an [...] "essential occupation" [...] to the war effort. For his service during the Second World War, Gibbs was eligible for the Pacific Star, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945, though he did not claim his medals until 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{classification}} for all para-alpine skiers {{looks at}} which equipment is utilized by a skier and their body position when they ski. Sit-skiers {{who are in}} the wheelchair group are assessed based on the residual muscle strength and level of spinal cord injury. For skiers with a visual impairment, their classification is handled by the International Blind Sports Association. [...] They are tested based on <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> by an Ophthalmologist.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "narcissism" [...] to {{describe}} excessive vanity and self-centeredness predates by many years the modern <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> of narcissistic personality disorder. The condition was named after Narcissus, a mythological Greek youth who became infatuated with his own reflection in a lake. He did not realize at first that it was his own reflection, but when he did, he died out of grief for having fallen in love with someone that did not exist outside of himself.|$|E
50|$|The WHA is also {{responsible}} for {{the endorsement of the}} WHO Family of International Classifications, a series of internationally standardized <b>medical</b> <b>classifications,</b> including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).|$|R
2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{opinions}} on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. During 2015, the Council of Europe, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have called for a review of <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health; the Council of Europe expressed concern that [...] "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of <b>medical</b> <b>classifications</b> has possibly widened over the past decade".|$|R
5000|$|Use of {{the term}} {{disorder}} of sex development (DSD) is controversial among many activists and community organizations due to the label [...] "disorders".

2500|$|To avoid {{conscription}} {{into the}} Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading {{member of the}} Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve [...] "poofs" [...] and protests against police harassment and the <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|People with {{cerebral}} palsy in classifications from CP1 to CP8 are covered by skiing classifications. [...] Skiers from CP5 to CP8 compete standing up {{with the use of}} equipment. The blind classifications are based on <b>medical</b> <b>classification,</b> not functional classification. In 1995, the classifications for skiing were LW1, LW2, LW3, LW4, LW5/7, LW6/8, and LW9, where LW stands for [...] Winter. There were three sit-ski classifications: LW10, LW11 and LW12. Classification for competitors with {{cerebral palsy}} is difficult because the levels of spasticity can change as the race progresses.|$|E
2500|$|Para-Nordic skiing {{classification}} is {{the classification}} system for para-Nordic skiing {{which includes the}} biathlon and cross country events. The classifications for Para-Nordic skiing mirrors the classifications for Para-Alpine skiing with some exceptions.

50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, ISMGF {{classification}} cheating {{occurred in}} both swimming and wheelchair basketball.

50|$|The {{term has}} been controversial, and {{research}} has shown that affected people experience a negative impact, with the terminology impacting choice and utilization of health care providers.

2500|$|There is no <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> {{for this}} {{specific}} syndrome {{in the sense}} used by lawyers, though it has historically been invoked in court systems. Similar to an insanity plea, battered person syndrome is purely a legal term {{used to refer to}} the severe psychological trauma caused by domestic abuse. [...] Although the condition is not gender-specific, the admission of evidence regarding battered woman syndrome as relevant to the defense of self-defense is commonly understood as a response by some jurisdictions to [...] male favorable gender-bias in the criminal justice system. Thus, this is a reference to any person who, because of constant and severe domestic abuse usually involving physical abuse or threats of physical abuse by a partner, may become severely depressed or unable to take any independent action that would allow him or her to escape the abuse.|$|E
2500|$|According to the American Psychiatric Association, a Western medical {{condition}} similar in many aspects to culturally bound syndromes, particularly the [...] "running" [...] syndromes, of which grisi siknis is part, is dissociative (or psychogenic) fugue. In any fugal state, a person appears normal, but has amnesia or identity forgetfulness. Dissociative fugue is distinguished by impulsive travel and amnesia, identity uncertainty, stress, and impediment to normal social function, {{all of which}} must not be influenced by substance intake. It is most often related to intense emotional stress and occurs randomly. However, some argue that [...] "running" [...] syndromes are really not dissociative fugue, and have no proper Western <b>medical</b> <b>classification.</b> Others contend that associating culturally bound symptoms with known ailments severely limits the discovery of new psychiatric disorders in folk culture. Edgardo Ruiz, PhD at the University of Pittsburgh argues that grisi siknis does not correlate with Western scientific cultural perspectives, and the cross-cultural translation of symptoms is an inaccurate device wherewith to understand the disease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{move from}} a <b>medical</b> <b>classification</b> to a {{functional}} classification system continued during the 1990s. There were conversations {{about whether or not}} less-disabled wintersport athletes should be competing in disability winter sport and if they should instead be competing against able bodied competitors. [...] At the same time, there were people including IPC first vice president Jens Bromann who entertained discussions about whether or not blind classifications should be combined into a single class like is done in some other disabilities sports. The debate about inclusion of competitors into able-bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst Strokhkendl as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able-bodied sport. [...] These efforts ended by 1993 as the International Paralympic Committee tried to carve out its own identity and largely ceased efforts for inclusion of disability sport on the Olympic programme. Nonetheless, in 2006, skiers with amputation still had a medical component to their classification assessment.|$|E
