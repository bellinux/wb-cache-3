5|$|Symptoms of lead {{poisoning}} include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and possibly {{weakness in the}} fingers, wrists, or ankles. Small blood pressure increases, particularly in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> older people, may be apparent and can cause anemia. Several studies, mostly cross-sectional, found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability. In pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. Chronic, high-level exposure {{has been shown to}} reduce fertility in males.|$|E

A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light.

Almost 80% of respondents stated {{they did not have}} any problems using their native language in 2011. 8% stated they had experienced difficulty in the execution (understanding) of official documents; mostly <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> elderly people in South Ukraine and the Donets Basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{mortality}} rate due to chronic ITP varies but {{tends to be}} higher relative {{to the general population}} for any age range. In a study conducted in Great Britain, it was noted that ITP causes an approximately 60 percent higher rate of mortality compared to gender- and age-matched subjects without ITP. This increased risk of death with ITP is largely concentrated in the <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> elderly. Ninety-six percent of reported ITP-related deaths were individuals 45 years or older. No significant difference was noted in the rate of survival between males and females.|$|E

Zemeckis wrote the script with Jim Carrey in mind, and Carrey agreed to play a multitude of roles in the film, including Ebenezer Scrooge as a young, <b>middle-aged,</b> <b>and</b> old man, and the three ghosts who haunt Scrooge. The film began production in February 2008, and was released on November 6, 2009, again to mixed reviews. Actor Gary Oldman also appeared in the film.|$|E

25|$|The BNP has {{a highly}} {{centralised}} structure that gives its chairman near-total control. It established {{a range of}} sub-groups—such as a youth wing, record label, and trade union—and built links with extreme-right parties across Europe. Regarded as the most successful far-right party in British history, the BNP attracted most support from within White British working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> elderly men. More widely, it was highly unpopular and faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, and mainstream politicians and media. BNP members were banned {{from a number of}} professions, and polling suggested that a majority of Britons favoured the party's criminalisation.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1944, Ōoka {{was drafted}} into the Imperial Japanese Army, given only three months of {{rudimentary}} training {{and sent to the}} front line at Mindoro Island in the Philippines, where he served as his battalion's communications technician until his battalion was routed and numerous men killed. In January 1945, he was captured by the American forces in the Philippine defeat and sent to a prisoner of war camp on Leyte Island. Survival was very traumatic for Ōoka, who was troubled that he, a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> unworthy soldier, had survived when so many others had not.

25|$|A {{study by}} Chung et al. (2006) {{focused on how}} the {{responses}} of spinal cord injury post-traumatic stress varied depending on age. The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, <b>middle-aged,</b> <b>and</b> elderly; the average age was 25, 48 and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age {{does not make a}} difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened. However, they did mention that age did {{play a role in the}} extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, the {{government}} has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment. The introduction of Burger King in Tórshavn was widely publicized {{as a sign of}} the globalization of Faroese culture. It remains to be seen whether these projects will succeed in broadening the islands' economic base. The islands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries after leaving high school. This leaves a largely <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the Faroes. Nonetheless, in 2008 the Faroes were able to make a $52 million loan to Iceland to help with that country's banking woes.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research {{published}} a meta-analysis examining whether milk consumption might protect against hip fracture in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>and</b> older adults. Studies {{could find no}} association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures. In 2014, JAMA Pediatrics {{published a}} report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women {{for more than two}} decades. Subjects were asked to report on how much milk they had consumed as teenagers, and were followed {{to see if there is}} any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life, it found there was not any. A study published in The BMJ that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results. Milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men, and an increased risk of fractures in women. The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent. It was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes.|$|E
