50|$|Since the mid-1990s, community-driven {{development}} {{has emerged as}} one of the fastest-growing investments by NGOs, aid organizations and <b>multilateral</b> <b>developments</b> <b>banks.</b> This continued investment in CDD has been driven mostly by a demand from donor agencies and developing countries for large-scale, bottom-up and demand-driven, poverty reduction subprojects that can increase the institutional capacity of small communities for self-development. The success and scale of some CDD projects in the World Bank are especially notable. The World Bank supported approximately 190 lending projects amounting to $9.3 billion in 2000-2005 (Tanaka, 2006). Initiated by the International Development Association (IDA) at the World Bank, CDD projects have been instrumental in harnessing the energy and capacity of communities for poverty reduction. Since the start of this decade, IDA lending for CDD has averaged annually just over 50 operations, for an average total of US$1.3 billion per year (International Development Association, 2009).|$|E

40|$|Direct lending by <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> to {{the private}} sector without {{sovereign}} guarantee raises two important issues. First, their presence in the financial markets alters the perception of risk, and that difference in perceived risk carries a market value; the question becomes who appropriates it. Second, by advising on policy matters related to activities that they are or may become interested in financing, or in which they have outstanding balances without sovereign guarantee, multilaterals put themselves in a conflict of interest that may affect their performance in informational and conditionality functions. <b>multilateral,</b> <b>development,</b> <b>banks,</b> finance, conditionality, sovereign...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, BRIC {{countries}} have demonstrated {{high rates of}} economic growth, rapid increases in GDP per capita and growing capital accumulation, and have been playing an increasingly {{important role in the}} global economy. However, as middle-income countries (low-income in the case of India), BRICs still rely on <b>development</b> finance. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> (MDBs) have become an important source of external long-term capital available to BRICs.

40|$|Since their creation, the <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> have {{accumulated}} performance records that include both substantial successes and stunning failures. Nowhere have their performance records been more mixed and controversial than {{with respect to}} environmental management issues. The <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> have financed projects that are widely considered to be environmental disasters, but have also financed projects that successfully included best practice environmental mitigation measures. They have wasted {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars financing unsuccessful environmental protection programs, while at the same time they have supported programs that contributed to the rapid development of environmental management capacity in less-developed countries. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore when and why monitoring and evaluation can prompt the <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> to move away from poor performing projects and towards high performing projects. This type of performance-based allocation has been repeatedly highlighted as a key element in the successful delivery of development assistance. To test when the <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> practice performance-based allocation, I assembled a team that coded environmental performance information from 960 project evaluations, 174 program evaluations, and 74 civil society complaints. I use the resulting data to model when four <b>multilateral</b> <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> - the World <b>Bank,</b> Asian <b>Development</b> <b>Bank,</b> Inter-American <b>Development</b> <b>Bank,</b> and African <b>Development</b> <b>Bank</b> - make performance-based allocation decisions about environmentally-risky and environment-improving operations. In addition, I visited the headquarters of each of these organizations and conducted interviews with 54 staff members about the processes that are in place to use monitoring and evaluation information as part of decision-making. I find that the establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems at the MDBs has not created incentives for staff to practice performance-based allocation. Instead, performance information influences allocation decisions when it helps MDB staff approve future projects more quickly. It does so by helping staff identify development projects that are likely to face significant delays due to the inability of the borrowing country to manage negative environmental impacts and to identify the borrowing countries that are likely to successfully implement environment-improving operations.
