40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A research project {{has been carried out}} to provide BG plc with service life predictions of lithium primary batteries capable of supplying a continuous pulsed power supply to two new electronic domestic gas meters over a desired design life of 11. 5 years, in UK weather conditions. The paper study includes investigations of the range of suitable lithium technologies and test methods, and detailed reviews of the discharge processes, polarisation and self-discharge failure modes of the lithium thionyl chloride system. A new multi-channel load test rig and a high resolution measurement system, and software analysis tools were designed and constructed, and some 440 accelerated discharge tests were carried out at different stress levels on 4 cell types. The results provide a unique database of the voltage/temperature/load trends through discharge, and generate a ranking order of performance. Basic statistical analyses have been carried out to quantify the variability of performance trends. A hitherto unreported behaviour pattern is characterised. Qualitative models are postulated to account for deviations from normal behaviour exhibited by two cell types. The analysis suggests that catholyte additives could predispose a system to early failure (due to modification of the crystal structure of the reaction products), and that manufacturing tolerances define the degree of failure. Mathematical models of self-discharge rate for both low and <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> <b>discharge</b> were developed from laboratory measurements. Meter load profiles were also measured, which together with the self-discharge model enabled prediction of operational energy utilisation rates. A sample of 50 batteries was extracted from customers homes, after operating in the field for periods of up to 2 years, and the battery capacity loss rates were measured by the residual capacity method. A comparison of predicted and actual capacity utilisation rates yielded a discrepancy of approximately 1. 28. Analysis implied that the source of the discrepancy could be adduced to an under estimate of the impact of self-discharge, but that a factor of up to six times the predicted value was required. Evidence was provided to show that self-discharge rate under operational stresses could be significantly higher than that under the steady-state laboratory measurement conditions, but that that the amplitude and time constant associated with a selfdischarge peak was unknown and not predictable. Mean service lives of 14 and 10 years for the respective battery types in the two types of meter are predicted, the worst case (probability of 0. 13...|$|E

40|$|Capacity drop {{indicates}} that the queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> {{is lower than the}} road capacity. Due to the capacity drop, traffic delays increase once queues form. Researchers find that queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> vary in different traffic conditions. Empirical data shows that the queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> increases as the speed in congestion increases. Understanding what and how driver behaviors result in such variable queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> can help minimize traffic delays and eliminate congestion. However, as far as authors know, few efforts have been devoted to testing impacts of traffic behaviors on the variable queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> This paper tries to fill in the gap. The authors investigate to what extent acceleration variety and reaction time can influence the queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> It is found that the acceleration variety cannot reduce the queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> considerably. Modelling reaction time might be more important than modeling acceleration when giving capacity drop in car-following models. A multi-phase reaction time mechanism for giving variable queue <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> is proposed.

40|$|Rate-of-{{discharge}} curves {{that show}} the discharge characteristics of an injection system having a very short fuel passage are presented. The <b>rate</b> of <b>discharge</b> closely follows the rate of displacement of the injection-pump plunger for open nozzles in which the maximum calculated pressures at the orifice do not exceed a certain value, which {{is dependent on the}} particular injection pump. With small orifices and high pump speeds, the <b>rate</b> of <b>discharge</b> does not follow the rate of plunger displacement because the higher discharge pressure results in increased leakage with corresponding decrease in <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>rate</b> of <b>discharge</b> is not directly related to the rate of plunger displacement with automatic injection valves having closed nozzles.

30|$|In {{a survey}} of New Zealand forest managers, Rolando et al. (2013) found that {{subsequent}} release sprays were based on clopyralid, {{with the addition of}} picloram and/or triclopyr. The three combinations of herbicides assessed in this trial based on clopyralid gave good control of broom at all rates assessed, though the two mixtures with triclopyr were more effective than the clopyralid/picloram mixture, especially when on 12 -month-old broom. The <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> tested for the two treatments that included both clopyralid and triclopyr mixtures (clo/tric and cpat) (which were based on rates recommended to forestry managers) appeared similar in efficacy. Although the highest rate of the clopyralid/triclopyr mix (clo/tric-H) gave slightly better control than the <b>medium</b> <b>rate</b> of both mixes (clo/tric-M and cpat-M), the difference was not statistically significant and cost was twice the <b>medium</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, there {{does not appear to be}} an advantage in adding picloram and aminopyralid to the clopyralid/triclopyr mix. However, the clopyralid/triclopyr/picloram/aminopyralid mix would cost the same as the clopyralid/triclopyr mix based on the prices obtained from Askin and Askin (2014) (Table  1). Comparisons of costs will vary depending on market prices for the various forms of triclopyr and combinations available.|$|R
