Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis.

We further demonstrate that the security of the electronic codebook (ECB) mode, and show that in the absence of integrity, one could exploit this to aid in known- and chosen- IV attacks.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} theoretic {{background}} <b>of</b> cryptographic <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> in particular those modes proposed to ensure message privacy. A novel algebraic model {{is presented as}} an archetype of encryption design. In the ideal case, encrypting multiple messages is treated as inductively applying the algebraic operation ⋆, an operation corresponding to block-by-block processing, on Latin Squares over a sequence of finite groups {Zrn, Zr 2 ∗n, Zr 3 ∗n, · · ·,}. We further show that a Latin Square cipher is a newly discovered hard-core function for any strong one-way length-preserving function. Based on the discovery, we propose a thesis that encryption <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> should implement cryptographically strong pseudorandom generators in the ideal case, so that the random oracle model {{can be used to}} justify the practice of replacing Latin Square ciphers with “good ” implementations (e. g., AES). Finally we present a cryptanalysis <b>of</b> NIST’s standard <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> based on this work. The algebraic model shows that, even when an ideally strong one-way function is used, none <b>of</b> NIST’s standard <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> (OFB, CFB, CTR, CBC) can produce cryptographically strong pseudorandom ensembles based on the ideal one-way function—the distinction of this work is to use formal method (rather than empirical attacks) to illustrate the design flaws in the standard <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> As numerous security protocols are using the flawed <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> we argue that these national standards should be repaired, and efficient repairs (double encryption) can be easily achieved.
