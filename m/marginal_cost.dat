5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E
25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets, firms {{decide the}} quantity {{to be produced}} based on marginal costs and sale price. If the sale price {{is higher than the}} <b>marginal</b> <b>cost,</b> then they supply the unit and sell it. If the <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce it. So the production will be carried out until the <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is equal to the sale price. In other words, firms refuse to sell if the <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is greater than the market price.|$|E

Consequently, if the intuition is correct, price equal <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> {{can be seen as a}} good approximation when most consumers are rather the same.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{structural}} approach to test investment equations, {{based on the}} log likelihood function of the optimal investment policy of a Q-theory model with real and financing frictions.

We quantify jointly the <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of investment, fixed costs of investment, and <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of external financing of US public firms.

25|$|In economics, <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is {{the change}} in the {{opportunity}} cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.|$|E

25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of a consumer good, the {{point on the}} demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer {{would be prepared to}} pay for that unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures <b>marginal</b> <b>cost,</b> the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> and marginal utility at equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{economic}} theory, if all the first-best conditions are met, social optimality involves the prices to be set equal to social <b>marginal</b> <b>costs.</b> When {{it is not possible}} to set prices equal to social <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,</b> due to the presence of constraints within the transport sector or distortions elsewhere in the economy, the theory suggests corrections to the SMC principle (second-best alternatives).

25|$|Under the Presidency of Carlos Flores, decrees No. 85-98 and 267-98 were {{approved}} in 1998 by the Honduras Congress {{with the aim}} of promoting the development of renewable energy-generating plants. The new legislation includes tax breaks to developers and a secure buyer arrangement for energy at prices equivalent to the system’s short-term <b>marginal</b> <b>cost.</b> ENEE, which is the default buyer, must pay a premium (10 percent of the same short-run <b>marginal</b> <b>cost)</b> for the electricity generated when the installed capacity is below 50 MW. This framework has facilitated the negotiation of about 30 public-private partnerships with ENEE for small renewable energy plants. In addition, Decree No. 85-98 also establishes tax exemptions in favor of developers: import and sales taxes on equipment, and a five-year income tax holiday.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model of price {{leadership}} on homogeneous product markets where the price leader is selected endogenously.

Somewhat counter-intuitively, lower <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of the leader imply higher prices. We compare two mechanisms to determine the price leader in a between-subjects design, majority voting and competitive bidding. The experimental data of later rounds support our theoretical finding that experienced price leaders with lower <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> choose higher prices.
