The aim of the present work was to study the effect of molding temperature (130 - 170 °C), <b>molding</b> <b>time</b> (5 - 25 min) and moisture content (5. 6 - 18. 0 %) on the gluten network. Molding temperature, <b>molding</b> <b>time</b> and gluten moisture content had a strong impact on the SDS extractable protein (SDS-EP) as determined with size-exclusion HPLC. SDS-EP, and more particularly the gliadin extractability, decreased for gluten molded at 130 °C with increasing molding times and moisture contents. Under the experimental conditions, almost no glutenins were extractable after thermo-molding. At 170 °C, degradation of gluten seems to occur. Reversed-phase HPLC results showed that the α- and γ-gliadins were more affected by thermo-molding than the ω-gliadins.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown the {{feasibility}} of production of masonry blocks and panels from agglomeration of cotton gin waste and calcium binders. Cotton gin waste {{is a serious problem}} for ginning plants, because in Argentina approximately 300, 000 t of lignocellulosic wastes are produced annually without any final disposal destination. The accumulation of these residues is associated with pests and fire hazards. Since these composites are produced with simple equipment and a minimum energy requirement, their cost depends mainly on the binder (Portland cement) used and the process efficiency, since with a high productivity model, labor and equipment depreciation costs are significantly reduced.

40|$|Variation of {{processing}} conditions on warpage prediction {{of a plastic}} quad flat package (PQFP) is examined. Thermal mismatch between package constituent materials is the major cause of IC package warpage. To minimize the warpage problem, {{a thorough understanding of}} epoxy,, molding compound (EMC) properties with molding parameters is necessary as EMC is epoxy-based with time and temperature dependent viscoelastic properties. This paper first addressed the thermal characterization of encapsulating material. Degree-of-cure (DOC or beta), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE or a), glass transition temperature T-g, and shear modulus G' and G of the molded specimens were measured by various thermal analysis techniques. The glass transition temperature was shown to be a good and direct measure of the degree-of-cure. The CTEs (alpha (1) and alpha (2)), G' and G'' were found to be decreasing functions of degree-of-cure. Viscoelastic EMC material models with DOC (i. e., T-g) dependent were formulated. Package warpage predictions against different processing conditions were performed via finite element analyses. Out-of-plane displacement measurements were performed on plastic quad flat package (PQFP) to validate the numerical results. Warpage prediction by the viscoelastic material model was found to agree with the measured data better than the thermoelastic one.

40|$|The {{starting}} material {{used in this}} study was a cake generated during thermo-mechanical fractionation of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) whole plant in a Clextral BC 45 (France) twin-screw extruder. It was slightly deoiled (17. 6 % dry matter for residual oil content), leading to an oil extraction yield of 46. 1 % (yield based on the residual oil content in cake). As it was a mixture of fibers and proteins, it could be considered as a natural composite that was processed successfully into fiberboards by thermo-pressing. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of thermo-pressing conditions on oil expression yield during molding and on flexural properties of fiberboards manufactured from this cake. An experimental design with three variables was realized: from 250 to 500 kgf/cm² for pressure applied (in 5 levels), from 60 to 300 s for <b>molding</b> <b>time</b> (in 7 levels), and from 600 to 1200 mg/cm² for cake quantity (in 3 levels). Temperature of the aluminium mold positioned between the two plates of the heated hydraulic press (PEI, France) with 400 tons capacity was 200 °C. All fiberboards were cohesive. As an internal binder, proteins ensured the agromaterial cohesion, and fibers entanglement also acted like reinforcement. Thermo-pressing was not only a molding operation. It also consisted in increasing the oil extraction efficiency. Oil expression yield during molding increased with the increase of pressure applied, and especially with the increase of <b>molding</b> <b>time.</b> At the same time, it was not so much influenced by the modification of cake quantity. Highest oil expression yield was 58. 8 % in proportion to the oil that the cake contained, leading to a total oil yield (oil extracted by water in twin-screw extruder, and oil expressed during molding) of 77. 8 % in proportion to the oil that the sunflower whole plant contained. It was associated with the next thermo-pressing conditions: 469 kgf/cm² for pressure applied, 300 s for <b>molding</b> <b>time,</b> and 697 mg/cm² for cake quantity. Flexural properties of the corresponding fiberboard were 8. 1 MPa for flexural strength at break, and 1778 MPa for elastic modulus. Its thickness was 5. 40 mm, leading to a mean apparent density of 1. 25. Such flexural strength at break was a bit lower (- 25 %) than the one of the most resistant fiberboard (10. 8 MPa), manufactured from the next thermo-pressing conditions: 250 kgf/cm² for pressure applied, 300 s for <b>molding</b> <b>time,</b> and 807 mg/cm² for cake quantity. For such conditions, oil expression yield was 48. 0 % in proportion to the oil that the cake contained, leading to a total oil yield close (- 8 %) to the highest yield obtained (71. 9 % in proportion to the oil that the sunflower whole plant contained instead of 77. 8 %). Thermo-pressing of cake from sunflower whole plant led to two actions in a single step: the expression of part of residual oil in cake that contributed to the improvement of the oil extraction efficiency, and the molding of biodegradable fiberboards. Their flexural properties were promising. Moreover, because residual oil content in fiberboards was at least 8. 0 % dry matter, they were not too water-sensitive (i. e. more durable than other thermo-pressed agromaterials). Such fiberboards were value-added agromaterials that may have direct industrial applications. Indeed, they would be potentially usable as inter-layer sheets for pallets, for the manufacturing of biodegradable containers (composters, crates for vegetable gardening), or for their heat insulation properties in building trade...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to manufacture new biodegradable fiberboards by thermo-pressing. The starting material was deoiled cake (only 0. 9 % oil content), generated during the biorefinery of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) whole plant in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. All fiberboards were cohesive mixtures of proteins and lignocellulosic fibers, acting respectively as binder and reinforcing fillers. The molding experiments were conducted using a 400 ton capacity heated hydraulic press. The influence of molding conditions on board density, mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties, thickness swelling, and water absorption was examined. Molding conditions included pressure applied (24. 5 – 49. 0 MPa), <b>molding</b> <b>time</b> (60 – 300 s), and mold temperature (156 – 204 ◦C), and these greatly affected board density and thus the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties. Board density increased with increasingly extreme molding conditions, rising from 1162 to 1324 kg/m 3. The flexural properties increased at the same time (from 12. 2 to 27. 7 MPa for flexural strength at break, and from 2183 to 5244 MPa for elastic modulus) and also Shore D surface hardness (from 69. 6 to 79. 0 ◦). Conversely, Charpy impact strength was low and quite independent of thermo-pressing conditions. Statistical analysis of the Doehlert’s experimental design was conducted to determine optimal thermo-pressing conditions for flexural properties, giving 49. 0 MPa pressure applied, 300 s <b>molding</b> <b>time,</b> and 204 ◦C mold temperature. Density of boards molded under these conditions was 1267 kg/m 3. Flexural strength at break, elastic modulus and Shore D surface hardness were 30. 3 MPa, 5946 MPa, and 81. 5 ◦, respectively, and these corresponded to the highest values for the entire study. Such boards largely complied with French standard NF EN 312, type P 4 (i. e. load bearing boards for use in dry conditions) for flexural properties. However, thickness swelling (30 %) needs to be slightly reduced to achieve the 21 % recommended standard value...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} article, an open gap is present between the fibrous {{reinforcements}} {{and the upper}} mold during the filling stage of resin injection/compression molding (I/CM). Thus resin can quickly fill up the gap. After that, the mold platens are brought together and drive the resin through the preform. The resin motion in the gap is simplified using the Hele-Shaw flow model, while Darcy’s law {{is used to calculate}} the flow fields in the fiber mats. The numerical simulation is based on the body-fitted finite element method (FEM). Results show that the resin injection time is short and most filling time is elevated to the closing of the cavity in the simultaneous I/CM filling process. Small gap size and high compression speed can be used to achieve the minimum <b>mold</b> filling <b>time.</b> However, the improper process parameters can cause the incomplete filling or reversed flow at the gate. In order to avoid the above conditions, the restrictive conditions of simultaneous I/CM are also discussed.

The MGSS conformal cooling channels reduced the warpage in both x and y directions by 14 % to 54 % and improved the cooling time by 65 % compared to straight-drilled cooling channels...|$|R
