40|$|The GLUT 4 {{system in}} muscle and fat cells plays an {{important}} role in whole-body glucose homeostasis. Insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT 4 from an intracellular <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> to the cell surface. The nature of this compartment remains largely unknown. We review recent studies describing the biogenesis and molecular constituents of the GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> and conclude that it is segregated from the endosomal and biosynthetic pathways. Further, we present evidence to suggest that the GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> moves directly to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and, hence, is analogous to small synaptic vesicles in neurons. We propose that the GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> be referred to as GLUT 4 storage vesicles or GSVs...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> {{requires}} more stringent and diligent packing than standard moving, since the packages will {{be handled by}} shippers or a <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> company's pickup/delivery service. For example, the thin walls of standard moving boxes cannot withstand the multiple transfers, stacking and other rigors of the shipping / mailing process. Further, failing to pack the boxes fully may result in boxes that [...] "cave in" [...] when other boxes are stacked on them. <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> companies often request customers to use thick walled or reinforced shipping boxes, to reinforce the seams with heavy duty packing tape, and to pack boxes to their fullest (while not over-stuffing them). This advice applies to boxes provided by <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> firms as well as boxes provided by the customer. Many <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> companies charge re-boxing and handling fees for boxes that are poorly packed or damaged on arrival. In addition, insurance charges that were paid by customers may not apply for boxes that were damaged in transit.|$|R

40|$|An energy {{producing}} device, {{for example}} a submersible vehicle for descending or ascending to different depths within water or ocean, is disclosed. The vehicle comprises a temperature-responsive material {{to which a}} hydraulic fluid is associated. A pressurized <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> stores the fluid {{as soon as the}} temperature-responsive material changes density. The <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> is connected with a hydraulic motor, and a valve allows fluid passage from the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> to the hydraulic motor. An energy storage component, e. g. a battery, is connected with the hydraulic motor and is charged by the hydraulic motor when the hydraulic fluid passes through the hydraulic motor. Upon passage in the hydraulic motor, the fluid is stored in a further <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> and is then sent back to the area of the temperature-responsive material...|$|R

40|$|The glucose {{transporter}} isoform GLUT 4 is unique among the {{glucose transporter}} family of proteins in that, in resting cells, it is sequestered very efficiently in a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b> In insulin-sensitive cells, such as fat and muscle, insulin stimulation leads to release of GLUT 4 from this reservoir and its translocation to the plasma membrane. This process {{is crucial for}} the control of blood and tissue glucose levels. Investigations of the composition {{and structure of the}} GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment,</b> together with the targeting motifs that direct GLUT 4 to this compartment, have been extensive but have been controversial. Recent findings have now provided a clearer consensus of opinion on the mechanisms involved in the formation of this <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b> However, another controversy has now emerged, which is unresolved. This concerns the issue of whether the insulin-regulated step occurs at the level of release of GLUT 4 from the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> or at the level at which released vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane...|$|R

40|$|Repeated {{high doses}} (2 - 4 mg/kg/day) of {{amphotericin}} B entrapped in sonicated liposomes made of egg yolk lecithin, cholesterol, and stearylamine in the molar ratio 4 : 3 : 1 were given intravenously to cancer patients with fungal complications. High {{levels of the}} drug were measured in the serum. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that amphotericin B distribution followed a nonlinear bicompartmental model incorporating a liposome-free drug subsystem. This model allowed us to define the Michaelis-Menten dissociation constant of uptake of the drug entrapped in the liposomes by the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment,</b> the maximal liberation rate and fractional liberation rate of free amphotericin B, {{and the number of}} binding sites in the ampholiposome <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b> the levels of free amphotericin B in the serum and the kinetics of saturation of the uptake of ampholiposomes by the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> were also calculated. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.
