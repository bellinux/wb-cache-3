25|$|DHEA is {{transformed}} into DHEA-S by sulfation at the C3β position via the sulfotransferase enzymes SULT2A1 {{and to a lesser}} extent SULT1E1. This occurs naturally in the adrenal cortex and during first-pass <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> and intestines when exogenous DHEA is administered orally. Levels of DHEA-S in circulation are approximately 250 to 300 times those of DHEA. DHEA-S in turn can be converted back into DHEA in peripheral tissues via steroid sulfatase (STS).|$|E

25|$|AMPK {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in lipid <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> It has long been known that hepatic ACC has been regulated in the liver by phosphorylation. AMPK also phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. HMGR converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is made from acetyl-CoA, into mevalonic acid, which then travels down several more metabolic steps to become cholesterol. AMPK, therefore, helps regulate fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Research is {{underway}} {{to determine if}} risks of estrogen supplement use are {{the same for all}} methods of delivery. In particular, estrogen applied topically may have a different spectrum of side-effects than when administered orally, and transdermal estrogens do not affect clotting as they are absorbed directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first-pass <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> This route of administration is thus preferred in women with a history of thrombo-embolic disease.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is well-absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract but between 55 and 87% undergoes first-pass <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver,</b> {{resulting in a}} mean oral bioavailability of approximately 29%. Following a single very low dose of 6mg, peak plasma levels of doxepin are 0.854ng/mL (3.06nmol/L) at 3hours without food and 0.951ng/mL (3.40nmol/L) at 6hours with food. Plasma concentrations of doxepin with antidepressant doses are far greater, ranging between 50 and 250ng/mL (180 to 900nmol/L). Area-under-curve levels of the drug are increased significantly when it is taken with food.|$|E

40|$|Chantier qualité GAA {{quantitative}} trait locus (QTL) for boar fat androstenone levels has been identified near the SSC 7 centromere in a Large White × Meishan cross. Backcrosses were produced to isolate <b>the</b> Chinese haplotype <b>in</b> a European genetic background.

50|$|Alcohol: Alcoholism {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of fatty liver due to {{production}} of toxic metabolites like aldehydes during <b>metabolism</b> of alcohol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> This phenomenon most commonly occurs with chronic alcoholism.|$|R
25|$|Progesterone is metabolized into allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (conversions {{that are}} catalyzed by the enzymes 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} and {{occurs in the}} liver, reproductive endocrine tissues, skin, and the brain), which are neurosteroids and potent potentiators of GABAA receptors. It {{is for this reason}} that common reported side effects of progesterone include dizziness, drowsiness or sedation, sleepiness, and fatigue. Both oral and sufficiently high doses of intramuscular progesterone can produce these sedative effects, indicating that first-pass <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> is not essential for the conversion to take place. Moreover, the sedative effects occur in both men and women, indicating a lack of sex-specificity of the effects.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of progesterone is very low, requiring {{very high}} doses to produce significant effects, and the hormone must be micronized {{in order to}} confer oral activity at practical dosages. As progesterone {{could not be used}} orally for many decades (until the introduction of OMP in 1980), the poor activity of oral progesterone prompted the development of progestins (i.e., synthetic progestogens), which, in contrast to oral progesterone, have improved metabolic stability and high oral bioavailability. OMP is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but its bioavailability is very low at less than 10% (relative to intramuscular injection) due to extensive first-pass <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> There is wide interindividual variability in the bioavailability of OMP, and its absorption is increased approximately two-fold when it is taken with food.|$|E
2500|$|Metabolism is also {{dependent}} on the species of organism; different organisms have slightly different P450 enzymes that metabolize certain PCBs better than others. [...] Looking at the PCB <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> of four sea turtles (green, olive ridley, loggerhead and hawksbill), green and hawksbill sea turtles have noticeably higher hydroxylation rates of PCB 52 than olive ridley or loggerhead sea turtles.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the {{efficiency}} and toxicity of drugs change during a 24 -h period. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes have started to emerge only recently. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to highlight recent discoveries showing the direct role of the molecular circadian clock <b>in</b> xenobiotic <b>metabolism</b> at <b>the</b> transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> and intestine, and the different ways of elimination of these metabolized drugs via biliary and urine excretions. Most of the related literature focuses on transcriptional regulation by the circadian clock of xenobiotic <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liver; however, the role of this timing system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> excretion of metabolized drugs and the importance of <b>the</b> kidney <b>in</b> this phenomenon are generally neglected. The goal of this review is to describe the molecular mechanisms involved <b>in</b> rhythmic drug <b>metabolism</b> and excretion. EXPERT OPINION: Chronopharmacology is used to analyze <b>the</b> <b>metabolism</b> of drugs <b>in</b> mammals according to the time of day. The circadian timing system plays a key role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> changes of toxicity of drugs by influencing their <b>metabolisms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> and intestine <b>in</b> addition to their excretion via bile flow and urine...|$|R
30|$|The use of {{regional}} anticoagulation with citrate also has additional benefits, such as improving the circuit survival time [15].

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of valproate <b>metabolism</b> occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> <b>In</b> adult patients taking valproate alone, 30–50% of an administered dose is excreted in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. [...] The other major pathway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>metabolism</b> of valproate is mitochondrial beta-oxidation, which typically accounts for over 40% of an administered dose. Typically, less than 20% of an administered dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose of valproate is excreted unchanged (i.e., as valproate) in urine.|$|R

40|$|The Kallikrein-Kinin System (KKS) {{has been}} implicated in several aspects of metabolism, {{including}} the regulation of glucose homeostasis and adiposity. Kinins and des-Arg-kinins are the major effectors of this system and promote their effects by binding to two different receptors, the kinin B 2 and B 1 receptors, respectively. To understand {{the influence of the}} KKS on the pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM), we generated an animal model deficient for both kinin receptor genes and leptin (obB 1 B 2 KO). Six-month-old obB 1 B 2 KO mice showed increased blood glucose levels. Isolated islets of the transgenic animals were more responsive to glucose stimulation releasing greater amounts of insulin, mainly in 3 -month-old mice, which was corroborated by elevated serum C-peptide concentrations. Furthermore, they presented hepatomegaly, pronounced steatosis, and increased levels of circulating transaminases. This mouse also demonstrated exacerbated gluconeogenesis during the pyruvate challenge test. The hepatic abnormalities were accompanied by changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gene expression of factors linked to glucose and lipid <b>metabolisms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> Thus, we conclude that kinin receptors are important for modulation of insulin secretion and for the preservation of normal glucose levels and hepatic functions i...|$|R

40|$|Benzene is {{a highly}} flammable, colorless liquid, and {{ubiquitous}} exposures result from its presence in gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. After uptake into the body, benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations resulting in multiple metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the uptake and elimination of benzene in mice to relate the concentration of inhaled and orally administered benzene to the tissue doses of benzene and its key metabolites. This model {{takes into account the}} zonal distribution of enzymes and <b>metabolisms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>liver,</b> rather than treating <b>the</b> <b>liver</b> as one homogeneous compartment, and considers <b>metabolism</b> <b>in</b> tissues other than <b>the</b> <b>liver.</b> Analysis was done to examine the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the system. We then formulated an inverse problem to obtain estimates for the unknown parameters; data from multiple laboratories and experiments were used. Despite the sources of variability, the model simulations matched the data reasonably well in most cases, showing that the multicompartment metabolism model does improve predictions over the previous model [6] and that in vitro metabolic constants can be successfully extrapolated to predict in vivo data for benzene metabolism and dosimetry. ...|$|R
