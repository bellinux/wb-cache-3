50|$|Doxacurium is {{available}} worldwide although, {{for a number}} of years, its use has not been popular because of considerably long duration of action. Its decline from clinical use was even further hastened when the sister molecule, <b>mivacurium</b> <b>chloride,</b> was introduced into the clinic very shortly after doxacurium's debut. The only perceived advantange of doxacurium over that of mivacurium is its superior cardiovascular profile, with particular reference to the lack of histamine release when administered as a rapid bolus dose.|$|E
40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE PHARMACOLOGICALLY A NEW RELAXANT AGENT <b>MIVACURIUM</b> <b>CHLORIDE</b> COMPARED TO A DEPOLARIZING AND A NON DEPOLARIZING RELAXANT RELATING TO THE STARTING TIME OF ACTION AND THE DURATION OF MYOCHALASES.

40|$|In {{three groups}} of 20 patients, anaesthetized with {{propofol}} and alfentanil, tracheal intubation conditions and the onset of neuromuscular blockade after administration of three different doses of <b>mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> (0. 11, 0. 15, and 0. 19 mg/kg = 1. 5 x ED 95, 2 x ED 95, and 2. 5 x ED 95) were assessed. Intubation conditions {{were found to be}} clinically acceptable (good or excellent) in 83 % of patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients were successfully intubated on the first attempt after 60 - 90 s. No difference in intubation scores or number of intubation attempts among the three dosage groups were found. We conclude that <b>mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> allows smooth intubation in most patients within 60 - 90 s, even with the lowest dose (0. 11 mg/kg), after a propofol-alfentanil induction of anaesthesia. However, because there were a few patients in whom intubating conditions were inadequate at 60 - 90 s, we are reluctant to advocate the preference of <b>mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> over suxamethonium for rapid sequence induction in emergency situations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> (BW B 1090 U), a new short-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular {{blocking}} drug, {{has undergone}} initial clinical trials to evaluate its neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects [1 - 7]. Mivacurium is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase {{at a rate}} 70 % of that of suxamethonium [8]. Because of its relatively short duration of action, mivacurium may be useful as a bolus to facilitate tracheal intubation and as an infusion to maintain extended neuromuscular block. This study of healthy adult patients undergoing surgery was designed to compare the onset of neuromuscular block and the ease of tracheal intubation after near equipotent bolus doses of mivacurium or suxamethonium, to define the infusion requirements and recovery pattern following cessation of mivacurium or suxa-methonium infusion, and to test the predictive value of the time to recovery of 5 % neuro-muscular transmission (75) after an initial bolus in determining the infusion requirements for miva-curium or suxamethonium. PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 30 healthy adults (ASA physical status I or II) aged 18 - 57 yr. All patients underwent low to moderate risk elective surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation. Wome...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is a new}} non-depolarizing neuromuscular {{blocking}} drug, structurally {{related to}} atracurium [1]. It has a duration of action which appears shorter than that of other currently available non-depolarizing neuromuscular block-ing agents [1], but longer than that of suxa-methonium [2]. It is eliminated via metabolism by plasma pseudocholinesterase [1, 3]. There have been no published comparisons of mivacurium with both suxamethonium and atracurium under the same experimental conditions. Our aim was to define the neuromuscular blocking actions and cardiovascular effects of mivacurium and compare them with those of suxamethonium and atra-curium. PATIENTS AND METHODS With approval from our Committee on Human Research and written, informed patient consent, we studied 41 patients (ASA physical status I or II) undergoing various surgical procedures. No patient was taking medications or suffered from any disease known to affect neuromuscular func-tion. Following premedication with midazolam 0. 02 - 0. 08 mg kg" 1 i. v., anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 5 - 10 kg" 1, followed by thio-pentone 2 - 6 mg kg" 1 i. v. Tracheal intubation wa...|$|E

40|$|Seventy-two adult {{surgical}} {{patients were}} studied to compare neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of <b>mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> during nitrous oxide-fentanyl-thiopentone (BAL group) or ni-trous oxide-halothane (HAL group) anaesthesia. Eighteen {{patients in the}} BAL group received an initial bolus of mivacurium, either the ED 2 S (n = 9) or the ED 50 (n = 9) (0. 03 and 0. 05 mg kg- 1). These doses {{were based on the}} assumption that the slope of the dose-response curve during nitrous oxide-opioid anaesthesia would be approximately the same as the slope of the neuromuscular response from the first human studies with mivacurium. Twenty-seven addi-tional patients were allocated to subgroups of nine patients to receive mivacurium 0. 04. 0. 08 or 0. 15 mg kg' 1. Twenty-seven patients in the HAL group were allocated also to subgroups of nine patients to receive mivacurium 0. 03, 0. 04 or 0. 15 mg kg' 1. During stable anaesthesia, mean end-tidal halothane concentrations were maintained at 0. 49 ± 0. 01 %. The estimated ED 50, ED 75 and ED 95 for BAL and HAL groups were 0. 039, 0. 05 and 0. 073 mg kg~ 1 and 0. 040, 0. 053 and 0. 081 mg kg' 1, respectively. Halothane did not poten-tiate maximum block or time to maximum block. Halothane did affect spontaneous recovery. With the 0. 15 -mg kg- 1 dose, time to 95 % recovery was prolonged significantly in the HAL group (30. 0 fSEM 1. 4) min) compared with the BAL group (24. 1 (1. 5) min). Recovery index from 25 % to 75 % recovery was also prolonged significantly in the HAL group (7. 0 (0. 4) min) compared with the BAL group (5. 4 (0. 4) min).

40|$|Rapacuronium bromide (rapacuronium; ORG- 9487) is a nondepolarising {{muscle relaxant}} (NMBA) {{with a low}} potency [90 % {{effective}} dose(ED 90) 1 mg/kg], which to some extent is responsible for its rapid onset of action. Because of the: high plasma clearance (5. 3 to 11. 1 mg/kg/min) of rapacuronium, its clinical duration of action following single bolus doses up to 2 mg/kg in adults is short (i. e. 1. 5 mg/kg to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation, and to use succinylcholine or rocuronium rather than rapacuronium in a rapid-sequence setting. Rapacuronium, however, is a suitable alternative to <b>mivacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> (mivacurium) and succinylcholine for short procedures (e. g. ambulatory anaesthesia). Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) is a relatively low-potent, intermediate-acting NMBA. Its main advantage is the rapid onset of neuromuscular block whereby good or excellent intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 seconds after rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg (2 x ED 95). and within 60 to 180 seconds after smaller doses (1 to 1. 5 x ED 95). Larger doses of rocuronium (greater {{than or equal to}} 1 mg/kg) seem to be suitable for rapid-sequence induction under relatively light anaesthesia. However, it is still a matter of controversy whether, {{in the case of an}} unanticipated difficult intubation, the long duration of rocuronium administered in such large doses outweighs the many adverse effects of succinylcholine. Rocuronium has mild vagolytic effects and does not release histamine. even when administered in large doses. Rocuronium is primarily eliminated via the liver and its pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that of vecuronium bromide (vecuronium). Unlike vecuronium, rocuronium has no metabolite. Cisatracurium besilate (cisatracurium). the 1 R-cis, 1 'R-cis isomer of atracurium besilate (atracurium) is approximately 4 times more potent than atracurium. The onset time of cisatracurium is significantly slower than after equipotent doses of atracurium. The recommended intubating dose is 0. 15 to 0. 2 mg/kg (3 to 4 times ED 95). Over a wide range of clinically relevant doses the recovery proper ties of cisatracurium are affected by neither the size of the bolus dose nor by the duration of infusion. Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium does not trigger histamine release. Like atracurium. cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination. In contrast to atracurium. cisatracurium does not undergo hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma esterases. Moreover, about 77 % of the drug is cleared by organ-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
