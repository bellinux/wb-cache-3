The ions are transported through an evacuated electrostatic beam line containing elements to focus and steer the beam over 60m to the cyclotron. The 520 <b>MeV</b> (<b>million</b> <b>electron</b> <b>volts)</b> variable energy cyclotron accelerates these ions {{with a high}} frequency alternating electric field and uses a massive six-sector magnet to confine the beam in an outward spiral trajectory. Inserting a very thin graphite extraction foil strips, or removes, the electrons from the H⁻ ion while allowing the proton to pass through. The proton, {{because it is a}} positively charged particle, is deflected in the outward direction due to the magnetic field and is directed to a proton beam line.|$|E
5000|$|Energetic protons {{that are}} guided into the polar regions collide with {{atmospheric}} constituents and release their energy {{through the process}} of ionization. The majority of the energy is extinguished in the extreme lower region of the ionosphere (around 50-80 km in altitude). This area is particularly important to ionospheric radio communications because this is the area where most of the absorption of radio signal energy occurs. The enhanced ionization produced by incoming energetic protons increases the absorption levels in the lower ionosphere and can have the effect of completely blocking all ionospheric radio communications through the polar regions. Such events are known as Polar Cap Absorption events (or PCAs). These events commence and last as long as the energy of incoming protons at approximately greater than 10 <b>MeV</b> (<b>million</b> <b>electron</b> <b>volts)</b> exceeds roughly 10 pfu (particle flux units or [...] ) at geosynchronous satellite altitudes.|$|E

Electron interactions during the generation of VLF rising tones are strongly nonlinear, such that {{a fraction of the}} relativistic electrons at resonant energies are trapped by waves, leading to significant nonadiabatic energy exchange. Through detailed examination of VLF chorus and electron fluxes observed by Van Allen Probes, we investigate the efficiency of nonlinear processes for acceleration of electrons to MeV energies. We find through subpacket analysis of chorus waveforms that electrons with initial energy of hundreds of keV to 3 MeV can be accelerated by 50 keV– 200 keV in resonant interactions with a single VLF rising tone on a time scale of 10 – 100 ms.

40|$|Before {{the second}} world war, the inner {{workings}} of the nucleus were a mystery. Fermi and collaborators in Rome had bombarded nuclei by neutrons, and the result was a large number of resonance states, evidenced by sharp peaks in the cross section; i. e., in the off-coming neutrons. These peaks were the size of <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> (eV) in width. (The characteristic energy of a single molecule flying around in the air at room temperature is the order of 1 / 40 of an <b>electron</b> <b>volt.</b> Thus, one <b>electron</b> <b>volt</b> is the energy of a small assemblage of these particles.) On the other hand, the difference in energy between low-lying energy levels in light and medium nuclei is the order of <b>MeV,</b> one <b>million</b> <b>electron</b> <b>volts.</b> Now Niels Bohr’s point [1] was that if the widths of the nuclear levels (compound states) were more than a million times smaller than the typical excitation energies of nuclei, then this meant that the neutron did not just fall into the nucleus and come out again, but that it collided with the many particles in the nucleus, sharing its energy. According to the energy-time uncertainty relation, the width ∆E of such a resonance is related to the lifetime of the state by t ≃ �/∆E ∼ �/(1 eV). In fact, the time t ∼ �/(10 MeV) is the characteristic time for a nucleon to circle around once in the nucleus, the dimension of which is Fermis (1 Fermi = 10 − 13 cm) ...|$|R
40|$|Measurements on the CRRES {{satellite}} {{have revealed}} that most discharge pulses experienced in the radiation belts correlated with high fluencies of energetic electrons but not with surface potentials. This fact {{highlights the importance of}} deep dielectric charging. In this overview, we start with the Bethe-Bloch equation, which describes the basic mechanism of charged particle penetration into matter. Depending on the charged species and material properties, the penetration distance can be calculated. At MeV energies, electrons penetrate deeper than ions into satellite surface dielectrics by two orders of magnitude, leaving an excess of electron charge inside and generating a high electric field. After the passage of the peak of a typical killer storm, low energy ambient ions arrive forming a double layer with the excess electrons. Overall charge neutrality renders the surface potential to be low despite a high electric field inside the double layer, explaining the CRRES results. Physical mechanisms are discussed for explaining the critical electric field that may cause a sudden discharge.
