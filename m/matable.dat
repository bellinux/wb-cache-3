50|$|Khama III (1837?-1923), {{referred}} to by missionaries as Khama the Good, was the kgosi (meaning chief or king) of the Bamangwato people of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), who made his country a protectorate of Great Britain to ensure its survival against Boer and Ndebele encroachments. One successful goal was to stop the westward expansion of the Transvaal. He fought on the British side in the 1893 <b>Matable</b> War. He gained some disputed territory as a result. When Cecil Rhodes threatened to expand north, he along with his chiefs and Protestant missionaries visited London. He {{was treated as a}} hero by evangelicals, and was received by Queen Victoria. He was guaranteed further protection. During the Anglo-Boer war of 1899-1902, he guarded British communication lines. He blocked incorporation into the white-run Union of South Africa in 1910. He built a well-organized, well-funded government with a bureaucracy dominated by Christian converts.|$|E
40|$|An {{electrical}} connector and method includes a connector and a conforming element proximate to or {{in contact with}} the mating end of the connector so as to prevent distortion of a <b>matable</b> end. The <b>matable</b> end of the connector may be of a female or male type and may be of a post, tube, blade, pin, or other configuration. An element made of conforming material, for example, an elastomer, epoxy or rubber type material, is configured and positioned {{in contact with the}} <b>matable</b> end of the connector, providing support during assembly to prevent distortion of the <b>matable</b> end. The conforming element may be rectangular, wedge, cylindrical, conical, annular, or of another configuration as required to provide support to the connector pin. The conforming element may be fastened with an adhesive to the <b>matable</b> end to further prevent distortion...|$|E
40|$|Newly molted female Heptacarpus paludicola {{with full}} ovaries evoke a copulatory {{response}} from males upon contact. Males recognize a <b>matable</b> female for copulation by apparent contact chemoreception with the antennal flagellae. Observational {{evidence in this}} species and in several others cited in the literature did not strongly suggest distance perception of <b>matable</b> females by males. However, when tested in an experimental "olfactometer"' evidence wu obtained to indicate that <b>matable</b> females of this species emit a pheromone that increases activity of males, whereas hard-shelled, embryo-bearing females do not. Although newly molted females with full ovaries were {{by far the most}} effective in evoking copulatory behavior from males, newly molted females without ovarian development (due to parasitization or food deprivation) showed varying degrees of attractiveness. Newly molted males were not attractive to other males. The duration of attractiveness to males was less than one day after <b>matable</b> females had molted. Chemicals associated with the hardening of the cuticle are suggested as a possibility for the apparent contact pheromone involved in sex recognition. ...|$|E

Om L-band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (S A R) array, a 1. 0 mdiamem X-baad telecom reflectarmy, and a 3 mdbmeter Ka-band telmm reflectarray. All three antennas are similar in c o w o n and each consists of an <b>Matable</b> tubular Erame that supports and tensions a multi-layer thin-membrane RF radiating surface with printed microstrip patches. The L-band S A R array achieved a bendwidth of 80 MHz, an aperture efficiency of 74 %, a d a total mass of 15 kg The X-band reflectanay achieved an aperture efficiency of 37 %, good radiation patterns, and a total mass o f 1. 2 kg (excluding inflation system). The 3 m Ka-band refl-achieved a surface flatness of 0. lmm RMS, good radiation patterns, and a total mass of 12. 8 kg (excluding Mation system). These antennas demonstrated that idatable arrays are feasible acfoss the microwave and millimeter-wave s p e c t n u n s. F d e r development of these antemas are deemed necessary, i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After {{giving an}} {{introduction}} to the procedure dubbed slow poly-nomial mating and stating a conjecture relating this to other notions of poly-nomial mating, we show conformally correct pictures of the slow mating of two degree 3 post critically finite polynomials introduced by Shishikura and Tan Lei {{as an example of a}} non <b>matable</b> pair of polynomials without a Levy cycle. The pictures show a limit for the Julia sets, which seems to be related to the Julia set of a degree 6 rational map. We give a conjectural interpretation o...|$|E
