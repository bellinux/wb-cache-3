50|$|Bio{{composite}} (Latin for ''''''grown by sun'''''') is {{a composite}} material formed by a matrix (resin) and a reinforcement of natural fibers. These kind of materials often mimic {{the structure of the}} living materials involved in the process keeping the strengthening properties of the matrix that was used, but always providing biocompatibility.The <b>matrix</b> <b>phase</b> is formed by polymers derived from renewable and nonrenewable resources. The matrix is important to protect the fibers from environmental degradation and mechanical damage, to hold the fibers together and to transfer the loads on it. In addition, biofibers are the principal components of biocomposites, which are derived from biological origins, for example fibers from crops (cotton, flax or hemp), recycled wood, waste paper, crop processing byproducts or regenerated cellulose fiber (viscose/rayon). The interest in biocomposites is rapidly growing in terms of industrial applications (automobiles, railway coach, aerospace, military applications, construction, and packaging) and fundamental research, due to its great benefits (renewable, cheap, recyclable, and biodegradable). Biocomposites can be used alone, or as a complement to standard materials, such as carbon fiber. Advocates of biocomposites state that use of these materials improve health and safety in their production, are lighter in weight, have a visual appeal similar to that of wood, and are environmentally superior.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{decrepitation}} (HD) is {{an effective}} and environmentally friendly technique for recycling of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets. During the HD process, the NdFeB breaks down into a <b>matrix</b> <b>phase</b> (Nd 2 Fe 14 BHx) and RE-rich grain boundary phase. The grain boundary phase in the HD powder is < 2 μm in size. Recycled NdFeB material has a higher oxygen content compared to the primary source material. This additional oxygen mainly occurs at the Rare Earth (RE) rich grain boundary phase (GBP), because rare earth elements oxidise rapidly when exposed to air. This higher oxygen level in the material results in a drop in density, coercivity, and remanence of sintered NdFeB magnets.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for three-dimensional nonlinear material modelling of fiber-reinforced laminated composites is presented. The material modelling procedure has a two-level hierarchical structure. At the bottom level, constitutive {{information about the}} fiber and the <b>matrix</b> <b>phases</b> are synthesized using a micromechanical model to yield the effective stress-strain response of a unidirectional lamina. At the top level, a three-dimensional lamination scheme is employed which assembles the laminae within a sublaminate, and delivers the effective stress-strain response of the sublaminate. Local stresses and strains in a lamina or in fiber and <b>matrix</b> <b>phases</b> can be recovered from the effective values at any stage. The material modelling procedure {{enables the use of}} standard displacement-based finite elements. The matrix material is characterized using nonlinear-elastic Ramberg-Osgood relations. Micromechanical failure criteria are used for determining various modes of failure, including compression kink-banding. The accuracy of the micromechanical model is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with results from other micromechanical models and experimental data.

The present study aims at a quantitative understanding of the effect of SiC reinforcements on secondary <b>matrix</b> <b>phases,</b> namely eutectic Si, during solidification of A 356 Al-SiC composites. Effect of volume fraction of SiC particulate on size and shape of eutectic Si has been studied at different cooling rates. Results indicate that an increase in SiC volume fraction leads to a reduction in the size of eutectic Si and also changes its morphology from needle-like to equiaxed. This is attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation of eutectic Si on SiC particles. However, SiC particles are found to have negligible influence on DAS. Under all the solidification conditions studied in the present investigation, SiC particles are found to be rejected by the growing dendrites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
