2500|$|In 1919, Prime Minister Billy Hughes {{and former}} Prime Minister Joseph Cook took Australia's {{seat at the}} Versailles peace conference. Hughes' signing of the Treaty of Versailles {{was the first time}} Australia had signed an {{international}} treaty. Hughes demanded heavy reparations from Germany and frequently clashed with US President Woodrow Wilson. At one point Hughes declared: [...] "I speak for 60,000 [...] dead". He went on to ask of Wilson; [...] "How <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> speak for?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During bidding, a team may declare either Big Mo or Little Mo, {{meaning they}} intend {{to take the first}} several tricks. [...] This is the only time that {{cross-talk}} during the bidding is allowed. [...] A player considering a Mo may ask his teammate [...] "How <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have on the Mo?" [...] or some similar question to determine how many tricks the teammate can contribute to the Mo without revealing any details as to which tricks they'll take. [...] The only detail that can be discussed is which teammate will be leading the first trick but not how they will be leading. [...] If a team declares Little Mo, they must take the first 7 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Little Mo earns the team 150 points. [...] If a team declares Big Mo, they must take the first 10 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Big Mo earns the team 250 points. [...] Taking more consecutive tricks than needed does not earn the team more points. [...] For instance, taking the first 10 tricks when a Little Mo had been declared still only earns the team 150 points. [...] The team that declares either Mo is immune to bags for that hand and will lead the first trick, regardless of whose turn it was to lead. [...] Failure to accomplish the declared Mo (the opposing team took a trick before the goal was met) will cause the team to lose the points they would have earned had they been successful. [...] This is true regardless of how many tricks they took before or after the opposing team took a trick. [...] The other team bids and must match their bid, as usual. [...] It's not unusual for a team that could do a Big Mo to declare a Little Mo to play it safe and then take the extra tricks to try to set their opponents.|$|E

60|$|Slavery, {{continued}} Mr. Lincoln, is not {{a matter}} of little importance, it overshadows every other question in which we are interested. It has divided the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, and has sown discord in the American Tract Society. The churches have split and the society will follow their example before long. So it will be seen that slavery is agitated in the religious as well as in the political world. Judge Douglas is very much afraid in the triumph that the Republican party will lead to a general mixture of the white and black races. Perhaps I am wrong in saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying that he pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the amalgamation of the blacks and whites. I think I can show plainly, from documents now before me, that Judge Douglas's fears are groundless. The census of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred thousand mulattoes in the United States. Now let us take what is called an Abolition State--the Republican, slavery-hating State of New Hampshire--and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders. The number amounts to just one hundred and eighty-four. In the Old Dominion--in the Democratic and aristocratic State of Virginia--there were a few more mulattoes than the Census-takers found in New Hampshire. How <b>many</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose there were? Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five--twenty-three thousand more than there were in all the free States! In the slave States there were in 1800, three hundred and forty-eight thousand mulattoes all of home production; and in the free States there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes--and a large number of them were imported from the South.|$|E
