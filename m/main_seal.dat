30|$|The Songliao Basin {{is famous}} for the Daqing Oilfield, the biggest in China. However, no {{economic}} hydrocarbon reservoir {{has been found in}} the northeastern Binbei district. Its thermal history, which is of great importance for hydrocarbon generation and migration, is studied with apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology. Samples with depositional ages of the late Cretaceous (∼ 108 – 73 Ma) are analyzed. The AFT ages of the samples from reservoir rock (depositional age > 76.1 Ma) fall between the late Cretaceous (72 ± 5 Ma) and the early Eocene (41 ± 3 Ma) period, indicating their total annealing after deposition. In contrast, two samples from the <b>main</b> <b>seals</b> of the Qingshankou (depositional age > 89.3 Ma) and the Nenjiang Formation (depositional age > 73.0 Ma) are not annealed or partially annealed (AFT ages of 97 ± 9 Ma and 70 ± 4 Ma, respectively). Because the maximum burial temperature (< 90 °C) evidenced by low vitrinite reflectance (Ro< 0.7) is not high enough to account for the AFT total annealing (110 – 120 °C), the transient thermal effect arising from the syntectonic fluid flow between the late Cretaceous and the early Eocene is proposed. Transient thermal effects from fluid flow explains the indicated temperature discrepancies between the AFT thermometer and the Ro thermometer because the transient thermal effect from the fluid flow with a temperature high enough (110 – 120 °C) to anneal the AFT thermometer does not last long enough (104 – 105 yrs.) for an enhancement of the Ro (minimum 106 – 107 yrs. under the same temperature). This indicates that dating thermal effect from fluid flow might be a new means to reconstruct the tectonic history. It also answers why the samples from the <b>main</b> <b>seals</b> are not annealed because the seals will prohibit fluid flow and supply good thermal insulation.

The main objective is to estimate soil loss by sealing in the Guadarrama River Basin (Madrid, Spain) between 1961 and 2011. The combination of digital processing (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), principal components and convolution filters) of satellite imagery with the digital terrain model helps to detect risk areas and allows quick updating of sealed soil mapping. The supervised classifications of the images were used to estimate the actual soil loss by sealing (9 % in 2011) in the Guadarrama River Basin and the types and agrologic classes that have been lost. Soil loss occurs to a greater extent in highly permeable soils (sands) and in the most fertile soils.

In 1971, deck height was extended from 9.480 in to 9.503 in (casting D1AE-6015-DA) {{to lower the}} compression ratio to reduce NOx emissions without the need to change piston or cylinder-head design. In 1974, a boss was added {{on the front of}} the right cylinder bank to mount the air injection pump (casting D4AE-A). In 1974, the oil dipstick tube moved from the timing case to the skirt under the left cylinder bank near the rear of the casting.

5000|$|Shafting and sealing: Keeping the {{propeller}} {{in the right}} place and making it reliable in case of impact with external items such as fishes or fishing nets {{is one of the main}} concerns in all kinds of thrusters. Many failures have been reported due to this problem. Some manufacturers try to solve it by using magnetic couplings and totally avoiding rotary sealing. This improves reliability of the sealing and shafting, but they lose in efficiency due to limited torque transfer capability of the magnetic coupling and they solve this problem by using a high speed, low torque propeller. In most models the efficiency is as low as 25% which is very low for underwater thrusters. Magnetic bearings require {{the propeller}} to be rotated on the outer shell surfaces using a layer of water as a lubricant, which may reduce the bearing life considerably in contaminated water. Some other manufacturers use tapered bearings and a multiple sealing system for redundancy.

30|$|The Oriente Basin is a {{foreland}} basin in {{the transition}} zone between the tectonically active Cordillera region and the stable Brazil–Guiana Shield (Christophoul et al. 2002). As {{one of the largest}} oil-producing basins in the South Andean foreland basin, the Oriente Basin accounts for 97 % of the proven reserves in Ecuador (Ma et al. 2014). The oil- and gas-producing capabilities of this basin have always attracted the attention of scholars. Two opinions prevail about the source rock of the Oriente Basin. One idea assumes that the main hydrocarbon source rocks of the basin (potential shale reservoir) are the Cretaceous group Napo marine shale and carbonate (Xie et al. 2010; Dashwood and Abbotts 1990). Meanwhile, others believe that the oil and gas come from the Santiago Formation (Gaibor et al. 2008). The general perspective is that the oil and gas are generated from the Napo marine shale in the north and Santiago Formation in the south and east of the basin. The main reservoirs are the Cretaceous group Hollin and Napo Formation sandstones (Estupiñan et al. 2010). The Cretaceous group is a source bed and an oil reservoir. The probable <b>main</b> <b>seal</b> rocks for Napo Formation are interbedded and overlying marine shales. The exploration and production data indicate that the Oriente Basin mainly produces oil and natural gas and yields considerably more of the former than the latter. To date, scholars have performed minimal research on the natural gas resource potential of this basin.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of engine seal is being {{developed}} {{to meet the needs}} of advanced hypersonic engines. A seal braided of emerging high temperature ceramic fibers comprised of a sheath-core construction was selected for study based on its low leakage rates. Flexible, low-leakage, high temperature seals are required to seal the movable engine panels of advanced ramjet-scramjet engines either preventing potentially dangerous leakage into backside engine cavities or limiting the purge coolant flow rates through the seals. To predict the leakage through these flexible, porous seal structures new analytical flow models are required. Two such models based on the Kozeny-Carman equations are developed herein and are compared to experimental leakage measurements for simulated pressure and seal gap conditions. The models developed allow prediction of the gas leakage rate as a function of fiber diameter, fiber packing density, gas properties, and pressure drop across the seal. The first model treats the seal as a homogeneous fiber bed. The second model divides the seal into two homogeneous fiber beds identified as the core and the sheath of the seal. Flow resistances of each of the <b>main</b> <b>seal</b> elements are combined to determine the total flow resistance. Comparisons between measured leakage rates and model predictions for seal structures covering a wide range of braid architectures show good agreement.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{developing}} a Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) for future exploration missions. The mechanism is a new state-of-the-art device for in-space assembly of structures and rendezvous of vehicles. At the interface between two pressurized modules, each with {{a version of the}} LIDS attached, a composite elastomer-metal seal assembly prevents the breathable air from escaping into the vacuum of space. Attached to the active LIDS, this seal mates against the passive LIDS during docking operation. The <b>main</b> interface <b>seal</b> assembly must exhibit low leak and outgas values, must be able to withstand various harsh space environments, must remain operational over a range of temperatures from - 50 C to 75 C, and perform after numerous docking cycles. This paper presents results from a comprehensive study of the mechanical performance of four candidate subscale seal assembly designs at - 50, 23, 50, and 75 C test temperatures. In particular, the force required to fully compress the seal during docking, and that which is required for separation during the undocking operation were measured. The height of subscale <b>main</b> interface <b>seal</b> bulbs, as well as the test temperature, were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the forces the <b>main</b> interface <b>seal</b> of the LIDS may experience during docking and undocking operations. The average force values required to fully compress each of the seal assemblies were shown to increase with test temperature by approximately 50 % from - 50 to 75 C. Also, the required compression forces were shown to increase as the height of the seal bulb was increased. The seal design with the tallest elastomer seal bulb, which was 31 % taller than that with the shortest bulb, required force values approximately 45 % higher than those for the shortest bulb, independent of the test temperature. The force required to separate the seal was shown to increase with decreasing temperature after 15 hours of simulated docking. No adhesion force was observed at 75 C, while magnitudes of up to 235 lbf were recorded at the refrigerated temperature. In addition, the adhesion force was observed to increase with bulb height. When compared with the LIDS program requirements, the measured compression force values were found to be below the maximum allowable load allotted to the <b>main</b> interface <b>seal.</b> However, the measured adhesion force values at the refrigerated test temperature were found to exceed the program limits...|$|R
