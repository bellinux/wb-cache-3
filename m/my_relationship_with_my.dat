40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} program of research was to retrospectively, narratively, and autobiographically examine how my professional identity shifted when I moved from the secret, safe space of my own classrooms to shared spaces with other teachers as a newly appointed Differentiated Instruction Facilitator. In education today, teachers increasingly share their classroom spaces with other professionals and often the shifts in identity of the people sharing spaces are not examined. In this inquiry, I examine my own identity by viewing the metaphorical dance floor of the Differentiated Instruction Project from both my position {{on the dance floor}} and from the balcony above. I inquire into the nature of <b>my</b> dancing <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> many partners over two years on my middle and secondary school landscape and how these relationships changed how I understood myself as a teacher and as a facilitator. I look at the differentiated philosophy I was expected to deliver and the knowledge my colleagues brought into our time together and how these two knowledge realms interacted and shifted my own knowledge and, in turn, <b>my</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> teacher partners and their students. My professional identity within the Differentiated Instruction Project shifted often. In the beginning, I attempted to integrate voices of the conduit and their system and sacred stories <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own personal practical knowledge. In this inquiry, I explore the relationship between the conduit and my work inside classroom spaces. I inquire into the effect of stories on my own personal practical knowledge and the knowledge of my colleagues and their students. I examine the ways in which many dancers were positioned on my educational dance floor {{and the ways in which}} these voices shaped the voice of my identity. Finally, I imagine possibilities for living and reliving and then telling and retelling stories of shifting identities within shared spaces...|$|R

40|$|Individuation, {{as defined}} by Jung, {{is a process that}} we go through which allows us to examine who we are as we delve into our shadows. These shadows both shape and {{constrain}} us as teachers, as partners, as parents and as human beings. As we seek to uncover all the hidden meanings, we throw off the constraints imposed upon us by the world. We are then able to mine our inner depths in order that we may discover our authentic selves. Having gone through this process, we as educators and artists, have some profound messages to bring to our students, and the world around us. Through the use of both poetic inquiry and autobiographical inquiry I illustrate how Jung’s theory of the process of individuation works.

The texts of the writers have allowed me to make visible a feminine freedom that has always existed. Reading them has allowed us to dialogue with them, bringing our life experience to the classroom as well. This has made <b>my</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the students easier; {{it has become the}} centre of my educational practice. It has been an experience of transforming myself, showing my opening to the other and making myself available. The recovery of <b>my</b> primary <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mother and of the language that she teaches me has been the key to a process that started out from the love of literature and the <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the students, and that has grown over time in <b>relationships</b> of authority <b>with</b> other women, that have led the way to making the cut of sexual difference, a way of making the feminine perspective present in the world and, therefore, in the classroom...|$|R

Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone went farther, writing that {{the song is}} about [...] "an apparently matter-of-fact reminiscence of underage sex with a music-business mentor, an affair 'under rug swept.'"

So when I subsequently began to write in legal journals, I already had claimed the role of faith in the "public" sphere, as key to my intellectual concerns. After all, it was theologians and mystics I found myself reading in the midst of battery trials; it was Thomas Merton, Juliana of Norwich, and John Woolman (an American Quaker abolitionist and mystic) who kept me from being pulled down by the steep emotional-almost physiological-dynamics of litigation. At the same time, the public role of spirit in American politics and discourse compelled my reflective work and scholarly reading...|$|R
40|$|Since a young age, I {{have been}} {{interested}} in bicycling as a form of fun and fanciful recreation, but it wasn’t until the summer of 2011 that a serious shift occurred in my understanding of the bike as more than a mere machine.

In writing about these experiences, I hope to offer some insight into how American culture currently frames transportation and how I hope the construction of a bike positive culture can instill social, environmental, and political change.
