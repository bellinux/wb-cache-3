40|$|A CAD {{tool for}} on chip {{controller}} synthesis to digital signal processors has been developed. Micro programmed digital signal processors {{often have a}} complicated control flow where structure {{and complexity of the}} <b>micro</b> <b>program</b> varies considerably between applications. Therefore, an advanced controller architecture adaptive to various algorithms is synthesized. The controller generates control words for datapath modules and can alter the control flow depending on signals generated in the datapath. Many applications require memories for coefficients and data storage. Address calculation to these memories is a natural part of the <b>micro</b> <b>program.</b> Hence, the controller synthesizer also generates memories and address processing units. Synchronization and communication with external circuitry {{is an important part of}} many signal processors. The controller synthesizer facilitates such functions. The controller synthesizer is part of a design system where algorithms are transformed from a high level description to an integrated circuit. No restrictions on datapath architecture or processor complexity, other than technology limitations, are set by the system. The controller synthesizer has proved useful for rapid design of complex digital signal processors and has been used for several designs of varying complexity. Complexity, partitioning and the size of synthesized controllers vary depending on the algorithm and the <b>micro</b> <b>program.</b> A main goal was to be technology independent and to be capable of interfacing to different cell libraries and thereby to various vendors. To verify this the synthesizer supports two different cell libraries...|$|E

40|$|<b>Micro</b> credit <b>programs,</b> {{which are}} based on lending money on {{interest}} and encouraging savings, have been first been used in Southern countries and are now being implemented worldwide. Mainly aimed at the rural poor, particularly poor women, <b>micro</b> credit <b>programs</b> seek to ensure sustainable economic development in line with the requirements of global capitalism and to include women in the productive activities of the market. Micro credit has been made institutionalized based on three main paradigms, namely financial sustainability, poverty alleviation and women’s empowerment. In <b>micro</b> credit <b>programs,</b> where the emphasis on women’s empowerment is strong, the lack of a social gender perspective is striking. In fact, women may face patriarchal pressure and restrictions at the start in access to loans, loan usage models, participation to the productive activities in the market and during loan repayment. Thus the allegation that by way of micro credit, women will be empowered in terms of economic, social and political means in the family and society becomes questionable.

40|$|The {{transport}} of connectionless data {{is necessary for}} the compatibility of emerging wide area ATM networks with existing computer networks. This paper investigates the design and performance of a virtual connectionless network overlayed on top of cell-based connectionoriented ATM networks. The virtual connectionless network is made possible by utilizing connectionless servers. Two packet forwarding techniques used by connectionless servers are examined. Forwarding connectionless packets in a cell-by-cell manner (streaming mode) is shown to result in lower packet loss and end-to-end delay than packet-by-packet forwarding of connectionless data (reassembly mode). A design and implementation are presented for a streaming mode connectionless server capable of a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps. 3 This research is supported by grants from the University of California <b>MICRO</b> <b>program,</b> Nippon Steel Information and Communication Systems Inc.
