5|$|People with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{can display}} behavior, interests, {{and activities that}} are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> to inflexible routines, move in stereotyped and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects or compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.|$|E

25|$|Pathogenesis {{results from}} rupture of {{infected}} {{red blood cells}}, leading to fever. Infected red blood cells <b>may</b> also <b>stick</b> {{to each other and}} to walls of capillaries. Vessels plug up and deprive tissues of oxygen. Infection may also cause the spleen to enlarge.|$|R

25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, their skin <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is not}} a {{universal}} trait of gleaning birds to join with other species or even to be gregarious with their own kind. The leafbirds of Asia are foliage-gleaners, but are often found singly or in pairs. Also, where multiple species of gleaning birds forage in the same area, they may show niche segregation; for example, one species <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> to conifers while another species inhabits broadleaf trees, or they may even divide up a habitat, with smaller species feeding among higher, smaller tree branches and larger species staying on lower, larger branches.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E

6000|$|That is all I {{had to say}} of King Johann and his [...] "ICH DIEN." [...] Of the Luxemburg Kaisers (four in number, {{two sons}} of Karl still to come); who, except him of the sacramental wine, with [...] "ICH DIEN" [...] for son, are good for little; and deserve no memory from mankind except as they <b>may</b> <b>stick,</b> not easily extricable, {{to the history of}} nobler men:--of them also I could wish to be silent, but must not. Must at least explain how they came in, as [...] "Luxemburg Kurfursts" [...] in Brandenburg; and how they went out, leaving Brandenburg not annihilated, but very near it.|$|E

60|$|Oh, now all common things become {{uncommon}} and enchanted to me. All lamps are wonderful; all {{rings are}} talismans. Common flower-pots {{are full of}} treasure, with a little earth scattered on the top; trees are for Ali Baba to hide in; beef-steaks are to throw down into the Valley of Diamonds, that the precious stones <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> to them, and be carried by the eagles to their nests, whence the traders, with loud cries, will scare them. Tarts are made, according to the recipe of the Vizier's son of Bussorah, who turned pastrycook after he was set down in his drawers at the gate of Damascus; cobblers are all Mustaphas, and {{in the habit of}} sewing up people cut into four pieces, to whom they are taken blind-fold.|$|E

"They are savages who {{expect to}} reap {{where they have}} not sown; to take {{out of the earth}} without {{returning}} anything to it but their precious carcasses; heathens, who worship the mere stones they dig up." [...] "And was there no Spaniard who ever dug gold?" [...] asked Mulrady, simply. [...] "Ah, there are Spaniards and Moors," [...] responded Don Ramon, sententiously. [...] "Gold has been dug, and by caballeros; but no good ever came of it. There were Alvarados in Sonora, look you, who had mines of SILVER, and worked them with peons and mules, and lost their money--a gold mine to work a silver one--like gentlemen!

But they know there is still another ordeal to face--his lordship's monthly speech. Every one awaits it with misgiving--the {{servants}} lest they should applaud, as last time, in the wrong place, and the daughters because he may be personal about them, as the time before. ERNEST is annoyed {{that there should be}} this speech at all when there is such a much better one coming, and BROCKLEHURST foresees the degradation of the peerage. All are thinking of themselves alone save CRICHTON, who knows his master's weakness, and fears he <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> in the middle. LORD LOAM, however, advances cheerfully to his doom. He sees ERNEST'S stool, and artfully stands on it, to his nephew's natural indignation. The three ladies knit their lips, the servants look down their noses, and the address begins.) ...|$|E
50|$|Smudge sticks {{are often}} sold commercially, despite {{traditional}} prohibitions against {{the sale of}} spiritual medicines like white sage. These <b>sticks</b> <b>may</b> be made of a single herb {{or a combination of}} several different herbs; often these herbs are not found bundled together in traditional use, and their use is not universal to all, or even most, Native cultures. In some Native American cultures the burning of these herbs is prohibited. Other commercial smudge <b>sticks</b> <b>may</b> contain herbs not native to North America, as well as substances that are toxic when burnt.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, it's the {{beginning}} of my second year, now. If they don't let me go to round hands pretty soon, I shall have to see if I can't get the form by modelling. That's the best way. I suppose it's my imagination; it carries me away so, and I don't see the thing as it is before me; that's what they say. But with the clay, I'll have to, don't you know. Well, you know some of the French painters model their whole picture in clay and paint it, before they touch the canvas, any way. I shall try it here awhile longer, and then if I can't get to the round in any other way, I'll take to the clay. If sculpture concentrates you more, perhaps I <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> to it altogether. Art is one, anyhow, and the great thing is to live it. Don't you think so?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{thus there}} is {{reciprocal}} action between {{the intensity of}} moral feeling {{and the power of}} imagination; for, on the one hand, those who have keenest sympathy are those who look closest and pierce deepest, and hold securest; and, on the other, those who have so pierced and seen the melancholy deeps of things, are filled with the most intense passion and gentleness of sympathy. Hence, I suppose that the powers of the imagination may always be tested by accompanying tenderness of emotion, and thus, (as Byron said,) there is no tenderness like Dante's, neither any intensity nor seriousness like his, such seriousness that it is incapable of perceiving that which is commonplace or ridiculous, but fuses all down into its white-hot fire; and, on the other hand, I suppose the chief bar to the action of imagination, and stop to all greatness in this present age of ours, is its mean and shallow love of jest and jeer, so that if there be in any good and lofty work a flaw or failing, or undipped vulnerable part where sarcasm <b>may</b> <b>stick</b> or stay, it is caught at, and pointed at, and buzzed about, and fixed upon, and stung into, as a recent wound is by flies, and nothing is ever taken seriously nor as it was meant, but always, if it may be, turned the wrong way, and misunderstood; and while this is so, there is not, nor cannot be any hope of achievement of high things; men dare not open their hearts to us, if we are to broil them on a thorn-fire.|$|E

I can't help swearing! you mustn't mind, sir! Remember what I am! I don't swear when Freddy's in the room, if I can help it. I went the pace, drank, kept women, {{and all the rest of}} it. My wife found me out and went away. I ain't saying a word against her. She was a good woman, and I was a bad man, and she left me! She was right enough! I wasn't fit for a decent woman to live with. All the same, I missed her; and it was another kick down Hellward for me when she went. I got desperate then; I took to drink worse than ever, and I began to let my business go and speculate. You wouldn't know anything of the city, sir; but I can tell you this, when a cool chap with all his wits about him starts speculating outside his business, it's touch and go with him; when a chap in the state I was in goes for it, you can spell the result in four letters! It's RUIN, ruin! That's what it meant for me. I lost two hundred thousand pounds in three years, and my business went to pot too. Then I had this cursed stroke, and here I am!
