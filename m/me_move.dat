I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes <b>me</b> <b>move</b> in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E

He also wrote, [...] "The second verse informs us that he's a 'sexy boy' who can set Stan 'free,' but that he's just as 'shy' as he is 'dirty.' Mr. Saxobeat, so it would seem, {{contains}} multitudes." [...] Echoing this thought, Stan stated that [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] was only her vision of the perfect man when on German television ARD.|$|E

In January 2010, Robinson told a reporter, [...] "When I was getting recruited I always wanted to run track and play football. It helped <b>me</b> <b>move</b> faster on the football field." [...] Michigan track coach Fred LaPlante said Robinson {{had one of the}} 10 fastest 100-meter high-school times in the United States in 2009 and described Robinson the sprinter as [...] "one of the four or five best guys in the Big Ten." [...] LaPlante emphasized Robinson's [...] "quickness":"One thing in football that you don't see in track is quickness. He's incredibly quick and his lateral movement is unbelievable and his ability to go in one direction and get in another. The perception people have is that's speed. That's not speed, that's quickness." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw <b>me</b> <b>move</b> as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
