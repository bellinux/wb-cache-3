5000|$|The greater short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma hernandesi), also {{commonly}} known as the <b>mountain</b> <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard,</b> is a species of lizard endemic to western North America. Like other horned lizards, it is often wrongly called a [...] "horned toad" [...] or [...] "horny toad", {{but it is not a}} toad at all. It is a reptile, not an amphibian. It is one of seven native species of lizards in Canada.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Mountain</b> <b>Short-horned</b> <b>lizard,</b> {{also called}} Hernandez's short-horned lizard or the greater short-horned lizard, (Phrynosoma hernandesi) is a diurnal species of phrynosomatid lizard. It is an insectivore, feeding mostly on ants, though will also eat young snakes. The lizards are found {{throughout}} the mountain ranges in the western U.S. (as south as Texas) and into Canada. It is found from sea level to over 10,000 feet in elevation. It was formerly classified as Phrynosoma douglassi hernandesi. It was named for Francisco Hernández Médico, a Spanish explorer who in 1651 wrote {{one of the first}} accounts of horned lizards.|$|E
5000|$|The greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> {{is often}} mistaken for its close {{relative}} the pygmy <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma douglasii [...] ), {{which has the}} same basic body type consisting of small pointed scales around the head and back. [...] Until recent mitochondrial DNA evidence, P. hernandesi {{was considered to be}} the same species as P. douglasii. They are now considered distinct species with the pygmy <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (P. douglasii [...] ) occupying the northwest portion of the United States and extreme southern British Columbia. [...] When placed together the two are easily distinguished at full size, the pygmy <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> being much smaller. P. hernandesi is a highly variable species with different geographic populations exhibiting differences in color, pattern and size with some authorities describing five subspecies.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Short-horned</b> <b>lizards</b> are [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] predators. They feed {{primarily}} on ants, {{but will also}} take an occasional grasshopper or beetle. Often, they can be found sitting {{in the vicinity of}} a nest or trails. They are diurnal creatures being most active during mid-day and burrowing at night. They rely extensively on camouflage to avoid predators. If provoked, some horned lizards can build up blood pressure in regions behind their eyes and accurately squirt their blood at attacking predators, which will deter canids from continuing their attack. [...] It is rare for horned lizards to squirt blood at humans however, reserving this unique defense primarily for canids (i.e. foxes, coyotes, dogs) which have a strong reaction of distaste to the blood. Squirting blood has been observed in greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizards</b> but has not been observed in pygmy <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> {{occupies}} {{ranges from}} semiarid plains to high elevations in the mountains. This species is frequently {{found in a}} wide range of habitats like shortgrass prairies, sagebrush deserts, and juniper, pine, or fir forests. The soil in these habitats can be stony or rocky but usually has fine loose soil or sand present. The greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> is more cold tolerant than other species and is able to reach higher elevations and a greater distribution where the temperature is much cooler.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{reptiles}} found in the Fossil Lake area, both snakes and lizards.

50|$|The Phrynosomatinae are {{a diverse}} {{subfamily}} of lizards, sometimes {{classified as a}} separate family (Phrynosomatidae), found from Panama to the extreme south of Canada. Many {{members of the group}} are adapted to life in hot, sandy deserts, although the spiny lizards prefer rocky deserts or even relatively moist forest edges, and the <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> lives in prairie or sagebrush environments. The group includes both egg-laying and viviparous species, with the latter being more common in species living at high elevations.|$|R
50|$|The greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> ranges in {{size from}} 2 to 5 inches (5.1 to 12.7 cm) in snout to vent length (SVL) and is a flat-bodied, squat lizard with short spines {{crowning}} the head.

50|$|The greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} lizard in North America and occurs in the widest range of habitats: West into central Nevada, East into North and South Dakota, North to Southern Saskatchewan and Alberta and then South into the Texas Panhandle and into central Mexico. This species of lizard is mostly an arid mountain dweller living {{in the range of}} 9000-11,300 feet (170-3440 m). It is the only member of its genus in Wyoming, which counts Phrynosoma as its state reptile. It is also considered an endangered species in Saskatchewan and Alberta.|$|R
5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert tortoises, diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, Gila monsters, <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizards,</b> spiny lizards, and zebra-tailed lizards. Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona Game and Fish Department lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.|$|R
500|$|There {{are more}} than a dozen species of {{reptiles}} in the forest including the venomous prairie rattlesnake which can be found at lower elevations.

50|$|Horned lizards adopt differing defences for {{specific}} predators. They may play dead to deceive a predator that has caught them; attempt to outrun the rattlesnake, {{which does not}} pursue prey; but stay still, relying on their cryptic coloration, for Masticophis whip snakes which can catch even swift prey. If caught, some species such as the greater <b>short-horned</b> <b>lizard</b> puff themselves up, making their bodies hard for a narrow-mouthed predator like a whip snake to swallow. Finally, horned lizards can squirt blood at cat and dog predators from a pouch beneath its eyes, to {{a distance of about}} two metres (6 feet); the blood tastes foul to these attackers.|$|R
