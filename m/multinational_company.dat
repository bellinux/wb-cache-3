40|$|<b>Multinational</b> <b>companies</b> play a {{major role}} in the {{globalization}} process and contribute significantly to the creation of wealth in national economies. Today, there exist about 82, 000 <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> which possess 810, 000 subsidiaries located across the world. In a rapidly changing environment, <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> need to find new management methods to improve their global competitiveness. This volume offers an innovative perspective of managerial practices adopted by <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> that operate in the French economy. It highlights the diversity of responses these companies have developed in regard to the challenges of market globalization. The authors examine the complexity of the internal organization of <b>multinational</b> <b>companies,</b> namely the management of headquarters-subsidiaries relationships, but also the performance of partnerships and networks they form with actors from other countries. The contributing authors present the findings of empirical investigations they conducted on the management of <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> and provide explanations illustrated with quantitative data, examples and case-studies of companies such as Accor, Alcatel-Lucent, Crédit Agricole, Danone, EADS, GL events, Google, Renault, Groupe SEB and Société Générale...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This {{research}} aims {{to compare}} the environmental information that is disclosed in the annual reports of the American and European <b>multinational</b> <b>companies.</b> Eventually, it also aims to try to show the factors which explain the differences. Design/methodology/approach – This paper analyzes the annual reports of 72 <b>multinational</b> <b>companies,</b> thanks to the index developed by Wiseman. The paper then uses regression analysis in order to explain the differences. Findings – The study finds that European multinationals reveal more environmental information than those that are American. Equally, it finds that the nationality of <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> seems {{to have an effect}} on the level of environmental communication. Research limitations/implications – The quantitative data are based on a small sample of <b>multinational</b> <b>companies.</b> However, findings will bring efficient contributions to the other studies dealing with the accounting harmonization. Originality/value – The study aims at enriching the debates on this question, comparing the environmental information (obligatory and voluntary) showed by the annual reports of the American and European <b>multinational</b> <b>companies.</b> Annual reports, Disclosure, Environmental management, Europe, <b>Multinational</b> <b>companies,</b> United States of America...|$|R

5|$|When the {{agreement}} was finalised, the United Kingdom and West Germany each had a 42.5% stake of the workload, with the remaining 15% going to Italy; this division of the production work was heavily influenced by international political bargaining. The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to BAC (now BAE Systems) in the United Kingdom; the centre fuselage to MBB (now EADS) in West Germany; and the wings to Aeritalia (now Alenia Aeronautica) in Italy. Similarly, tri-national worksharing was used for engines, general and avionic equipment.

40|$|The {{business}} world started to integrate internationally; therefore, {{it is likely}} to say that the <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> have become one of the key actors in international business. Since the <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> operate in many countries simultaneously; they face to multicultural challenges. The organisational culture is also influenced by the cultural diversity. It is possible to state that the transfer of the organisational culture is essential for the creation of the compatibility in the <b>multinational</b> <b>companies.</b> This dissertation discusses to what extent the <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> transfer their organisational culture to the subsidiaries and to what extent the national cultures affect the transfer. The British and Turkish subsidiaries of two German <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> have researched. The organisational cultures in the subsidiaries have been examined. According to the findings, it was concluded that the organizational culture in the <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> can be transferred to a greater extent and national cultures affect the transfer to a limited extent and by establishing an organisational culture, the differences of national cultures can be reduced...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multinational</b> <b>companies</b> are {{particularly}} affected {{by changes in}} the global economy in which they play a major role. The strategies they develop and the decisions they make contribute to shape the globalization process. Over the past few years, many <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> have tried to diversify their international expansion by reinforcing their presence in new geographic regions, particularly in emerging markets. At the same time, one can observe a fragmentation of the value-chain, marked by a growing geographic dispersion of production and marketing activities, as well as of research and development (R&D) activities. This chapter focuses on the characteristics of <b>multinational</b> <b>companies</b> in a context of economic globalization.

5|$|On 26 March 1969, four partner nations– United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, {{agreed to}} form a <b>multinational</b> <b>company,</b> Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop and {{manufacture}} the MRCA. The project's aim was to produce an aircraft capable of undertaking missions in the tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence, and maritime roles; thus allowing the MRCA to replace several different aircraft then in use by the partner nations. Various concepts, including alternative fixed-wing and single-engine designs, were studied while defining the aircraft. The Netherlands {{pulled out of the}} project in 1970, citing that the aircraft was too complicated and technical for the RNLAF's preferences, which had sought a simpler aircraft with outstanding manoeuvrability. An additional blow was struck by the German requirement reduced from an initial 600 aircraft to 324 in 1972.|$|E

25|$|Cargill, a <b>multinational</b> <b>company</b> which {{controls}} {{the majority of}} the soya bean trade in Brazil has been criticized, along with fast food chains like McDonald's, by active groups such as Greenpeace for speeding up the process of the deforestation of the Amazon. Cargill is the main supplier of soya beans to large fast food companies such as McDonald's which uses the soya products to feed their cattle and chickens. As fast food chains expand, fast food chains must increase the quantity of their livestock in order to produce more products. In order to meet the large demands of soya, Cargill is forced to expand its soya production by clear cutting parts of the Amazon.|$|E

500|$|From the 1980s to {{the present}} there have been {{multiple}} accounting scandals that were widely reported on {{by the media and}} resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of creative accounting, misleading financial analysis, as well as bribery. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including Nugan Hand Bank, Phar-Mor, WorldCom, and AIG. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved Enron, a <b>multinational</b> <b>company,</b> that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm considered one of the [...] "Big Five", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements.

Enron's shareholders lost $25billion {{as a result of the}} company's bankruptcy.

They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E

However, others have suggested the premiere was met with muted applause interspersed with boos and hisses. At {{the time of its}} German premiere, Metropolis had a length of 4,189 metres (approximately 153 mins at 24 fps). Metropolis had been funded in part by Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and UFA had formed a distribution deal with the two companies whereby they were [...] "entitled to make any change [...] they found appropriate to ensure profitability". The distribution of Metropolis was handled by Parufamet, a <b>multinational</b> <b>company</b> that incorporated all three film studios. Considering Metropolis too long and unwieldy, Parufamet commissioned American playwright Channing Pollock to write a simpler version of the film that could be assembled using the existing material. Pollock shortened the film dramatically, altered its inter-titles and removed all references to the character of Hel (as the name sounded too similar to the English word Hell), thereby removing Rotwang's original motivation for creating his robot. In Pollock's cut, the film ran for 3170 meters, or approximately 115 minutes. This version of Metropolis premiered in the US in March 1927, and was released in the UK around the same time with different title cards.|$|E
