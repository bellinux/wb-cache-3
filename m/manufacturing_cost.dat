5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence. It became widely known in the United States after comedian Charlie Chaplin parodied it in his 1940 film The Great Dictator. Comedy group The Three Stooges also made fun of it in two of their short subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, {{commodity}} prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost</b> to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E

30|$|According to the assumptions, a {{symmetrical}} demand leakage occurs {{between two}} echelons of supply chain {{on the same}} products because of different unit <b>manufacturing</b> <b>costs</b> in the echelons. The demand leakage occurs between products 1 and 3 and also products 2 and 4. Here, {{we assume that the}} unit <b>manufacturing</b> <b>costs</b> of manufacturers 1 and 2 are larger than manufacturers 3 and 4. So, the manufacturers 1 and 2 lost their demand and the manufacturers 3 and 4 against earn more demands due to their lower unit <b>manufacturing</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The UCIL factory {{was built}} in 1969 to produce the {{pesticide}} Sevin (UCC's brand name for carbaryl) using methyl isocyanate (MIC) as an intermediate. A MIC production plant was added in 1979. After the Bhopal plant was built, other manufacturers, including Bayer, produced carbaryl without MIC, though at a greater <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost.</b> Bayer also used the UCC process at the chemical plant once owned by UCC at Institute, West Virginia, in the United States.|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of the Zeiss-Ikon Contaflex of the mid-50's and its {{follow-ups}} in form of the Bessamatic, Retina- and Paxette-reflex, Zenit's next attempt was the Zenit-4 (1964), -5 and -6 cameras. These were based on a Voigtländer Bessamatic-type mount with Compur-type iris-shutter near the lens elements. The poor durability and high <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost</b> of this concept in contrast to the classical barebone Zenit design based on ultimate simplicity showed KMZ to have taken a wrong track: Nevertheless, the Zenit-5 was the first Soviet motor-driven SLR camera, and the first Soviet zoom lens (Rubin-1c 2.8/37–80, based on Voigtländer Zoomar design) featured in the Zenit-6.|$|E
25|$|The oldest form of {{rechargeable}} battery is the lead–acid battery, which {{are widely used}} in automotive and boating applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the hydrogen gas it produces during overcharging. The lead–acid battery is relatively heavy {{for the amount of}} electrical energy it can supply. Its low <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost</b> and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern car battery, which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 amperes.|$|E

25|$|When {{currently}} available implants are used, cemented stems {{tend to have}} a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost,</b> but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{race was}} {{specifically}} given a 1949 theme, with the BBC postulating {{that the race}} might represent what Top Gear {{would have been like}} in 1949. That year reflects the fact that the original 49 Peppercorn Class A1s were built in 1948/9, and accordingly, the bike and car selected were 1949 models. The motorcycle was a Vincent Black Shadow, registration 750 UXL (1952), the car was a Jaguar XK120, registration SKE 7 (1954). According to the show, the XK120 and Black Shadow were the fastest car and bike in the world in 1949. Although Tornado is a brand new locomotive completed in 2008, her design was based on the original 1940s designs used for the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 locomotives, with appropriate modern day changes for engineering, safety, operational and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost</b> reasons.|$|E

25|$|The Switch is {{produced}} between Taiwan-based Foxconn and Japan-based Hosiden, with Foxconn {{accounting for the}} largest volume. Nintendo did not plan to sell the unit below <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost,</b> as they had done for both the 3DS and Wii U at their respective launches; Nintendo affirmed that the Switch would be profitable from launch during its 2016 fiscal year earnings report, as the company saw the console as a key earnings driver for 2017 and beyond. Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese product teardown firm, estimated that the Switch cost $257 to make compared to its $299 MSRP, with the Console and Dock at $167 while each Joy-Con cost $45. Kimishima said {{that they may be}} able to see further profitability on the Switch when they can achieve volume discounts on components once they reach a level of about 10 million Switch units.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost</b> for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E
25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost,</b> and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|E

2500|$|Organic and polymer {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) are {{a relatively}} new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, tunnel junction, holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cost</b> and making them more environmentally friendly. OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production. OPV uses [...] "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times". Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%, however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.|$|E
