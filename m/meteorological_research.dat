5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through <b>meteorological</b> <b>research</b> and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt to}} fit the weather radar {{equation}} by using radar data of the Radar C band localized on Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil, in the operational center of the Institute of <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Researches,</b> IPMet/UNESP, is performed as inverse problem to identification of parameters. Several values empirical to the coefficients and from e relation coefficients, i. e., the radar measurements and the rainfall rate values, have been purposed. The IPMet radar use the values determined by Marshal-Palmer (1948),,, for the stratiform rain. First, a direct theoretical model relating radar return to rainfall rates measured from raingauge localized in Botucatu city far 55 km from radar position, is presented. Second, the inverse algorithm of Levenberg Marquardt used to retrieve parameters of the radar returns model is described and its application is discussed. Third, a sensitive analysis as the performed to test {{the influence of the}} parameters involved in the inverse method. The sensitive analysis allows for establish the application conditions of the method. Last, a evaluating of de method is provide, through using rainfall data and reflectivity measured to retrieve and parameters values. The study case confirms the utility of the proposed method and its hability to provide a better performance of the studied model. Pages: 7385 - 739...|$|R
