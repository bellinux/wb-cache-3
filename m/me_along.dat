On 21 May 2007, he {{presented a}}n hour-long documentary, Battle for the Holy Land: Love Thy Neighbour, about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. He visited Bethlehem, Hebron and the Israeli settlement of Tekoa. Liddle sought to examine whether Israel was a true liberal democracy in light of its treatment of the Palestinians.

25|$|Harper {{began as}} a dancer and chorus girl on Broadway, {{and went on to}} perform in several Broadway shows, some choreographed by Michael Kidd, {{including}} Wildcat (starring Lucille Ball), Take <b>Me</b> <b>Along</b> (starring Jackie Gleason), and Subways Are For Sleeping. In-between she was also cast in Destry Rides Again but was forced to leave rehearsals due to illness. Her roommate, actress Arlene Golonka, introduced her to Second City improvisation theater and to improv performer Dick Schaal, whom Harper later married in 1965. Harper was stepmother to Schaal's daughter, Wendy, an actress. They lived in Greenwich Village. She returned to Broadway in February 2010, playing Tallulah Bankhead in Matthew Lombardo's Looped at the Lyceum Theatre.|$|E

Then, in 1965, {{she joined the}} cast of the primetime serial, Peyton Place, playing Hannah Cord.

Warrick received an Emmy Award nomination for her work on this show in 1967, the same year she left the show. In 1969, she made her last major film, Disney's The Great Bank Robbery. During this time, Nixon had been moving up the daytime television ranks. She had created her own show, One Life to Live, in 1968. ABC approved her new show, All My Children, in 1969.|$|E

500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped <b>me</b> <b>along</b> the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} was split. While the {{majority}} of reviewers were favorably impressed, some very much so, a significant minority were disappointed at the message the episode conveyed and the storytelling decisions. Among the former were Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic, who described it as [...] "Glee at its best: cartoonish, outlandish, and loud—but still oh-so true to life." [...] IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10, and called the main storyline [...] "comical and human". Candace Bulter of ScreenCrave also gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote, [...] "This week's Glee puts on the beer goggles to put alcohol-related issues in perspective. The result is humorous and ironic, but leaves something to be wanted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, wrote that [...] "the underpinnings of the episode aren't terrible, just overstuffed" [...] {{and gave it a}} [...] "B−". MTV's Aly Semigran stated that the episode [...] "left something of a sour taste", and added that while the show [...] "always combines humor with serious life lessons, it seems there were none to be found here"; she called the episode [...] "a wasted opportunity". BuddyTV Jen Harper was also disenchanted by the episode, and concluded, [...] "Geez Louise, Glee. What's happened to you?" [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times saw the show's message differently from Semigran, and wrote, [...] "Leave it to Glee to tackle a potentially joyless, didactic topic like teenage drinking and somehow manage to entertain and surprise and get its important life lessons across." [...] Time Richard Corliss called it a [...] "breezy, sharply written episode" [...] and rated it in the [...] "high-middle range" [...] for the show. He concluded, [...] "Last night’s hour of Glee was of the level a superior series sticks in mid-season between its 'important' episodes. If this is coasting, take <b>me</b> <b>along</b> for the ride." ...|$|E

I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the July Crisis, Germany had given her full support to Austria. This stratagem had earlier served to keep Russia on the sidelines during the Annexationist Crisis of 1908, and may {{therefore}} have been thought to offer the best possible prospect of keeping the Austro-Serb dispute localized. On 28 July, Russia ordered partial mobilization in response to Austria's declaration of war on Serbia, Bethmann-Hollweg became alarmed and changed his attitude 180 degrees. Already on 28 July, two hours before becoming aware of the Austrian declaration of war, the Kaiser had suggested the [...] "Halt in Belgrade" [...] plan and instructed von Jagow:"I propose that we say to Austria: Serbia has been forced to retreat in a very humiliating manner and we offer our congratulations. Naturally, as a result, no more cause for war exists, but a guarantee that the promises will be carried out is probably necessary.
