40|$|The third main <b>methodological</b> <b>stream</b> of {{the systems}} {{movement}} is applied systems thinking, beside the study of systems {{in their own right}} and systems thinking in the disciplines. Applied systems thinking, represented by different systems methodologies for structuring problem situations, is based on appropriate frameworks of ideas, on the one hand, and is addressed to creative intervening in the real world to solve practical management problems, on the other. According to its Tran disciplinary interdisciplinary and Tran paradigmatic nature, systems thinking, through its theories, methodologies, models can add significant value in a variety of fields. In comparison with the management "fads", high status ought to be granted to applied systems thinking due to the theoretical and methodological founded ness and practical capabilities verified of various systems approaches to solving the complex, interactive and multi-meaning management problems...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally Expert Systems (ES) {{require a}} full {{analysis}} of the business problem by a Knowledge Engineer (KE) to develop a solution. This inherently makes ES technology very expensive and beyond the affordability {{of the majority of}} Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) and Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs). Therefore, SMEs and NPOs tend to only have access to off-the-shelf solutions to generic problems, which rarely meet the full extent of an organisation’s requirements. One existing <b>methodological</b> <b>stream</b> of research, Ripple-Down Rules (RDR) goes some of the way to being suitable to SMEs and NPOs as it removes the need for a knowledge engineer. This group of methodologies provide an environment where a company can develop large knowledge based systems themselves, specifically tailored to the company’s individual situation. These methods, however, require constant supervision by the expert during development, which is still a significant burden on the organisation. This paper discusses an extension to an RDR method, known as Rated MCRDR (RM) and a feature called prudence analysis. This enhanced methodology to ES development is particularly well suited to the development of ES in restricted environments such as SMEs and NPOs...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{the social}} survey data, texts {{have been an}} {{important}} source of sociological data {{since the beginning of the}} development of sociological methodology. Text analysis methods contain two main branches of development: Bernard Berelson's content analysis and Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic analysis. Both these methodological branches have been influenced by the development of information technologies in the last twenty years. The thesis presented here deals with one of the methods of computer text analysis (CATA), which stands on the border between these two <b>methodological</b> <b>streams,</b> a method of analyzing words' collocations in texts. The thesis presents the method in the context of other methods of text analysis, and mentions sources of inspiration for further development of these methods - corpus linguistics and text mining. The second part discusses the different steps of words' collocation analysis: building a text corpus, dictionary compilation, calculation of data matrix and visualisation of words' distances using multidimensional scaling (MDS). The method is also applied to a specific data, two text corpora compiled from transcripts of biographical interviews with actors of Czechoslovak normalization - with dissidents and Communist functionaries. Quality of the models is assessed, depending [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{concerns}} {{the topic of}} writing skills in foreign language textbooks of Spanish. The original idea was {{that there are not}} enough exercises in the textbooks and that writing is not practised sufficiently. In the theoretical part there are explanations about the concept of writing. Then the mutual influence of language skills and writing is treated. The next chapter deals with psycholinguistics and its approach towards writing skills. In the following chapter lingvodidactics and writing is outlined. Next, there is a chapter dedicated to <b>methodological</b> <b>streams</b> in foreign language teaching from history till nowadays and their appreciation of writing. Attitude towards writing is also reflected in two important documents of the European Union: the Common European Framework for Languages and Portfolio. In the penultimate chapter exercises dedicated to writing are divided into different groups. In the last chapter of the theoretical part ideas of the author about teaching writing in a foreign language are presented. The practical part starts with a detailed analysis of six Spanish textbooks: Španělština pro jazykové školy I., II., Fiesta 1, 2, 3, Ven 1, 2, 3, Espaol sin fronteras 1, 2, 3, Primer Plano 1, 2, 3, 4 a Suea 1, 2, 3, 4 (for all levels: teacher's books, student's books and workbooks). The [...] ...|$|R
40|$|S u m m a r y The paper {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} application of the exemplary (paradigmatic) model in teaching the subject of nature and society and gives the example of its application in the teaching unit ’Weather and its Significance for Life in the Environment’. Key words: exemplary (paradigmatic) model, teaching the subject of nature and society Modern critical theories of society, {{as well as a}} series of epistemological and <b>methodological</b> <b>streams</b> in pedagogy, impose the development of critically oriented pedagogy, and thereby also critical theory of teaching and school. A significant place is occupied by Klafki’s critical-constructive theory, critical-communicative pedagogy (Winkel) and Schultz’s humanistically oriented didactics (Vlahović, 2001). As far as Klafki’s critical-constructive theory is concerned, we can say that it joins the elements of: didactics as a theory of education, critical theory of research, as well as postulates of constructivism, where learning is understood as a process which is realized through discovery, i. e. understanding. For that reason, the teaching process should be organized {{in such a way that}} students can learn actively, independently and that such a process can capacitate them for further learning. Self-realization, through interaction and communication process, is understood in critical theories of teaching as a relation of teaching and learning, where students learn relatively independently, gain knowledge, develop intellectual and other potentials, make themselves ready for permanent education, all of it with a teacher's assistance. It is important to mention here also an opinion of our eminent didactic, G. Gojkov, on the constructivist approach from the postmodern perspective. Namely, in her study, Didactics and Postmodernism, Gojkov emphasizes that ’in postmoder...|$|R
40|$|Ethnography {{is a very}} {{abstract}} concept, {{but often}} perceived as a very concrete practice, but what is hidden in the slippage between the abstract and concrete, as ethnography moves. While a great deal has been written and debated about the practices, methods and outcomes of applied research, and we appreciate these debates, our own point of departure lies in a curiosity over {{what happens in the}} processes of travel, translation and reappropriation – as a methodological stance moves from one sphere of inquiry to another. And it lies in a concern that there is much more <b>methodological</b> information <b>streaming</b> out of the university than into it. What can we learn by turning an interested ear in new directions? This paper takes its point of departure in a series of observations made during a period of fieldwork in the United States in which we studied and spoke with ethnographers working outside the academy. By juxtaposing a number examples from vastly different contexts in which ethnography is applied, the authors strive to illuminate the very different meanings that are attributed to ethnography as well as the diverse ways in which ethnography (both the concept and the series of methods associated with it) is practiced and invoked. As the paper argues, the meanings attributed to ethnography not only affect the practices attributed to it, but ultimately even to the life circumstances of the people working with it...|$|R
