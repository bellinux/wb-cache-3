5|$|The Panic of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.|$|E
5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} trading increased by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010, {{and has more}} than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an asset class, the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of retail investors as an important market segment. The growth of electronic execution and the diverse selection of execution venues has lowered transaction costs, increased <b>market</b> <b>liquidity,</b> and attracted greater participation from many customer types. In particular, electronic trading via online portals has made it easier for retail traders to trade in the foreign exchange market. By 2010, retail trading was estimated to account for up to 10% of spot turnover, or $150 billion per day (see below: Retail foreign exchange traders).|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2010, the TSE {{main index}} (TEPIX) reached a record level of 16,056 points, despite US-sponsored {{sanctions}} against Iran. Thus, TEDPIX became the world’s second-best performing equity index. Factors {{such as the}} global spike in oil and metal prices, government support for industries and oil sectors {{as well as the}} growth of stock <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> flow contributed to the boom. Experts commented that the growth was also partly due to a government decision to sell off 20 percent of its equity in two major automakers. Given the relative low market valuation of TSE stocks in 2010, the upward trend was expected to continue over the long run, rather than being a bubble. TEPIX reached a new record on September 18, 2010, when it hit 18,658, up from 11,295 {{at the start of the}} year. As of December 2010, the TSE index rose about 64 percent since the start of 2010.

40|$|This study investigates how limit orders affect {{liquidity}} in {{a purely}} order-driven futures market. Additionally, the possible asymmetric relationship between market depth and transitory volatility in bull and bear {{markets and the}} effect of institutional trading on liquidity provision behavior are examined as well. The empirical results demonstrate that subsequent market depth increases as transient volatility increases in bull markets. Market depth exhibits significantly positive relationship to subsequent transient volatility in bull markets. Additionally, although trading volume positively influences transient volatility in bull markets, no such relationship exists in bear <b>markets.</b> <b>Liquidity</b> provision decreases when institutional trading activity intensifies during bear <b>markets.</b> Thus, <b>liquidity</b> provision for limit orders differs between bull and bear markets.

2500|$|Side pockets {{were widely}} used by hedge funds during the 2008 {{financial}} crisis amidst {{a flood of}} withdrawal requests. Side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> improved, a move that could reduce losses.

[...] This then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange.|$|E
2500|$|Bond markets, unlike {{stock or}} share markets, {{sometimes}} {{do not have}} a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the counterparty to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond [...] "in inventory", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.|$|E

When financial intermediaries issue contingent (non-contingent) liabilities, an increase in the consumers' relative risk aversion coefficient decreases (increases) the interest rate. Also, the interest rate rises when capitalists are less risk-averse and financial intermediaries are hit by a liquidity shock.

50|$|The <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> {{of assets}} affects their prices and {{expected}} returns. Theory and empirical {{evidence suggests that}} investors require higher return on assets with lower <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> to compensate them for the higher cost of trading these assets. That is, for an asset with given cash flow, the higher its <b>market</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the higher its price and the lower is its expected return. In addition, risk-averse investors require higher expected return if the asset's market-liquidity risk is greater. This risk involves the exposure of the asset return to shocks in overall <b>market</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the exposure of the asset own liquidity to shocks in <b>market</b> <b>liquidity</b> {{and the effect of}} market return on the asset's own liquidity. Here too, the higher the liquidity risk, the higher the expected return on the asset or the lower is its price.|$|E

In dealer <b>markets</b> <b>liquidity</b> is supplied by entry of any trader to supply liquidity by permitting the submission of limit orders. In both cases investors face a competitive price schedule, which they can then trade against, and competition between traders in the auction market or between dealers in the dealer market should ensure that liquidity suppliers maker no excess profits. ...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} since a firm with market power has more stable cash flows {{because of its}} ability to set prices in the product market, its stock price is less {{sensitive}} to order flow (Peress, 2010), which results in greater stock liquidity.
