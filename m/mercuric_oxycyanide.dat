40|$|Case report: A 53 -year old {{pharmacist}} {{is admitted}} to hospital after poisoning with a magistral formulation containing <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxycyanide.</b> The initial treatment {{consists of the}} administration of hydroxocobalamine and dimercaprol (BAL), followed by a blood purifying treatment, hemodialysis, then dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and hemoperfusion. Material and methods: Mercury is quantified using cold vapor - atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) in blood and ICP-MS in urine. The mercury concentrations, determined in blood and urine 24 hours after ingestion were respectively 3087 $mu$g/L (reference value < 5 $mu$g/L) and 9573 $mu$g/g creatinin (reference value < 3 $mu$g/g). Mercury was quantified in blood and urine during 52 days of hospitalisation to follow its excretion and treatments efficiency. A mercury quantification is carried out using ICP-MS on two locks of hair collected two months after ingestion. Hair specimen (6 cm) was cut into six equal lengths. Results and discussion: Mercury concentrations range from 4. 6 to 41. 2 ng/mg (reference value < 1 ng/mg). These high concentrations {{could be explained by}} a contamination of the hair by sebum...|$|E
