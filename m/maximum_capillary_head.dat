Modifications are required to address the hysteresis between drainage and imbibition and between primary drainage and secondary drainage from a state of residual gas saturation. Along these lines, Parker and Lenhard (1987) developed a model that includes effects of gas entrapment during imbibition. Their model defines limiting <b>maximum</b> <b>capillary</b> <b>heads</b> for drainage and minimum <b>capillary</b> <b>heads</b> for imbibition.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{model has been}} developed to analyze the transient and steady-state performance of flat heat pipes subjected to heating with multiple discrete heat sources. Three-dimensional flow and energy equations are solved in the vapor and liquid regions, along with conduction in the wall. Saturated flow models are used for heat transfer and fluid flow through the wick. In the wick region, the analysis uses an equilibrium model for heat transfer and a Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy model for fluid flow. Averaged properties weighted with the porosity are used for the wick analysis. The state equation {{is used in the}} vapor core to relate density change to the operating pressure. The density change due to pressurization of the vapor core is accounted for in the continuity equation. Vapor flow, temperature and hydrodynamic pressure fields are computed at each time step from coupled continuity/momentum and energy equations in the wick and vapor regions. The mass flow rate at the interface is obtained from the application of kinetic theory. Predictions are made for the magnitude of heat flux at which dryout would occur in a flat heat pipe. The input heat flux and the spacing between the discrete heat sources are studied as parameters. The location in the heat pipe at which dryout is initiated is found to be {{different from that of the}} maximum temperature.

Nonintrusive imaging in real time offers the potential to examine critical impacts of heterogeneity and surface properties on imbibition dynamics. Neutron radiography is applied as a powerful imaging tool to observe temporal changes in the spatial distribution of water in porous materials. We analyze water imbibition in both homogeneous and heterogeneous low-permeability sandstones. Dynamic observations of the advance of the imbibition front with time are compared with characterizations of microstructure (via high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT)), pore size distribution (Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry), and permeability of the contrasting samples. We use an automated method to detect the progress of wetting front with time and link this to square-root-of-time progress. These data are used to estimate the effect of microstructure on water sorptivity from a modified Lucas-Washburn equation. Moreover, a model is established to calculate the <b>maximum</b> <b>capillary</b> diameter by modifying the Hagen-Poiseuille and Young-Laplace equations based on fractal theory. Comparing the calculated <b>maximum</b> <b>capillary</b> diameter with the maximum pore diameter (from high-resolution CT) shows congruence between the two independent methods for the homogeneous silty sandstone but less effectively for the heterogeneous sandstone.

The liquid hydrocarbon was Soltrol 170, a low-density branched alkane mixture. Liquid saturations were measured using a collinear dual-energy gamma radiation apparatus and liquid pressures were measured using hydrophilic (untreated) and hydrophobic (treated) ceramic tensiometers connected to pressure transducers. The experimental regime was selected to impose monotonically draining water and total liquid saturation paths to avoid hysteretic effects. Measured saturations and pressures are compared to values obtained from numerical simulations of the experiment using a finite element solution of the governing multiphase flow equations assuming negligible gas pressure gradients.

It makes two modifications to the standard Brooks and Corey [1964] (B-C) description, one {{at each end of}} the suction range.
