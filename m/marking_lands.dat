50|$|Starting in 1999, <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> is {{a series}} of {{projects}} that encompasses film, video, photography and performance pieces related to the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, which, for 60 years, was used by the United States for military operations, leading to a civil disobedience campaign waged by local residents. The works include <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> (1999/2003/2006), <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> (Footprints) (2001-02), Returning a Sound (2004), Under Discussion (2005) and Half Mast\Full Mast (2010). Allora & Calzadilla interrogate the economic, cultural, and political markers that differentiate one area of land from another, and the processes of colonization and gentrification that come to define its changing status. As a whole, these works connected performances typical of political activism to artistic traditions like engraving. <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> is explained semantically as an instrument for reading marks left on the territory (landmarks) instead of as a simple point of spatial orientation (landmark). The spatial investigations in Allora & Calzadilla's work are made {{in terms of what the}} artists call “the trace.” At once a poetic trope and a set of material operations, the trace links presence and absence, inscription and erasure, preservation and destruction, and appearance and disappearance.|$|R
