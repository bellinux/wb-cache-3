5|$|Bismuth sulfide, , occurs {{naturally}} in bismuth ores. It is also {{produced by the}} combination of <b>molten</b> bismuth and sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Iridium is {{the most}} {{corrosion-resistant}} metal known: it is not attacked by almost any acid, aqua regia, <b>molten</b> metals, or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, be attacked by some <b>molten</b> salts, such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, as well as oxygen and the halogens (particularly fluorine) at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|K2 can be {{converted}} to metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium, at approximately 800°C in <b>molten</b> salt.|$|E
5|$|Melted {{and sprayed}} in the <b>molten</b> form.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molten</b> SnCl2 can be {{oxidised}} to form highly crystalline SnO2 nanostructures. to SnO2 nano-single crystals, Ceram Intern 40 (2014)8533-8538.|$|E
5|$|Other molybdenum-based alloys that do {{not contain}} iron have only limited applications. For example, because of its {{resistance}} to <b>molten</b> zinc, both pure molybdenum and molybdenum/tungsten alloy (70%/30%) are used for piping, stirrers and pump impellers that {{come into contact with}} <b>molten</b> zinc.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to <b>molten</b> plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to <b>molten</b> gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{was first}} isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) {{by the use}} of electrolysis of the <b>molten</b> salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium's extreme reactivity. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different. Later that year, the first pieces of pure <b>molten</b> sodium metal were similarly prepared by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of <b>molten</b> caustic soda (now called sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|The direct {{electrolysis}} of a <b>molten</b> {{mixture of}} beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride by Paul Lebeau in 1898 {{resulted in the}} first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium. The first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1932 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt. Their process involves the electrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluorides and barium, which causes <b>molten</b> beryllium to collect on a water-cooled iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|Also, pure {{lanthanum}} can {{be produced}} by electrolysis of <b>molten</b> mixture of anhydrous LaCl3 and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of <b>molten</b> rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of <b>molten</b> and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is {{insoluble}} in {{the usual}} acids, but is soluble in alkaline <b>molten</b> salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2, Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.|$|E
5|$|Each mouse was {{released}} with different specifications. This table {{does not include}} redesigned mice, such as the Naga <b>Molten</b> and the League of Legends Naga Hex.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine {{reacts with}} lead at room temperature, forming lead(II) fluoride. The {{reaction}} with chlorine is similar but requires heating as the resulting chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements. <b>Molten</b> lead reacts with the chalcogens to give lead(II) chalcogenides.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, {{infusion}} of silicon carbide nano-particles in <b>molten</b> magnesium was {{mentioned as a}} way to produce a new strong and plastic alloy suitable for use in aeronautics, aerospace, automobile and micro-electronics.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria has {{produced}} a large landslide deposit as well as flows of <b>molten</b> sulfur. A progressive uplift of the terrain around Lastarria and farther south has been recognized.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{energy is}} radiant light and {{heat from the}} Sun that is {{harnessed}} using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, <b>molten</b> salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The casting is {{traditionally}} {{accompanied by the}} chanting of Buddhist sutras, which may go on for several hours. Buddhist prayer papers, sprigs of sacred mulberry and other ceremonial offerings {{are added to the}} <b>molten</b> bronze during the founding process.|$|E
5|$|The {{desulfurisation}} of thioureas with <b>molten</b> potassium to give imidazol-2-ylidenes or diaminocarbenes has {{not been}} widely used. The method was used to prepare dihydroimidazole carbenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in <b>molten</b> sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in <b>molten</b> alkali while exposed to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the <b>molten</b> slag floats on top of the denser <b>molten</b> iron, and {{apertures}} in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of <b>molten</b> metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer the <b>molten</b> metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly <b>molten,</b> high-pressure gas- and steam-rich {{rock in the}} volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed <b>molten</b> steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of <b>molten</b> steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of <b>molten</b> metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large <b>molten</b> droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|In {{this process}} lead bullion and slag is {{obtained}} directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide. Carbon (coke or coal gas) {{is added to}} the <b>molten</b> charge along with fluxing agents. The lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lead, {{in the midst of a}} slag rich in lead monoxide.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still <b>molten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leonard Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) is the Fury 161 {{preacher and}} {{chaplain}} to the prisoners. An inmate {{with a history}} of murder and rape, he turned to God while incarcerated. Dillon {{is one of the few}} prisoners to whom Ripley speaks after her arrival; he asks if she has faith, and says that his men have faith enough to accept anyone. He delivers an eloquent eulogy during Newt and Hicks' funeral which touches Ripley. When prisoners try to rape her, Dillon bashes them with a crowbar. Ripley asks Dillon to kill her and the gestating Alien inside her, and he promises to do so when the Alien is dead. Shortly afterwards, Dillon organizes the remaining prisoners to lure the Alien into the foundry and drown it in <b>molten</b> lead. When the Alien attempts to follow Ripley out of the trap, Dillon baits it; when it attacks, Ripley submerges them both in the <b>molten</b> lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molten</b> salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The <b>molten</b> salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in high-temperature applications. This material is refractory, hard, and resistant to chemical attack. Because of these properties, zircon finds many applications, few {{of which are}} highly publicized. Its main use is as an opacifier, conferring a white, opaque appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for <b>molten</b> metals.|$|E
5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the <b>molten</b> metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (potassium chloride). Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its <b>molten</b> chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing <b>molten</b> potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions {{are similar}} to Hawaiian eruptions, but there are differences. Strombolian eruptions are noisier, produce no {{sustained}} eruptive columns, do not produce some volcanic products associated with Hawaiian volcanism (specifically Pele's tears and Pele's hair), and produce fewer <b>molten</b> lava flows (although the eruptive material does tend to form small rivulets).|$|E
5|$|The Qinghe Special Steel Corporation {{disaster}} was {{an industrial}} disaster that occurred on April 18, 2007, in Tieling, Liaoning, China. Thirty-two {{people were killed}} and six were injured when a ladle used to transport <b>molten</b> steel separated from an overhead rail in the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation factory.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} where the disaster occurred {{was used by}} the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation as a steel processing plant. The ladle which failed carried <b>molten</b> steel from a blast furnace to other processes, and had a diameter of two metres and a capacity of 30 tons (25 tonnes) of liquid steel. It ran on a rail at a height of three metres above the factory floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} {{are placed in}} a tantalum crucible and fired in a helium atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and <b>molten</b> dysprosium separate {{due to differences in}} density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.|$|E
