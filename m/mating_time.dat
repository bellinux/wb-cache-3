5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total <b>mating</b> <b>time</b> of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around <b>mating</b> <b>time</b> showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly {{pacing back and forth}} {{in front of the other}} male. They seek out females only during <b>mating</b> <b>time.</b> When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|E

500|$|For breeders {{intent on}} strict {{improvements}} to their flocks, ewes are classed and inferior sheep are removed prior to mating {{in order to}} maintain or improve the quality of the flock. Muffled (wooly) faces have long been associated with lower fertility rates. Stud or specially selected rams are chosen with aid of objective measurements, genetic information and evaluation services that are now available in Australia and New Zealand. [...] The choice of <b>mating</b> <b>time</b> is governed by many factors including climate, market requirements and feed availability. Rams are typically mated at about 2.5% depending on the age of the sheep, plus consideration as to the size and type of mating paddocks. The mating period ranges from about 6 to 8 weeks in commercial flocks. Longer mating times result in management problems with lamb marking and shearing etc.|$|E
2500|$|Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often {{supposed}} to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. Another example: camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colors [...] are displayed at <b>mating</b> <b>time.</b> Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|According to the IUCN, the Balantiopteryx plicata {{is rated}} as [...] "least concern" [...] because the species {{has a wide}} range and usually resides in {{protected}} areas. Little {{is known about the}} specific numbers of Balantiopteryx plicata, so a population trend cannot be deduced. It prefers to live near the mouth of caves, in barns and other buildings; usually in areas that are open and lit. The bat is sociable and is usually {{part of a group of}} fifty or more. It has also been reported that the colony can include up to 10,000 bats. In the colony, there are approximately 25% females and 75% males. These statistics are variable – another source described how the males were more likely to be a part of the colony at the beginning of the dry season around <b>mating</b> <b>time</b> than it is to be near the rainy season; most of the females stayed in one roost while the males left for other roosts. It also prefers to live in dry areas or arid climates rather than wet climates, so it would more likely to be found in evergreen forests rather than swamps. It is necessary to have at least 25% humidity, and preferable to have multiple exits in the structure of the roost. When they roost, they stay about twenty centimeters apart - except when young are present - and they all face the same way. The bats do not seem to be territorial, and also share roosts with other species of bat.|$|E

60|$|In sex {{there are}} about five female lions to one male. This {{is caused by the}} jealous and vicious {{disposition}} of the male. It is a fact that the old Toms kill every young lion they can catch. Both male and female of the litter suffer alike until after weaning time, and then only the males. In this matter wise animal logic is displayed by the Toms. The domestic cat, to some extent, possesses the same trait. If the litter is destroyed, the <b>mating</b> <b>time</b> is sure to come about regardless of the season. Thus this savage trait of the lions prevents overproduction, and breeds a hardy and intrepid race. If by chance or that cardinal feature of animal life--the survival of the fittest--a young male lion escapes to the weaning time, even after that he is persecuted. Young male lions have been killed and found to have had their flesh beaten until it was a mass of bruises and undoubtedly it had been the work of an old Tom. Moreover, old males and females have been killed, and found {{to be in the same}} bruised condition. A feature, and a conclusive one, is the fact that invariably the female is suckling her young at this period, and sustains the bruises in desperately defending her litter.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} oral hydroxyurea (HU) {{in the treatment}} of the sickle cell disease (SCD) is already proven. However, side-effects on reproduction and development still cause concerns, mainly in long term treatments. We used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism in the study of this subject. This species has been considered favorable for studying human diseases and responses to drugs because both organisms share more than 50 % of the genes for disease and exhibit a very similar drug metabolism. In addition, D. melanogaster allows laboratory approaches that are not possible in humans. We analyzed the impact of the concentrations HU 0. 1 and HU 0. 25 on productivity, oviposition rate, emergence period duration, mortality and development time from egg to adult. HU affected all these traits, showing dose dependence. The frequency of mating, and duration of premating and <b>mating</b> <b>times</b> of flies were also analyzed in treatments with HU 0. 25. Considering all the traits, the treatments decreased the productivity, oviposition rate and frequency of mating, and increased the emergence period duration, mortality rate from egg to adult and development time. The premating and <b>mating</b> <b>times</b> duration were affected in a more complex way. On the basis of the knowledge that HU affects DNA synthesis and repair, and other data available in the literature, we raised hypotheses to explain the present observations. The results and hypotheses suggested new approaches for further studies of particular and important aspects. In general, this study reinforces the validity of the concern with HU side-effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Female crickets can {{potentially}} gain both {{direct and indirect}} benefits from <b>mating</b> multiple <b>times</b> with different males.

Virgin female Gryllus vocalis crickets were assigned to mate five, ten or 15 times with either the same or different males. Females that <b>mated</b> more <b>times</b> gained direct benefits in terms of laying more eggs and more fertilized eggs. Females that mated with different males rather than mating repeatedly with the same male did not have higher offspring hatching success, a result that is contrary to other published results comparing female reproductive success with repeated versus different partners.
