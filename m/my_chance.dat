5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot from his chest and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was in the morgue while holding his brothers' hands, {{recalled}} the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: [...] "He said, 'This is <b>my</b> <b>chance,</b> to have a say, so that maybe our country will do something for us.' My country did do something; it killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Vickers {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first career win {{in front of the}} crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient." [...] Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus, was annoyed: [...] "I just don't think [...] has the talent to understand what he has underneath him." ...|$|E

500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2–1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1–0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a sad day, but obviously a happy day for me because I'm getting <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> to be a manager in the league," [...] said the former striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other." [...] His first match was a 2–0 defeat at Preston North End, but he took positives from the performance.|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{was also}} a regular guest on various talk shows, {{including}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman, on which he appeared 50 times. Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at the Comedy Store in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up.

2500|$|His {{first goal}} of the season came in a 3–0 win at Yeovil Town on 24 August, which was quickly {{followed}} up by his first career hat-trick in a 5–1 win at Millwall on 14 September, which {{was also the first}} league hat-trick by a Derby player since Paul Simpson in April 1996. After a 1–0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, with the club having won only once in the last six matches, having failed to win at home, and lying in 14th place, manager Nigel Clough was sacked. Bryson was saddened by the move, saying it came as a [...] "shock", adding that Clough [...] "has been excellent for me, he brought me down from Scotland and gave me <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> in England. So obviously I was sad to see him go. But it happens in football {{and you just have to}} get on with it." [...] Clough was replaced by Steve McClaren and Bryson said that he was looking forward to working with the new manager.|$|E
2500|$|Titans {{running backs}} coach Earnest Byner said of Ringer “You {{can see the}} running skills, {{the things that we}} saw when we watched him at Michigan State, Good patience, good body lean, the ability to set the inside zones, acceleration, vision. Can he go in and compete on offense? Yes he can. With the way things are progressing, with the {{competition}} … that competition is going to make that third position much better." [...] When describing the role of the 3rd string running back, Jeff Fisher said [...] "The rotation is, for the most part, like it was last year, So the third running back will be called upon if the second back can’t play, and to be a good player on special teams." [...] Ringer commented on the role, saying [...] "Special teams can help you win or lose a game. My goal coming in here was to be a productive player anyway possible. If special teams is it then that will be it. I know that’s {{going to be a big}} deal. I know I’ll get <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> sooner or later.” ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009–10 season, Bryson {{was linked}} with a move to Hearts, who were managed by Jim Jefferies, who had signed Bryson when he was manager of Kilmarnock. Bryson said: [...] "we'll wait and see if {{anything}} materialises over the summer. Jim Jefferies signed me from Clyde and gave me <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> in the SPL and I'm grateful to him for that. I enjoyed working under him at Kilmarnock and wouldn't mind working under him again. Every player has ambitions to play at the highest level and I'm no different so we'll just wait and see if an offer comes in but I'm happy at Killie just now." [...] Hearts were prepared to offer £300,000 but Kilmarnock valued Bryson at closer to £500,000 and talks between the two clubs collapsed. Hearts turned their attention to their former midfielder Paul Hartley, whose contract with English Championship club Bristol City was about to expire. However, they dropped their interest in Hartley after he refused to distance himself from criticism of Hearts' majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov during his first stint with the club. Hearts thus turned their attention back to Bryson and gave Kilmarnock a final [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] offer, which included a [...] "significant sell-on clause" [...] but not an increased transfer fee. The offer was rejected. Hearts returned with two more bids on transfer deadline day, which were also rejected. Bryson said that he was [...] "relieved the window has now closed... It's nice that other clubs want you, it shows you must be doing well, but it's not to be just now and I'll carry on doing well for Kilmarnock." ...|$|E
