The ICA Commission in Spatial Data Quality (1995) recognizes three parts of the {{specification}} and use of spatial data quality information: (1) defining the elements of spatial data quality; (2) derivation of an easily understood index of spatial quality, composed {{of a series of}} metrics that measure the elements of spatial data quality; and, (3) presenting or rendering the known quality for visualization. Efforts in the past twenty years have resulted in the definition of the following elements of spatial data quality: lineage, positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, completeness, logical consistency, semantic accuracy, and temporal information.

This debate, in part, can be avoided by assessing the positional accuracy of geospatial data, leading to increased confidence (decreased uncertainty) in both the data and the decisions made from the data. In this study, we assessed the positional accuracy of two Geographic Information System (GIS) baseline datasets at the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA); high-resolution digital aerial photography acquired in January 2000, and the Digital Topographic Data Base (DTDB) roads data. We also assessed areal error of paddock measurements from an improved accuracy version of the high-resolution digital aerial photography.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{feasibility}} of using planialtimetric information derived from RADARSAT- 2 (RST- 2) ultra-fine (UF) stereo pairs and fine quad-pol (FQP) images for detailed topographic mapping was investigated for a semiarid terrain in the Curac ¸ a´ Valley, northeast of Brazil. Precise topographic field information acquired from a global positioning system was used for ground control points for the modeling of the stereoscopic digital surface models (DSMs), orthoimages, and as independent check points for the calculation of planialtimetric accuracies. The analysis was performed with the following two approaches: (i) the use of {{root mean square error}} for the overall classification of the DSMs and orthoimages considering the Brazilian <b>Map</b> <b>Accuracy</b> <b>Standard</b> limits, and (ii) calculations of systematic errors (bias) and accuracy based on a methodology that takes into account computed discrepancies and standard deviations. Thematic information was extracted from FQP data through the use of an unsupervised terrain and land-use classification scheme based on the FreemanDurden decomposition and the Wishart classifier. The investigation showed that the planialtimetric accuracies of UF DSMs and ortho-images and the thematic information of the FQP data fulfilled the requirements compatible to detailed topographic mapping (1 : 50 000). Thus, the use of RST- 2 data can be considered a real alternative as a primary source for detailed topographic mapping programs in similar environments of Brazil, where terrain information is limited or of a poor quality.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Herbicide Ballistic Technology (HBT) is an {{electro-pneumatic}} {{delivery system}} designed for administering 17. 3 mm herbicide-filled projectiles (i. e., paintballs) to visually-acquired weed targets. Currently, HBT is being deployed from a Hughes 500 D helicopter platform in aerial surveillance operations to eliminate satellite populations of an invasive weed (Miconia calvescens) in remote watershed areas of East Maui (Hawaii, USA). Coordination {{and analysis of}} control operations require that the site of each HBT application be recorded with a handheld GPS data logger. This independent step, though critically important, adds significant time to the target acquisition process where flight time is extremely limited. Furthermore, herbicide use rates are calculated post-operation by rudimentary mean estimation of bulk projectile consumption relative {{to the number of}} recorded targets. In an effort to improve operations, GPS and other sensors were integrated directly into the electro-pneumatic device for instantaneously recording time, origin, and trajectory of each projectile discharged. These data are transmitted wirelessly to a custom android application that displays target information in real-time both textually and on a map. The application also records data into a comma delimited file so that it can easily be recalled for map display, or exported to other software such as for conducting additional GIS analysis. Static precision, reported as the Circular <b>Map</b> <b>Accuracy</b> <b>Standard</b> (CMAS) and Spherical <b>Accuracy</b> <b>Standard</b> (SAS), and <b>accuracy,</b> reported as root mean squared error (RMSE) in horizontal and three dimensional space, of the logger are 7. 33 m, 11. 41 m, 7. 27 m and 11. 47 m, respectively. Offset reproducibility was determined to be robust based on the convergence of CMAS, from 18. 18 m to 3. 28 m, and horizontal RMSE, from 12. 12 m to 2. 86 m, from four different marker positions. Operational data collected over the course of ten operations in 2014 and 2015 agreed with previous anecdotal observations and showed a high level of precision. The logger makes data collection a seamless part of the operation, facilitates logistics of applying airborne HBT, and improves our interpretations of operational HBT performance with more statistically robust measures of herbicide use rate and time-on-target. This provides enhanced capabilities for building operational intelligence relevant to landscape scale invasive species management...|$|R

Woody vegetation proved to be more stable in terms of omission and commission errors compared to herbaceous vegetation types. Generally, <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> increases with increasing length of the observation period. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) verified that inter-annual classifications significantly improved class-wise <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracies,</b> and confirmed that monthly composites achieved the best accuracy scores for both annual and inter-annual classifications. Correlation analyses using piecewise linear models affirmed positive correlations between cumulative <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> and rainfall and indicated an influence of seasonality and environmental cues on the <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracies.</b> The consideration of the inter-seasonal variability of vegetation activity and phenology cycling in the classification process further increases the overall classification performance of savanna classes in large-area land-cover datasets. Implications for global monitoring frameworks are discussed based on a conceptual model of the relationship between observation period and accurac...|$|R

In {{the paper}} two methods for data {{structure}} analysis and visualisation are presented: the simultaneous nonlinear mapping (Sammon, 1969) and the sequential one (Montvilas, 1995). These two methods were compared according ability {{to map the}} data on the plane, <b>mapping</b> <b>accuracy</b> and a <b>mapping</b> time. It was showed that the sequential nonlinear mapping has some bigger total mapping error but needs considerable less calculation time {{than that of the}} simultaneous one. Examples are given. Key words:simultaneous nonlinear mapping, sequential nonlinear <b>mapping,</b> <b>accuracy,</b> comparison. 1...|$|R

Statistical estimation of classification accuracy {{has been a long}} studied and established subject that has a vast literature. However, most theoretical considerations for sample sizes and other factors for the assessment of <b>map</b> <b>accuracy</b> were developed and verified on low-to-moderate dimensionality data (e.g., Landsat TM, MSS, SPOT HRV) and allowing relatively large errors. With hyperspectral data, the <b>map</b> <b>accuracy</b> is expected to increase; therefore, the sample size required for rigorous assessment of the accuracy within a meaningful error limit and confidence level may become prohibitively large. The works cited above, and others in the literature, offer recommendations for accuracy assessments. According to the formula derived from binomial distribution [72], the number of test samples needed for <b>map</b> <b>accuracy</b> assessment is ntest[*]=[*]x 2 [*]×[*]p[*]×[*](1 [*]−[*]p)[*]/[*]E 2, where E is the allowed maximum error in the accuracy assessment, x defines the confidence level (confidence level corresponding to x ‘sigma’), and p is the desired <b>map</b> <b>accuracy.</b> As an example, for assessment of the classification at the 95 % confidence level within 4 % error, this requires at least 2, 700 test samples for the 23 classes in this study.|$|R
