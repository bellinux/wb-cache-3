For HID lamps, there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but for these lamps the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan. Some HID lamp types like the ceramic discharge <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> <b>lamp</b> have reduced reliability when operated at high frequencies {{in the range of}} for these lamps a square wave low frequency current drive is mostly used with frequency in the range of , with the same advantage of lower light depreciation.|$|E

This study introduces the structure of the curing unit and examines the resulting properties of a representative composite material. The curing unit is equipped with two <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> <b>lamps</b> that radiate both ultraviolet and visible light. Unlike conventional <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> <b>lamps</b> for industrial use, these <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> <b>lamps</b> radiate an increased intensity of visible radiation. Properties of a microfilled composite veneering material cured with the new <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> unit were ascertained. A xenon photo-curing unit was also used as a control. The specimens cured with the <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> unit exhibited greater Knoop hardness numbers and flexural moduli as compared with those cured with the xenon unit, and also showed reduced water solubility values. These results suggest that the <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> light source is effective in curing composite materials within a shorter period of time and with improved conversion...|$|R
