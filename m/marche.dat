5|$|Within Ivalice, {{there are}} other {{characters}} that help advance the plot. Some characters befriended <b>Marche,</b> such as the moogles Montblanc and Nono; Ezel Berbier, a Nu Mou troublemaker and self-proclaimed genius; and Shara, a Viera archer who befriends Ritz. There are other characters who antagonize <b>Marche,</b> including Babus Swain, a Nu Mou Royal mage in Mewt's service; Llednar Twem, a mysterious enforcer who replaces the Judges when they become independent of the Palace; and Queen Remedi, who is the ruler of Ivalice {{and was in the}} Gran Grimoire itself in a form modeled after Mewt's deceased mother.|$|E
5|$|In Tactics Advance, turn-based {{tactical}} battles {{take place}} on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of <b>Marche,</b> a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions instantly.|$|E
5|$|The Tirreno–Adriatico ended as {{its parent}} race the Giro d'Italia {{had for the}} last three seasons, with an {{individual}} time trial. San Benedetto del Tronto in the <b>Marche</b> region played host to a perfectly flat out-and-back ride right along the Adriatic coast.|$|E

5|$|Alexandre Villaplane captained France in {{its first}} FIFA World Cup match in 1930 {{and went on to}} captain the team in the entire tournament. Maurice Cottenet was the first goalkeeper to captain the {{national}} team. Alex Thépot was the second and bore the armband at the 1934 FIFA World Cup. The team's first captain after World War II was Alfred Aston. Aston captained the team for the first time {{in its first}} match following the conclusion of the war, a 3–1 win over Belgium on Christmas Eve 1944, and subsequently led the team out six more times. Following Aston, the captaincy was rotated among striker Jean Baratte and defenders Roger <b>Marche</b> and Robert Jonquet. <b>Marche</b> and Jonquet alternated the armband at the 1954 and 1958 editions of the FIFA World Cup. Following the retirement of Baratte, <b>Marche</b> took primary control of the captaincy and guided the team until his international retirement in 1960. The former Stade de Reims defender held the record of captaining France the most until he was surpassed by Michel Platini in 1986. Platini is the first France captain to lead the team to victory in a major international competition. He accomplished this feat at UEFA Euro 1984. In 2000, Platini was surpassed by Didier Deschamps, who captained France to its first FIFA World Cup title in 1998. Deschamps surpassed Platini during UEFA Euro 2000 in the team's semi-final match against Portugal. France won the match, 2–1. In the final, France defeated Italy, giving Deschamps his second major honour as captain. Deschamps was succeeded by Marcel Desailly, who ranks second in captaining France the most. Desailly captained France to victory at both the 2001 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} of these appearances, on October 28, 1893, Tchaikovsky {{conducted}} the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, along with his First Piano Concerto with Adele aus der Ohe as soloist. Tchaikovsky did not live to conduct the other three concerts, as he died on November 6, 1893. Rimsky-Korsakov stood in for him at the second of these events, an all-Tchaikovsky concert in memory of the composer, on December 12, 1893. The program included the Fourth Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, <b>Marche</b> Slave and some solo piano works played by Felix Blumenfeld.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main plot, there are two side plots: the Redwing Arc and the Judge Arc. The Redwing Arc centers around the Redwings clan, a foreign crime ring, their subordinate clan Borzoi, and their smuggled foreign monsters. The other is the Judge Arc, unlockable after beating the main three hundred missions. This serves as an alternative ending where <b>Marche</b> never goes on his quest and stays in Ivalice, overthrows several corrupt judges, and becomes next in line for Cid's judge sword.|$|E
5|$|Its generic name, Cleptornis, {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek kleptes, a robber or thief, and ornis, a bird. This is not a {{reference}} to any aspect of the golden white-eye's behaviour, but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands, les Îles des Voleurs, or Robbers' Islands. The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred <b>Marche,</b> who procured the original specimens.|$|E
5|$|Limousin cattle {{evolved in}} the French region now known as Limousin. The region {{comprises}} the historical French provinces of Limousin and <b>Marche,</b> which include the departments of Corrèze in its entirety, most of Creuse, and parts of Haute-Vienne. Limousin cattle adapted to the local hilly conditions of acidic soils and weakly mineralised granite, with large variations in temperature. These factors {{led to the development}} of a hardy breed with an unusually thin but solid bone.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky wrote many {{works that}} are {{popular with the}} {{classical}} music public, including his Romeo and Juliet, the 1812 Overture, his three ballets (The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty) and <b>Marche</b> Slave. These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto, the last three of his six numbered symphonies and his operas The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin, are among his most familiar works. Almost as popular are the Manfred Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, the Capriccio Italien and the Serenade for Strings.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Light Horse Brigade {{with the}} 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery, had {{advanced}} quickly along the Tulkarm-to-Nablus road {{to attack the}} last resistance outside Nablus and capture the town, between 800 and 900 prisoners and two field guns. The Régiment Mixte de <b>Marche</b> de Cavalerie, with two armoured cars, entered Nablus while the 14th Light Horse Regiment linked with the 29th and 30th Brigades (10th Division, XX Corps) at Balata.|$|E
5|$|The France {{national}} team's record appearance-maker as captain is Didier Deschamps, who led {{the team}} out 52 times during his 103-cap tenure, which lasted through three decades. Deschamps {{is also the most}} successful France captain, having worn the armband, an indicator of the team's captain, in team victories at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. The Bayonne-born midfielder surpassed the previous record-holder of the France captaincy, midfielder Michel Platini, in the team's semi-final match at the latter competition. Platini became the first France captain to win a major international competition after leading the team in the 1984 European Football Championship. Aside from Deschamps and Platini, only two other players have captained France over 40 occasions, defenders Roger <b>Marche</b> and Marcel Desailly. <b>Marche</b> is one of two French captains to lead the team at two FIFA World Cup competitions. Desailly captained the team to victories at the 2001 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup. He is one of four players to be sent off in a FIFA World Cup final; one of the other three being fellow France captain Zinedine Zidane.|$|E
5|$|After {{travelling}} to Tangiers in 1912, Rix held several successful {{exhibitions of}} her work, with one drawing, Grande <b>marche,</b> Tanger, {{purchased by the}} French government. She {{was one of the}} first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, was made a member of the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français, and had works hung in the Paris Salon first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Missions are tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, <b>Marche</b> temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E
5|$|Place d'Armes {{is one of}} {{the largest}} squares in the city of Calais, adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city. While Calais was a {{territory}} of England (1347–1558), it became known as Market Square (place du <b>Marché).</b> Only at the end of English rule did it take the name of Place d'Armes. After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis, Duke of Guise, Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year on the square, which still exists today, as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Tactics Advance {{revolves}} around three primary characters: <b>Marche</b> Radiuju, {{the main character}} who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz Malheur, a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world {{into the world of}} Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche's little brother who does not desire to return to the real world, since he is sick in the real world and healthy in the dream one; and Cid Randell, Mewt's father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|By 29 May, the battalions of Adriatic Command were {{in their}} {{garrison}} locations: the 6th Battalion at Mostar, the 7th Battalion at Trebinje, and the 10th Battalion in the Dubrovnik area. The other two Adriatic Command battalions were deployed to Knin and Sinj far to the west. The 18th Battalion was allocated as a reserve and was garrisoned in Mostar. Main Ustaše Headquarters was tasked to recruit one battalion for duties within the Adriatic Command area. Home Guard battalions had a standard structure, consisting of a headquarters company, three infantry companies, a machine gun platoon and a communications section, while battalions of the Ustaše Militia consisted of a headquarters, three companies and a motorised section. Even after the establishment of NDH authorities in eastern Herzegovina, Italian forces maintained {{their presence in the}} region. The 55th Regiment of the 32nd Infantry Division <b>Marche</b> remained garrisoned in Trebinje, with the 56th Regiment based in Mostar. The 49th MVSN Legion (Blackshirts) were also stationed in Bileća. The Italians maintained a troop presence in Nevesinje until 17 June, and conducted almost daily motorised patrols throughout eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Hergé sought work {{elsewhere}} too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon <b>Marché</b> department store, and The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West for {{the rival}} L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although {{neither of them}} were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged {{to do so by}} Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
5|$|Aymer {{was the son}} of William de Valence, son of Hugh X, Count of La <b>Marche</b> and Isabella of Angoulême. William was Henry III's {{half-brother}} {{through his}} mother’s prior marriage to King John, and as such gained a central position in the Kingdom of England. He had come to the earldom of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, granddaughter of William Marshal. Aymer was the third son of his family, so little is known of his birth and early years. He {{is believed to have been}} born some time between 1270 and 1275. As his father was on crusade with Lord Edward until January 1273, a date towards the end of this period is more likely. With the death in battle in Wales of his remaining brother William in 1282 (John, the elder brother, was dead in 1277), Aymer found himself heir to the Earldom of Pembroke. William de Valence died in 1296, and Aymer inherited his father's French lands, but had to wait until his mother died in 1307 to succeed to the Earldom. Through inheritance and marriages his lands consisted of– apart from the county palatine in Pembrokeshire– property spread out across England primarily in a strip from Gloucestershire to East Anglia, in south-east Ireland (Wexford), and French lands in the Poitou- and Calais areas.|$|E
5|$|The 1174 peace did {{not deal}} with the long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s. The two kings now began to compete for control of Berry, a prosperous region of value to both kings. Henry had some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fiancée Alice the whole province {{as part of the}} marriage settlement. If Louis accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away in the first place, and would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf. To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war. The papacy intervened and, probably as Henry had planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a non-aggression treaty in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint crusade. The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an arbitration panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing La <b>Marche</b> from the local count. This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.|$|E
