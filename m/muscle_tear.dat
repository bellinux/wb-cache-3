5|$|Egypt manager Marco Tardelli dropped Mido in September 2004, after Mido {{claimed to}} be {{unavailable}} for the national team due to an injury, but played in a friendly match for Roma 24 hours later. A day later, Mido rejected accusations that he refused to play for his country. Also, the Egyptian Football Association {{announced that he would}} not play for the team again. However, Tardelli was sacked as Egypt coach and in January 2005 the Egyptian Football Association said they would consider bringing Mido back into the team if he were to apologise for his past behaviour. Mido flew to Cairo in February 2005 and made a public apology and the following month he was recalled by the national team. Mido withdrew from Egypt's 2006 World Cup qualifier against Cameroon, after sustaining a <b>muscle</b> <b>tear</b> while playing with Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

25|$|Broad had an {{indifferent}} tour of Australia, {{which was}} cut short due to injury. He started with a half-century in a warm-up game, and overall took 6 wickets over the two games against Western Australia and South Australia. In the first Test at the Gabba, Brisbane, he fell for a golden duck in England's innings, the final victim of Peter Siddle's hat-trick. Wicketless in Australia's first innings, he had Simon Katich caught in the second as the Test was drawn. In the second Test at Adelaide, he finished Australia's first innings off with the wicket of Brad Haddin, but a stomach muscle injury limited his participation in the second where England won by an innings. That injury was revealed to be a <b>muscle</b> <b>tear,</b> and it ruled Broad out of the remaining three Tests and the one-day series that followed. He was not missed {{for the rest of}} the Test series but he was for the ODIs because England were plagued by injuries throughout the 6–1 series defeat.|$|E

For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined {{a host of other}} British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf <b>muscle</b> <b>tear</b> had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E

His 21-game hit-streak was the second-longest for the Indians that season, behind Dale Mitchell's mark of 23 games in a row. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby's salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby, who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs, stating he would not accept a pay cut. Indians manager Al López confirmed that Doby was injury-riddled throughout the season, stating that he [...] "was beset by first one injury and then another" [...] including [...] "a <b>muscle</b> <b>tear</b> in his thigh, a groin pull, an ankle twist."

40|$|Background: to {{describe}} role of alternative management as {{an approach to}} management and rehabilitation of multiple hip <b>muscles</b> <b>tears</b> {{by the use of}} 1 RM (Repetition Maximum) testing and hip muscle strengthening program along with the use of sports specific drills for rehabilitation and recovery. There is very limited literature describing multiple hip <b>muscle</b> <b>tears</b> and the conservative management of the same. 1 RM testing and strengthening of hip muscles is an approach that is able to help in the return to sports of an athlete without surgical intervention. Methods: the patient, is a 21 -year-old male hockey player who presented with pain right buttock, right lower leg and a limp on the right side while walking. Physical examination revealed a positive Trendelenburg sign both in stance and gait phase. Hip rotational movements showed a normal range of motion, there was a severe pain in the right buttock on movements which he described at 8 / 10 on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). Strength assessment revealed weakness of the right hip flexors and extensors and also of the abductor and external hip rotator muscles. Treatment protocol followed was based on 1 RM testing of muscles and hip strengthening exercises and sports specific drills. Results: following the intervention, the patient reported pain at 0 / 10 VAS while doing all activities and also showed good muscle control with no limp. Conclusions: this highlights an alternative protocol for treating multiple hip <b>muscle</b> <b>tears</b> and illustrates the importance of 1 RM testing as a part of examination and sports medicine intervention...|$|R

2500|$|He {{missed the}} start of the 2011 season after {{sustaining}} a <b>muscle</b> <b>tear</b> in Lancashire's final pre-season warm-up match. At {{the start of}} May Hogg again suffered an injury, this time twisting his ankle in training. When not sidelined with injury, Hogg was competing with Sajid Mahmood, Farveez Maharoof, Oliver Newby, and Tom Smith for a place in the team. His first appearance of the season was on 16 May in Lancashire's CB40 defeat to Somerset in which he conceded 63 runs from six over, taking a single wicket. Later that month Hogg played his first County Championship game of the season. He recorded his career best bowling figures, taking 7wickets for 28runs against Hampshire (surpassed in June 2013 by taking 7 Northants wickets for just 27 runs conceded) it was his second five-wicket haul and first since 2002. Lancashire {{went on to win the}} match by ten wickets with Hogg taking career best figures of 11/59 in the match. When Lancashire faced Yorkshire in the County Championship in July, Hogg scored a half-century and took a five-wicket haul to help his team to victory in the Roses match, reaching 150first-class wickets in the process. Against Nottinghamshire Hogg took his third five-wicket haul of the season in the Championship. The 2011 season was Hogg's most successful: as well as recording his best first-class bowling figures Hogg took 50wickets in the County Championship for the first time. He also scored 300first-class runs at an average of 21.47. One of three bowlers to take at least 50wickets in the County Championship for Lancashire that year, Hogg contributed to the club winning the competition for the first time since it shared the title with Surrey in 1950.|$|E

The most frequent location of compartment syndrome in the lower extremity is the anterior compartment. Looking at the literature, lateral compartment syndrome {{of the lower}} leg is quite rare. Lateral compartment syndrome occurs due to inversion ankle injuries [1, 2], exertion [3, 4], horseback riding [5, 6], a prolonged lithotomy position in general surgical, urologic, and gynecologic procedures [7], peroneus longus <b>muscle</b> <b>tears</b> or avulsion [8 – 12].|$|R
