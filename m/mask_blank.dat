40|$|The {{readiness}} of a defect-free extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) <b>mask</b> <b>blank</b> infrastructure {{is one of}} the main enablers for the insertion of EUVL technology into production. It is essential to have sufficient defect detection capability and understanding of defect printability to develop a defect-free EUVL <b>mask</b> <b>blank</b> infrastructure. The SEMATECH <b>Mask</b> <b>Blank</b> Development Center (MBDC) has been developing EUVL mask blanks with low defect densities with the Lasertec M 1350 and M 7360, the 1 st and 2 nd generations, respectively, of visible light EUVL <b>mask</b> <b>blank</b> inspection tools. Although the M 7360 represents a significant improvement in our defect detection capability, it is time to start developing a 3 rd generation tool for EUVL <b>mask</b> <b>blank</b> inspection. The goal of this tool is to detect all printable defects; therefore, understanding defect printability criteria is critical to this tool development. In this paper, we will investigate the defect detectability of a 2 nd generation blank inspection tool and a patterned EUVL mask inspection tool. We will also compare the ability of the inspection tools to detect programmed defects whose printability has been estimated from wafer printing results and actinic aerial images results...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of defect-free <b>mask</b> <b>blanks</b> remains a key challenge for EUV lithography. Mask-blank inspection tools {{must be able}} to accurately detect all critical defects while simultaneously having the minimum possible false-positive detection rate. We have recently observed and here report the identification of bump-type buried substrate defects, that were below the detection limit of a non-actinic (i. e. non-EUV) in inspection tool. Presently, the occurrence inspection of pit-type defects, their printability, and their detectability with actinic techniques and non-actinic commercial tools, has become a significant concern. We believe that the most successful strategy for the development of effective non-actinic mask inspection tools will involve the careful cross-correlation with actinic inspection and lithographic printing. In this way, the true efficacy of prototype inspection tools now under development can be studied quantitatively against relevant benchmarks. To this end we have developed a dual-mode actinic mask inspection system capable of scanning <b>mask</b> <b>blanks</b> for defects (with simultaneous EUV bright-field and dark-field detection) and imaging those same defects with a zoneplate microscope that matches or exceeds the resolution of EUV steppers...|$|R

Reflectivity is achieved with resonant, wavelength-matched multilayer (ML) coatings on all of the optical surfaces - including the mask. The EUV mask has a unique architecture - it consists of a substrate with a highly reflective ML coating (the <b>mask</b> <b>blank)</b> that is subsequently over-coated with a patterned absorber layer (the mask).

40|$|The mask {{industry}} has recently witnessed {{an increasing number}} of new MoSi <b>mask</b> <b>blank</b> materials which are quickly replacing the older materials as the standard in high end mask shops. These new materials, including OMOG (opaque MoSi on glass) and high transmission (Hi-T) films, are driven foremost by the need to reduce feature size through resolution enhancement techniques (RET). The subject of this paper is a new low stress, Hi-T material which addresses the challenges presented by transitioning to smaller technology nodes including difficulties with pattern transfer, cleaning and repair. This material, based on currently employed MoSi films, eliminates process steps and utilizes a thinner overall substrate stack than currently used Hi-T schemes allowing an increase in critical dimension (CD) uniformity and feature resolution and more robustness due to a lower aspect ratio. While this new material is MoSi based the small compositional change requires, in some cases, a significant change in processing. Among the most impacted areas are the etch, clean and repair steps.
