40|$|The {{degradation}} of GaAs <b>metal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (MESFET) performance after rinsing {{for a short}} time in deionized water is investigated. It is caused by the oxidation of the GaAs surface specially in the periphery of metal electrodes. The mechanism of the rapid surface oxidation is contributed by the electrode reaction between GaAs and electrode metal. Oxygen dissolved in deionized water has a significant effect on the reaction. The GaAs integrated-circuit (IC) process is substantially different from the Si IC process because there is no high qual itynative oxide of GaAs. In Si IC processing thermal oxidation of the Si surface is performed first, and the sur-face of Si is covered by SiO 2 except when ohmic contacts are to be formed. In GaAs IC processing, however, the sur-face of GaAs often is exposed to ambience because the na-tive oxide of GaAs is unstable.

40|$|Organic {{compounds}} {{have been}} regarded as insulators for a long time. However, a semi-conductive organic material was discovered in the late 1940 s. Since then, many organic semiconductors have been found and studied. However, the current carriers have quite lower mobility than those of inorganic counterparts so far. In spite of the low mobility, organic semiconductor devices have many interesting advantages such as low-cost fabrication, easy process, diverse substrate materials, and so on. Owing {{to the benefit of}} the low-cost fabrication, organic semiconductor can be applied to large-area electronic devices as well as ubiquitous devices. Although organic semiconductor has been widely utilized in electronics, its low performance has extremely restricted application in integrated circuits (ICs) that are essential for high-tech electronics. In order to be competitive in market, the performance improvement of organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) has become an indispensable prerequisite. Although the low performance of conventional OTFTs basically results from the inherent low carrier mobility, it is also attributed to low resolution fabrication processes and their inferior configuration with large parasitic capacitance. With regard to solutions to improve the performance of OTFTs, three novel strategies are proposed in this work: submicron metal patterning, self-aligned structure, and <b>metal</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (MESFET) -like structure. To realize the solutions, a new concept of lithography, dual-layer thermal nanoimprint, is devised and its potential for submicron organic semiconductor patterning is experimented. In addition to the submicron resolution, two innovative patterning techniques, single-layer patterning and double-layer patterning, are successfully developed through the dual-layer thermal nanoimprint. Both patterning techniques can be utilized in fabricating self-aligned OTFTs and organic metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (OMESFETs). In the case of OMESFETs that require multiple-level metallization, the application of the dual-layer thermal nanoimprint lithography is extended from two-dimension to three-dimension to achieve self-aligned metallization that completely eliminates alignment errors. The 3 D dual-layer thermal nanoimprint enables a sub- 100 nm gap between metal patterns on an organic active layer. Because of the capability of nanoscale metal patterning on organic semiconductors with high overlay accuracy, this self-aligned metallization technique can be effectively utilized to fabricate high-performance top-contact OMESFETs...|$|E

With the enhanced control, performance trends of all FETs are still challenged by carrier mobility dependence on the strengths of the electrical field along the channel. However, in cases when the ratio of FinFET volume to its surface dramatically decreases, one should carefully consider the surface boundary conditions of the device. Moreover, the inherent non-planar nature of a FinFET demands 3 D modeling for accurate analysis of the device performance. Using the Silvaco modeling tool with quantization effects, we modeled a physical FinFET described in the work of Hisamoto et al. (IEEE Tran. Elec. Devices 47 : 12, 2000) in 3 D.

This is due to the increased capability in both the material and the device engineering in GaAs technology, which has proliferated incredibly fast during the last decade. In this thesis, two different approaches to monolithically integrate various electronic and optical devices are explored for the implementation of optical neurons. The first approach utilizes the technology from double heterojunction bipolar transistor for its potentially high current gain and its structural compatibility with optical devices. In achieving the current gain required for optical neurons, modeling of the base leakage current, effect of surface passivation and diffusion characteristics is performed for Zn-diffused bipolar transistors.

However, one of the major limitations for oxide electronics is the scarcity of an equally good hole-conducting semiconductor, which can provide identical performance for the p-type <b>metal</b> oxide <b>semiconductor</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> as compared to their electron conducting counterparts. In this quest, here we present a bulk synthesis method for single crystalline cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) nanowires, their chemical and morphological characterization and suitability as active channel material in electrolyte-gated, low-power, <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> (FETs) for portable and flexible logic circuits. The bulk synthesis method used in the present study includes two steps: namely hydrothermal synthesis of the nanowires and the removal of the surface organic contaminants. The surface treated nanowires are then dispersed on a receiver substrate where the passive electrodes are structured, followed by printing of a composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE), chosen as the gate insulator. The characteristic electrical properties of individual nanowire FETs are found to be quite interesting including accumulation-mode operation and field-effect mobility of 0. 15 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) ...|$|R
