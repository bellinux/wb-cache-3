As a consequence of our characterizations, an old issue raised in Meyers-Ziemer [MZ] is resolved by constructing a locally integrable function f such that f belongs to BV(R^n) ^* but |f| does not. Moreover, we show that the <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> BV_n/n- 1 (R^n) ^* coincide with the <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> Ẇ^ 1, 1 (R^n) ^*, the dual of the homogeneous Sobolev space Ẇ^ 1, 1 (R^n), in the sense of isometric isomorphism.
