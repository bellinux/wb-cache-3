Generally described as a military dictatorship, Noriega's rule in Panama was marked by repression of the media, {{an expansion of the}} <b>military,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> persecution of political opponents, effectively controlling the outcomes of any elections. He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., being described as being its ally and nemesis at the same time. He has been called one of the best-known dictators of his time, and compared to authoritarian rulers such as Muammar Gaddafi and Augusto Pinochet.|$|E

5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast.

The Crusades also had a role in the creation and institutionalisation of the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dominican orders as well as the Medieval Inquisition.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air training scheme. Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output. Annual costs for the air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E

5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into <b>military,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over {{and the return of}} players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2million.|$|E
5|$|An SASR troop was {{deployed}} to Timor Leste in May 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Astute, operating alongside a Commando Company Group {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component following renewed unrest there. On 4 March 2007, along with the commandos, SASR personnel took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. It was reported in October 2006 that 20 SASR operators were in the southern Philippines, supporting Filipino operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah terrorist groups, but this was denied by the Department of Defence. Meanwhile, following tensions in Fiji between the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government the Australian Government dispatched three naval vessels in November and December 2006 as part of Operation Quickstep, in preparation for a potential evacuation of Australian citizens. On 29 November 2006, a Black Hawk helicopter from the 171st Aviation Squadron carrying four crew and six soldiers from the SASR crashed while attempting to land on HMAS Kanimbla and sank in international waters off Fiji. The helicopter's pilot and a soldier from SASR were killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|As the New Hampshire primary neared, Rockefeller {{began to}} attack Goldwater, {{claiming}} he supported a voluntary social security {{plan that would}} bankrupt the nation. Goldwater denied the charge. He campaigned in New Hampshire until the primary vote, spending approximately $150,000 as opposed to $250,000 by Rockefeller. Voters grew wary of Goldwater's stances on social security, Cuba, the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> role of the Federal government, and were likewise turned off by Rockefeller's very public divorce. As a result, the electorate sought out other candidates. Surprisingly, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. won the primary with 35.5 percent as a write-in candidate while still serving in Vietnam and without making any public appearances in New Hampshire. Goldwater finished in second with 22.3 percent, followed by Rockefeller with 21.0 percent. Neither won any delegates from the primary. The chairman of the Florida GOP attributed the defeat to a divided campaign, which he also witnessed in his state, where party leaders such as Congressman William C. Cramer disagreed over a delegate slate.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{to pacify}} the population, Amin {{released}} {{a list of}} 18,000 {{people who had been}} executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the Afghan military deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bureaucracy. While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
5|$|Born in Warsaw and {{following}} in his father's footsteps, he {{became interested in}} politics {{at an early age}} and soon became involved in the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary affairs in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian domination of the Commonwealth. When this uprising failed, he was driven into exile. Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin, Pulaski emigrated to North America to help in the cause of the American Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself throughout the revolution, most notably when he saved the life of George Washington. Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army, created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. At the Battle of Savannah, while leading a daring charge against British forces, he was gravely wounded, and died shortly thereafter.|$|E
