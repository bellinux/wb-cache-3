25|$|The {{removal of}} {{oxidization}} (tarnish) from metal objects is accomplished using a <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> or tarnish remover; {{this is also}} called polishing.

25|$|The {{tamarind}} tree produces pod-like fruit, which contain an edible pulp {{that is used}} in cuisines around the world. Other uses of the pulp include traditional medicine and <b>metal</b> <b>polish.</b> The wood {{can be used for}} woodworking, and tamarind seed oil can be extracted from the seeds. Because of the tamarind's many uses, cultivation has spread around the world in tropical and subtropical zones.|$|E

60|$|When Mr. Stone, {{refusing to}} be accompanied, had taken his departure, and Thyme had gone to bed, Stephen withdrew to his study. This room, which had a {{different}} air from any other portion of the house, was sacred to his private life. Here, in specially designed compartments, he kept his golf clubs, pipes, and papers. Nothing was touched by anyone except himself, and twice a week by one particular housemaid. Here was no bust of Socrates, no books in deerskin bindings, but a bookcase filled with treatises on law, Blue Books, reviews, and the novels of Sir Walter Scott; two black oak cabinets stood side by side against the wall filled with small drawers. When these cabinets were opened and the drawers drawn forward there emerged a scent of <b>metal</b> <b>polish.</b> If the green-baize covers of the drawers were lifted, there were seen coins, carefully arranged with labels--as one may see plants growing in rows, each with its little name tied on. To these tidy rows of shining metal discs Stephen turned in moments when his spirit was fatigued. To add to them, touch them, read their names, gave him the sweet, secret feeling which comes {{to a man who}} rubs one hand against the other. Like a dram-drinker, Stephen drank--in little doses--of the feeling these coins gave him. They were his creative work, his history of the world. To them he gave that side of him which refused to find its full expression in summarising law, playing golf, or reading the reviews; that side of a man which aches, he knows not wherefore, to construct something ere he die. From Rameses to George IV. the coins lay within those drawers--links of the long unbroken chain of authority.|$|E

50|$|In the pre-First World War {{years of}} the 20th century the company {{expanded}} by acquisition, {{as well as by}} organic growth. The Brasso <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> product was introduced in 1905, and an additional factory established on Dansom Lane for its manufacture; rival polishes-Bluebell, Shinio and Mepo were acquired in the early 1900s, along with a number of stove, boot and <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> brands, and blue manufacturers. The Chiswick Polish Company was founded in 1913 as a joint venture. The company expanded by acquiring related manufacturing and raw material concerns, cutting costs: Wilson's Canister Works in Stoneferry was acquired, and carbon black manufacturers were acquired. The acquisitions increased Reckitt's employees from 3,025 in 1909 to 5,339 in 1913.|$|E

50|$|In those days, the Leather Trades Exhibition held in {{the centre}} of Britain’s boot-making {{industry}} Northampton was a very prestigious event and was of significant importance to the trade.

50|$|After {{years of}} trying to find someone who could buy the entire company, the company was sold to S. C. Johnson & Son in 1992. As expected, the Federal Trade Commission had anti-trust {{concerns}} and ordered Johnson not only to divest itself of the Behold and Endust furniture care products and the Renuzit air freshener products within 12 months, but to seek prior approval for a decade before acquiring another furniture care or air freshener company. They placed the furniture brands with Sara Lee and the air freshener with Dial, and were released early from the prior approval requirement. Johnson has since jettisoned some other lines, such as Twinkle <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> and O'Cedar handle goods.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the fundamental surface processes associated with the chemical mechanical planarization ~CMP! of metals, we have developed an experimental tool that combines the high resolution mass sensing capabilities of the quartz crystal microbalance ~QCM! with a triboelectrochemical testing system. A electrochemical QCM is combined with a polishing tool and force sensor in order to perform controlled surface abrasion while simultaneously monitoring mass changes and electrochemical signals at the metal/solution interface. This system can be used to simulate a <b>metal</b> <b>polishing</b> process with in situ surface measurement capabilities. Typical parameters that can be measured include etch rates, polishing rates, and repassivation kinetics via changes in the resonance frequency of the quartz crystal before, during, and after polishing. Simultaneous measurements of electrochemical parameters, such as the electrode current or open circuit potential, provide a direct correlation between polishing parameters and electrochemical signals. The behavior of copper in various solutions illustrates the capabilities of this technique and highlights the complexities of the <b>metal</b> <b>polishing</b> process. The influence of pH, benzotriazole, peroxide, and several slurry chemistries are examined...|$|R

50|$|After {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I in April 1917, Raimes & Company, the American agents of Franz Schulz, Jr. Co., a German company {{incorporated}} in New Jersey (in which Hoople then held 2% of the shares) that manufactured <b>metal</b> <b>polish,</b> attempted to seize the Schulz factory {{in order to preserve}} it and to allow its business to continue during the war. The owners of Franz Schulz., Jr. Co. subsequently sued Raimes & Company, for breach of contract and outstanding debts due to the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Alien Enemy Act. On May 2, 1917, just prior to his embarkation for France, Hoople transferred his property at 250 Front Street in Manhattan, that had previously belonged to his father, to his two surviving sisters, Bessie M. H. Nichols and Mary E. H. Staebler. In 1921 Hoople was the president of the Commonwealth Light & Power Co., with Abram Fitkin one of the directors.|$|E

50|$|Farley's Health Products Limited started life in 1857 as a baker's shop, run by Mr Samuel Farley, at 90 Cambridge Street, Plymouth. In 1862 he {{transferred}} premises to 7, Exeter Street and in 1912 Edwin Farley sold the business, including the secret formula for Farley's rusks to Mr William Bolitho Trahair, prior to emigrating to Canada. William Trahair, a well-known Liberal, and Methodist lay-preacher marketed proprietary lines, such as Globe <b>Metal</b> <b>Polish</b> and John Master's matches, from his shop Globe Stores, 58-59 Notte Street, Plymouth. In 1915 Trahair moved the Exeter Street bakery to 14 Notte Street and in 1919 the Trahair family formed Farley's Infant Food Limited. During the 1920s, the business transferred to Woolster Street {{and gave up}} its agencies to concentrate on rusk production. A new model factory was built in 1931 at Torr Lane, Peverell, Plymouth and the Company expanded rapidly, until the Glaxo Group took over operations in 1968. In 1986 Boots The Chemist Limited bought the Farley's interest from Glaxo and operations continued at the Torr Lane site until the factory shut in 1990. It is now {{the site of a}} supermarket.|$|E
40|$|Double-stick carbon tape is {{frequently}} used in {{scanning electron microscopy}} to attach specimens to specimen holders. An excellent adhesive, double-stick carbon tape has the added advantage of being electrically conductive. However, recycling specimen holders has been problematic because carbon tape adheres tightly to the holder, making removal difficult.
