5|$|Erythranthe, the monkey-flowers and musk-flowers, is {{a diverse}} plant genus {{with at least}} 111 members (as of 2017) in the family Phrymaceae. Erythranthe was {{originally}} described as a separate genus, then generally regarded as a section within the genus <b>Mimulus,</b> and recently returned to generic rank. <b>Mimulus</b> sect. Diplacus was segregated from <b>Mimulus</b> as a separate genus at the same time. <b>Mimulus</b> remains as a small genus of eastern North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Molecular data show Erythranthe and Diplacus to be distinct evolutionary lines that are distinct from <b>Mimulus</b> as strictly defined.|$|E
5|$|This {{meets the}} birds' high energy requirements, the most {{important}} determinants of flower choice. In <b>Mimulus,</b> an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of <b>Mimulus</b> cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In Penstemon, flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as Heliconia angusta appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by Trigona stingless bees. These bees are largely pollen robbers in this case, but may also serve as pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, <b>Mimulus</b> lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed an ability to digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E

500|$|The French {{botanist}} Édouard Spach established Erythranthe as {{a separate}} genus with just the type species [...] Erythranthe cardinalis. In 1885, American botanist Edward Lee Greene classified Erythranthe as a section of <b>Mimulus</b> while adding E. lewisii and E. parishii. In the 2012 restructuring of <b>Mimulus</b> by Barker et al., based largely upon DNA evidence, seven species were left in <b>Mimulus</b> as strictly defined; Erythranthe was greatly enlarged to include 111 species, based upon axile placentation and long pedicels, 46 placed into Diplacus (species with parietal placentation and sessile flowers), two placed in Uvedalia, and one each placed in Elacholoma, Mimetanthe, and Thyridia.

500|$|The {{derivation}} of Erythranthe is from Greek ἐρυθρός ("erythros"), red, with ἄνθος ("anthos"), flower. They {{are called}} monkey-flowers because some species have flowers {{shaped like a}} monkey's face. The widely used generic name, Latin mimus meaning [...] "mimic actor", from the Greek mimos meaning [...] "imitator" [...] also alludes to the fancied monkey resemblance. The stem of Erythranthe can be either smooth or hairy, and this is known in a few species to be a trait determined by a simple allelic difference. [...] At least E. lewisii is known to possess [...] "flypaper-type" [...] traps and is apparently protocarnivorous, supplementing its nutrients with small insects. Variations in color largely reflect concentrations of anthocyanins. The species that are subshrubs with woody stems were originally placed in the section Diplacus, and this was subsequently made a separate genus. Diplacus is clearly derived from within <b>Mimulus,</b> broadly defined, and was not usually {{considered to be a}} separate genus.|$|E
500|$|The {{landscape}} in Shetland {{is marked by}} the grazing of sheep and the harsh conditions have limited {{the total number of}} plant species to about 400.

[...] The flora is dominated by Arctic-alpine plants, wild flowers, moss and lichen. Spring squill, buck's-horn plantain, Scots lovage, roseroot and sea campion are abundant, especially in sheltered places.

60|$|A {{few other}} cases not {{included}} in the above three lists deserve notice. In all three pots of Viola tricolor, naturally crossed plants the offspring of crossed plants flowered before naturally crossed plants the offspring of self-fertilised plants. Flowers on two plants, both of self-fertilised parentage, of the sixth generation of <b>Mimulus</b> luteus were intercrossed, and other flowers on the same plants were fertilised with their own pollen; intercrossed seedlings and seedlings of the seventh self-fertilised generation were thus raised, and the latter flowered before the intercrossed in three out of the five pots. Flowers on a plant both of <b>Mimulus</b> luteus and of Ipomoea purpurea were crossed with pollen from other flowers on the same plant, and other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen; intercrossed seedlings of this peculiar kind, and others strictly self-fertilised being thus raised. In the case of the <b>Mimulus</b> the self-fertilised plants flowered first in seven out of the eight pots, {{and in the case of}} the Ipomoea in eight out of the ten pots; so that an intercross between the flowers on the same plant was very far from giving to the offspring thus raised, any advantage over the strictly self-fertilised plants in their period of flowering.|$|E

60|$|The {{constitutional}} {{superiority of}} the crossed over the self-fertilised plants was proved in another way in the third generation of <b>Mimulus,</b> by self-fertilised seeds being sown {{on one side of}} a pot, and after a certain interval of time crossed seeds on the opposite side. The self-fertilised seedlings thus had (for I ascertained that the seeds germinated simultaneously) a clear advantage over the crossed in the start for the race. Nevertheless they were easily beaten (as may be seen under the head of <b>Mimulus)</b> when the crossed seeds were sown two whole days after the self-fertilised. But when the interval was four days, the two lots were nearly equal throughout life. Even in this latter case the crossed plants still possessed an inherent advantage, for after both lots had grown to their full height they were cut down, and without being disturbed were transferred to a larger pot, and when in the ensuing year they had again grown to their full height they were measured; and now the tallest crossed plants were to the tallest self-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 75, and in fertility (i.e., by weight of seeds produced by an equal number of capsules from both lots) as 100 to 34.|$|E
60|$|This variety {{presents}} a strikingly analogous case {{to that of}} the plant called the Hero, which appeared in the sixth self-fertilised generation of Ipomoea. If the seeds produced by Hero had been as greatly in excess of those produced by the other plants, {{as was the case with}} <b>Mimulus,</b> and if all the seeds had been mingled together, the offspring of Hero would have increased to the entire exclusion of the ordinary plants in the later self-fertilised generations, and from naturally growing taller would have exceeded the crossed plants in height in each succeeding generation.|$|E
60|$|Some {{flowers of}} the <b>Mimulus</b> luteus were fertilised {{with their own}} pollen, and others were crossed with pollen from {{distinct}} plants growing in the same pot. The seeds were thickly sown {{on opposite sides of}} a pot. The seedlings were at first equal in height; but when the young crossed plants were half an inch, the self-fertilised plants were only a quarter of an inch high. But this degree of inequality did not last, for, when the crossed plants were four and a half inches high, the self-fertilised were three inches, and they retained the same relative difference till their growth was complete. The crossed plants looked far more vigorous than the uncrossed, and flowered before them; they produced also a far greater number of capsules. As in the former case, the experiment was repeated during several succeeding generations. Had I not watched these plants of <b>Mimulus</b> and Ipomoea during their whole growth, I could not have believed it possible, that a difference apparently so slight as that of the pollen being taken from the same flower, or from a distinct plant growing in the same pot, could have made so wonderful a difference in the growth and vigour of the plants thus produced. This, under a physiological point of view, is a most remarkable phenomenon.|$|E
60|$|The most {{important}} of all the experiments on <b>Mimulus</b> are those in which flowers on plants of the eighth self-fertilised generation were again self-fertilised; other flowers on distinct plants of the same lot were intercrossed; and others were crossed with a new stock of plants from Chelsea. The Chelsea-crossed seedlings were to the intercrossed in height as 100 to 56, and in fertility as 100 to 4; and they were to the self-fertilised plants, in height as 100 to 52, and in fertility as 100 to 3. These Chelsea-crossed plants were also much more hardy than the plants of the other two lots; so that altogether the gain from the cross with a fresh stock was wonderfully great.|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the innate {{fertility}} of the plants of crossed and self-fertilised parentage, given in the previous Table 9/D--that is, the number of seeds produced by both lots when their flowers were fertilised in the same manner,--nearly the same remarks are applicable, {{in reference to the}} absence of any close correspondence between their fertility and powers of growth, {{as in the case of}} the plants in the Tables 9/F and 9/G, just considered. Thus the crossed and self-fertilised plants of Ipomoea, Papaver, Reseda odorata, and Limnanthes were almost equally fertile, yet the former exceeded considerably in height the self-fertilised plants. On the other hand, the crossed and self-fertilised plants of <b>Mimulus</b> and Primula differed to an extreme degree in innate fertility, but by no means to a corresponding degree in height or vigour.|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} from these several statements that insects strictly confine their visits to the same species. They often visit other species when only a few plants {{of the same kind}} grow near together. In a flower-garden containing some plants of Oenothera, the pollen of which can easily be recognised, I found not only single grains but masses of it within many flowers of <b>Mimulus,</b> Digitalis, Antirrhinum, and Linaria. Other kinds of pollen were likewise detected in these same flowers. A large number of the stigmas of a plant of Thyme, in which the anthers were completely aborted, were examined; and these stigmas, though scarcely larger than a split needle, were covered not only with pollen of Thyme brought from other plants by the bees, but with several other kinds of pollen.|$|E
60|$|It {{should be}} remembered that {{in two of the}} cases in which highly {{self-fertile}} varieties appeared amongst my experimental plants, namely, with <b>Mimulus</b> and Nicotiana, such varieties were greatly benefited by a cross with a fresh stock or with a slightly different variety; and this likewise {{was the case with the}} cultivated varieties of Pisum sativum and Lathyrus odoratus, which have been long propagated by self-fertilisation. Therefore until the contrary is distinctly proved, I must believe that as a general rule small and inconspicuous flowers are occasionally intercrossed by insects; and that after long-continued self-fertilisation, if they are crossed with pollen brought from a plant growing under somewhat different conditions, or descended from one thus growing, their offspring would profit greatly. It cannot be admitted, under our present state of knowledge, that self-fertilisation continued during many successive generations is ever the most beneficial method of reproduction.|$|E
