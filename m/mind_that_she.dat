25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{went on to}} earn her Juris Doctor (J.D.) {{degree from}} Harvard Law School in 1988. By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her {{confidence}} had grown; [...] "This time around, {{there was no doubt}} in her <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had earned her place". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law, of whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton, believing that she concluded she could be [...] "both brilliant and black." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{understood}} that {{as she was}} growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to attempt something different, she wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to dictate what could be popular in the music world. The singer had certain personal matters on her <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thought could be the musical direction of the album. For the title track, Madonna chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public. She perused of her personal journals and diaries, and began considering options. She recalled, [...] "What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life." ...|$|E

60|$|Captain Smith was <b>minded</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{should be}} satisfied, {{so far as}} her curiosity was concerned, for when the dinner {{had come to an}} end, and I had given this king's {{daughter}} some dry, sweet grass on which to wipe her hands and mouth, he conducted her around the village, allowing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> look in upon the tents and houses at her pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Prendergast gave a smile such as {{was only}} evoked by his late rector's little daughter, and answered, 'No {{one can be}} more {{concerned}} than I. She was not in her place here, that was certain, and I ought to have <b>minded</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not thrust into temptation. I shall remember it with shame to my dying day.' ...|$|R
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thought could be the musical direction of the album. But she understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to try something different, Madonna wanted {{the sound of her}} new album to indicate what could be popular in music. However, being raised as a Catholic, Madonna felt guilty about the failure of her marriage. She said, [...] "Because in Catholicism you are a born sinner and you are a sinner all your life. ... I could not escape my past, nor could I relax". Saddened by what was happening with her, Madonna missed her family, her father and her siblings. She confessed to Becky Johnston for Interview magazine: ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track {{was going on at}} Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard had to pick up his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like as if I was my mother and [...] was me. We were playing in our backyard again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E

She had certain personal matters on her <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thought could be the musical direction of the album. While writing the songs for Like a Prayer, Madonna also acted in a Broadway production called Speed-the-Plow. In the play, she portrayed Karen, a secretary to a movie producer who bedded her on a bet with his friends. Karen later gets revenge, but is depicted as just as seedy and conniving as {{the men who had}} partaken in this bet and exploited her. Madonna was frustrated with the role and the negative reception, which she vented into her lyrics. The result was a set of three songs—"Till Death Do Us Part", [...] "Promise to Try" [...] and [...] "Oh Father"—where she sought to purge herself from her personal paranoia and demons. Written with producer Patrick Leonard, in [...] "Oh Father" [...] the singer wanted to revisit the pain and confusion that had characterized her relationship with her father. Generally accepted by critics and academics as a love letter to Tony Ciccone or as an indictment, Madonna never divulged her inspiration behind [...] "Oh Father", except saying that the song was about her father and a tribute to Simon & Garfunkel, her favorite band at that time. She added, [...] " [...] is what the listener thinks it is, all open to interpretation. I just wrote the song, it's up to others to interpret them to mean what they want them to mean." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 13 January 2012, Chris Evans began {{negotiations}} {{to star in}} the film adaptation, and was later confirmed as the film's male lead. On 17 January 2012, Tilda Swinton and Jamie Bell were confirmed to be in talks to join the project. Swinton first met Bong at the Cannes Film Festival, where she was of the <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{did not want to}} make any other films, a decision she takes after each film: [...] "And that one (and only) condition in which I will make another film is that I will have some fun. So we started to play with the idea of what would amuse us about this." [...] Bong and Swinton experimented with voices, mannerisms and the general appearance of the character of Mason. On 18 January 2012, John Hurt was confirmed to have been cast, with Hurt stating, [...] "All the film crew refer to , with great reverence, as 'Director Bong'. I love the fact that I am working for Director Bong." [...] On 2 February 2012, Octavia Spencer had joined the cast of Bong's project in the role of a [...] "passenger on the train who joins the revolt in order to save her son." [...] Ed Harris spoke of his love of Bong Joon-ho's films and wanted to work with him, [...] "I want to do this. I don't care what he's asking me to do because he's a really great filmmaker." [...] On 27 February 2012, Ewen Bremner had joined the cast of Bong's film. On 3 April 2012, Luke Pasqualino was confirmed to have joined the cast.|$|E

Do what you like with her husband; I don't care; he's a brute, and I hate him. But there's one thing I insist on--I won't have Miss Regina frightened or annoyed; <b>mind</b> <b>that!</b> <b>She's</b> a good creature.
