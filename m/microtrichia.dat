25|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate and the cuticle may be thicker and more heavily sclerotized. Within each of the major veins is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings. Also, the wing lumen, being {{an extension of the}} hemocoel, contains the tracheae, nerves, and hemolymph.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways insects can be fossilized and preserved including compressions and impressions, concretions, mineral replication, charcoalified (fusainized) remains, and their trace remains. Compressions and Impressions are the most extensive types of insect fossils, occurring in rocks from the Carboniferous to Recent. Impressions are like a cast or mold of a fossil insect, showing its form and even some relief, like pleating in the wings, but usually little or no color from the cuticle. Compressions preserve remains of the cuticle, so color distinguishes structure. In exceptional situations, microscopic features such as <b>microtrichia</b> on sclerites and wing membranes are even visible, but preservation of this scale also requires a matrix of exceptionally fine grain, such as in micritic muds and volcanic tuffs. Because arthropod sclerites are held together by membranes, which readily decompose, many fossil arthropods are known only by isolated sclerites. Far more desirable are complete fossils. Concretions are stones with a fossil at the core whose chemical composition {{differs from that of}} the surrounding matrix, usually formed as a result of mineral precipitation from decaying organisms. The most significant deposit consists of various localities of the Late Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation at Mazon Creek, Illinois, which are composed of shales and coal seams yielding oblong concretions. Within most concretions is a mold of an animal and sometimes a plant that is usually marine in origin.|$|E

50|$|Although N. glauca {{live in the}} water, they breathe {{atmosphere}} air and do {{not have}} gills. When these insects are diving or resting under the water surface, they create a film of air that surrounds their body. This air film is also known as a superhydrophobic coating or surface, and it prevents the insect from becoming wet. It also reduces the drag (physics) that is created when diving. To be able to create this air film around it, N. glauca is covered in hairy structures, except on its head and legs. There are two types of hairs and air retention is maximized by having both types: setae and <b>microtrichia.</b> The most important part in creating an air film is the density of the hairs. Notonecta glauca has dense <b>microtrichia</b> and their air film can last up to 120 days. The air film cannot last forever because as an insect respires (breathes), the oxygen partial pressure will decrease and nitrogen partial pressure will increase, causing the air bubble to decrease in size.|$|E

50|$|The Salvinia effect {{describes}} the permanent stabilization {{of an air}} layer upon a hierarchically structured surface submerged in water. Based on biological models (e.g. the floating ferns Salvinia, backswimmer Notonecta), biomimetic Salvinia-surfaces are used as drag reducing coatings (up to 30% reduction were previously measured on the first prototypes. When applied to a ship hull, the coating would allow the boat to float on an air-layer; reducing energy consumption and emissions. Such surfaces require an extremely water repellent super-hydrophobic surface and an elastic hairy structure in the millimeter range to entrap air while submerged. The Salvinia effect was discovered by the biologist and botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (University of Bonn) and his colleagues and has been investigated on several plants and animals since 2002. Publications and patents were published between 2006 and 2016. The best biological models are the floating ferns (Salvinia) with highly sophisticated hierarchically structured hairy surfaces, and the back swimmers (e.g.Notonecta) with a complex double structure of hairs (setae) and microvilli (<b>microtrichia).</b> Three of the ten known Salvinia species show a paradoxical chemical heterogenity: hydrophilic hair tips, {{in addition to the}} super-hydrophobic plant surface, further stabilizing the air layer.|$|E

Basal, medial, and apical whorls of hairs occur on the antennal segments. In some species, whorls of loop-shaped sensory filaments are also found, the basal or medial one sometimes being reduced. Some gall flies have only one (basal) whorl of hairs on the antennal segments, and the sensoria (transparent sensory appendages) differ in size and shape.
