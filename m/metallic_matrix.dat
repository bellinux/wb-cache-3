50|$|Conventional Sintering is the {{simplest}} method for producing CNT {{metal matrix composite}} compacts.The CNTs and metal powders are mixed by a process of mechanical alloying/blending and then are compressed to form a green compact, which is then sintered to get the final product. Metallic compacts are subject to oxidation as compared to ceramics and hence the sintering {{has to be done}} in an inert atmosphere or under vacuum. One major drawback of this processing route is the inability to tailor the CNT distribution within the <b>metallic</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|E

50|$|Exploration diamond {{drilling}} differs from other geological drilling (see Drilling rig) in that a solid core is extracted from depth, for examination on the surface. The key {{technology of the}} diamond drill is the actual diamond bit itself. It is composed of industrial diamonds set into a soft <b>metallic</b> <b>matrix.</b> As shown in the figure, the diamonds are scattered throughout the matrix, and the action relies on the matrix to slowly wear during the drilling, so as to expose more diamonds. The bit is mounted onto a drill stem, which is connected to a rotary drill. Water is injected into the drill pipe, so as to wash out the rock cuttings produced by the bit and also to reduce the heat produced due to friction which causes less wear and tear of the bits. An actual diamond bit is a complex affair, usually designed for a specific rock type, with many channels for washing.|$|E
50|$|The EN plating of {{metallic}} nickel from {{aqueous solution}} {{in the presence}} of hypophosphite was first noted as a chemical accident by Wurtz in 1844. In 1911, Roux reported that metal was inevitably precipitated in the powder form; however these works were not in practical applications. In its early stage, progress in the field remained slow until World War II. In 1946, Brenner and Riddell developed a process for plating the inner walls of tubes with nickel-tungsten alloy, derived from the citrate based bath using an insoluble anode, which brought out the unusual reducing properties of hypophosphite. The U.S. Patent Office says that the patent it issued in 1950 differed from the earlier patent in that Roux reaction was spontaneous and complete, while the Brenner and Riddell process was a controlled catalytic process so that deposition occurred only on catalytic surfaces immersed in the bath. Brenner later wrote that his patent was an accidental discovery similar to the work of Wurtz and Roux, but said that he took out a patent to protect U.S. government rights. In fact, a declassified U.S. Army technical report written in 1963 goes on extensively about Wurtz and Roux work, and gives more of the discovery credit to them than to Brenner. This plating process was attributed to the action of chemical reduction of Ni ions. During the 1954-59 period, Gutzeit at GATC (General American Transportation Corporation) worked on full scale development of electroless plating by chemical reduction alone, as an alternate process to conventional electroplating. Initially, the co-deposition of particles was carried out for electrodepositing Ni-Cr by Odekerken, during the year of 1966. In that study, in an intermediate layer, finely powdered particles like aluminum oxide, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin were distributed within a <b>metallic</b> <b>matrix.</b> A layer in the coating is composite but other parts of the coating are not. The first commercial application of their work used the electroless Ni-SiC coatings on the wankel internal combustion engine and another commercial composite incorporating polytetrafluoroethylene (Ni-P-PTFE) was co-deposited, during the year of 1981. However, the co-deposition of diamond and PTFE particles was more difficult than that of composites incorporating Al2O3 or SiC. The feasibility to incorporate the fine second phase particles, in submicron to nano size, within a metal/alloy matrix has initiated a new generation of composite coatings.|$|E

40|$|Aluminium is very {{interesting}} from a technological point of view because its density is 2. 7 g/cm 3, {{one of the lowest}} values amongst metals. The main drawback of pure aluminium is its poor mechanical resistance. In order to improve it, two different ways have been explored: 1 : alloying it with magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, silicon and 2 : using <b>metallic</b> <b>matrix</b> composites: the composites have both fibres and other particles that strengthen the continuous phase of the <b>metallic</b> <b>matrix.</b> In this sense, <b>metallic</b> <b>matrix</b> composites reinforced with particles such as silicon carbide, alumina, intermetallics (mainly Nickel and Copper) and other materials, have been widely reported.

40|$|The {{mesoscopic}} Kondo {{effect in}} metallic nanoparticles containing a magnetic impurity is investigated by model calculations. A Maxwell–Garnett approach {{is used to}} approximately determine the resistivity of doped nanoparticles in a matrix, and the magnetic susceptibility is estimated from the confinement of the conduction electrons. Conductivity measurements of nanoparticles embedded in a matrix are difficult to realize, because <b>metallic</b> <b>matrices</b> distort the Kondo cloud, whereas insulating or semiconducting matrices yield a very weak signal. By comparison, susceptibility measurements do not suffer from these shortcomings. The Kondo effect survives in nanoparticles even if the cluster size is {{much smaller than the}} Kondo screening cloud, but the effective Curie constant becomes constant below a particle-size dependent transition temperature and the temperature dependence of the susceptibility is no longer universal...|$|R
50|$|Hydrides in the {{transition}} metals and lanthanides are also typically polymeric covalent hydrides. However, they usually possess only weak degrees of ionic character. Usually, these hydrides rapidly decompose into their component elements at ambient conditions.

Such a solid {{can be thought of}} as a solid solution and is alternately termed a metallic- or interstitial hydride. These decomposed solids are identifiable by their ability to conduct electricity and their magnetic properties (the presence of hydrogen is coupled with the delocalisation of the valence electrons of the metal), and their lowered density compared to the metal.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of dry particle coating on {{the properties of}} coatings produced by d. c. arc plasma spraying is reported. A mechanofusion process is used to coat coarser metallic particles with fine ceramic particles without using either binders or solvents. The key parameters affecting the mechanofusion process and the corresponding plasma spraying method have been varied {{in order to increase}} the hardness of the resulting composite coatings.
