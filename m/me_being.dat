We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For <b>me</b> <b>being</b> such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
25|$|Meir {{stated in}} the 1975 edition of her {{autobiography}} My Life that “It {{is not only a}} matter, I believe, of religious observance and practice. To <b>me,</b> <b>being</b> Jewish means and has always meant being proud {{to be part of a}} people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.” Meir strongly identified with Judaism culturally, but when it came to her religious beliefs she was an atheist.|$|E

Keenan stated of the minitour: [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>being</b> on stage with King Crimson is like Lenny Kravitz playing with Led Zeppelin, or Britney Spears onstage with Debbie Gibson." ...|$|E

In Lennon's last published interview, he said: [...] "This image of <b>me</b> <b>being</b> an orphan is garbage, because I was well protected by my auntie and uncle [...] and they looked after me very well, thanks".|$|E
500|$|According to Jayson Rodriguez of MTV, {{the video}} is [...] "a mix of goth bondage-esque voyeurism, {{complete}} with Rihanna's gyrating moves and a raging band that features Travis Barker on the drums." [...] Shortly after the video was released, Slash {{said that he was}} [...] "flattered" [...] that Rihanna had impersonated him in the video, saying [...] "The video is way better with her being me than with <b>me</b> <b>being</b> me...all things considered, it brings an element of sexuality to it that I probably wouldn't have been capable of.

500|$|Bassist Mark Hoppus penned [...] "Adam's Song" [...] to vent these {{frustrations and}} the {{loneliness}} he experienced on the tour; {{while the other}} members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single.

[...] "You hang out with all your bros and it's a great time and everything, but everybody wants {{to come home and}} have a girlfriend. And every time we'd fly home, Tom and [...] Scott [...] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport, and I didn't.

500|$|Mark {{struggles with}} {{balancing}} {{his career and}} personal life and McGregor told Nate Micó from SX News {{that he would like}} to see Mark either grow in his job or get [...] "tempted by the wrong side of the law" [...] in the future. Mark manages to develop friendships with some of the other male characters, like Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Of this, McGregor said [...] "Even though we're friends there are always references to <b>me</b> <b>being</b> a cop and they're always quite wary." [...] When Mark becomes involved in an illegal street racing investigation, he expresses an interest in buying a motorbike.

500|$|In native Sweden, [...] "Dressed for Success" [...] and [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] {{were chosen}} as the first two singles from their second album Look Sharp!, as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to {{highlight}} Fredriksson's singing. Gessle said, [...] "I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang. <b>Me</b> <b>being</b> a lead singer wasn't part of the plan, not for me anyway." [...] Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart, while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No.1 position for 14 weeks. Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: [...] "To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle's once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense." [...] But the album won Roxette their first Rockbjörnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer.|$|E
500|$|Following his death, Watts' mother {{moved the}} family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts' {{maternal}} grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, <b>me</b> <b>being</b> an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame.|$|E
50|$|All Me was {{the lead}} single of the album. It was noticed that this song was the only dance beat tune in the entire album. The sound and beat of the track was {{compared}} to 2NE1's hit, Fire.

500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves <b>me</b> <b>being</b> at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland.

500|$|On {{the vinyl}} and {{cassette}} pressings of Illmatic, Nas replaces the traditional Side A and Side B division with [...] "40th Side North" [...] and “41st Side South,” respectively – the main streets {{that form the}} geographic boundaries that divide the Queensbridge housing projects. Professor Sohail Daulatzai views this labeling as significant, since it transforms Illmatic into [...] "a sonic map." [...] The album serves as the legend for Nas’s ghetto cartography, as he narrates his experiences and {{those who live in}} the Queensbridge” [...] In a 2009 interview with XXL, Nas discussed the purpose behind the album artwork among other promotional efforts, stating [...] "Really the record had to represent everything Nasir Jones is about from beginning to end, from my album cover to my videos. My record company had to beg me to stop filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about I had 'em out there. That's {{what it was all about}} for <b>me,</b> <b>being</b> that kid from the projects, being a poster child for that, that didn’t exist back then." ...|$|E

Trainor told [...] MTV News, [...] "Here's <b>me</b> <b>being</b> sassy {{and other people}} dancing with me and having just {{a good time and}} trying to get through this feeling of, Ugh he's cheating on me again". The video was commissioned by information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard. It features several [...] "influencers"—actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. The influencers featured in the video include set designer Bri Emery; actors Marcus Johns, Cody Johns, and Robby Ayala; YouTube star Liza Koshy; dancers Les Twins; Spanish stylist Sara Escudero; hair stylist Kristin Ess; Japanese nail artist Mei Kawajiri; American dancer Chachi Gonzales; and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which was used as the video's theme. Trainor's team asked the ad agency 180LA to make the music video similar to [...] "All About That Bass" [...] and not stray too far from it.|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night.

[...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and <b>me</b> <b>being</b> able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me".

500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] is an uptempo electro house, dancehall and Europop {{song with}} R influences. According to James Dean Wells from AOL Radio, {{the song is}} [...] " [...] pulsing synths that build under Benassi and Brown's staccato and auto-tuned melodies." [...] "Beautiful People" [...] is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of Eb major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5. The song is positive and uplifting with lyrics such as: [...] "Everywhere that I've been / The only thing that I see is beautiful people ... / Don't you know / Don't you know / You're beautiful." [...] According to Rap-Up, on the song, Brown encourages [...] "everyone {{on the dance floor}} to keep their heads up and discover the beauty inside." [...] When speaking about [...] "Beautiful People", Brown told Jayson Rodriguez from MTV News that [...] "it wasn't a selfish record, it wasn't me bragging or boasting or talking about cars or money or girls. It was <b>me</b> <b>being</b> able to inspire people with dance music. We have a lot of tragic things going on and the world needs to come together as a whole and stop the negativity." ...|$|E

[...] "The really left-of-center artists, you really wonder about them. Can the world catch up? Can the culture meet them in the middle? That’s what the adventure is. It doesn’t always happen, but it should and it could." [...] Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, states, [...] "You've got to bend culture around to suit you, and I think M.I.A has done that" [...] adding that M.I.A.'s composition and production skills were a major attraction for him. As a vocalist, M.I.A. is recognisable by her distinctive whooping, chanting voice, which {{has been described as}} having an [...] "indelible, nursery-rhyme swing." [...] She has adopted different singing styles on her songs, from aggressive raps, to semi-spoken and melodic vocals. She has said of the sometimes [...] "unaffected" [...] vocals and delivery of her lyrics, [...] "It is what it is. Most people would just put it down to <b>me</b> <b>being</b> lazy.
