40|$|Intact {{methionine}} residues in proteins were {{rapidly and}} precisely determined by measuring <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> released during the reaction with CNBr and separated by g. l. c. Conditions for the reaction and for chromatography on columns of Porapak P-S are described. The recovery of <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> from several methionine derivatives and analogues were examined. Carbamoylmethionine was adopted as a stable primary standard and ethyl thiocyanate as internal standard. The measured methionine content of several isolated proteins {{was close to}} the theoretical value indicated by previous work and the results for these and a range of food proteins agreed well with results obtained by ion-exchange chromatography after performic acid oxidation. Since CNBr does not react with methionine sulphoxide and a preliminary hydrolysis is not required, the method discriminates between methionine and any methionine sulphoxide that may be present. It could be useful in studies on the nutritional availability of methionine in processed foods...|$|E
40|$|Soil and {{rhizosphere}} bacteria {{produce an}} array of secondary metabolites including {{a wide range of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds {{play an important role in}} the long-distance interactions and communication between (micro) organisms. Furthermore, bacterial VOCs are involved in plant pathogens inhibition and induction of soil fungistasis and suppressivenes. In the present study, we analysed the volatile blend emitted by the rhizospheric isolate Pseudomonas donghuensis P 482 and evaluated the volatile effect on the plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria as well as one oomycete. Moreover, we investigated the role of the GacS/GacA system on VOCs production in P. donghuensis P 482. The results obtained demonstrated that VOCs emitted by P. donghuensis P 482 have strong antifungal and antioomycete, but not antibacterial activity. The production of certain volatiles such as dimethyl sulfide, S-methyl thioacetate, <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> dimethyl trisulfide, 1 -undecan and HCN is depended on the GacS/GacA two-component regulatory system. Apparently, these compounds play an important role in the pathogens suppression as the gacA mutant entirely lost the ability to inhibit via volatiles the growth of tested plant pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Two chemotaxis-defective mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, {{designated}} PC 1 and PC 2, {{were selected}} by the swarm plate method after N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. These mutants were fully motile but incapable of swarming, suggesting {{that they had a}} defect in the intracellular signalling pathway. Computer-assisted capillary assays confirmed that they failed to show behavioral responses to chemical stimuli, including peptone, <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> and phosphate. Two chemotaxis genes were cloned by phenotypic complementation of PC 1 and PC 2. From nucleotide sequence analysis, one gene was found to encode a putative polypeptide that was homologous to the enteric CheZ protein, while the other gene was cheY, which had been previously reported (M. N. Starnbach and S. Lory, Mol. Microbiol. 6 : 459 - 469, 1992). Deletion and complementation analysis showed that PC 1 was a cheY mutant, whereas PC 2 had a double mutation in the cheY and cheZ genes. A chromosomal cheZ mutant, constructed by inserting a kanamycin resistance gene cassette into the wild-type gene, changed its swimming direction much more frequently than did wild-type strain PAO 1. In contrast, cheY mutants were found to rarely reverse their swimming directions...|$|E
40|$|The {{responses}} of olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) antennal and palpal olfactory receptors to odors emitted by Pseudomonas putida bacterial filtrate and to volatiles from a host plant were evaluated using electrophysiological and behavioral bioassays. Morphological identification of olfactory receptors was also performed. The third antennal segment (flagellum) bears {{four types of}} multiporous sensilla: trichoid, short basiconica, clavate and grooved. Maxillary palps have mechanosensory bristles and multiporous basiconica sensilla. In wind-tunnel bioassays, olive fly responses to volatiles emitted by bacterial filtrate were higher than those to culture medium. Bacterial filtrate was more attractive than ammonium carbonate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetic acid in ethanol. GC–MS of bacterial filtrate identified some of the chemicals produced by bacterial activity, including methyl thiolacetate, ammonia, 2 -pentanone, 2 - heptanone, ethyl tiglate and <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate.</b> Electrophysiological investigations proved that antennal sensilla are responsive to bacterial filtrate odor, methyl thiolacetate, olive leaves and olives, {{as well as to}} a-pinene, while acetic acid elicited an inhibitory response. Electropalpgrams recorded a specific response to bacterial filtrate by mated males and females, as well as a dose-dependent response relationship to methyl thiolacetate by mated females. The identification of new active volatile compounds in the semiochemical system of the olive fly is promising for the development of innovative control strategies in areawide management...|$|E
40|$|Research on new {{pesticides}} {{based on}} plant extracts, {{aimed at the}} development of nontoxic formulates, has recently gained increased interest. This study investigated {{the use of the}} volatilome of rucola (Eruca sativa) as a powerful natural nematicidal agent against the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Analysis of the composition of the volatilome, using GC-MS-SPME, showed that the compound (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate was the most abundant, followed by (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and erucin, with relative percentages of 22. 7 ± 1. 6, 15. 9 ± 2. 3, and 8. 6 ± 1. 3, respectively. Testing of the nematicidal activity of rucola volatile compounds revealed that erucin, pentyl isothiocyanate, hexyl isothiocyanate, (E) - 2 -hexenal, 2 -ethylfuran, and <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> were the most active with EC 50 values of 3. 2 ± 1. 7, 11. 1 ± 5. 0, 11. 3 ± 2. 6, 15. 0 ± 3. 3, 16. 0 ± 5. 0, and 18. 1 ± 0. 6 mg/L, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. Moreover, the nematicidal activity of fresh rucola used as soil amendant in a containerized culture of tomato decreased the nematode infection in a dose-response manner (EC 50 = 20. 03 mg/g) and plant growth was improved. On the basis of these results, E. sativa can be considered as a promising companion plant in intercropping strategies for tomato growers to control root-knot nematode...|$|E
40|$|PMID: 16013377 Volatile {{compounds}} {{produced in}} cheese by five Pseudomonas fragi strains isolated from 1 -day-old raw milk cheeses were investigated. Each strain was {{representative of a}} different biochemical group of isolates of identical phenotypic characteristics, according to identification with API 20 NE strips. The five strains were ascribed to the species P. fragi after 16 S rRNA sequencing because of their high degree of coincidence with P. fragi ATCC 4973. In each of two experiments, carried out on different days, five cheeses were made at laboratory scale from pasteurized milk separately inoculated with approximately 105 CFU/ml of each P. fragi strain. After 12 days at 10 °C, mean counts of P. fragi strains were close to 1010 CFU/g in the outer part of cheeses and close to 108 CFU/g in the inner part. A total of 131 volatile compounds, 49 of which were further characterized, were identified in cheeses by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry after extraction with a purge and trap apparatus. Abundances of compounds were generally higher in the outer part of cheeses. Production of volatile compounds was clearly strain dependent. Only two strains produced ethyl esters, and three produced nonethyl esters. Ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, methyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, and propyl tiglate were the major esters, and ethanol, 2 -propanol, and 3 -methyl butanol were the major alcohols. Undecene was the major hydrocarbon, dimethyl sulfide and <b>methyl</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> the major sulfur compounds, and 2 -pentanone the major ketone. Two aromatic compounds, styrene and o-dichlorobenzene, were present in all cheeses. Peer reviewe...|$|E
