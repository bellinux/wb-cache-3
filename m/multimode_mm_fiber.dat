40|$|We have numerically {{investigated}} {{the behavior of}} the LP 01 fundamental mode of a step-index, <b>multimode</b> (<b>MM)</b> <b>fiber</b> as the optical power approaches the self-focusing limit (Pcrit).

We find that at powers below Pcrit, there exist stably propagating power-dependent modifications of the LP 01 mode, in contrast to some previous solutions that exhibited large-amplitude oscillations in beam waist along the fiber. For the first time, to our knowledge, we show that in a MM fiber amplifier seeded with the low-power LP 01 eigenmode, the transverse spatial profile will adiabatically evolve through power-dependent stationary solutions as the beam is amplified toward Pcrit. In addition, for a given value of the nonlinear index, Pcrit is found to be nearly the same in the bulk material and in a step-index fiber.

40|$|As {{the optical}} power levels {{extractable}} from current single-mode (SM) fiber amplifiers are reaching regions where optical nonlinearities become significant, even under cw operation, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to develop methods for reducing these nonlinearities to further boost the amplifier performance. Here we demonstrate a simple new approach, namely the SM excitation of specially designed large-core <b>multimode</b> (<b>MM)</b> <b>fibers.</b> Cladding-pumped Er/Yb amplifier versions of such fibers allow the direct amplification of diffraction-limited optical soliton pulses with peak powers up to 12 kW, about one order of magnitude larger than possible with conventional fiber amplifiers. Under SM excitation of a <b>MM</b> mode <b>fiber,</b> the amount of power propagating in the fundamental mode as a function of fiber length decreases due to micro-bending-induced mode-coupling. The resulting M 2 -value as a function of fiber length, as calculated from mode-coupling experiments, in various 50 µm-core diameter fibers is shown in Fig. 1. The excitation wave-length was 1. 55 µm. In this fiber # 1 was made by the rod-in-tube technique, whereas fibers # 2 and # 3 where made using modified chemical-vapor deposition. The low-micro-bending fiber # 3 indeed allows to obtain an M 2 -value < 1. 2 for fiber lengths up to 10 m, allowing for essentially diffraction-limited amplification in cladding-pumped Er/Yb amplifiers, which typically vary in length between 1 - 10 m. The fundamental mode is launched in these <b>MM</b> <b>fibers</b> with high accuracy by suppressing modal speckle by using broad-bandwidth excitation sources such as ultrashort pulses. As the temporal coherence length of broad-bandwidth sources is very short, temporal interference between the modes and thus the presence of speckle is prevented. The stability of the spatial beam profile was verified by coupling the output of a <b>MM</b> <b>fiber</b> into a SM dummy fiber and measuring the launched signal power as a function of time. The result for both single-frequency (SF) excitation and broad-band excitation of the <b>MM</b> <b>fiber</b> is shown in Fig. 2. The large random power fluctuations due to modal speckle for the case of SF excitation are clearly visible, whereas the power fluctuations for broad-band excitation are about a factor of 5 smaller. Figure 3 shows the autocorrelation and the spectrum of 340 fs pulses directly amplified to a peak power of 12 kW in a 1. 5 m length of 30 -µm-core diameter cladding-pumped Er/Yb amplifier fiber. The pulses had an energy of 4 nJ and were near-transform-limited with a time-bandwidth-product of 0. 29. The autocorrelation is displayed on a logarithmic scale to demonstrate the absence of a pedestal. Secondary autocorrelation peaks due to small residual excitation of higher-order modes are suppressed to better than 0. 5 %. Pulses amplified to similar peak powers in such Er/Yb fibers have recently also been frequency-doubled to generate 300 femtosecond pulses with peak powers of 25 kW and a record average power of 300 mW at 780 nm. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique for greatly expanding the operation limits of fiber lasers. The very large-core, low micro-bending fiber amplifiers discussed here should allow {{the construction of a new}} generation of ultrahigh-power fiber laser systems...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of ramie}} fibers as {{reinforcement}} in hybrid composites is justified considering their satisfactory mechanical properties {{if compared with}} other natural fibers. This study aims to verify changes in chemical composition and thermal stability of the ramie fibers after washing with distilled water. One additional goal is to study glass fiber and washed ramie fiber composites focusing {{on the effect of}} varying both the fiber length (25, 35, 45 and 55 <b>mm)</b> and the <b>fiber</b> composition. The overall fiber loading was maintained constant (21 vol. %). Based on the results obtained, the washed ramie fiber may be considered as an alternative for the production of these composites. The higher flexural strength presented being observed for 45 <b>mm</b> <b>fiber</b> length composite, although this difference is not significant for lower glass fiber volume fractions: (0 : 100) and (25 : 75). Also, by increasing the relative volume fraction of glass fiber until an upper limit of 75 %, higher flexural and impact properties were obtained...|$|R
40|$|A vector dual-wavelength rectangular-shape laser (RSL) {{based on}} a long fiber taper {{deposited}} with reduced graphene oxide is proposed, where the nonlinearity is enhanced due to large evanescent-field-interacting length and strong field confinement of a 8 <b>mm</b> <b>fiber</b> taper with a waist diameter of 4 micronmeters. Graphene flakes are deposited uniformly on the taper waist with light pressure effect, so this structure guarantees both excellent saturable absorption and high nonlinearity. The RSL with a repetition rate of 7. 9 MHz exhibits fast polarization switching in two orthogonal polarization directions, and the temporal and spectral characteristics are investigated. The {{results suggest that the}} long taper-based graphene structure is an efficient choice for nonlinear devices...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} fibers {{which can be}} used for {{improving}} concrete properties. Such as steel fiber, fiber glass, banana fiber. The objective of this research is to know how Pandan leaf fibers Beach affects to the concrete strength. During the experiment 2. 5 <b>mm</b> <b>fibers</b> were mixed to the concrete mortar. The fiber length diameter was 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm. The concrete simple size is 15 cm x 15 cm x l 60 cm. The cement water factor was 0. 45 – 0, 6. The fiber volume proportion were 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, and 3 %. It was observed that those addition increase the strength by 18 %, and decrease concrete break...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an intense}} {{on-going}} search for less polluting materials and technologies, which consume little energy in their production, construction and/or utilization. Attention {{of the researchers}} has turned to materials, which found applications in engineering in pre-industrial times: local vegetable fibers and earth composites {{are one of the}} promising materials. This paper presents the results of an investigation in establishing the physical and mechanical properties of Hibiscus cannabinus fibers which have been used in the fabrication of Pressed Adobe Blocks (PABs). The PABs have been reinforced with 0. 2 – 0. 8 wt. % of 30 mm and 60 mm lengths of H. cannabinus fibers. The microstructural characteristics of the PABs composites were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and video microscopy. It was established that the addition with 0. 2 – 0. 6 wt. % of 30 <b>mm</b> long <b>fibers</b> reduced the dimensions of the pores in the PABs with the improvement of their mechanical properties. However, the addition of 0. 8 wt. % of 60 <b>mm</b> <b>fibers</b> had negative effects on the compressive strength. The elaborated Pressed Adobe Blocks specimens were suitable as building material with contribution for thermal comfort...|$|R
