Brenna, realizing that existing project <b>management</b> <b>controls</b> will delay completion, demanded elimination of all financial controls and intermediaries between Paul and himself. Paul agreed and allowed Brenna unchecked access to state finances; in the end, total cost of the Castle reached six million roubles in gold.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{characterize}} the role of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> and its potential functions from the perspective of New Public Management with regard to Polish realities.

Currently, changes in the market are seen to affect companies' internal needs to modify their <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems which different consultancy companies have recognized as well. The meaning of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design and coordination should be studied more in organizations. This study examines the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design and coordination and how they affect <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system functioning in a manufacturing company. The theoretical part adapts Tessier and Otley's (2012) research {{of the meaning of}} the design in the employee perception of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system. <b>Management</b> <b>control</b> system elements, the use of controls, and the role and objective of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> have been selected as factors affecting <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design. The coordination process of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems has been studied less and therefore Ghoshal and Nohria's (1989) theory of coordination mechanisms is used in this thesis. The focus is on the formalization of the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system and its impact on internal transparency, global transparency, flexibility and repair. This study provides insights in the relationship between <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system design and coordination and brings forward success factors and main challenges in the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems formalization. Practical constructivism was selected as an ontological approach to the study and it was conducted as a qualitative single case study. Semi-structured interview was selected as a data generation method. Research data consists of 12 interview for senior managers and other upper white collar employees in the organization. Analysis was conducted through content analysis which was directed by more abstract descriptive analysis strategy. The most remarkable findings concluded that the MCS elements design, the objective of control and the use of controls are inter-related subjects in the MCS design, and without common coordination different controls do not work together harmoniously as a package and do not support common goal achievement.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} literature on <b>management</b> <b>control</b> {{used in the}} dynamic and innovative settings of strategic capital investments (SCI). SCI {{have a significant impact}} on the long term performance of companies. Yet, they are challenging, complex and involve a high degree of uncertainty. <b>Management</b> <b>control</b> is demanding because money and resources cannot be traced to outcomes. SCI needs <b>management</b> <b>control</b> that is future oriented. Yet, Knowledge is lacking when it comes to the specifics of how future oriented <b>management</b> <b>control</b> can be exercised in innovative and dynamic settings. The first purpose of this paper is to review the theoretical and empirical literatures that offer the conceptual tools and the evidence of future oriented <b>management</b> <b>control</b> in companies operating in innovative settings. The second purpose is to prepare a framework to examine <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems in the innovative context of SCI in the mining industry. This literature review is an attempt to organize current work in a way useful to structure future research questions and findings. The result of the literature review shows that the extant literature is characterized by an orientation towards future oriented <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems for making SCI decisions. Further the review reveals that some future oriented control systems are more frequently advocated than others in the literature. Previous studies also show that the suitability of different appraisal tools for SCI is debatable. Because the traditional functions of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems rely on established measurable outputs, they are suggested to be less effective when considering SCI. The more advocated control systems tend to be more qualitative in nature and based on a long-term point of view. However, previous empirical studies suggest that traditional control systems still dominate in practice. Thus there is a gap between the normative <b>management</b> <b>control</b> literature and the empirical evidence in the area of SCI. Based on these findings it is concluded that there is need for more exploratory case studies able to capture intangible factors which address the different roles of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> in SCI, how <b>management</b> <b>control</b> is used and in the way that <b>management</b> <b>control</b> is used.

40|$|Studies on the <b>management</b> <b>control</b> {{system have}} evolved since its first work published. <b>Management</b> <b>control</b> {{is the process}} by which {{managers}} influence other members of the organization to implement the organization’s strategies. The guiding framework for this research is an instrument-oriented framework developed by Malmi and Brown, which represents the most intuitive and recent framework by synthesizing nearly four decades of research. To date, only one publication has used this <b>management</b> <b>control</b> system framework. This dissertation tackles different sections of the “MCS as a package” framework. Using quantitative meta-analysis, “Design parameters of the strategic planning process and organizational performance” examines empirical studies on the relationship between organizational performance and design parameters of the strategic planning process.

40|$|The need {{to focus}} and economize on scarce {{attention}} is increasingly being acknowledged within <b>management</b> accounting and <b>control</b> literature. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate how practitioners go about creating new concepts and measurements to induce attention towards new issues and as-pects of strategic importance for the organization. In this case study, we follow a project group in a Swedish municipality, creating a <b>management</b> <b>control</b> model of employee health. A close-up view is provided through a narrative approach, based on filming and participant observation, illustrating the highly situated and contextual character of atten-tion in sensemaking processes. The naming of the concepts of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> was found to be associated with a science-framing, while references to local practices of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> induced practice-framing strongly de-emphasizing characteristic features of <b>management</b> <b>control.</b> Line-managers of the study accepted the framework without demands for indica-tors or predictive models. This outcome is in line with a practice notion of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> and a language-game understanding of human communication: <b>management</b> <b>control</b> systems are part of the practices defining meaning and directing at-tention towards different aspects of any situation. Rather than being a lan-guage, <b>management</b> <b>control</b> concepts and measurement may not provide much more than the phonetics of business. Consequently, it may be ques-tioned whether what gets measured automatically gets managed. In line with the attention-based view of the firm and a practice notion of <b>management</b> <b>control,</b> this study suggests that new attention is created through the naming and framing of <b>management</b> <b>control</b> ideals, and as a result of the expressions of managerial intent through practices...|$|R
