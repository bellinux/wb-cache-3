The majority of plug samples are from coarse bioclastic facies and their dolomitized equiva-lents. Dolomitization probably occurred by circulation of normal to slightly modified sea-water. Increasing fabric destruction at greater depth in the SMP may reflect overprinting of multiple dolomitization episodes in older strata, perhaps related to successive cycles of sea-level fluctuation. Both limestones and dolostones how similarly wide variation in porosity and permeability, reflecting extreme metre-scale heterogeneity of lithologies and diagenetic responses. The limestones show poorer porosity-permeability correlation, with generally lower permeability for given porosity compared with the dolostones, but with similar <b>maximum</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> D spite wide textural diversity, the dolostones cluster along a single trend that parallels the ideal relationship described by the Kozeny equation and characteristic of well-sorted sandstones.

Materials and Methods: Full crown preparations were made in extracted human molars to expose deep coronal dentin. The roots and pulp were removed and the resulting crown segments were connected to a special device (Flodec) to permit the measurement of the permeability of the specimens before and after treatments. Minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>permeability</b> were recorded after smear layer and phosphoric acid treatment. A new smear layer was created and the permeability measured after the crowns were bonded with Single Bond (3 M ESPE), One-Up Bond F (Tokuyama), and AdheSE (Ivoclar Vivadent), either according to manufacturer's instructions or after treating the acid-etched dentin with a 3 wt% potassium oxalate gel.
