The focus of this research was to examine a novel method for calibrating natural gas flow meters. This new method can accommodate very large flow rates and it avoids common problems associated with current <b>meter</b> <b>proving</b> techniques. In this method, the amount of gas accumulated in a vessel of fixed. volume is determined by measuring the change in capacitance of the vessel with respect to time. Because the accumulator has a fixed volume, the problems inherent with the mechanical motions involved in volumetric provers such as bell provers and piston provers are eliminated. Accurate measurements can also be made in larger vessels than would be feasible for gravimetric provers, especially for in situ calibrations...|$|E

There have been significant improvements in the measurement performance of ultrasonic gas flow meters. The performance of multipath ultrasonic gas flow meters has improved {{to the point that they}} now approach the measurement performance level of other proving technologies, such as sonic nozzles and turbine flow meters. A new rotary piston meter design (that uses multiple rotors to reduce pulsations) and new dual-rotor turbine meter designs have entered the marketplace. Many of the gas meter field provers that were in existence in the early 1990 s are no longer in service. It is speculated that these provers were not capable of providing cost-effective field meter proofs, and thus, their use has been discontinued. "...|$|E
40|$|Metered mixing {{specifically}} for the RSRM backfill operation was investigated.

Although <b>metered</b> mixing <b>proved</b> to be a viable method for mixing the Dow Corning DC 90 - 0006 rubber with its catalyst, applying the technology to the RSRM backfill operation has several disadvantages that are decisive. Use of a metered mixer would increase the amount of material that was being scraped for each backfill and increase the amount of time required to clean up the equipment after each operation. Therefore, use of metered static mixers is not recommended for use in the RSRM nozzle backfill operations.

50|$|Some early SLRs {{featured}} a built-in CdS meter usually {{on the front}} {{left side of the}} top plate, as in the Minolta SR-7. Other manufacturers, such as Miranda and Nikon introduced a CdS prism which fitted to their interchangeable prism SLR cameras. Nikon's early Photomic finder utilized a cover in front of the cell which was raised and a reading was taken and the photographer would either turn the coupled shutter speed dial and/or the coupled aperture ring to center a galvanometer-based meter needle shown in the viewfinder. The disadvantage of this early Photomic prism finder was that the meter had no ON/OFF switch so the meter was constantly 'ON', thus draining battery power. A later Photomic housing had an ON/OFF switch on the Pentaprism. CdS light <b>meters</b> <b>proved</b> more sensitive to light and thus metering in available light situations was becoming more prominent and useful. Further advances in CdS sensitivity, however, were needed as, CdS cells suffered from a 'memory effect'. That is, if exposed to bright sunlight, the cell would require many minutes to return to normal operation and sensitivity.|$|R

40|$|Bamboo, as a {{relatively}} new plantation crop in Australia, requires an integrated agricultural strategy as a benchmark against which improvements to optimise productivity and maximise growers’ gross margin can be assessed. An important aspect of bamboo production is how to balance the productivity and returns from edible shoots and/or culms for timber. A 6 -year trial was set up on an existing clumping bamboo (Bambusa oldhamii) grove at Eumundi, Queensland, Australia, from 2001 to 2006. Using conventional best management as a control (T 1 —fertilised, irrigated, early-season selection of shoots for timber culms, and designed wide clump space), five other treatment variations (T 2 —no irrigation during dry season, T 3 —late-season selection, T 4 —narrow spacing, T 5 —late-season selection, and harvesting excess shoots only as early thinning, and T 6 —non-irrigation, non-fertilisation, early-season selection) were imposed. Shoots and culms in each treatment were seasonally harvested during 2003 – 05, and the total production, i. e. fresh weight (FW) for shoots and dry weight (DW) and volume for culms, were summed for each treatment. Water-use efficiency for dry culms at c. 1. 0 g/kg (total applied water plus precipitation) was not dissimilar to other species. There was a trade-off between shoot and culm production when the harvest of shoots as a vegetable was excessive. To compare bamboo productivity between treatments, a productivity index (PI) was calculated to convert the value of culm DW to relative market value of edible shoot FW using a range of ratios from 0. 0 – 1. 0 such {{that the value of}} 1 kg of culm was adjusted as a ratio of the value of 1 kg of edible shoot. We concluded that T 3 was the best strategy for producing shoots only, T 5 was the best for culms only, and T 2 was the best for dual production of shoots and culms because it increased average relative water-use efficiency by 28 %. However, the case study indicated that T 3 was a financially sustainable management for growers in Australia regardless of the fluctuation in shoot and culm market prices.

Five legume species were investigated in three separate experiments from 1990 to 1993 at the UMass Research Farm in S. Deerfield, Mass. These were hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), lana vetch (Vicia dasycarpa MacLeod), purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis L.), field pea (Pisum sativum spp. Arvense (L.) Poir) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.). ^ Oat (Avena sativa L.) {{was used as}} a companion crop with all five legume species investigated. With conventional tillage, legumes seeded in combination with oats provided significant amounts of N to sweet corn seeded early the following spring. Hairy vetch was the only legume species to survive the winter in these trials. This made it the most effective of the legume species investigated since the regrowth in the spring accumulated more N compared to the legumes that did not survive the winter. ^ Research studies also evaluated hairy vetch interseeded with rye (Secale cereale L.). Results suggest that a combination of oat-vetch may be superior to rye-vetch due to the competition observed from rye in the spring. Oat would provide necessary erosion control since it germinates and grows faster than vetch in the fall and it would add more soil organic matter than the legume grown alone. ^ The pre-sidedress nitrate test and the SPAD- 502 chlorophyll meter were evaluated as predictors of N needs in sweet corn. Soil samples and chlorophyll meter readings were taken in sweet corn following different cover crop treatments when the plants were approximately 30 cm high. The data were compared to relative yield of sweet corn. Neither the pre-sidedress nitrate test or a chlorophyll <b>meter</b> <b>proved</b> to be effective predictors of N needs in sweet corn.

The prototype has an angular error of 0, 53 ° of the laser beam to one side due to a design flaw. This will add a distance error that is not negligible from targets that are not orthogonal with the theoretical measuring line. Suggestions for improvements in the design of the prototype have been put forward. The project has generated practical knowledge that can be used in the development of a similar product...|$|R
50|$|However, {{construction}} of the 7,804 <b>meter</b> long tunnel <b>proved</b> to be extremely difficult due to numerous unforeseen problems with the local geology and contemporary tunneling technology. The Hakone mountain range is an active volcanic zone, containing a number of faults and is subject to frequent earthquakes. In addition, workers encountered problems with a huge volume of water seepage, soft rock formations, and vents of hot spring water. On April 1, 1920, a large section of the tunnel from the Atami side collapsed, trapping 42 workers, 17 of whom were rescued a week later after heroic efforts to dig them out. The tunnel was also damaged during the Great Kantō earthquake without fatalities; however, another section collapsed during an earthquake on February 26, 1930, killing five more workers. The work took many years more than initially anticipated, and costs far exceeded original budgetary estimates. The total number of workers killed in during construction was 67 men.|$|R
