40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the types of <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> {{strategies}} and <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times on customer satisfaction. An analysis of the pilot test data and expert reviews provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the scales. Empirical descriptive statistics and regression analysis indicated the most influential effect of different service strategies and <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times on customer satisfaction. Three <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> strategies and two <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times were examined in this study. Firm <b>service</b> <b>recovery,</b> customer <b>service</b> <b>recovery,</b> and joint <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> each took place within thirty minutes as customers’ expected <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> timeframe and within two hours as over customers’ expected <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> timeframe after a service failure. The results showed that all six <b>service</b> <b>recoveries</b> (3 by 2) have significant positive effects on customer satisfaction levels. However, the findings indicated that joint <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> in thirty minutes had the greatest positive effect on hotel guests’ customer satisfaction levels. If the resolution is efficient, customer satisfaction increases. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future study were also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to describe the relationship between specific local government solid waste and recycling program attributes and recyclable <b>material</b> <b>recovery.</b> The characteristics of solid waste and recycling programs vary greatly across North Carolina, achieving variable levels of recyclable <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> rates. Given that solid waste disposal is increasing at a significant rate in North Carolina and approximately 20 years of landfill space remain in the state’s landfills, solid waste directors and recycling coordinators face an enormous amount of pressure to divert as much materials as possible to recycling programs. Through a survey of North Carolina solid waste and recycling program managers, this study collected vital data regarding characteristics of waste and recycling collection programs including pickup frequencies, weekly waste and recycling collection capacities, recycling separation requirements, and other variables presumed to be related to recyclable <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> rates. Using correlation analyses and significance tests, the study revealed which solid waste and recycling program characteristics are most closely related to recyclable <b>materials</b> <b>recovery.</b> The study showed the three variables most closely related to recyclable <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> are recycling pickup frequency, separation methods and provision of recycling equipment. Solid waste and recycling program managers interested in maximizing recyclable <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> rates should evaluate these three program attributes first to determine if improvements could be made. Recycling pickup frequency should be maximized, separation methods should be minimized and local governments should increase convenience for residents to obtain recycling bins or carts...|$|R

40|$|One way to {{generate}} a higher recycling rate is to handle <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> efficiently. Conventional recycling schemes require the recylates to be "clean", i. e. separated prior to coming into the <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> facility (MRF). However, it is inconvenient to pre-sort their recyclates. To solve this problem, we propose multiple bins to be assigned to each personnel to maximize conveyor belt usage. We model the unload-and-switch cycle through a 2 -nested routing problem. A numerical example validates the approach. ...|$|R
