As a television newscaster with WAAM-TV in Baltimore, Parker covered the 1952 elections, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U. S. President and J. Glenn Beall was elected U.S. Senator from Maryland. He created a children's television character, Mister Poplolly, {{in which he}} would don an oversized hat and glasses, along with a clown's nose, for a daily show. Later, he portrayed a Popeye-like sailor hosting a daily cartoon show. Parker also did commercials, including The Buddy Deane Show between 1957 - 1962 (by then, WAAM had been sold to Westinghouse and its call letters changed to WJZ-TV).|$|R

5|$|Henry Conwell (c. 1748 – April 22, 1842) was an Irish-born Catholic {{bishop in}} the United States. He became {{a priest in}} 1776 and served in that {{capacity}} in Ireland for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> After the Pope declined to appoint him Archbishop of Armagh, the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second Bishop of Philadelphia in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and {{spent much of his}} time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated William Hogan, a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his coadjutor bishop, Francis Kenrick. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.|$|E
5|$|He went {{one better}} at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he beat Fernando Meligeni to win the bronze medal, thus {{becoming}} the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> earlier. Paes cited the match {{as one of his}} greatest performances on the court, in part because his wrist was severely injured. He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996. His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993, when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal. After having a moderate season in 1994, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett. From 1996, he partnered with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, which would prove to be a winning combination. Their first year was not a very successful one, especially in the Grand Slams, with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best. 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi, with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result. Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no. 89 {{at the beginning of the}} year to no. 14 at the end of the year. That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam, getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open, beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric Pioline.|$|E

40|$|The {{relations}} between China and Africa {{have become increasingly}} complex over the last <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> As China’s economic ties with Africa go beyond commodity-dominant trade, Xiangming Chen & Garth Myers consider China’s activities in Africa’s broader economy {{with a focus on}} urban infrastructure. Back in the early 1970 s, the Chinese Dining Hall of Xinqiao Hotel in Beijing where Xiangming Chen worked as a waiter was a favorable spot for Tanzanian and Zambian engineering students to drink beer. They were in Beijing to learn how to operate the railroad between the two countries that China began to build in 1970 and completed in 1975. Despite being very poor, China put up $ 500 million to build the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, the largest single foreign-aid project undertaken by China at the time. The irony then was that a good number of these African students were known to be the sons of government officials with whom China shared a strong socialist ideology. If we fast forward to the 21 st century, we see that while China and Africa remain connected, their relations have become considerably different and much <b>more</b> complex <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> ago. The new China-Africa relationship is defined by the rapid growth and broader scale of thei...|$|R
40|$|Evidence that {{infectious}} diseases cause wildlife population extirpation or extinction remains anecdotal {{and it is}} unclear whether the impacts of a pathogen at the individual level can scale up to population level so drastically. Here, we quantify the response of a Common eider colony to emerging epidemics of avian cholera, {{one of the most important}} {{infectious diseases}} affecting wild waterfowl. We show that avian cholera has the potential to drive colony extinction, even over a very short period. Extinction depends on disease severity (the impact of the disease on adult female survival) and disease frequency (the number of annual epidemics per decade). In case of epidemics of high severity (i. e., causing > 30 % mortality of breeding females), <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one outbreak per decade will be unsustainable for the colony and will likely lead to extinction within the next century; <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> outbreaks per <b>decade</b> will drive extinction to within 20 years. Such severity and frequency of avian cholera are already observed, and avian cholera might thus represent a significant threat to viability of breeding populations. However, this will depend on the mechanisms underlying avian cholera transmission, maintenance, and spread, which are currently only poorly known...|$|R
5000|$|Moses Grandy ( [...] - unknown), was an African-American author, abolitionist, and, for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{the first}} <b>four</b> <b>decades</b> of his life, an enslaved person. At {{eight years of}} age he became the {{property}} of his playmate, James Grandy {{and two years later}} he was hired out for work. The monies Moses earned were collected and held until James Grandy turned 21. Grandy helped build the Great Dismal Swamp Canal and learned how to navigate boats. It was that skill that led him to be made commander of several boats that traveled the canal and Pasquotank River, transporting merchandise from Elizabeth City, North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia. The position allowed him to be better fed, shod and dressed. Able to keep a portion of his earnings, Grandy arranged to buy his freedom twice and twice his owners kept the money and held him in slavery. An arrangement was made for an honorable man to buy him and Grandy earned the money to buy his freedom a third time, this time successfully.|$|R

40|$|Perhaps {{it is not}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> or five <b>decades</b> {{that the}} hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer is {{recognized}} by the scholars, but during this short period, we have seen tempestuous critics and objections against their hermeneutical thoughts. Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics, after publication of Wahrheit und Methode in 1960, has met with many criticisms. One of the major areas in which Gadamer has sustained criticism is epistemology. Although the topic of epistemology is not the central point of TM, his hermeneutics does call to mind the question, what can we know? And “how is understanding possible, {{not only in the}} humanities but in the whole of man’s experience of the world?” Does Gadamer’s hermeneutics lead to relativism, the very thing he appears quite ardently to fight in his critique of historicism? Pol Vandevelde 1 is someone who has recently criticized Gadamer’s hermeneutics from the perspective of traditional hermeneutics. He published a book entitled: "The Task of the Interpreter: Text, Meaning, and Negotiation”. The first two chapters of this book, especially the second chapter, with the title “Interpretation as Event: A Critique of Gadamer’s Critical Pluralism,” is devoted to attacking some aspects of Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics. I will state the general schema of his book and his critiques of Gadamer as they have been put forward in the first 62 pages of his book. In my conclusion, I will raise five questions or contradictions in Vandeveld’s theory of interpretation...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Martin Luther King {{wrote and}} {{delivered}} his famous “I Have a Dream” speech <b>more</b> <b>than</b> fifty years ago. When he obtained copyright protection on the speech in 1963, Dr. King (and later his estate) {{would have expected}} the copyright to last a maximum of fifty-six years. That fifty-six-year copyright has become a ninety-five-year copyright, thanks to lengthy duration extensions enacted by Congress in the mid- 1970 s and late 1990 s. As a result, the copyright on the “I Have a Dream” speech will not expire {{until the end of}} 2058. Because the Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. and its affili- ates have closely guarded the speech in a copyright enforcement and li- censing sense, the public seldom sees <b>more</b> <b>than</b> snippets {{of one of the most}} highly regarded speeches in history. Greater public exposure to the full speech would serve important purposes of the sort recognized by Congress in the fair use section of the Copyright Act. However, those interested in borrowing from or otherwise using the speech have tended to drop their plans or have obtained a costly license from the King Estate or one of the affiliated entities—even when the users may had have a plausible right under the fair use doctrine to borrow from or use the speech without ob- taining a license. With the copyright on the speech not expiring until the end of 2058, there is a danger that the snippets-only nature of the pub- lic’s exposure to the speech will remain the status quo for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> another <b>four</b> <b>decades.</b> Infringement cases that have not been settled by the parties have yielded judicial rulings on whether the “I Have a Dream” speech was properly copyrighted, but no case has been litigated extensively enough to permit a court to address the defendant’s fair use defense. This Article proposes a fair use analysis appropriate for use by courts in the event that a user of the “I Have a Dream” speech departs from the usual tendency to obtain a license in order to avoid litigation and, instead, rests its fate on the fair use doctrine. The proposed analysis gives a suitably expansive scope to the fair use doctrine for cases dealing with uses of the speech or similarly historic works, given the important public purposes that could be served by many such uses. The Article also develops a test for use in determining whether a work is sufficiently historic, for purposes of the fair use analysis proposed here...|$|R
