5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> {{of severe}} disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of infection in this population, as well as the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism {{is a state of}} insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E

5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> {{in the developed}} world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism. In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause.</b> The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic.

5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually {{does not affect the}} production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident.

5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> {{of primary}} hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In {{areas of the}} world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess.

Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
