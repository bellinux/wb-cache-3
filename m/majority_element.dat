50|$|Even {{when the}} input {{sequence}} has no majority, the algorithm will report {{one of the}} sequence elements as its result.However, {{it is possible to}} perform a second pass over the same input sequence in order to count the number of times the reported element occurs and determine whether it is actually a majority.This second pass is needed, as it is not possible for a sublinear-space algorithm to determine whether there exists a <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> in a single pass through the input.|$|E
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{the algorithm}} finds a <b>majority</b> <b>element,</b> {{if there is}} one: that is, an element that occurs repeatedly {{for more than half}} of the elements of the input.However, if there is no majority, the algorithm will not detect that fact, and will still output one of the elements.A version of the algorithm that makes a second pass through the data can be used to verify that the element found in the first pass really is a majority.|$|E
40|$|Let’s {{begin with}} a problem that {{many of you have}} seen before. It’s a common {{question}} in technical interviews. You’re given as input an array A of length n, with the promise that it has a <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> — a value that is repeated in strictly more than n/ 2 of the array’s entries. Your task is to find the <b>majority</b> <b>element.</b> In algorithm design, the usual “holy grail ” is a linear-time algorithm. For this problem, your post-CS 161 toolbox already contains a subroutine that gives a linear-time solution — just compute the median of A. (Note: it must be the <b>majority</b> <b>element.)</b> So let’s be more ambitious: can we compute the <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> with a single left-to-right pass through the array? If you haven’t seen it before, here’s the solution: • Initialize counter: = 0, current: = NULL. [current stores the frontrunner for the majority element] • For i = 1 to n: – If counter = = 0 : [In this case, there is no frontrunner. ] ∗ current: = A[i] ∗ counter++ – else if A[i]==current: [In this case, our confidence in the current frontrunner goes up. ] ∗ counter++ 1 – else [In this case, our confidence in the current frontrunner goes down. ] ∗ counter [...] • Return current For example, suppose the input is the array { 2, 1, 1 }. The first iteration of the algorithm makes “ 2 ” the current guess of the <b>majority</b> <b>element,</b> and sets the counter to 1. The next element decreases the counter back to 0 (since 1 6 = 2). The final iteration resets the current guess to “ 1 ” (with counter value 1), which is indeed the <b>majority</b> <b>element.</b> More generally, the algorithm correctly computes the <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> of any array that possesses one. We encourage you to formalize a proof of this statement (e. g., by induction on n). The intuition is that each entry of A that contains a non-majority-value can only “cancel out ” one copy of the majority value. Since more than n/ 2 of the entries of A contain the majority value, there is guaranteed to be a copy of it left standing {{at the end of the}} algorithm. But so what? It’s a cute algorithm, but isn’t this just a toy problem? It is, but modest generalizations of the problem are quite close to problems that people really want to solve in practice...|$|E

40|$|Redundant automata, as {{described}} by von Neumann, use “restoring organs” in order to remove the effect of malfunctions. It is shown that the class of possible restoring organs is wider than that discussed by von Neumann. If “triplication” is used, a class of <b>majority</b> <b>elements</b> for the multivalued case provides restoring action in approximately the same amount as von Neumann's two-valued majority organs. If “multiplexing” is used, possible restoring organs can be classified {{in terms of their}} “length. ” The length- 1 restoring organs are majority elements; the length- 2 restoring organs are derived from the majority organ concept, etc. This approach makes it possible to write truth-tables for restoring organs, and to synthesize them by means of two-valued or multivalued devices...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{strategy}} used {{to limit}} these deleterious processes is called selective oxidation. Simply, the alloy is designed {{such that the}} ratio of alloying elements promotes formation of a specific oxide phase that can then act {{as a barrier to}} further oxidation. Most commonly, aluminum and chromium are used in this role, because they form relatively thin and continuous oxide layers of alumina (Al2O3) and chromia (Cr2O3), respectively. Furthermore, they possess low oxygen diffusivities, effectively halting further oxidation beneath this layer. In the ideal case, oxidation proceeds through 2 stages. First, transient oxidation involves the conversion of various <b>elements,</b> especially the <b>majority</b> <b>elements</b> (e.g. nickel or cobalt). Transient oxidation proceeds until the selective oxidation of the sacrificial element forms a complete barrier layer.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Majority game {{is played}} by a {{questioner}} (Q) and an answerer (A). A holds n elements, each {{of which can be}} labeled as 0 or 1. Q is trying to identify some element A holds as having the Majority label or, {{in the case of a}} tie, claim there is none. To do this Q asks questions comparing whether two elements have the same or different label. Q’s goal is to ask as few questions as possible while A’s goal is to delay Q as much as possible. Let q∗ denote the minimal number of questions needed for Q to identify a <b>Majority</b> <b>element</b> regardless of A’s answers. In this paper we investigate upper and lower bounds for q∗ in a variation of the Majority game, where A is allowed to lie up to t times.

40|$|Abstract. Given {{an array}} A of size n, we {{consider}} the problem of an-swering range majority queries: given a query range [i [...] j] where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, return the <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> of the subarray A[i [...] j] if it exists. We describe a linear space data structure that answers range majority queries in constant time. We further generalize this problem by defining range α-majority queries: given a query range [i [...] j], return all the ele-ments in the subarray A[i [...] j] with frequency greater than α(j−i+ 1). We prove an upper bound {{on the number of}} α-majorities that can exist in a subarray, assuming that query ranges are restricted to be larger than a given threshold. Using this upper bound, we generalize our range major-ity data structure to answer range α-majority queries in O (1 α) time using O(n lg (1 α + 1)) space, for any fixed α ∈ (0, 1). This result is interesting since other similar range query problems based on frequency have nearly logarithmic lower bounds on query time when restricted to linear space. ...|$|E

30|$|The stent’s {{material}} was surgical stainless steel type 316 LVM (where “L” stands for Low Carbon and “VM” denotes Vacuum Melted), using a wire of 200 –μm diameter (Figure  2 b). The 316 LVM is an austenitic steel, which {{is widely used}} for implants because it never develops surface rust and shows superior resistance to constant salt water exposure. According to the international standards (ASM International Handbook Committee 1990), the elemental composition of 316 LVM is in the range 0.03 wt.% C, up to 2.0 % Mn, 2.0 – 3.0 % Mo, up to 1.0 % Si, 16.0 – 18.0 % Cr, 10.0 – 14.0 % Ni, up to max. 0.16 % N, and about 65 % Fe as the <b>majority</b> <b>element.</b> We have determined the particular chemical composition of our investigated stent by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) Supra VP 35 Zeiss (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany). The resulting chemical composition (in weight %) is displayed as a histogram in Figure  2 c. The too high carbon concentration (2.94 %) is artificial; it originates from the contamination of the SEM by the hydrocarbons (a known problem in SEM microscopy). Apart from the carbon, other elements are within the specifications for the 316 LVM steel.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} reaction metaphor {{has been discussed}} in various occasions in the literature. This metaphor describes computation {{in terms of a}} chemical solution in which molecules (representing data) interact freely according to reaction rules. Chemical solutions are represented by multisets. Computation proceeds by rewritings of the multiset which consume and produce new elements according to reaction conditions and transformation rules. To the best of our knowledge, the Gamma formalism was the first “chemical model of computation” proposed as early as in 1986 [4] and later extended in [5]. A Gamma program is a collection of reaction rules acting on a multiset of basic elements. A reaction rule is made of a condition and an action. Execution proceeds by replacing elements satisfying the reaction condition by the elements specified by the action. The result of a Gamma program is obtained when a stable state is reached, that is to say, when no reaction can take place anymore. Let’s illustrate this style of programming of Gamma with three small examples: the maximum, the prime numbers and the <b>majority</b> <b>element.</b> The reaction max = replace x, y by x if x ≥ y computes the maximum element of a non empty set. The reaction replaces any couple of elements x and y such that the reaction condition (x ≥ y) holds by x. This process goes on till a stabl...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{obstacles}} to a swift agreement on how to reform the EU institutions is the belated insistence of Poland to reopen the issue of voting weights in the Council. The system unanimously agreed in the Constitutional Treaty (CT) foresaw a double majority system under which a (qualified) majority requires two elements: at least 55 % of the member states accounting for at least 65 % of the EU’s population. In 2004, the then Polish government had agreed, under considerable pressure, to this double majority formula. The new Polish government has {{for some time now}} insisted that this issue should be reconsidered. Initially it proposed that instead of the double majority the so-called ‘Penrose’, or square root formula should be used under which only one majority would be required, namely one calculated using the square root of member states ’ populations. Recently, however, the Polish government has changed its stance and is now ready to accept the principle of a double majority approach, but one in which the second <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> would not be based on a majority of the population, but rather on the square root of the population. It is widely assumed that the insistence of the Polish government on the square root approach is motivated by the desire to increase its voting power. Our figures show, however, that this will not be necessarily the case. Poland is in general unlikely to gain a lot from the square root approach because it is a ‘nearly-big ’ member state: 21 member states are smaller than Poland, and only 5 are larger. An...|$|E

40|$|Transition {{metal alloy}} {{nanoparticles}} {{are of interest}} both theoretically and experimentally, particularly due to their potential technological applications, and to their novel structural and magnetic properties in the subnanometer region. Here we compute structural parameters, chemical and magnetic properties, and the fragmentation channels of FexCoyPdz nanoparticles, for x þ y þ z 7, and compare our results with macroscopic systems whenever it is feasible. We carry out density functional theory calculations, as implemented in the SIESTA code, for all possible concentrations (i. e., all x-, y-, and z-values). The seeds for the possible homotops are built using a semiempirical Gupta potential; these, and additional low coordinated conformations, are thereafter subject to reoptimization {{by means of the}} SIESTA code. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that such kind of calculations are performed for all the possible compositions of up to 7 atom ternary nanoclusters. We find that the binding is strongest in the FeCo-rich region and weakest for pristine Pd for all the sizes we considered. Interatomic distances in general decrease monotonically, as the FeCo region is approached. The total magnetic moment varies almost continuously over the composition range, with the large Fe moment being quenched by the addition of Pd and/or Co; however, an almost continuous range of the moments magnitude can be achieved, which allows for fine tuning magnetism by controlling the composition. As far as the fragmentation channels are concerned, for neutral, cationic, and anionic clusters, the most likely path is through atomic Pd 0, Pdþ, and Pd, when Pd is present in the cluster. However, in the absence of Pd, the most likely fragmentation channel is through the <b>majority</b> <b>element.</b> Molecular fragmentation channels are only observed for very small cluster sizes...|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering, University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 The main {{idea of the}} paper to give solutions to the majority problem where we are {{counting the number of}} occurrences of the <b>majority</b> <b>element</b> {{more than half of the}} total number of the elements in the input set and also for the number of occurrences of the element at least half of the total number of the elements in the input set. In the model we use elements that cannot be used to index into an array and there is no order for the input elements. Thus the outcome of the comparison of two elements can only be either equal or not equal and cannot be greater than or smaller than. The focus of the paper is to propose algorithms for these problems and analyze their time complexity. For both versions we show O(n) time algorithms. These results could be compared with cases whose elements can be ordered. The paper has also been modified to give the solution to the majority problem where the number of occurrences of an item exceeds (at least) more than n/k times in a multiset of n elements. In the model we used elements cannot be used to index into an array and there is no order for the input elements. The focus of this thesis is on the solutions and analyze the time complexity. We have achieved time O(nk) for this problem and we believe this is the optimal time complexity for this problem. Moreover an algorithm is suggested in this paper to find the majority elements which is only applicable for integers.

Also, fear has bigger gravity in the female SR structure, but men evoked it only once. In peripheral region of SR, women includeterms as pain, humiliation, tension.
