Nearly [...] {{everything}} in the fore-turret is worked by steam and hydraulic power, [...] so that comparatively few men are required to move the iron monsters. [...] Let {{me ask you to}} imagine the men at their stations. Some are inside [...] the turret, and as guns and turret move in concert the men inside move [...] with them. Those outside the turret stand at its base, and are [...] therefore below the iron deck and protected by the iron sides of the [...] ship. The insiders revolve, aim, and fire the gun; the outsiders [...] load. The first lieutenant, standing {{at the base of the}} tower, close [...] to the hole by which it is entered, so that he may be heard by both [...] out and insiders, shouts, `Close up,' in the voice of a Stentor. At [...] this some men grasp levers, others stand by wheels which let on [...] respectively hydraulic power and steam. The captain of the tower, [...] seated on an elevated position, puts his head through a <b>man-hole</b> in [...] the roof of the turret, which hole is covered with a bullet-proof iron [...] hood, having a narrow opening in front. He surveys the supposed [...] enemy, and his duty is to revolve the tower, take aim, and let go the [...] firing machinery, i.e. pull the trigger. The outsiders stand by the [...] locking bolt, levers, shot-racks, etcetera. Then, in the attitude of [...] ready-for-action, all become motionless attentive statues--a regular [...] tableau-vivant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract ⎯ Interests in {{magnetic}} fields {{over the last}} 15 years have been a transient issue, but general utility guidelines are to practice prudent avoidance where possible. This paper discusses various design issues considered by a utility preparing to under-ground an existing overhead transmission line {{in an area that}} has seen significant residential growth and general encroachment near and onto the overhead line’s right-of-way. The utility’s consultants evaluated various cable and magnetic shielding con-figurations to minimize the resulting {{magnetic fields}} from an underground cable system along the duct bank and near <b>man-holes.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo {{approaches}} may {{be followed}} to obtain damage information from strain measurements: 1) To use multiple sensing points, {{and to reduce}} the huge amount of information by pattern recognition techniques, as PCA. (companion paper) 2) To use distributed sensing (OFDR of backscattered radiation), placing the plain optical fibre at the region where damage is expected. Because of its simplicity, this approach is very robust, and even its local nature, similar to the VCM, it may be of interest in some applications, like stringer debonding, or for identifying local damage by impacts around <b>man-holes.</b> One advantage of this approach compared to the former one, is that the structure {{does not need to}} be under load, it measures the residual strains caused by the damage. Several experiments, done on real aeronautic composite parts, are presented, quantifiying the POD, robustness and applicability of the technique...|$|R
60|$|When {{the whole}} hill shall have been {{properly}} washed, the contained reefs will present this wall-like appearance. The dimensions are ten feet long {{by the same}} height and half that thickness, and the slope shows an angle of 40º. We passed onwards {{to the top of}} the ridge, winding among the pits and round holes sunk by the native miners in order to work the casing of the reef. One of these, carefully measured, showed 82 feet. About sixty yards to the north-north-east we reached the crest of what Mr. Ross calls 'Ponsonby Hill.' He notices that the strike of the quartz, which shows visible gold, is from north-north-east to south-south-west, and its underlie to the south-east is at the ratio of one inch in twelve. Cameron found that near the head of the descent, 120 feet to the plain below, three, and perhaps four lodes meet. The true bed, with a measured thickness of 157 feet, strikes north 22º east, the western 355º, and the eastern north 37º east (true). All radiate from one point, a knot which gives 'great expectations.' The natives have opened large <b>man-holes</b> in search of loose gold, and here, tradition says, many nuggets have been found. A greater number will come to light when the miners shall dig the 'blind creek' to the east, and when the roots of the secular trees crowning the summit shall be laid bare by the hose. I would wash down and sluice the whole of the Akankon ridge.|$|R

60|$|Akim {{is divided}} into eastern and western. Mr. H. Ponsonby, when {{travelling}} through both regions, found the natives getting quantities of gold by digging holes eight to ten feet deep {{on either side of}} the forest-paths. He saw as much as three ounces taken up in less than half an hour. Around the capital of eastern Akim, Kyebi, or Chyebi, the land is also honeycombed with <b>man-holes,</b> making night-travel dangerous to the stranger. It requires a sharp eye to detect the deserted pits, two feet in diameter and 'sunk straight, as if they had been bored with huge augurs.' I have seen something of the kind in the water-meadows near Shoreham. The workman descends by foot-holes, and works with a hoe four to six inches long by two broad: when his calabash is filled it is drawn up by his companions. The earthquakes of April and July 1862 [Footnote: I happened to be at Akra during the convulsion of July 10. The commandant, Major (now Colonel) de Buvignes, and I set out for a stroll along the sands to the west. The morning was close and cloudy: what little breeze there was came from the south-west, under a leaden sky and over a leaden sea. At 8.10 A.M., as we were returning from the rocks about three-quarters of a mile off, there was a sudden rambling like a distant thunder-clap; the sands seemed to wave up and down as a shaken carpet, and we both staggered forwards. Others described the movement as rising and falling like the waters of a lagoon. I looked with apprehension at the sea; but the direction of the shock was apparently from west-north-west; and the line was too oblique to produce one of those awful earthquake-waves, seventy feet high, which have swept tall ships over the roofs of cities. We ran as fast as we could to the town, where everything was in the wildest confusion. The 'Big House' and Mr. John Hansen's were mere ruins; the Court-house had come to pieces, and the prison-cells yawned open. I distinctly saw that the rock-ledge under Akra, between Fort James and Crèvecoeur, had been upraised: canoes passed over what was now dry. A second shock at 8.20 A.M., and a third about 10.45, completed the destruction, split every standing wall, and shook down the three forts into ruinous heaps. Nor did the seismic movements cease till July 15, when I made my escape.|$|R
50|$|Snell's window (also called Snell's circle or optical <b>man-hole)</b> is a {{phenomenon}} by which an underwater viewer sees everything above the surface through a cone of light of width of about 96 degrees. This phenomenon is caused by refraction of light entering water, and is governed by Snell's Law. The area outside Snell's window will either be completely dark or show a reflection of underwater objects by total internal reflection.|$|E
50|$|Another ancient {{monument}} {{that can}} be visited is a well-preserved Neolithic chambered cairn on the small island of Holm of Papa Westray, a little east of Papay itself (and readily visible from the larger island). The long, stalled cairn, built of local stone, was once a communal burial place for the bones of an ancient community. It is protected by a modern roof and entered by a <b>man-hole</b> from above. This {{can be seen at}} any time of day, but visitors must arrange privately for a boat through the local co-op.|$|E

The image appears on city crests, taxi cabs, <b>man-hole</b> covers, and other city infrastructure. The fruit of the Madroño tree ferments on the tree if left to ripen, so some of the bears become drunk from eating the fruits.|$|E
50|$|Partly due to debris washing {{onto the}} roadways, {{numerous}} automobile accidents, and people abandoning their vehicles because of rising waters, caused I-71, I-64, I-65, {{and part of}} The Watterson Expressway (I-264) and The Gene Snyder Freeway (I-265) were shut down. Surrounding cities of New Albany, Jeffersonville, and Clarksville, Indiana were also affected. In New Albany, several parked cars were washed into the Ohio River. Additionally, most city streets were rendered impassable and several other important roadways were closed for hours. Across both Indiana and Kentucky, the massive amount of water entering the cities' underground viaducts caused a pressure build-up, blowing off a number of <b>man-hole</b> covers, which created dangerous road hazards.|$|E
50|$|The {{airframe}} is a two-stage, aerodynamically stable {{structure that}} houses and protects the airborne missile equipment during powered flight. The missile guidance system enables the shutdown and staging enable relay to initiate Stage I separation.

External conduits are attached to the outside surface of the tanks to provide passage for the wire bundles and tubing. Access doors are provided on the missile forward, aft and between-tanks structure for inspection and maintenance. A <b>man-hole</b> cover for tank entry is located on the forward dome of each tank.|$|E
5000|$|The Class 16E Pacific was {{designed}} by Watson and built by Henschel, who delivered six locomotives in 1935. With its 72 in diameter coupled wheels, it {{was considered to be}} the most remarkable Cape gauge express passenger locomotive ever built. The coupled wheels were the largest ever used on any less than [...] locomotive, and it had an all-up weight and tractive effort equal to or exceeding that of most Pacifics outside North America. It used rotary cam poppet valve gear driven by outside rotary shafts, which resulted in extremely free-running characteristics. It also boasted the largest fire grate on any Pacific outside North America. The Class 16E had a Watson Standard no. 3A boiler and, at 9 ft above rail level, its boiler centre-line was the highest-pitched on the SAR. This and the limitations of the loading gauge made it impossible to install a normal steam dome and its place was taken by an inspection <b>man-hole.</b> Steam was collected through numerous small feeder pipes fixed into two collector pipes, which were arranged as high as possible above the water surface. The collector pipes joined together to form a main steam pipe, 7 in in diameter, which led to the superheater header and multiple valve regulator, situated in the smokebox.|$|E
