30|$|In Malaysia, tiger grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, {{also known}} as brown <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper,</b> is a major cultured marine species. It is {{considered}} a popular and high valued aquaculture species and fast growing (Afero et al., 2009). Data from Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority of Malaysia (2013) (FAMA) indicated that grouper species are the major export fish for the year 2010 (MAHA, 2013).|$|E
40|$|The marine grouper {{species are}} {{considered}} high value food fish in several countries. However, controlled breeding and hatchery production of grouper fingerlings for commercial farming {{is still in}} its infancy. Investigations on the growth performance of the brown <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (Forskal), camouflage grouper E. polyphekadion (Bleeker) and their hybrid (E. fuscoguttatus x E. polyphekadion) under hatchery and growout culture conditions indicate the potential of grouper hybrids for aquaculture...|$|E

40|$|Brown <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) is an apex {{predator}} from {{coral reefs}} of the Indo-Pacific region. All five published case series of ciguatera after consumption of brown <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> were reviewed {{to characterize the}} types, severity and chronicity of ciguatera symptoms associated with its consumption. Three of these case series were from large outbreaks affecting over 100 – 200 subjects who had eaten this reef fish served at banquets. Affected subjects generally developed a combination of gastrointestinal, neurological and, less commonly, cardiovascular symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms occurred early and generally subsided in 1 – 2 days. Some neurological symptoms (e. g., paresthesia of four limbs) could last for weeks or months. Sinus bradycardia and hypotension occurred early, but could be severe and prolonged, necessitating the timely use of intravenous fluids, atropine and dopamine. Other cardiovascular and neurological features included atrial ectopics, ventricular ectopics, dyspnea, chest tightness, PR interval > 0. 2 s, ST segment changes, polymyositis and coma. Concomitant alcohol consumption {{was associated with a}} much higher risk of developing bradycardia, hypotension and altered skin sensation. The public should realize that consumption of the high-risk fish (especially the ciguatoxin-rich parts and together with alcohol use) and repeated ciguatoxin exposures will result in more severe and chronic illness...|$|E
40|$|Groupers {{were known}} as a high {{economically}} marine commodity {{and in order to}} support groupers production, the seed availability was the most important. Eggs are still as limited factor in hatchery production, for this reason the success of eggs transportation is one as base of successful production of seed. Planning on hatching time of eggs through different incubation temperature was an option to solve that problem. This experiment was aimed to find out the optimum temperature for groupers eggs and the minimum temperature to arrange incubation time and to plan the hatching time. Fertilized eggs were incubated into three beaker glasses of 1 liter in volume with the density of ± 250 eggs/liter. The incubation was done under laboratory condition at controlled temperature, i. e. (A) 21 - 22 ºC, (B) 24 - 25 ºC, (C) 27 - 28 ºC and (D) 30 - 31 ºC. The eggs that used were including orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coiodes), brown <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> (E. microdon), tiger grouper (E. fuscoguttatus) and humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis). Investigated variables were embryonic development pattern, incubation time and hatching rate. The result showed that the eggs incubated in temperature range of 24 - 31 °C had the normal sequence of embryonic development pattern, but in temperature of 21 - 22 °C performed irregular sequence and the embryonic development stopped at blastula or gastrula stage or even the eggs could still develop but the body of hatched larvae were abnormal. In lower temperature incubation, the incubation time was longer and the hatching rate of eggs was lower than those in higher temperature. Therefore the optimum temperature for incubation of orange spotted grouper, <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper,</b> tiger grouper and humpback grouper eggs ranged between 24 - 31 ºC, while the lowest possible temperature was 24 ºC...|$|E

40|$|Disease {{is one of}} {{obstacle}} in fish culture. Immunity of fish against {{disease can}} be increased by using immunostimulant. The purpose of this experiment to increasing immunity of cantik hybrid grouper (cross breeding of tiger grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus female with <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper,</b> E. polyphekadion male) to the diseases by using immunostimulant. Treatments were LPS cell walls of V. alginolyticus and commercial LPS was also used in this study, as a-control without LPS was used saline water (0. 85 % NaCl). The LPS was delivered by injection intra-muscularly with concentration of 0. 1 mL/fish. This experiment was design by completely randomized with 3 replicates. Results showed that LPS were effective to increase titer antibody values and survival rates of cantik hybrid grouper. The titer antibody values of fish after 90 days rearing period were 128 (LPS from V. alginolyticus), 64 (commercial LPS), and only 4 in the control fish. The survival rates {{at the end of}} experiment were 88. 67 ± 3. 62 % (LPS from V. alginolyticus), 85. 22 ± 5. 93 % (commercial LPS), and only 50. 13 ± 6. 11 % in the control fish. Relative percentage survival of fish following challenged with live V. alginolyticus were 77. 46 % in the received LPS from V. alginolyticus cell wall and 71. 12 % in the fish received commercial LPS.

40|$|We {{report a}} reef {{ecosystem}} where corals {{may have lost}} their role as major reef engineering species but fish biomass and assemblage structure is comparable to unfished reefs elsewhere around the world. This scenario {{is based on an}} extensive assessment of the coral reefs of Farquhar Atoll, the most southern of the Seychelles Islands. Coral cover and overall benthic community condition at Farquhar was poor, likely due to a combination of limited habitat, localized upwelling, past coral bleaching, and cyclones. Farquhar Atoll harbors a relatively intact reef fish assemblage with very large biomass (3. 2 t ha(- 1)) reflecting natural ecological processes that are not influenced by fishing or other local anthropogenic factors. The most striking feature of the reef fish assemblage is the dominance by large groupers, snappers, and jacks with large (> 1 m) potato cod (Epinephelus tukula) and <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> (E. polyphekadion), commonly observed at many locations. Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) and bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) are listed as endangered and vulnerable, respectively, but were frequently encountered at Farquhar. The high abundance and large sizes of parrotfishes at Farquhar also appears to regulate macroalgal abundance and enhance the dominance of crustose corallines, which are a necessary condition for maintenance of healthy reef communities. Overall fish biomass and biomass of large predators at Farquhar are substantially higher than other areas within the Seychelles, and are some of the highest recorded in the Indian Ocean. Remote islands like Farquhar Atoll with low human populations and limited fishing pressure offer ideal opportunities for understanding whether reefs can be resilient from global threats if local threats are minimized...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Knowledge of an animal’s predatory interac-tions {{provides}} {{insight into}} its ecological role. Until now, investigation of reef shark predation {{has relied on}} artificial stimuli to facilitate feeding events, with few sightings of natural predation events. Here we document two different foraging modes of the grey reef shark, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos (f. Carcharhinidae), recorded without the influence of baits or burley. The first mode saw an aggre-gation of sharks targeting a morning mass spawning event of <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> (f. Serranidae). We observed 120 separate grouper spawns over a 104 -min period. Detailed analysis of 52 spawns showed an average of five groupers and 2. 7 sharks involved in each spawn, with sharks usually on site within 1. 29 s of spawn initiation. The success rate of investigating sharks was relatively low (8. 1 %), and conspecific competition, rather than cooperative behaviour, was repeatedly observed among sharks. The second for-aging mode documented was the nocturnal predation of individual fishes in the same reef pass 2 weeks later. Here, 128 separate fish pursuits were observed, with fusiliers (f. Caesionidae) comprising 88 % of targeted individuals. Multiple sharks usually investigated each fish, with over 300 interaction events recorded. Over 100 bite attempts were observed, and again the rate of predation was low, with fish taken in only 5. 3 % of investigations (16 % of attempted bites). Our findings show that grey reef sharks naturally prey on species {{across a range of}} trophic levels, employing foraging techniques optimised for prey species and circumstance. Although a high-order mesopredator, the low rates of predation success observed suggest that grey reef sharks may have limited direct impact on lower-trophic-order species; however, this remains to be verified...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia is an {{archipelagic}} {{country with}} many locations suit for aquaculture. Grouper hatcheries are still concentrated {{in a few}} locations. Therefore, appropriate technology to transport live grouper seed is needed to ensure the survival and health of the seed. This study aimed to determine the duration of fasting before transportation and the optimum density of grouper seed during transportation. Transportation was conducted in closed system, transported using a car, for 24 hours. Grouper seed used for the experiment was cantik hybrid grouper, a cross-breed between female tiger grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) and male <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus microdon) {{with an average of}} size 7. 0 ± 0. 32 cm. There were 2 experiments in this study. Experiment 1 was different durations of fasting before transprotation: A. 12 hours, B. 24 hours, C. 36 hours and D. 48 hours with the density of 150 seeds/boxes. The result of the first experiment was used to determine the experimental design of experiment 2, which consisted of 4 different densities per boxes: A. 125 seeds, B. 150 seeds, C. 175 seeds and D. 200 seeds. Both of the experiments were conducted in triplicates. The seeds were packed in plastic bags with a thickness 0. 08 mm, length 120 cm x width 53 cm, filled with 10 liters of sea water. The results showed that the duration of fasting from 36 to 48 hours had the highest survival rate. Polinomial relation y = - 0. 0439 x 2 + 3. 7696 x + 17. 075 with the value of R² = 0. 966 illustrated that the optimum duration of fasting was 44 hours. There was a significant difference in densities of seeds during transportation (P< 0. 05), where the higher density lead to the lower survival rate. The density of 125 seeds/boxes resulted in the highest survival rate, 99. 0 ± 1. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|The health-promoting {{effects of}} dietary onion and ginger were studied in brown <b>marbled</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus fuscoguttatus. An eight-week feeding trial was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of dietary onion and ginger on growth, cortisol levels, histology and disease resistance in the fish. Five experimental diets were formulated to contain either onion (2 %), ginger (2 %), Î²-glucan (1 %) or vitamin C (3 %) and a control diet (without immunostimulants). Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish with an average weight of 10. 85 Â± 0. 69 g. Fish supplemented with either of the immunostimulants exhibited a significantly higher growth compared to the control group. Specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were significantly higher in the onion and ginger-supplemented fish than the control. Cortisol level was higher in the control compared to the immunostimulant-fed groups with onion and ginger-fed fish showing significantly lower cortisol levels. When experimentally infected with Vibrio harveyi, fish fed onion or ginger exhibited significantly reduced mortality {{when compared with the}} control and Î²-glucan, but not when compared with the vitamin C-fed group. Liver sections sampled 4 days postinfection showed no remarkable pathology except for the slight reduction in glycogen granules in the supplement-fed fish. The liver of non-supplemented infected fish showed necrosis, fatty globule deposition, vacuolation, and presence of short rod-shaped bacteria. Kidney sections in the supplemented groups, likewise, did not show significant pathology similar to the uninfected control, whereas those of infected control fish showed necrosis of the tubules and glomeruli resulting in severely altered morphology of the tissues and presence of bacteria in the necrotic areas. As a result of circumventing tissue damage, wound healing was faster in fish supplemented with ginger, onion, and vitamin C compared to the Î²-glucan and the control groups. This study showed the benefits of onion and ginger in promoting growth and alleviating stress and severity of vibriosis in grouper.
