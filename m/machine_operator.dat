The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit.

25|$|The {{linotype}} <b>machine</b> <b>operator</b> enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, {{which are}} molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then {{cast as a}} single piece, called a slug, of type metal in {{a process known as}} hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.|$|E

25|$|Each matrix {{contains}} the letter form {{for a single}} character of a font of type; i.e.,a particular type design in a particular size. The letter form is engraved into {{one side of the}} matrix. For sizes up to 14 points, and in some matrices of size 16 to 24 points, the matrix has two letter forms on it, the normal and auxiliary positions. The normal position has the upright (Roman) form of a given character, and on the auxiliary, the slanted (Italic) form of that character will be used, but this can also be the boldface form or even a different font entirely. The <b>machine</b> <b>operator</b> can select which of the two will be cast by operating the auxiliary rail of the assembler, or, when setting entire lines of italics, by using the flap, which is a piece that can be turned under a portion of the first elevator column. This is the origin of the old typesetting terms upper rail for italic and lower rail for Roman characters. These terms have persisted in phototypesetting technology even though the mechanics of the auxiliary rail do not exist there. The character on a Linotype matrix, when viewed, is not inverted as a letter for conventional movable type would be, and the letter is incised below the surface rather than raised above it. This is because the matrix is not used directly to print onto the paper—rather, it is used as part of a mold from which a metal slug will be cast. The slug has its features reversed: therefore, the matrix does not.|$|E

[...] By using the Lubbers machine, human glass blowers were replaced with a <b>machine</b> <b>operator</b> paid 30 percent of the glass blower wage. The machine was also five times more productive than the human blowers. It could make windows four times as large because a larger cylinder was extracted from the tank of molten glass.

The results show that the majority of the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> find it simple to use the reporting system, although, some of them reports that it doesn’t always work as supposed to. About 25 percent of the interviewed answered that the reason for low reporting frequency is the lack of timber order number.

Other suggestions of actions aiming to increase the reporting frequency are using a production technician for support of the production leaders make it possible for <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> to report service stops Finally, most of <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> sees the reporting as a natural part of their job and are positive concerning their relation to Holmen Skog...|$|R

He continued his study of the martial arts while attending the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse where he earned a brown belt in Kyokushinkai Karate and a black belt in Shotokan Karate while competing on the university's karate team. After graduating with degrees in physical education and world history, Emerson moved to Southern California {{for the sole purpose of}} continuing his martial arts training at the Filipino Kali Academy. There he studied Jun Fan Gung Fu, Jeet Kune Do, and Eskrima under the tutelage of Dan Inosanto and Richard Bustillo (both protégés of the late Bruce Lee). [...] Emerson subsequently trained in Gracie Jiu Jitsu for three years at the original Gracie Academy in Torrance, California, under the founders of the Gracie Jiu Jitsu system, Rorion and Royce Gracie. Eventually, Emerson became an instructor in his own right and combined the principles of all these systems. It was in Southern California where he met his wife, Mary, who at the time was one of the world's top female practitioners of Jujutsu. During this time, Emerson worked as a technician, a <b>machine</b> <b>operator,</b> and eventually a design engineer for Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo.|$|E

However, when wage equations are estimated for all managers and for all plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> with a dummy variable for women included in the list of independent variables, the coefficient on women is negative and significant: ceteris paribus, women in managerial jobs or working as plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> have between 30  percent and 33 percent lower hourly earnings than men (see Appendix, Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|R
