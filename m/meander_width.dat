40|$|The ichnogenus Helminthorhaphe is a {{meandering}} trace fossil {{valuable to}} the study of movement behaviours of the trace-making marine invertebrates. In this work, we studied systematically the morphology of selected examples of Helminthorhaphe from the Upper Cretaceous to Miocene by means of primary morphological constructs, morphometrics, and theoretical morphological models. Eleven morphological constructs encompassing meander arrangement, meander tip, and meander course properties are established to illustrate the essential morphological features of meanders, which cover key aspects of the motion and navigation capacities of Helminthorhaphe makers. Tunnel diameter, <b>meander</b> <b>width,</b> and meander length are extracted to explore the size range of Helminthorhaphe, from which an exceptionally large end member is recognised, H. magna ichnosp. nov. <b>Meander</b> <b>width</b> versus tunnel diameter ratio and the fractal dimension of Helminthorhaphe are two prominent morphometric parameters that characterise the average closeness and space usage of the meanders, respectively, which aid differentiation between ichnospecies. Helminthorhaphe miocenica, H. magna, H. flexuosa, and H. japonica generally conform to a series of increasing closeness and space usage of the meanders. Theoretical morphogenetic analysis of the meander-generating process of Helminthorhaphe based on the bilateral phobo-thigmotactic robot car model reveals that the tempo and hierarchy of bilateral movement differentiation contribute to the formation of primary terminal U-turn at the meander tip, as well as lower-level meander-course undulations. The meander tip property proves to be an important morphological feature with biomechanical and neurobiological implications on the body flexibility and lateralisation in the nervous system of Helminthorhaphe producers. Larger-scale meander arrangement styles suggest that Helminthorhaphe makers potentially possessed certain radial or concentric spatial cognition of the environment. With an emphasis on theoretical morphogenetic analysis, this study provides a preliminary attempt in linking ichnology with behavioural, neurobiological, and intelligence sciences...|$|E

40|$|This study {{utilized}} a new {{database of}} levee failures along 685 km of the Middle and Lower Mississippi River from St. Louis, MO to Memphis, TN {{during the past}} 120 years. The goals of this investigation were to: 1) identify {{the relative importance of}} geologic and geomorphic factors that have led to levee failures through the past century along the Mississippi River and 2) measure levee crest elevations to determine if they have increased or decreased between 1998 and 2007 and if they are built to the proper design grade elevation. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine selected site characteristics at each levee failure location. These site characteristics (levee failure parameters) included: 1) levee underlain by previous channel fill, 2) presence/absence of borrow pit, 3) location of failure on a <b>meander</b> bend, 4) <b>width</b> of channel, 5) width of floodway, 6) constriction-over-time factor, 7) land-cover type, 8) width of vegetative buffer, 9) sinuosity of channel, 10) intensity of dredging, and 11) presence/absence of bank revetment. Each of these parameters was evaluated using geologic maps, soil survey data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), historic river maps, and dredging reports (Winkley, 1977; Pinter et al., 2004). Two models were created for each river reach. The first model for both reaches used a  95 % significance threshold, while the second model for the MMR used a  80 % significance threshold, and the second model for the LMR used a  90 % significance threshold. The first model for the Middle Mississippi River (MMR) identified only the presence/absence of channel fills to predict levee failure as significant, had an R² value of 0. 178, a p-value of 0. 002, and a percentage accuracy of 68. 6 %. The second model for the MMR identified the following variables as significant: presence/absence of channel fills to predict levee failure, location of failure on a <b>meander</b> bend, channel <b>width,</b> land-cover type, and intensity of dredging. This model had an R 2 value of 0. 408, p-value of 0. 002, and a percentage accuracy of 74. 3 %. The  95 % model for the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) identified location of failure on a meander bend, land-cover type, constriction-over-time factor, and sinuosity of the channel as significant. This model had an R 2 value of 0. 326, p-value of 0. 003, and a percentage accuracy of 69. 5 %. The 90 % LMR model identified the following variables as significant: the presence/absence of borrow pits, location of failure on <b>meander</b> bend, channel <b>width,</b> land-cover type, constriction-over-time factor, vegetative buffer width, channel sinuosity, and presence/absence of bank revetment. This model had an R 2 value of 0. 385, p-value of 0. 006, and a percentage accuracy of 72. 0 %. The MMR and LMR models with the  95 % significance threshold had no predictors in common because of differences between the two river reaches or possibly because of the small sample size. However, the expanded MMR and LMR models shared three predictors (i. e., <b>meander</b> location, channel <b>width,</b> and land cover type). The second portion of this project used post-processed dual-frequency GPS surveying to measure levee elevations between St. Louis, MO and Cairo, IL. These elevations were compared to the 50 -year design flood grade elevations and to a 1998 DEM to identify areas of levee heightening, levee degradation and/or subsidence, and locations of past levee crevasses. This surveying revealed areas that, between 1998 and 2007, were raised up to ~ 1. 5 meters and other areas that degraded or subsided up to ~ 1. 0 meter. Also, the locations of five recent levee crevasses were investigated, showing local increases or decreases at those points. The importance of levee road construction type was identified through many sharp increases or decreases at the transition between road types. Overall, this project showed promising implications for the determination of levee failure susceptibility and proper levee elevation heights using logistic regression analysis and kinematic GPS surveying. The logistic regression models predicted the potential for levee failure based on local site characteristics of levees between St. Louis, MO and Memphis, TN. The high-precision kinematic GPS surveying illustrated levee elevations along the MMR to a high degree of accuracy, allowing for the rapid and efficient identification of areas that do not correspond to the proper design flood grade elevation...|$|R

50|$|In {{a flowing}} stream, a riffle-pool {{sequence}} (also {{known as a}} pool-riffle sequence) develops as a stream's hydrological flow structure alternates from areas of relatively shallow to deeper water.

40|$|Territory {{protection}} against flood water inundation {{and creation of}} polder systems are carried out {{with the help of}} protection dikes. One of the main requirements to the composition of polder systems in flood plains is a location of border dikes beyond meander belt in order to avoid their erosion when meander development occurs. <b>Meander</b> belt <b>width</b> can be determined {{on the basis of the}} analysis of multi-year land surveying pertaining top river-bed building and in the case when such data is not available this parameter is calculated in accordance with the Snishchenko formula. While banking-up a river bed a flooded area is decreasing and, consequently, water level in inter-dike space and rate of flood water are significantly increasing. For this reason it is necessary to locate dikes at a such distance from a river bed which will not cause rather high increase in water level and flow velocity in the inter-dike space. Methodology for hydraulic calculation of river regulation has been developed in order to substantiate design parameters for levee systems, creation of favourable hydraulic regime in these systems and provision of sustainability for dikes. Its main elements are calculations of pass-through capacity of the leveed channel and rise of water level in inter-dike space, and distance between dikes and their crest level. Peculiar feature of the proposed calculated formulae is an interaction consideration of channel and inundated flows. Their mass-exchanging process results in slowing-down of the channel flow and acceleration of the inundated flow. This occurrence is taken into account and coefficients of kinematic efficiency are introduced to the elements of water flow rate in the river channel and flood plain, respectively. The adduced dependencies for determination of a dike crest level (consequently their height) take into consideration a rise of water level in inter-dike space for two types of polder systems: non-inundable (winter) dikes with maximum spring flood rate and inundable (summer) dikes with summer-autumn flood rates. The proposed calculated formulae can be recommended for application at design organizations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Meandering rivers {{are common}} on Earth and other {{planetary}} surfaces, yet the conditions {{necessary to maintain}} meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which <b>meandering</b> with near-constant <b>width</b> was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) {{in the lee of}} point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate {{may have contributed to the}} relatively low sinuosity of 1. 19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders...|$|R

The planform geometry of tidal channels {{is controlled by}} bidirectional flow, a fundamentally different process from that controlling the shape of meandering river channels. However, prior studies do not reach any consensus on how channel planforms differ in these two environments. We use Google Earth imagery to digitize 130 meandering channels on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna Delta in Bangladesh, from which we produce a data set of <b>meander</b> and channel <b>width</b> statistics for tidal and fluvial channels. Our data indicate that the tidal meanders are more symmetrical than the river meanders, which are both downstream and upstream skewed. The fluvial meanders are also more sinuous than the tidal meanders. We observe some evidence of longer intrinsic and Cartesian meander wavelengths in the tidal environment, although {{this could be a}} consequence of anthropogenic modifications to the fluvial channels. Despite these differences, we find that the relative strength of the first through third curvature harmonics is the same for the tidal and fluvial meanders. Our data set also provides insight into the funnel-shaped geometry of tidal channel mouths; we find that there is a positive correlation between channel mouth width and e-folding length. For those channels with a fluvial connection upstream, there is also a positive correlation between mouth width and upstream width. We propose several causes for the observed trends in our data, but future study will be necessary to test these hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|Observational {{evidence}} is presented on {{the geometry of}} meandering tidal channels evolved within coastal wetlands characterized by different tidal, hydrodynamic, topographic, vegetational and ecological features. New insight is provided on the geometrical properties of tidal meanders, with possible dynamic implications on their evolution. In particular, it is shown that large spatial gradients of leading flow rates induce important spatial variabilities of <b>meander</b> wavelengths and <b>widths,</b> while their ratio remains remarkably constant {{in the range of}} scales of observation. This holds regardless of changes in width and wavelength up to two orders of magnitude. This suggests a locally adapted evolution, involving the morphological adjustment to the chief landforming events driven by local hydrodynamics. The spectral analysis of local curvatures reveals that Kinoshita's model curve does not fit tidal meanders due to the presence of even harmonics, in particular the second mode. Geometric parameters are constructed that are suitable to detect possible geomorphic signatures of the transitions from ebb- to flood-dominated hydrodynamics, here related to the skewness of the tidal meander. Trends in skewness, however, prove elusive to measure and fail to show detectable patterns. We also study comparatively the spatial patterns of evolution of the ratios of channel width to depth, and the ratio of width to local radius of curvature. Interestingly, the latter ratio exhibits consistency despite sharp differences in channel incision. Since the degree of incision, epitomized by the width-to-depth ratio, responds to the relevant erosion and migrations mechanisms and is much sensitive to vegetation and sediment properties, it is noticeable that we observe a great variety of landscape carving modes and yet recurrent planar features like constant width/curvature and wavelength/width ratios...|$|R
40|$|Long-term channel {{changes of}} the Tagus and the Jarama Rivers in central Spain were studied in {{relation}} to variations in hydroclimatic factors, such as rainfall and flooding, and also with respect to human activities undertaken in their valleys. Data were taken from historical (1580 – 1823) and topographical (1877 – 1988) maps, as well as aerial photographs (1945 – 1999). The available hydroclimatic data consists {{of a series of}} monthly rainfall totals (1859 – 1994) and mean river flow values recorded at gauging stations (1911 – 1985). In addition, a historical flood record (1550 – 1947) was produced from documentary sources. Some of the data was incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) to quantify the changes {{in the course of the}} rivers. The results show there have been two distinct periods: before and after human intervention in the river system, which took place around 1950. During the earlier period (1550 – 1950), a correlation exists between climate, frequency and magnitude of flooding and changes in fluvial geomorphology. Between 1860 and 1892 an increase in flood frequency and magnitude occurred, which produced half of the cut-offs recorded in the study area between 1823 and 1877. The <b>meanders</b> length (L), <b>width</b> (W) and radius of curvature (RC) of the Tagus River have decreased since 1750. However, those of the Jarama reached their maximum values during flood periods. Both rivers have different geomorphological responses during flood events, which can explain these different trends. Floods in the Jarama not only led to the cut-offs, but also enlarged the channel size (L, W and RC).

Using photo- and electron-beam-lithography 5 to 20 nm thick films were patterned into single bridges and <b>meander</b> structures with <b>widths</b> of the conduction paths as narrow as 50 nm. Dependencies of the critical temperature and critical current density on variations in bridge width and thickness can be modelled rather well using existing theories applicable to dirty superconductors with very short coherence lengths. The meander structures have already been shown to be very fast and sensitive single photon detectors in the visible and near-infrared range. Their ultimate sensitivity is hampered however, by electric noise caused at least partly by fluctuations in the superconducting state. The detection mechanism exploits the creation of a localized hot-spot by the absorption of a photon with sufficient energy. Albeit being a relatively small perturbation of the superconducting state, it can be detected as a voltage transient given the right experimental conditions. These conditions require cross-sectional areas of the conduction paths comparable with the cross-section of the hot-spot and an applied bias current only slightly less than the critical current at the operating temperature. Under these conditions fluctuations, like e. g. phase-slip centers, fluctuations in the number density of Cooper-pairs or fluctuations within the vortex system, may also cause voltage pulses very similar in magnitude and shape to those caused by absorbed photons and may be a significant contribution to the dark count rate. Measured dark count rates have been analyzed with respect to these various noise sources. Besides the noise characteristics or noise equivalent power the performance of the single-photon detectors was investigated concerning the quantum efficiencies {{as a function of the}} incident photon energy and material parameters of the superconducting meander line...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades, the {{systematic}} {{investigation of the}} morphodynamics of meandering rivers mostly involved the theoretical-analytical methodology. The development of analytical models enabled the definition of equilibrium conditions, stability and evolution of river meanders and to investigate the interaction between planform and bedform processes and mechanisms. In recent years the new branch of remote sensing applied to river morphodynamics has been constantly developing simultaneously to the rapid increase of computational and satellite resources. The remote sensing analysis is nowadays employed {{in a wide range}} fields in geophysics; for this reason, the past years have seen the prolific development of numerous algorithms for remote sensing analysis. However, remote sensing of meandering river morphodynamics has not been consistently integrated with morphodynamic modelling so far. There is a lack of sophisticated algorithms for the extraction of extensive morphodynamic information from the available remotely sensed data; this gap prevented researchers from seeking systematic validation of analytical models to define their range of applicability, and to exploit their potential for improved insight on observations in real world meandering rivers. The evolutionary dynamics of the channel width, at local and bend scale, as well as the dynamics of bars in meandering rivers represent two major unsettled issues in our present understanding of river meandering dynamics. In this thesis I first provide a systematic methodology for the automated extraction of meandering river morphodynamic information from multitemporal, multispectral remotely sensed data, coded in the PyRIS software. Moreover, I develop an analytical model to investigate the long-term planform evolution of periodic sequences of meander bends incorporating spatio-temporal variations of channel curvature, width and slope. A first model component predicts the temporal evolution of the channel width and slope based on a novel treatment of the sediment continuity at the reach scale. A second model component is a fully analytical, evolutionary model of periodic meanders with spatially and temporally oscillating width accounting for nonlinear feedbacks in flow and sediment transport by means of a two-parameters perturbation approach. Application of the PyRIS software to several long reaches of free-flowing meandering rivers allows me to develop a consistent set of observations on the temporal and spatial evolution of channel width and curvature with unprecedented level of detail. Furthermore, model outcomes indicate that meander-averaged width and slope invariably decrease during meander development, and that the temporal adjustment of the hydraulic geometry is controlled by the ratio between the evolutionary timescales of planform and riverbed, quantified from the analyzed meandering rivers dataset. The nonlinear perturbation model indicates that width and curvature co-evolve according to a hysteretic behavior in time and predicts that the <b>meander</b> belt <b>width</b> dramatically decreases when the meander resonance threshold is crossed. The modelling approach predicts wider-at-bend meanders when the bank pull is dominant with respect to bar push, which in turn promotes meander bends that are wider at inflections. Analytical modeling and remote sensing analysis are mostly integrated through a statistical approach; bend-scale evolutionary analysis of planform descriptors such as channel width, width oscillations and curvature in large pristine meandering rivers exhibit good agreement with the outcomes of the proposed analytical models. Finally, the integration between analytical modeling and remote sensing analysis allows me to identify the key processes controlling the interaction between migrating sediment bars and planform-driven steady point bars. The conditions for the formation of migrating bars in meandering rivers are mostly related to the production of sediment supply by the basin, contrarily to the widespread idea that meandering rivers exhibiting migrating bars typically display lower values of the channel curvature...|$|R
