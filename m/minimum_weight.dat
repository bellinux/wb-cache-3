5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> cycle bases of the graph.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> of simple full-length array LDPC codes (SFA-LDPC codes). The SFA-LDPC codes are a subclass of LDPC codes, and constructed algebraically {{according to two}} integer parameters p and j. Mittelholzer and Yang et al. have studied the <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> of SFA-LDPC codes, but the exact <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> of the codes are not known except for some small p and j. In this paper, we show that the <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> of the SFA-LDPC codes with j= 4 and j= 5 are upper-bounded by 10 and 12, respectively, independent from the prime number p. By combining the results with Yangs lower-bound limits, we can conclude that the <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> of the SFA-LDPC codes with j= 4 and p> 7 are exactly 10 {{and those of the}} SFA-LDPC codes with j= 5 are 10 or 12...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an algorithm {{for the free}} distance determination of turbo Bose Ray Chaudhuri Hocquenghem (BCH) codes constructed by row-column interleavers. The algorithm calculates the <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> of turbo BCH codes obtained from input bitstreams having different <b>weights.</b> Among the <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> calculated in different cases, the minimum one is being considered as the free distance of turbo BCH codes. This is being achieved applying specifications of the interleaver and constituent BCH codes. Based on the computed free distances, the upper bound of probability of error for different turbo BCH codes is determined. It agrees with simulation results of the code performance in the error floor region...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{some of the}} {{existing}} teams, Forti was able to test its chassis extensively {{prior to the start}} of the season. However, Diniz proved to be around seven seconds per lap off the pace of the leading runners in group testing at the Estoril circuit in March, indicating that the team was likely to be mired at the back of the field. Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening Brazilian GP, but was seven laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. In Argentina, this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner Damon Hill at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers' similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher's fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner's fastest lap (Domenico Schiattarella in the Simtek). Imola was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and again failed to reach the 90% threshold for classification. Forti was already the butt of paddock jokes, and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: Pacific, Simtek, and Minardi. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10% of the F1 <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> limit of 595kg), and a semi-automatic gearbox, an airbox and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and monocoque were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season. This resulted in a gradual improvement in pace throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.|$|E

25|$|If {{the edges}} of a graph are given real number weights, {{the weight of a}} {{subgraph}} may be computed as the sum of the weights of its edges. The <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> basis of the cycle space is necessarily a cycle basis, and can be constructed in polynomial time. The <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> basis is not always weakly fundamental, and when it is not it is NP-hard to find the weakly fundamental basis with the minimum possible weight.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with construction and structural analysis of both cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes, particularly LDPC codes. It consists of three parts. The first part shows that a cyclic code given by a parity-check matrix in circulant form can be decomposed into descendant cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes of various lengths and rates. Some fundamental structural properties of these descendant codes are developed, including the characterizations of {{the roots of the}} generator polynomial of a cyclic descendant code. The second part of the paper shows that cyclic and quasi-cyclic descendant LDPC codes can be derived from cyclic finite geometry LDPC codes using the results developed in first part of the paper. This enlarges the repertoire of cyclic LDPC codes. The third part of the paper analyzes the trapping sets of regular LDPC codes whose parity-check matrices satisfy a certain constraint on their rows and columns. Several classes of finite geometry and finite field cyclic and quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with large <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> are shown to have no harmful trapping sets with size smaller than their <b>minimum</b> <b>weights.</b> Consequently, their performance error-floors are dominated by their <b>minimum</b> <b>weights.</b> Comment: 70 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theor...|$|R
40|$|A Newton-Krylov {{algorithm}} for aerodynamic optimization {{is applied}} to the multipoint design of an airfoil for eighteen different operating conditions. The operating conditions include four cruise conditions and four long-range cruise conditions at maximum and <b>minimum</b> cruise <b>weights</b> and altitudes. In addition, eight operating points are included in order to provide adequate maneuvering capabilities under dive conditions at the same maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>weights</b> and altitudes with two different load factors. Finally, two low-speed operating conditions are included at the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>weights.</b> The problem is posed as a multipoint optimization problem with a composite objective function that is formed by a weighted sum of the individual objective functions. The Newton-Krylov algorithm, which employs the discrete-adjoint method, has been extended to include the lift constraint among the governing equations, leading to an improved lift-constrained drag minimization capability. The optimized airfoil performs well throughout the flight envelope. This example demonstrates how numerical optimization can be applied to practical aerodynamic design.

Donohue was about to have his race victory taken away for cheating, but Roger Penske stepped in. Penske warned that any disqualification would have the potential of motivating Chevrolet to pull all support for the Trans-Am series. After considering the potential consequences, the race stewards allowed Donohue's victory to stand, but the rules for the 1968 season incorporated a change whereby all cars would be weighed during the technical inspection before the race.|$|E
25|$|A <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> {{basis of}} a graphic matroid is a minimum {{spanning}} tree (or minimum spanning forest, if the underlying graph is disconnected). Algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees have been intensively studied; it is known how {{to solve the problem}} in linear randomized expected time in a comparison model of computation, or in linear time in a model of computation in which the edge weights are small integers and bitwise operations are allowed on their binary representations. The fastest known time bound that has been proven for a deterministic algorithm is slightly superlinear.|$|E

The series is being run under the most radical engine regulation changes since 1995. All cars entering any Formula One championship race must run with 1.6-litre single turbocharged 6-cylinder engines with a rev limit of 15,000 rpm and maximum fuel flow of 100kg/hr. New car regulations will also be enforced, and the <b>minimum</b> <b>weight</b> regulations will be raised from 642kg (1,415lb) to 690kg (1,521lb). Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault will be producing engines for this new formula; Cosworth did not participate from 2014 and beyond. Honda returned to supplying McLaren with engines in 2015. In-season engine development will return; the previous V8's development was frozen. The new turbo engines are reckoned to produce 600bhp (the previous V8s produce approximately 750hp); but the new Energy Recovery System (ERS) will be twice as powerful as the current KERS system; this new ERS system will give the drivers up to the equivalent of 160hp when activated; the current KERS gives cars an extra 80hp when activated.|$|E
