50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate and H2O, whereas {{its product}} is <b>meso-tartrate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since {{thaumatin}} crystallizes {{rapidly and}} {{easily in the}} presence of tartrate ions, thaumatin-tartrate mixtures are frequently used as model systems to study protein crystallization. Interestingly, the solubility of thaumatin, its crystal habit, and mechanism of crystal formation are dependent upon the chirality of precipitant used. When crystallized with L- tartrate, thaumatin forms bipyramidal crystals and displays a solubility that increases with temperature; with D- and <b>meso-tartrate,</b> it forms stubby and prismatic crystals and displays a solubility that decreases with temperature. [...] This suggests control of precipitant chirality may be an important factor in protein crystallization in general.|$|E
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of "malic' enzyme (EC 1. 1. 1. 40) from potato {{suggests}} that the mechanism is Ordered Bi Ter with NADP+ binding before malate, and NADPH binding before pyruvate and HCO 3 -. The analysis {{is complicated by the}} non-linearity that occurs in some of the plots. <b>meso-Tartrate</b> is shown to inhibit the oxidative decarboxylation of malate but to activate the reductive carboxylation of pyruvate. To explain these unidirectional effects it is suggested that the control site of "malic' enzyme binds organic acids (including <b>meso-tartrate)</b> which activate the enzyme. <b>meso-Tartrate,</b> however, competes with malate for the active site and thus inhibits the oxidative decarboxylation of malate. Because <b>meso-tartrate</b> does not compete effectively with pyruvate for enzyme-NADPH, its binding at the control site leads to a stimulation of the carboxylation of pyruvate. A similar explanation is advanced for the observation that malic acid stimulates its own synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{generalization}} that 'when a metabolic sequence involves consecutive nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent reactions, the dehydrogenases {{have the}} same stereospecificity' was tested and confirmed for three metabolic sequences. (1) NAD+-xylitol (D-xylulose) dehydrogenase and NADP+-xylitol (L-xylulose) dehydrogenase are both B-specific. (2) D-Mannitol 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase and D-sorbitol 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase are both B-specific. (3) meso Tartrate dehydrogenase and oxaloglycollate reductive decarboxylase are both A-specific. Other dehydrogenases associated with the metabolism of <b>meso-tartrate</b> in Pseudomonas putida, such as hydroxypyruvate reductase and tartronate semialdehyde reductase, were also shown to be A-specific. Malate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida was A-specific, and the proposition is discussed that the common A-stereospecificity among the dehydrogenases involved in <b>meso-tartrate</b> metabolism reflects their origin from malate dehydrogenase...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1537 strains of Salmonella typhimurium {{belonging}} to seven prevalent phage types were examined on solid media {{for their ability}} to ferment rhamnose, xylose and inositol, for colicine production and for nutritional requirements. Most of the strains in each phage type were almost completely homogeneous, especially in their sugar fermentation reactions. However, strains of phage type 1 a/ 2 were not homogeneous, but could be assigned to one of four subgroups on the basis of ability to ferment inositol, inhibition of growth by <b>meso-tartrate</b> and auxotrophy for nicotinic acid. The subdivision proved to have epidemiological value. The inhibition of growth by <b>meso-tartrate</b> was observed on a defined medium containing citrate as the energy source. Inhibition did not occur if glucose, casein hydrolysate or aspartic acid were added to the medium...|$|E

We describe here the crystal structure of Rv 1098 c in complex with l-malate, fumarate or the competitive inhibitor <b>meso-tartrate.</b> The models reveal that substrate binding promotes {{the closure of the}} active site through conformational changes involving the catalytic SS-loop and the C-terminal domain, which likely represents a general feature of this enzyme superfamily.

40|$|An isolate of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides {{was capable}} of growing phototrophically and chemotrophically (μ = 0. 15 h− 1 for either condition) with d-(–) -tartrate as the carbon source. A d-(–) -tartrate dehydratase, (d-(–) -tartrate hydrolyase, EC 4. 1. 2. 70) was induced in the {{presence}} of d-(–) -tartrate. The enzyme was purified 30 -fold from cell extracts of R. sphaeroides to a specific activity of 7. 5 U/mg of protein and was subsequently crystallized {{in the presence of}} 1 M KCl. The enzyme was homogeneous upon analytical electrophoresis in 5 % polyacrylamide gels and by criteria of ultracentrifugation. The native enzyme had a molecular weight of 158, 000 ± 1, 000 as determined by gel filtration and ultracentrifugation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded a single polypeptide chain with an estimated molecular weight of 39, 500 ± 500, indicating that d-(–) -tartrate dehydratase was a tetramer. The isoelectric point of the native enzyme was at pH 5. 5. The enzyme catalyzed irreversibly the conversion of d-(–) -tartrate to oxaloacetate and water, and the turnover number was calculated to be 1, 185. The reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a Km value of 1. 8 × 10 − 4 M was determined. d-(–) -Tartrate dehydratase required Mg 2 + for activity. The pH optimum was within a range from 6. 2 to 7. 2, and the activation energy of the reaction (Δ H 0) was 63. 2 kJ/mol. The enzyme was specific for d-(–) -tartrate; it did not react with l-(+) -tartrate, <b>meso-tartrate,</b> and other hydroxycarboxylic acids. d-(–) -Tartrate dehydratase was strongly inhibited by <b>meso-tartrate</b> (50 % at 0. 6 mM). l-(+) -Tartrate and a variety of hydroxycarboxylic acids caused 50 % inhibition at concentrations of > 30 mM...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of some organic anions {{in the space}} inaccessible to sucrose of rat liver mitochondria was measured. In untreated mitochondria anions were apparently concentrated from 1 mm applied concentration by between five- and 22 -fold, depending on their charge. After depletion of endogenous reserves either with uncoupling agent or with oligomycin uptakes were decreased. The {{accumulation of}} citrate was restored by combinations of a dicarboxylic acid (malate, succinate, maleate or <b>meso-tartrate)</b> and energy. The energy could either be provided by oxidation of a suitable dicarboxylic acid or from ascorbate {{in the presence of}} tetramethylphenylenediamine, or from ATP. The restoration of citrate uptake is not necessarily accompanied by a gain of K+, but a cation- and energy-linked citrate uptake can be induced with valinomycin. When citrate is added to mitochondria in the presence of malate the latter is competitively displaced. The anion accumulation could arise from an internal energy-linked positive potential...|$|E
40|$|Fumarase (EC 4. 2. 1. 2) from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Breuibacterium flavum) ATCC 14067 was {{purified}} to homogeneity. Its amino-terminal sequence (residues 1 to 30) {{corresponded to}} the sequence (residues 6 to 35) of the deduced product of the fumarase gene of C. glutamicum (GeneBank accession no. BAB 98403). The molecular mass of the native enzyme was 200 kDa. The protein was a homotetramer, with a 50 -kDa subunit molecular mass. The homotetrameric and stable properties indicated that the enzyme belongs to a family of Class II fumarase. Equilibrium constants (Keq) for the enzyme reaction were determined at pH 6. 0, 7. 0, and 8. 0, resulting in Keq = 6. 4, 6. 1, and 4. 6 in phosphate buffer, while 16, 19, and 17 in the non-phosphate buffers, respectively. Among amino acids and nucleotides tested ATP inhibited the enzyme.

40|$|A bifunctional enzyme, L-(+) -tartrate {{dehydrogenase}}-D-(+) -malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (EC 1. 1. 1. 93 and EC 1. 1. 1..., respectively), {{was discovered}} in cells of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides Y, which accounts for the ability of this organism to grow on L-(+) -malate. The enzyme was purified 110 -fold to homogeneity with a yield of 51 %. During the course of purification, including ion-exchange chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis, both enzyme activities {{appeared to be in}} association. The ratio of their activities remained almost constant [1 : 10, L-(+) -tartrate dehydrogenase/D-(+) -malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) ] throughout all steps of purification. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a single protein band, the position of which was coincident with both L-(+) -tartrate dehydrogenase and D-(+) -malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) activities. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 158, 000 by gel filtration and 162, 000 by ultracentrifugation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded a single polypeptide chain with an estimated molecular weight of 38, 500, indicating that the enzyme consisted of four subunits of identical size. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was between pH 5. 0 and 5. 2. The enzyme catalyzed the NAD-linked oxidation of L-(+) -tartrate as well as the oxidative decarboxylation of D-(+) -malate. For both reactions, the optimal pH was in a range from 8. 4 to 9. 0. The activation energy of the reaction (delta Ho) was 71. 8 kJ/mol for L-(+) -tartrate and 54. 6 kJ/mol for D-(+) -malate. NAD was required as a cosubstrate, and optimal activity depended on the presence of both Mn 2 + and NH 4 + ions. The reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the apparent Km values of the individual reactants were determined to be: L-(+) -tartrate, 2. 3 X 10 (- 3) M; NAD, 2. 8 X 10 (- 4) M; and Mn 2 +, 1. 6 X 10 (- 5) M with respect to L-(+) -tartrate; and D-(+) -malate, 1. 7 X 10 (- 4) M; NAD, 1. 3 X 10 (- 4); and Mn 2 +, 1. 6 X 10 (- 5) M with respect to D-(+) -malate. Of a variety of compounds tested, only <b>meso-tartrate,</b> oxaloacetate, and dihydroxyfumarate were effective inhibitors. <b>meso-Tartrate</b> and oxaloacetate caused competitive inhibition, whereas dihydroxyfumarate caused noncompetitive inhibition. The Ki values determined for the inhibitors were, in the above sequence, 1. 0, 0. 014, and 0. 06 mM with respect to L-(+) -tartrate and 0. 28, 0. 012, and 0. 027 mM with respect to D-(+) -malate...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-five {{strains of}} Pseudomonas corrugata {{isolated}} in southern Italy were characterized phenotypically and compared with 23 strains of different origins. At least two main cultural types with rough or smooth colonies were observed. Strains with rough colonies produced a diffusible pigment in culture. On {{the basis of}} their nutritional profiles, Ps. corrugata strains formed a distinct phenon most closely related to fluorescent Pseudomonas spp, isolated from tomato with necrosis-diseased plants. Three major groups of strains were differentiated within the Ps. corrugata phenon on the basis of utilization of 2 -ketogluconate, <b>meso-tartrate,</b> hystamine, DL-glycerate and induction of a hypersensitive reaction on tobacco, Some Ps. corrugata strains belonging to group 1 and 3 which did not produce pigment in culture produced IAA in a colorimetric test. Variability in the serological reaction of the Italian strain was observed. None of the three antisera utilized reacted with all strains. Some strains isolated from diseased plants from the same greenhouse showed different nutritional profiles and reacted with different antisera, Fifteen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) patterns were observed. Strains were divided into two groups on {{the basis of their}} protein profiles. The heterogeneity which had already been observed in a world-wide study on Ps. corrugata was confirmed in strains from this restricted area...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli K- 12 {{is able to}} grow under aerobic {{conditions}} on D-malate using DctA for D-malate uptake and the D-malate dehydrogenase DmlA (formerly YeaU) for converting D-malate to pyruvate. Induction of dmlA encoding DmlA required an intact dmlR (formerly yeaT) gene, which encodes DmlR, a LysR-type transcrip-tional regulator. Induction of dmlA by DmlR required the presence of D-malate or L- or <b>meso-tartrate,</b> but only D-malate supported aerobic growth. The regulator of general C 4 -dicarboxylate metabolism (DcuS-DcuR two-component system) had some effect on dmlA expression. The anaerobic L-tartrate regulator TtdR or the oxygen sensors ArcB-ArcA and FNR {{did not have a}} major effect on dmlA expression. DmlR has a high level of sequence identity (49 %) with TtdR, the L- and meso-tartrate-specific regulator of L-tartrate fermentation in E. coli. dmlA was also expressed at high levels under anaerobic conditions, and the bacteria had D-malate dehydrogenase activity. These bacteria, however, were not able to grow on D-malate since the anaerobic pathway for D-malate degradation has a predicted yield of < 0 ATP/mol D-malate. Slow anaerobic growth on D-malate was observed when glycerol was also provided as an electron donor, and D-malate was used in fumarate respiration. The expression of dmlR is subject to negative autoregulation. The network for regulation and coordination of the central and peripheral pathways for C 4 -dicarboxylate metabolism by the regulators DcuS-DcuR, DmlR, and TtdR is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Extracts {{of frozen}} rat liver {{were found to}} {{catalyse}} the formation of 3 H 2 O from DL- 2 -hydroxy[2 - 3 H]glutarate. Three peaks of enzyme activities were observed on separation by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. The first and second peaks corresponded to an enzyme acting on L- 2 -hydroxyglutarate and the third peak corresponded to an enzyme acting on D- 2 -hydroxyglutarate, as indicated by competitive inhibition of the detritiation of the racemic radioactive compound by the unlabelled L- and D-isomers respectively. The enzyme acting on the D-form was further characterized. It was independent of NAD or NADP and it converted D- 2 -hydroxyglutarate into a-ketoglutarate, transferring electrons to artificial electron acceptors. It also oxidized D-lactate, D-malate and <b>meso-tartrate</b> and was stimulated by Zn 2 +, Co 2 + and Mn 2 +, but not by Mg 2 + or Ca 2 +. Subcellular fractionation indicated that it was present in the mitochondrial fraction. The enzyme was further purified by chromatography on Blue Trisacryl and phenyl-Sepharose, up to a stage where only a few bands were still visible by SDS/PAGE. Among the four candidate polypeptides that were identified by MS, one corresponded to a predicted mitochondrial protein homologous with FAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase. The corresponding human protein was expressed in HEK- 293 cells and it was shown to catalyse the detritiation of DL- 2 -hydroxy[2 - 3 H]glutarate with similar properties as the purified rat enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Boric acid ‘flux’ {{synthesis}} {{was developed}} by our group and assisted the preparation of new borate materials solids. In this thesis apply the methodology to the preparation of new organo-borate materials. Some background and motivation for this work is presented in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we describe some novel phases of organoborate phases including [(C 4 H 10 N 2) (B 6 O 10 H 2) ] with direct B-N connection. The flux approach also {{led to the formation}} of a number of organic salts of polyborate anions. In Chapter 3 metal and organic bis(salicylato) spiroborates have been synthesized with high yield, purity and crystallinity by the flux approach. Since salicylate and its derivatives are asymmetric chelates, the boron centers are chiral. Resolution of the [BS(Sal) 2] anion was effected by using quininium as chiral counter cation. In aqueous media the chiral B center was found to be labile, the rate of scrambling t 1 / 2 is about 40 mins. However. solutions of chirally resolved B(Sal) 2 ions have been found to be indefinitely stable in DMF solution at room temperature. In Chapter 4 hydrothermal boric acid ‘flux’ and solvothermal synthesis of tartratoborates affords simple monomer, cyclic oligomer or chain polymer arrangements. For L-tartrate all three types can be isolated through use of different crystallization conditions, such as solvent, temperature, reagent stoichiometry and the identity of the counter cations. For <b>meso-tartrate</b> two isomeric cyclic tetramers can be fored using K or Na counter ions, that appear to exhibit a templating effect. Nmr shows that the rings are stable in solution. Finally in Chapter 5 we looked at metal-organic framework (MOF) formation using calcium and group 13 elements. The study of calcium tartrate phases was due to the unintended preparation of these from boric acid flux reactions. In the indium system interesting phase types were formed including a porous MOF polymer...|$|E
