5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{has a few}} natural predators. Humans, <b>mongooses,</b> snake eagles, and genets {{commonly}} prey on this species of mamba. Hornbills and other snakes tend to prey on juvenile green mambas.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} also form {{associations with}} non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface. Hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf <b>mongooses,</b> {{in which they}} forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.|$|E
5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, <b>mongooses,</b> honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, <b>mongooses,</b> rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E

5|$|Pest {{control is}} at least as old as agriculture, as {{there has always been a}} need to keep crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. <b>Mongooses</b> were {{introduced}} into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of <b>mongooses,</b> feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the <b>mongooses</b> and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and <b>mongooses</b> threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
50|$|The black-footed <b>mongoose</b> (Bdeogale nigripes) is {{a species}} of <b>mongoose</b> found in central Africa. Unlike most similar species, the black-footed <b>mongoose</b> has only 4 toes on each limb rather than 5. The black-footed <b>mongoose</b> {{is closely related to}} Jackson's <b>mongoose,</b> which is of the same {{subgenus}} Galeriscus and are sometimes considered conspecific. The black-footed <b>mongoose</b> inhabits the tropical belt from east Nigeria to north-east Zaire and to north Angola.|$|R
50|$|The ruddy <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes smithii) is {{a species}} of <b>mongoose</b> found in hill forests of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. This <b>mongoose,</b> along with the striped-neck and Indian grey mongeese, are the only <b>mongoose</b> species endemic to India and Sri Lanka. The ruddy <b>mongoose</b> is very closely related to Indian grey <b>mongoose,</b> but {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger size and black-tipped tail extending for 2 to 3 inches at the distal end. There are two sub-species of this <b>mongoose,</b> H. smithii smithii in India, and H. smithii zeylanicus (Thomas, 1852) in Sri Lanka.|$|R

5|$|Animal Lifestyles, in {{the western}} {{quadrant}} of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf <b>mongooses,</b> desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals. The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, {{a part of the}} larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, <b>mongooses</b> raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the <b>mongooses</b> and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|E

50|$|Nocturnal predators include: the African civet (civettictis civetta) - a bulky long haired animal; small-spotted genet (Genetta genetta) and the large-spotted genet (Genetta tigrina) {{found in}} both parks; the spotted-necked otter (Lutra maculicollis), ratel or honey badger (Mellivora capensis); many <b>mongoose</b> {{species such as}} the marsh <b>mongoose</b> (Atilax paludinosus), the Egyptian large grey <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes ichneumon), cusimanse (Crossarchus obscurus), the white-tailed <b>mongoose</b> (Ichneumia albicauda); slender or pygmy <b>mongoose</b> (Galerella sanguinea), solitary {{inhabitant}} of the savanna; and Gambian <b>mongoose</b> (mungos gambianus).|$|R
5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and <b>mongooses.</b> Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon {{include the}} red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century {{and has been}} a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian <b>mongooses</b> (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis {{published}} a DNA hybridization study {{suggesting that the}} fossa was {{more closely related to}} <b>mongooses</b> (family Herpestidae) than to cats or civets. However, in 1995, Veron's morphological study once again grouped it with Felidae. In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae. Within Eupleridae, the fossa is placed in the subfamily Euplerinae along with the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and Malagasy civet, but its exact relationships are poorly resolved.|$|E

50|$|Apparently, <b>Mongoose</b> {{was a real}} <b>mongoose</b> {{before his}} powers were genetically {{engineered}} by the High Evolutionary to serve as his agent. At one point, the <b>Mongoose</b> arrives in New York where he is invited by Baron Zemo II to join his Masters of Evil. <b>Mongoose</b> later battles both Spider-Man and Thor, and this confrontation eventually causes Thor and <b>Mongoose</b> to become mortal enemies. After his first defeat {{at the hands of}} Thor, <b>Mongoose</b> flees. During his escape, he causes a fall of girders which injures Erik Masterson, better known as Thunderstrike.|$|R
5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only by the size it can swallow). <b>Mongooses,</b> which also are partially immune to venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E
5|$|The fossa was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with civets, <b>mongooses,</b> and cats (Felidae), its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, <b>mongooses</b> and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
5000|$|The Selous’s <b>mongoose</b> has a {{total length}} of 63-90 cm and a tail length of 28-43 cm. It weighs about 1.4-2.0 kg. [...] The {{body of the}} <b>mongoose</b> ranges from pale {{speckled}} grey to tawny grey with a pale underside, while the legs are brown or black. [...] The tail of the <b>mongoose</b> is white at the tip, making it identifiable from the white-tailed <b>mongoose,</b> which has a tail that is ¾ white. The Selous’s <b>mongoose</b> is also smaller and more slender than the white-tailed <b>mongoose.</b> The <b>mongoose</b> has four digits on each limb and long, slightly curved claws {{that are associated with}} digging.

50|$|<b>Mongoose</b> {{belong to}} a family closely related to civets.

5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and <b>mongooses</b> found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles, and <b>mongooses</b> have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledgings.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebrate}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 24 species of mammals, 87 species of birds, nine species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians. The ] disappeared from {{the region in the}} 1940s at the latest. At present, the largest and the most commonly seen mammal is the sambar deer. Some research findings estimate the population of sambar deer to be around 1500 to 2000, possibly more than the carrying capacity of the plains. Other mammal species found in the park include Kelaart's long-clawed shrews, toque macaques, purple-faced langurs, rusty-spotted cat, Sri Lankan leopards, wild boars, stripe-necked <b>mongooses,</b> Sri Lankan spotted chevrotains, Indian muntjacs, and grizzled giant squirrels. Fishing cats and European otters visit the wetlands of the park to prey on aquatic animals. A subspecies of red slender loris, the Horton Plains slender loris (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides formerly sometimes considered as Loris lydekkerianus nycticeboides) is found only in highlands of Sri Lanka and {{is considered one of the}} world's most endangered primates. In July 2010 a group of researchers from the Zoological Society of London was able to photograph the mammal for the first time.|$|E
