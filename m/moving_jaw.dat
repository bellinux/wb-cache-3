50|$|The Earthshock designs by Dinah Collin {{included}} {{a set of}} Mk 2C RAF flight suits with built-in pipes used to pump cool air around. The Revenge of the Cybermen head was reshaped and recut by Richard Gregory of the freelance company Imagineering to add more details. There was a transparent section in the face through where the actor's <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> could be seen. New chest units were made in fibreglass, and they were decorated with ammunition trays. Also worn with the costumes were padded zip-back gloves and Tecnica Moon Boots. For The Five Doctors and Attack of the Cybermen, the jaw area was sprayed silver, and less ostentatious boots were worn. Anushia Nieradzik was the costume designer on Attack of the Cybermen. A specially modified Cyber Controller costume with a tall silver dome on its head was made for Attack of the Cybermen; as with the Controller costume used in The Tomb of the Cybermen, its helmet had no handles. For Silver Nemesis, the same head and chest pieces returned with a dappled plastic jaw {{and the removal of}} the ammunition trays. A plainer type of flight suit without built-in pipes was used for the bodies, and cable junction boxes with plastic tubes were added to the limbs for more detail. The costumes had cricket gloves sprayed silver, and Dr. Martens boots.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper aims at the {{problems}} of traditional compound pendulum jaw crusher including unreasonable structure design, heavy weight, low utilization of material and high cost, chooses <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> which is the key part of motion mechanism as the optimal design subject, uses finite element method, through statics analysis, obtains stress and displacement distribution of <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> that is under the action of maximum fracture force, realizes weak link and surplus part of primary structure. Based on the above-mentioned study, this article uses minimum weight of <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> as objective function, combines with structure characteristic of crusher, uses the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) to establish parameterization model, and combines with the optimal design module OPT, works out the minimum weight of <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> under the conditions of meeting intensity and stiffness. The result indicates that <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> {{is less than the}} original one by 27 %, which saves material, reduces cost and weakens additional dynamic load that caused by inertial force of work mechanism, improves dynamics of mechanism to a cert extent, reduces the vibration of mechanism and the wear of part, and extends product service life...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw crusher. Jaw plate wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the fixed jaw should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{assessed}} the dosimetric performance of an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (EPID) for measurement and quality assurance of enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) profile and wedge factor. EPID measurements of EDW profiles were corrected for pixel sensitivity variation and spectral over-response relative to ion chamber and compared to ion-chamber and diode-array measurements. The dependence of EPID measurements on wedge direction and source to EPID distance was assessed. The long-term stability was investigated by weekly measurement of EDW profiles and wedge factors over a seven month interval. An empirical correction method {{was developed to}} improve EPID profile agreement with diode-array measurements. The EPID profiles differed from conventional measurements by up to 5 %. Backscatter from the EPID housing was also found to affect measurements by up to 4 %, resulting in changes in EPID measured profile with {{the direction of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>jaw</b> and source to EPID distance. EPID profile measurements varied by a maximum of 0. 3 % (1 SD) within the umbra, and wedge factors varied by 0. 3 % (1 SD) over the seven month interval. The correction function improved agreement between EPID and diode array to within 2 % for all wedge angles and energies. Due to the ease of use and reproducibility of the EPID-measured EDW profiles the device is highly suited to regular measurement of EDW...|$|E
40|$|Background. Dysphagia {{diagnosis}} {{is limited by}} our inability to evaluate the underlying neuromuscular pathology of swallowing. A novel approach using pharyngeal surface electromyography (PsEMG) {{has been reported in}} the literature. Objective. Three exploratory projects were undertaken to provide data toward the validation of PsEMG as a clinical measure of pharyngeal physiology. The first evaluates laterality of electrode placement in the pharynx. The second and third evaluate PsEMG using a circumferential and unidirectional electrode, respectively, during swallowing maneuvers. Methods. In experiment 1, a catheter housing 3 manometric sensors and 1 bipolar PsEMG electrode was randomly inserted in each nares of 10 participants. <b>Moving</b> <b>jaw</b> radiographs were taken, and the PsEMG electrode was measured in millimeters from midline. In experiments 2 and 3, the catheter was placed in 22 and 40 research participants, respectively. Waveform characteristics were collected during swallowing maneuvers. The 2 experiments differed by type of electrode (circumferential, unidirectional) and swallowing maneuver (noneffortful and effortful swallow; noneffortful, effortful, and tongue-hold swallow). Results. Midline electrode placement occurred on 20 % of trials with deviation of up to 14. 7 mm on all other trials. Maneuver-specific differences in amplitude were not detected with PsEMG; unacceptable levels of intrasubject and intersubject variability were identified. Temporal relationships of PsEMG and pharyngeal manometric pressure appeared appropriate. The unidirectional electrode revealed a unique bimodal PsEMG pattern that may reflect sequential contraction of muscles of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Conclusions. The current PsEMG design and procedures do not validly measure pharyngeal muscle activity. Recommendations for improved methods are provided. Sebastian H.

50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some lathe chucks have independently <b>moving</b> <b>jaws</b> which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are flexible collars or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|R

The weary lounging of boatmen on shore was trebly weary here; the youth of the district smoked together in speechless depression under the lee of a dead wall; the ragged children said mechanically: [...] "Give us a penny," [...] and before the charitable hand could search the merciful pocket, lapsed away again in misanthropic doubt of the human nature they addressed.
