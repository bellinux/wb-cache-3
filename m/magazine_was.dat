5|$|The <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> {{canceled}} {{after the}} April 1941 issue, {{but when a}} boom in science fiction magazines began in 1950, the publishers revived it. The first {{issue of the new}} series was dated November 1950; a further six issues appeared, the last dated May 1952. In addition to Kuttner, contributors to the first run included Arthur J. Burks and Jack Williamson; the second run published stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Jack Vance, and L. Sprague de Camp, among others. In the opinion of science fiction historian Joseph Marchesani, the quality of the second incarnation of the <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> superior to the first, but it was unable to compete with the new higher-quality magazines that had appeared in the interim.|$|E
5|$|The <b>magazine</b> <b>was,</b> however, highly controversial. Before {{publication}} Muslim {{groups had}} expressed opposition. After publication began the Playboy Indonesia offices were attacked, as were various printers. In one instance the Islamic Defenders Front attacked the Playboy Indonesia offices in South Jakarta, {{leading to the}} building being evacuated. By May 2006 the continuous protests had left the magazine without an office. The bad publicity led advertisers to abandon the magazine. Ultimately the <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> shut down after releasing ten issues, having moved to the predominantly Hindu island Bali since its second issue, in June 2006.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Magazines</b> <b>are</b> {{inserted}} into the <b>magazine</b> well, which <b>is</b> located {{to the rear of}} the pistol grip. The <b>magazine</b> <b>is</b> inserted front-first into the well so that the notch on the front of the <b>magazine</b> <b>is</b> retained in the well. The <b>magazine</b> <b>is</b> then [...] "rocked" [...] into place by rotating the rear of the magazine upwards into the well (in a manner similar to the AK-47 series) until the magazine release {{to the rear of the}} well is engaged. To release the magazine, the <b>magazine</b> release <b>is</b> pressed rearward, and the magazine pivoted forward and disengaged from the front recess.|$|R

5|$|While elated to {{have his}} work {{published}} again, Hergé quickly learned that if Tintin <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> his deliverer, it was also his demanding employer.

5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time the <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{television}} show, Live and Kicking launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show {{to create their own}} television production on a small scale. A monthly <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> also produced, though towards the end of Live & Kickings production, the sales of the magazine dropped significantly, reflecting its loss of viewers.|$|E

These <b>magazines</b> <b>were</b> constructed of stone, brick, timber or iron, largely dependent on the local availability of materials. At some ports, floating <b>magazines</b> <b>were</b> utilised.|$|R

5|$|Browne's {{interest}} in Amazing declined when {{the project to}} turn it into a slick <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> derailed. Although he stayed involved with Fantastic Adventures, another Ziff-Davis magazine, he left the editing work on Amazing to William Hamling and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.|$|E

5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> a mixed success from an {{organizational}} point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.|$|E
5|$|Imagination was an American {{fantasy and}} science fiction {{magazine}} {{first published in}} October 1950 by Raymond Palmer's Clark Publishing Company. The <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> sold almost immediately to Greenleaf Publishing Company, owned by William Hamling, who published and edited it from the third issue, February 1951, {{for the rest of}} the magazine's life. Hamling launched a sister magazine, Imaginative Tales, in 1954; both ceased publication at the end of 1958 in the aftermath of major changes in US magazine distribution due to the liquidation of American News Company.|$|E
