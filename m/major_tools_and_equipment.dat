40|$|Head {{spinning}} pace {{of change}} and development in information and technology has not yet discredited coursebooks as the <b>major</b> classroom <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> Coursebooks, as they have always been, are still the primary source <b>and</b> <b>tool</b> of teaching <b>and</b> learning process. As with the mainstream education, well-prepared coursebooks and texts are also a necessity for a high-quality Turkish course within distance education. Distance education is a legitimate education activity providing opportunities for students, teachers, and materials located in different places to meet. All the responsibility of teaching within distance education falls onto the course material. Among the printed materials, it is almost solely the coursebook and class notes that shoulder this responsibility. Texts within the current coursebooks should be analyzed in order to depict the current status, which will help increase the quality of distance education. Designed {{on the basis of}} this need, this study is expected to contribute to teaching Turkish through a realistic analysis of the texts in Turkish coursebooks studied at Open Education Secondary School (5 th, 6 th, 7 th, and 8 th grades). Bearing a descriptive research design, this paper aims to examine and assess the texts in Turkish coursebooks used in Open Education Secondary School in terms of genre, topic, and moral lessons. Research data has been collected through document analysis, one of the qualitative research methods. Each of 96 texts found in Turkish coursebooks were meticulously analyzed, and findings are presented in frequency tables...|$|R
40|$|Due to low service {{quality of}} {{maintenance}} management, high maintenance cost becomes a common issue in building industry of Malaysia. Lack of preventive measure is the problem that resulting poor maintenance performance. So, condition-based maintenance is introduced to improve the maintenance performance. Monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is seen as an}} important factor to ensure the efficiency of condition-based maintenance. So, this paper aims to determine the aspects of monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to be concerned in building maintenance, as well as to establish the relationship between the aspects and maintenance cost performance. A quantitative approach is adopted and performed through questionnaire survey. Furthermore, descriptive analysis and correlation analysis are used to analyse the research data. The literature review determines three aspects of monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to be considered in maintenance management. Furthermore, the research result demonstrates that the budget allocation for acquisition of monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> capability to operate the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as availability of the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> are significantly correlated to the maintenance cost variance. The research recommends the maintenance management to convince the clients or organisation to acquire advanced monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> for implementation of condition-based maintenance. Besides that, provision of training is encouraged to ensure that the maintenance personnel are able to utilise the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R
