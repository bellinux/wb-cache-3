5000|$|Sepro <b>Mobile</b> <b>Plants</b> are {{designed}} to be easily re-locatable as they are mounted on road transportable custom built trailer assemblies. These include the Sepro <b>Mobile</b> Mill <b>Plant</b> and Sepro <b>Mobile</b> Flotation <b>Plant,</b> both of which were installed by Banks Island Gold Ltd at the company's Yellow Giant Gold Property on the coast of British Columbia. They can be designed to encompass a wide variety of process options from crushing through to the final concentrate collection. [...] Sepro Modular and Skid Mounted Plants are engineered around structural elements that are simple and easy to erect on site. These plants can be designed with larger equipment for higher tonnage applications than that of the Sepro <b>Mobile</b> <b>Plants.</b> One example is a 360 TPD Gold Processing Plant Sepro supplied to ProEurasia LCC for the Vladimirskaya Project in Russia. This included milling, gravity and smelting circuits.|$|R

5000|$|Aggregates {{themselves}} can be recycled as aggregates. Unlike deposits {{of sand and}} gravel or stone suitable for crushing into aggregate, which can be anywhere and may require overburden removal and/or blasting, [...] "deposits" [...] of recyclable aggregate tend to be concentrated near urban areas, and production from them cannot be raised or lowered to meet demand for aggregates. Supply of recycled aggregate depends on physical decay of structures and their demolition. The recycling plant can be fixed or mobile; the smaller capacity <b>mobile</b> <b>plant</b> works best for asphalt-aggregate recycling. The material being recycled is usually highly variable in quality and properties.|$|E

Nona treats Kirk with a Mahko root, a <b>mobile</b> <b>plant.</b> She cuts her own hand and presses it against the root over his wound ("Take this of my soul into thine..."). Kirk is fully healed by the small ceremony, and McCoy says he'd like to know more about the plant she used.

When the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power, its thermal efficiency is about 30%. However, it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it.

40|$|AbstractCellular and {{physiological}} evidence suggests {{the presence of}} a novel class of systemically <b>mobile</b> <b>plant</b> molecules that are recognized by antibodies against vertebrate atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs). In order to characterize the function of these immunoanalogues we have expressed the full-length recombinant (AtPNP-A[1 – 126]) and demonstrate that this molecule induces osmoticum-dependent H 2 O uptake into protoplasts at nanomolar concentrations and thus affects cell volume. A similar response is also seen with a recombinant that does not contain the signal peptide (AtPNP-A[26 – 126]) as well as a short domain (AtPNP-A[33 – 66]) that shows homology to the vertebrate peptide. Taken together, these findings suggest that AtPNP-A has an important and systemic role in plant growth and homeostasis...|$|E
