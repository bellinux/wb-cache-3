25|$|On 20 May 1967, {{at a site}} not {{far from}} the 1962–1964 Little Brickhill finds, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>digger</b> {{uncovered}} a hoard of 296 denarii from the 1st to 2nd century. Hearth tools, pottery, and a fragment of whetstone were also found. Five of the coins are now at the British Museum and the remainder are at the Buckinghamshire County Museum.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, {{a service}} trench had been {{excavated}} {{in the adjacent}} Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A. Eldridge published this discovery in the Archaeologica Cantiana journal, suggesting that {{there might have been}} a building dating to Roman Britain nearby. In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the derelict site at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation took place at the site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a <b>mechanical</b> <b>digger</b> to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M. Bowen, curator of Orpington Museum, where the site finds were initially stored.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{decision}} by RUC Chief Constable Hugh Annesley to ban the Orange parade through the Garvaghy Road area of Portadown {{in the summer of}} 1996, a protest campaign of road blockages and general disruption was organised across Northern Ireland by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The protests, which led to a reversal of the ban, saw no official UVF involvement although Wright, despite not {{being a member of the}} Orange Order, was personally involved and led a sizeable force of his men to Drumcree. Wright and the Mid-Ulster Brigade attracted considerable attention from the global media as they made a formidable show of strength and staunchly defended the Orangemen's right to march their traditional route. The brigade manned the barricades, and brought homemade weapons to the church; among these was a <b>mechanical</b> <b>digger</b> and a petrol tanker. There was intelligence that Wright and his unit had planned to attack the British Army and police who were blocking the Orangemen's passage. Television cameras broadcast Wright directing rioters on Drumcree hill against the security forces. Wright even held a meeting with one of the central figures in the operation, UUP leader David Trimble, and he was often seen in the company of Harold Gracey, Grand Master of the Portadown District Orange Lodge.|$|E

500|$|During {{its entire}} operation, Treblinka I's commandant was Sturmbannführer Theodor van Eupen. He ran the camp with several SS men and almost 100 Hiwi guards. The quarry, spread over {{an area of}} , {{supplied}} road construction material for German military use and {{was part of the}} strategic road-building programme in the war with the Soviet Union. It was equipped with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>digger</b> for shared use by both Treblinka I and II. Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Ząbecki, the local station master, Eupen often killed prisoners by [...] "taking shots at them, as if they were partridges". A widely feared overseer was Untersturmführer Franz Schwarz, who executed prisoners with a pickaxe or hammer.|$|E
500|$|South of {{the terrace}} lawn are the Upper and Lower lakes, scene of Churchill's most ambitious {{landscaping}} schemes. The Lower lake had existed during the Colquhouns' ownership, but the island within it, and the Upper lake, were Churchill's own creations. On 1 January 1935, while Lady Churchill {{was on a}} cruise off Sumatra, Churchill described the beginnings of his endeavours {{in one of his}} Chartwell Bulletins; [...] "I have arranged to have one of those great mechanical diggers. In one week he can do more than 40 men can do. There is no difficulty about bringing him in as he is a caterpillar and can walk over the most sloppy fields". Excavation work proved more challenging than Churchill had anticipated, two weeks later he wrote again, [...] "The <b>mechanical</b> <b>digger</b> has arrived. He moves about on his caterpillars only with the greatest difficulty on this wet ground".|$|E
500|$|The {{third section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 3, {{also called the}} upper camp) was the main killing zone with gas {{chambers}} at its centre. It was completely screened from the railway tracks by an earth bank built {{with the help of}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>digger.</b> This mound was elongated in shape, similar to a retaining wall, and can be seen in a sketch produced during the 1967 trial of Treblinka II commandant Franz Stangl. On the other sides, the zone was camouflaged from new arrivals like the rest of the camp, using tree branches woven into barbed wire fences by the Tarnungskommando (the work detail led out to collect them). From the undressing barracks there was a fenced-off path leading through the forested area into the gas chambers. It was cynically called die Himmelstraße ("the road to heaven") or der Schlauch ("the tube") by the SS. For the first eight months of the camp's operation, the excavator was used to dig burial ditches on both sides of the gas chambers; these ditches were [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] deep. In early 1943, they were replaced with cremation pyres up to [...] long, with rails laid across the pits on concrete blocks. The 300 prisoners who operated the upper camp lived in separate barracks behind the gas chambers.|$|E

It was originally called the [...] "Collingtree site" [...] but the county council finally referred to it as the Milton site in late 2008. It has so far not been developed probably due to its triangular shape and stranded location between the motorway along one edge, the railway line another and a road unsuited to heavy lorries on the third.

Each tunnel has an approximate excavated diameter of 11.6 m. A 200 mm shotcrete primary lining provided the initial support for the tunnel. At the southern end, where tunneling passed through the Lower Hythe sands, the primary lining was supplemented with 4 m [...] "pins" [...] to provide more support.|$|R

50|$|Further {{iron ore}} {{quarries}} were {{opened to the}} west of the village in about 1873,operating to the north of the Gayton Road until 1895 and south of the road from 1895 to about 1913. Horse Tramways connected these quarries eastwards to the canal and westwards to the railway. A new quarry operated to the south of these in 1942 and 1943 and between 1954 and 1967. This was the only iron quarry at Blisworth to use <b>mechanical</b> <b>diggers.</b> They were electric and diesel powered. The quarry was connected by standard gauge steam operated tramway to sidings on the railway at Gayton south of Blisworth Junction on the line to Towcester. The ore was taken to Scunthorpe and South Wales for smelting. A few traces of all of these quarries remain mainly in the form of depressed field levels and some buildings connected with the later quarry.|$|R

Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego's Future Lab, the Danish toy company's experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company's robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.|$|R

5000|$|This {{describes}} the use in excavations {{of various types}} and sizes of machines from small backhoes to heavy duty earth-moving machinery. Machines are often used in what is called salvage or rescue archaeology in developer-led excavation when there are financial or time pressures. Using a mechanical excavator is the quickest method to remove soil and debris and to prepare the surface for excavation by hand, taking care to avoid damaging archaeological deposits by accident or to {{make it difficult to}} identify later precisely where finds were located. The use of such machinery is often routine (as it is for instance with the British archaeological television series Time Team) but can also be controversial as it can result in less discrimination in how the archaeological sequence on a site is recorded. One of the earliest uses of earth-moving machinery was at Durrington Walls in 1967. An old road through the henge was to be straightened and improved and was going to cause considerable damage to the archaeology. Rosemary Hill describes how Geoffrey Wainwright [...] "oversaw large, high-speed excavations, taking bulldozers to the site in a manner that shocked some of his colleagues but yielded valuable if tantalising information about what Durrington had looked like and how it might have been used." [...] Machines are used primarily to remove modern overburden and for the control of spoil. In British archaeology <b>mechanical</b> <b>diggers</b> are sometimes nicknamed [...] "big yellow trowels".|$|R
50|$|The Aum group {{traveled}} with chemicals and mining equipment {{on which they}} paid over $20,000 in excess baggage fees. According to the Australian Federal Police report, among the baggage was a <b>mechanical</b> ditch <b>digger,</b> picks, petrol generators, gas masks, respirators, and shovels. A Customs duty of over $15,000 was paid to import these items. Because of {{the large amount of}} excess baggage being brought in by the group, Australian Customs searched the entire group. This search revealed four liters of concentrated hydrochloric acid, including some in containers marked as hand soap. Among the other chemicals that Australian customs officials found were ammonium chloride, sodium sulphate, perchloric acid, and ammonium water. All of the chemicals and some of the laboratory equipment were seized by Australian authorities.|$|R
50|$|The {{television}} camera on Surveyor 3 {{consisted of a}} vidicon tube, two 25 and 100 millimeter focal length lenses, shutters, filters, and an iris mounted along an axis inclined about 16 degrees to the central axis of the spacecraft. The TV camera was mounted under a mirror that could be moved in azimuth (horizontally) and elevation (vertically). The operation of the camera was completely dependent upon the receipt of proper commands from the Earth. Frame-by-frame coverage of the lunar surface was obtained over the complete 360 degrees in azimuth, and from +40 degrees above the plane normal to the camera's Z-axis to −65 degrees below this plane. Both 600-line and 200-line modes of TV camera operation were used. The 200-line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame every 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200-line picture required 20 seconds and used a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. The 600-line pictures were transmitted over a directional antenna. These pictures were scanned as often as once every 3.6 seconds. Each 600-line picture required a nominal one second to be read from the image vidicon, and its transmission required a 220 kHz bandwidth, using digital picture transmission. The TV photos were displayed back on the Earth on a slow-scan TV monitor that was coated with a long-persistence phosphor. Its persistence had been selected to match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV photo, and the picture was displayed in real-time at a rate compatible {{with that of the}} incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic-tape recorder. The camera returned 6315 pictures between April 20 and May 3, 1967, including views of the spacecraft itself, panoramic lunar surveys, views of the <b>mechanical</b> surface <b>digger</b> at work, and of an eclipse of the Sun by the Earth.|$|R
