5|$|Jill Foster {{was born}} in Genoa City, Wisconsin. She is raised by her mother, Liz Foster, and her two older brothers, Snapper (David Hasselhoff) and Greg (Wings Hauser). The family struggles {{to make ends meet}} and things aren't easy when their father, Bill {{abandons}} them. Jill must work alongside her mother to help put her brothers through college. She works as a <b>manicurist</b> and also has aspirations of being a model. In 2003, Jill's birth certificate confirmed the year of her birth as 1957.|$|E
5|$|When she debuted, Jill was an 18-year-old <b>manicurist</b> {{working to}} support her {{struggling}} family. The character is known for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper); it is the longest feud {{in the history of}} American soap operas. Their rivalry began when she fell in love and slept with Katherine's husband Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and became pregnant. Following Phillip's accidental death, the women fought over custody of Jill's son, Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz), as well as numerous of Katherine's other husbands. A 2003 plot twist shockingly revealed Jill to be Katherine's long lost biological daughter, although in 2009, former head writer Maria Arena Bell rewrote their history, reversing that decision. In 2010, Jill discovered she is the daughter of Neil Fenmore (Jim Storm).|$|E
5|$|Jill, a <b>manicurist</b> {{working to}} support her family, befriends the wealthy Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), who hires her as a {{personal}} assistant. However, things turn sour when Jill has an affair with Kay's neglected husband who didn't love her, Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes). Jill ends up pregnant, and Phillip divorces Kay in the Dominican Republic. Kay offered to drive him home from the airport, but ends up running the car over a cliff, killing him. On his death bed, he invalidly married Jill. Kay offered Jill $1 million for her baby, which she declined. She gave birth to Phillip Chancellor III (eventually portrayed by Thom Bierdz) in 1976. She romances David Mallory, who was the recipient of her late father Bill's eye cornea. However, she never loved him. He proposed, but she declines after Liz warned her of a loveless marriage. She {{had an affair with}} Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue) and later romanced Stuart Brooks (Robert Colbert), whose wife Jennifer had just died. He was really in love with her mother Liz, but Jill tricked him into marriage following a one-night stand. He left her after she faked a pregnancy and miscarriage. Jill wanted to reunite with Derek, who marries Katherine after she promised him a salon and a $100,000 trust for Jill's son. Derek's ex-wife Suzanne Lynch (Ellen Weston) arrives in town and wanted him back. Kay was briefly presumed dead and finding himself free of Suzanne and Kay, Derek planned to marry Jill. Kay showed up alive at the wedding and reclaimed her life with Derek.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>Manicurists</b> {{are exposed}} to various {{chemicals}} in nail and skin care products and may develop ocular, nasal, respiratory or skin adverse reactions to them. To investigate the occurrence of ocular, nasal, respiratory and skin problems among <b>manicurists</b> and to identify their causal factors, particularly allergic etiology and occupational origin. Material and Methods: <b>Manicurists</b> employed in beauty salons in the central region of Poland were invited {{to fill in the}} questionnaire and undergo medical examination, skin prick tests with common aeroallergens, patch tests with European Baseline Series and (Meth) Acrylates Series-Nails and spirometry. Results: In the questionnaire adverse nasal symptoms were reported by 70 %, ocular – by 58 %, respiratory – by 42 %, hand eczema – by 43 % of <b>manicurists.</b> In the medical interview, the frequency of those complaints was lower: nasal ones – 41 %, ocular – 24 %, cough – 18 %, hand skin dryness – 20 %, hand eczema – 6 %. Cough and hand skin dryness occurred significantly more frequently than in the case of controls. Contact allergy was found for 41 % of <b>manicurists</b> and 35 % of controls. The prevalence of nickel sensitization was high in both groups (38 % and 27 %, respectively). Only 3 <b>manicurists</b> reacted to (meth) acrylates. The frequency of atopic diseases was similar in compared groups. Irritant nasal and respiratory reactions were significantly more prevalent among <b>manicurists</b> (nasal – 18 % vs. 2 %, p < 0. 01; respiratory – 18 % vs. 1 %, p < 0. 001). Work-related nasal irritant reactions were finally diagnosed for 19 %, ocular ones – for 13 %, respiratory – for 18 % and within hand skin – for 23 % of <b>manicurists.</b> Conclusions: The frequency of workattributed irritant mucosal and skin symptoms among <b>manicurists</b> is high. Exposure to acrylates is an important source of mucosal irritant reactions while occlusive gloves cause irritation of hand skin. The prevalence of nickel allergy among Polish females is high.

25|$|Von Teese {{was born}} in Rochester, Michigan, the second of three daughters. Her father was a {{machinist}} and her mother a <b>manicurist.</b> She is of English, Scottish, Armenian, and German heritage. Dita has stated {{that one of her}} grandmothers was half-Armenian and adopted into an Anglo-Saxon American family. Von Teese is known for her fascination with 1940s cinema and classic vintage style. This began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for her daughter to dress up. Her mother was a fan of old, Golden Age-era Hollywood films, and from her Von Teese developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially Betty Grable.|$|E
500|$|Jill {{is known}} as a {{business}}woman, after working as a <b>manicurist</b> during her youth.

500|$|The next {{films in}} which Lombard {{appeared}} were Henry Hathaway's Now and Forever (1934), featuring Gary Cooper {{and the new}} child star Shirley Temple, and Lady by Choice (1934), which was a critical and commercial success. The Gay Bride (1934) placed her opposite Chester Morris in a gangster comedy, but this outing was panned by critics. After reuniting with George Raft for another dance picture, Rumba (1935), Lombard was {{given the opportunity to}} repeat the screwball success of Twentieth Century. In [...] Mitchell Leisen's Hands Across the Table (1935), she portrayed a <b>manicurist</b> in search of a rich husband, played by Fred MacMurray. Critics praised the film, and Photoplays reviewer stated that Lombard had reaffirmed her talent for the genre. It is remembered as one of her best films, and the pairing of Lombard and MacMurray proved so successful that they made three more pictures together.|$|E

40|$|Although {{many people}} believe that {{immigrants}} displace native workers, most economic research finds that immigration has little or no adverse effect on natives’ employment outcomes. An unusual opportunity to explore this question {{in the context of a}} narrowly defined labor market is afforded by the influx of Vietnamese immigrants into California’s market for <b>manicurists.</b> Over the years 1987 – 2002, the number of these new entrants (35, 700) slightly exceeded the total number of <b>manicurists</b> in California in 1987 (35, 500). Using data for 34 metropolitan areas over the 16 -year period, the authors estimate that for every five Vietnamese who entered the market, two non-Vietnamese were displaced. This displacement appears to have been primarily due to a reduction in the number of non-Vietnamese entering the occupation rather than to an increase in the number of current <b>manicurists</b> leaving it...|$|R

2500|$|When Arthur Bourchier, who {{had married}} Violet Vanbrugh, {{launched}} {{himself as an}} actor-manager, Vanbrugh joined them at the Royalty Theatre, winning good notices in The Chili Widow and {{in the title role}} of the comedy Kitty Clive. She went with the Bourchier company to America, and on her return in 1898 she created Rose in Trelawny of the Wells by Arthur Pinero, and, during the same season, Stella in Robert Marshall's His Excellency the Governor. After a short break she then played the role that made her name, Sophy Fullgarney in Pinero's The Gay Lord Quex (1899). This part, a little Cockney <b>manicurist,</b> was quite different from any she had played before, but Pinero was insistent that she should play it. In the words of the biographer S. R. Littlewood, [...] "Vanbrugh's intelligence, sympathy, and alertness avoided extravagance in a subtle expression of class-contrast. This gave the character an intensity of appeal that was at the time something quite new." [...] The play was regarded as risqué, and one critic commented that had Lewis Carroll still been alive, he would have approved of [...] "Miss Vanbrugh's greatest triumph," [...] but probably not of the play.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} decade the Overland's {{connection}} at Ogden to and from San Francisco was with the eastbound Atlantic Express and westbound Pacific Express until October 15, 1899 when the SP inaugurated its own new Overland Limited (TR1&2) which became the UP's identically named Ogden to Omaha/Council Bluffs train providing 71-hour through service. The SP described its new first class train as [...] "An Elegant Solid Vestibuled Train of Composite Car, with library, Smoking Parlor, Buffet, etc. Luxurious Double Drawing-room Sleeping Cars, Dining Car. The Fastest Overland service {{in the history of}} transcontinental railroading." [...] On January 1, 1913 the Overland Limited became an extra-fare ($10) train when it further cut its running time from 68 to 64 hours and added amenities such as a barber, <b>manicurist,</b> stenographer, bath, etc. Known variously as both the Overland Limited and San Francisco Overland Limited for the next 32 years, on May 31, 1931 the service again became the San Francisco Overland Limited when its train numbers changed from [...] "1 and 2" [...] to [...] "27 and 28", and on July 10, 1947 the designation [...] "Limited" [...] was dropped from the name altogether.|$|E
