40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{recursive}} procedure {{to estimate the}} microcanonical density of states in multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations which relies only on <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> of the energy distribution, avoiding entirely the need for energy histograms. This method yields directly a piecewise analytical approximation to the microcanonical inverse temperature, β(E), and allows improved control over the statistics and efficiency of the simulations. We demonstrate its utility in connection with recently proposed schemes for improving the efficiency of multicanonical sampling, either with adjustment of the asymptotic energy distribution or with the replacement of single spin flip dynamics with collective updates.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} impact of finite {{particle}} losses associated with instrumental effects in <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> of produced multiplicities with the Identity Method towards the evaluation of fluctuation measures such as ν_dyn. We show that the identity method remains applicable provided it is modified to determine factorial moments 〈 N(N- 1) 〉, rather than moments 〈 N^ 2 〉. We further show that ν_dyn remains robust if detection efficiencies are uniform across the measurement's acceptance. The robustness is lost, however, if detection efficiencies are momentum dependent, although the identity methods remains applicable provided detection efficiencies can be determined with sufficient accuracy.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} first <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> of the hadronic n_X^ 2 distribution {{measured in}} inclusive semileptonic decays of B mesons to final states containing a charm quark, B-&gt;Xc l nu. The variable n_X^ 2 {{is a combination}} of the invariant mass of the charmed meson m_X, its energy in the B-meson rest-frame E_X, and a constant Λ̃ = 0. 65 GeV, n_X^ 2 = m_X^ 2 c^ 4 - 2 Λ̃ E_X + Λ̃^ 2. The moments &lt;n_X^k&gt; with k= 2, 4, 6 are measured as proposed by theory to constrain assumptions made in the theoretical description of inclusive observables in semileptonic B-meson decays. This description uses Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE), an effective QCD combined with an Operator Product Expansion. The measurement is based on a sample of 231. 6 million e+e- -&gt; Y(4 S) -&gt; BB̅ events recorded with the BABAR experiment at the PEP-II e+e [...] storage rings at SLAC. We reconstruct the semileptonic decay by identifying a charged lepton in events tagged by a fully reconstructed hadronic decay of the second B meson. Correction procedures are derived from Monte Carlo simulations to ensure an unbiased measurement of the moments of the n_X^ 2 distribution. All moments are measured requiring minimum lepton momenta between 0. 8 GeV/c and 1. 9 GeV/c in the rest frame of the B meson. Performing a simultaneous fit to the measured moments &lt;n_X^k&gt; up to order k= 6 combined with other <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> of the lepton-energy spectrum in decays B-&gt;Xc l nu and moments of the photon-energy spectrum in decays B-&gt;Xs gamma, we determine the quark-mixing parameter |V_cb|, the bottom and charm quark masses, the semileptonic branching fraction BR(B-&gt;X l nu), and four non-perturbative heavy quark parameters. Using HQE calculations in the kinetic scheme up to order 1 /m_b^ 3 we find |V_cb| = (41. 65 +- 0. 43 +- 0. 40 +- 0. 58) x 10 ^- 3 and m_b = (4. 570 ± 0. 033 ± 0. 043) GeV/c^ 2, where the first uncertainty refers to experimental contributions, the second to uncertainties in the HQE, and the third to theoretical uncertainties in the calculations of the semileptonic decay rate. All obtained results are consistent with previous determinations. The inclusion of the moments &lt;n_X^ 6 &gt; decreases the uncertainty on the HQE parameters mu_pi and rho_D. Furthermore, the theoretical treatment of higher order corrections in the HQE used for the moments &lt;m_X^k&gt; has been verified with these new measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We have united an {{immersive}} dynamic {{virtual environment}} with motion of a posture platform to record biomechanical and physiological responses to combined visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs. A 6 degree-of-freedom force plate provides <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> exerted {{on the base}} of support. Kinematic data from the head, trunk, and lower limb is collected using 3 -D video motion analysis. The virtual image is projected via a stereo-capable projector mounted behind the back-projection screen. This system allows us to explore complex behaviors necessary for rehabilitation. We are currently examining how a dynamic visual field affects posture and spatial orientation, and whether visual task demands interfere with our ability to react to a loss of balance in healthy adults and in adults with labyrinthine deficit. Our data suggest that when there is a confluence of meaningful inputs, none of the inputs are suppressed in healthy adults; the postural response is modulated by all existing sensory signals in a non-additive fashion. Labyrinthine deficient adults suppress visual inputs. Individual perception of the sensory structure also appears to be a significant component of the postural response in these protocols. We will discuss the implications of these results for the design of clinical interventions for balance disorders...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Virtual environments (VE) are a {{powerful}} tool for various forms of rehabilitation. Coupling VE with high-speed networking [Tele-Immersion] that approaches speeds of 100 Gb/sec can greatly expand its influence in rehabilitation. Accordingly, these new networks will permit various peripherals attached to computers on this network to be connected and to act as fast as if connected to a local PC. This innovation may soon allow the development of previously unheard of networked rehabilitation systems. Rapid advances in this technology need to be coupled with an understanding of how human behavior is affected when immersed in the VE. Methods This paper will discuss various forms of VE that are currently available for rehabilitation. The characteristic of these new networks and examine how such networks might be used for extending the rehabilitation clinic to remote areas will be explained. In addition, we will present data from an immersive dynamic virtual environment united with motion of a posture platform to record biomechanical and physiological responses to combined visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs. A 6 degree-of-freedom force plate provides <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> exerted on the base of support. Kinematic data from the head, trunk, and lower limb was collected using 3 -D video motion analysis. Results Our data suggest that when there is a confluence of meaningful inputs, neither vision, vestibular, or proprioceptive inputs are suppressed in healthy adults; the postural response is modulated by all existing sensory signals in a non-additive fashion. Individual perception of the sensory structure appears to be a significant component of the response to these protocols and underlies much of the observed response variability. Conclusion The ability to provide new technology for rehabilitation services is emerging as an important option for clinicians and patients. The use of data mining software would help analyze the incoming data to provide both the patient and the therapist with evaluation of the current treatment and modifications needed for future therapies. Quantification of individual perceptual styles in the VE will support development of individualized treatment programs. The virtual environment can be a valuable tool for therapeutic interventions that require adaptation to complex, multimodal environments. </p...|$|E
