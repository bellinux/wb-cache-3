500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] Bush had said in June 2008, [...] "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. <b>My</b> <b>administration</b> has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So <b>my</b> <b>administration</b> has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|E

[...] While slavery was not the stated goal nor Cuba mentioned by name, the antebellum makeup of his party required the Northerner to appeal to Southern interests, so he favored the annexation of Cuba as a slave state. To this end, he appointed expansionists to diplomatic posts throughout Europe, notably sending Pierre Soulé, an outspoken proponent of Cuban annexation, as United States Minister to Spain. The Northerners in his cabinet were fellow doughfaces (Northerners with Southern sympathies) such as Buchanan, who was made Minister to Great Britain after a failed bid for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention, and Secretary of State William L.

40|$|This is a {{theoretical}} paper that gives direction {{as to how}} Administrative Quality at a university can be measured on an interval scale. There are no service quality measures available for universities. The best-researched service quality measures come from the business area and, in particular, the scale SERVQUAL (Parasuraman, Zeitham]. 2 ̆ 6 Berry, 1985, 1994) for measuring customer services. The measure for my paper is oriented towards service quality. {{it is based on}} a model of academic staff perceptions in relation to Central, Faculty or School administration (as the case may be) for the quality of service provided to academics. The Australian government has set up a new Australian University Quality Agency in 2001 and one of its objectives is to measure quality in administration (management). Academic staff perceptions of Administrative Quality are proposed to consist of two 1 st order aspects, operationally defined by a number of 2 nd order aspects. These are: Reliability and Responsiveness (Administrative Contact, Provision of Administrative Material, Confident and Dependable Administrative Advice and Advanced Notice of Administrative Changes), and Assurance and Empathy (Courteousness and Confidence in Contact, Individual and Understanding Contact and Feeling Secure Contact). The 21 stem-items measuring each 2 nd order aspect are set up in Guttman patterns, conceptually ordered by increasing 2 ̆ 7 difficulty 2 ̆ 7. Academics are asked to respond to each of the 21 stem-items in two parts, conceptually ordered from 2 ̆ 7 easy 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 hard 2 ̆ 7 : Ideally, This is what I think <b>my</b> university <b>administration</b> should do (2 ̆ 7 easy 2 ̆ 7), and This is what <b>my</b> university <b>administration</b> actually does (2 ̆ 7 hard 2 ̆ 7). This model has been pilot tested successfully with a small sample (N= 27) and is now ready for a full test...|$|R

Fitzwilliam wrote to Lord Grey on 28 January 1827 that [...] "If this lack of emancipation is to go on till you have war with a foreign power, from that instant you lose Ireland".

The visit sparked admonition from the Chinese government, which called Abe's visits to Yasukuni [...] "an effort to glorify the Japanese militaristic history of external invasion and colonial rule... and to challenge the outcome of World War II," [...] as well as regret from Russia. The United States urged Japan to improve relations with neighbors after Yasukuni controversy.

40|$|When {{a doctor}} is investigated, or {{subjected}} to sham peer review, or prosecuted, or delicensed, the most common response by physicians is—silence. Others comment that “there are bad apples out there. ” And they tend to trust the process because physicians are involved in it. When they came for J. Philip Smith, doctors might have said: “I didn’t speak up because I don’t run Medicare subacute care facilities. ” When they came for Andy Wakefield, “I didn’t speak up because I support the current process for mandating vaccines. ” When they came for John Minarcik, “I didn’t speak up because I don’t {{have a problem with}} exclusive hospital contracts or <b>my</b> hospital <b>administration.</b> ” When they came for Billy Hurwitz, “I didn’t speak up because I don’t treat chronic pain with high-dose opioids. ” Do good doctors need to worry that the hospital, the medical board, or federal prosecutors might come for them? All doctors are under scrutiny by the medical board, which will probably be involved eventually in any kind of question about a doctor. AAPS has received complaints about abusive procedures by medical boards nationwide.

Why are there so many schools in the state of Wisconsin that are called the University of Wisconsin? Are all universities independent from each other like the ones in Michigan are? Does any university allow students on its Board of Regents? This senior thesis is my opportunity to research and learn the answers to many of my questions regarding public higher education. Since many of my questions are quite vague and have expansive responses, I have narrowed my study down to three case-study states: Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan.
