500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E

2500|$|While {{they lived}} in San Diego, Wyatt raced Otto Rex, the horse he had won in a card game. The horse was a {{frequent}} winner and sometimes Wyatt bought Josephine some jewelry with the proceeds. To feed her gambling habit, Josephine would pawn the jewelry to millionaire Lucky Baldwin, but Wyatt would later buy the jewelry back. Josephine eventually sold virtually all of her jewelry to Baldwin. Josephine was addicted to gambling on horse racing and her wagering increased until Wyatt gave her an ultimatum. [...] "You're not a smart gambler. And you have no business risking money that way. Now after this I'm not going to redeem any <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> jewelry." [...] He also told Baldwin to stop loaning money to Josephine, but she continued to gamble anyway. [...] He was furious about her gambling habit, during which she lost considerable sums of money.|$|E

2500|$|While {{serving as}} Assembly Speaker, Brown was {{diagnosed}} with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that still has no cure and that would slowly steal his eyesight. RP is a hereditary disease that causes a continual loss of peripheral vision and often leads to total blindness. Brown's two sisters were also diagnosed with RP. Brown remarked, [...] "Having RP is a challenge, as Speaker of the Assembly {{it was very important}} that I recognize people in the halls of the Legislature. But I couldn't see people unless they were right in front of me. I needed to have the security people give me notes to tell me who was in the room. Reading is also very difficult so I use larger print notes and memos. Living with RP means having to use <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> brain function—I listen more intently, I memorize vast amounts of information, and I have trained my computer to recognize numerous verbal commands." [...] Brown has worked with the Foundation Fighting Blindness to raise awareness of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|As captain, he {{suffered}} a lack of support from Geoffrey Boycott, who had hoped to be appointed captain instead, and these tensions contributed to the downfall of Denness as a skipper. [...] Boycott played in the first 6 Tests with Denness as captain, including the five matches in the 1–1 drawn series in the West Indies and the first Test of a 3–0 whitewash against India, during which Denness scored his first two Test centuries, but then Boycott then refused to play under Denness and remained out of the Test team until 1977. [...] After a 0–0 drawn three-match series against Pakistan at home in 1974, his boycott left England exposed in several matches against the fast bowling of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in the Ashes series in Australia in 1974-5. [...] Denness dropped himself from the England team for the 4th Test at Sydney after scoring only 65 runs in 6 innings (6, 26, 2, 20, 8, 2) {{in the first three}} Tests, although he was selected again for the 5th Test in Adelaide after his replacement John Edrich was injured, and achieving his highest Test score of 188 at Melbourne in the 6th Test to win by an innings. [...] The victory was little consolation, as Australia had already won four of the six matches in the series. [...] Once while in Australia, Denness received an envelope that had been sent with the address [...] "Mike Denness, cricketer". The letter inside read, [...] "Should this reach you, the post office clearly thinks <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ability than I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beresford {{and other}} Irish {{supporters}} of Ascendancy were alarmed at Fitzwilliam's policies. Pitt wrote to Fitzwilliam on 9 February that Beresford's removal was never [...] "to my recollection...hinted at {{even in the}} most distant manner...much less...without his consent" [...] and that he should have discussed it at the meeting held on 15 November. Furthermore, Fitzwilliam's policies were [...] "in contradiction to the ideas which I thought were fully understood among us. ... On most of these points I should have written to your lordship sooner but the state of public business has really not left me the time of doing so; and it is not without very deep regret that I feel myself under the necessity of interrupting your attention by considerations of this sort while there are so many others of a different nature which all our minds ought to be directed". On 14 February Fitzwilliam replied that it was support national security that he made those appointments: the disaffection amongst Catholics was great and so a change in direction was needed to retain Ireland. His fears of Beresford's [...] "power and influence" [...] had been [...] "too well founded: I found them incompatible with mine...and after the receipt of this, you will be prepared to decide between Mr Beresford and me and that the matter is come to this issue is well known here". Fitzwilliam asserted that he had already informed Pitt of his intention to remove Beresford and he had [...] "made no objection, nor, indeed, any reply", which he took to mean the decision was at his discretion. If Pitt refused his advise, he should be recalled: [...] "These are not times for the fate of the empire to be trifled with. ... I will deliver over the country in the best state I can to any person, who possesses <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> confidence".|$|E
