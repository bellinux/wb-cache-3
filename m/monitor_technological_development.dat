40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore and {{illustrate}} a possible use of densification, a metric derived from network theory, to shed light into the evolution of three renewable energy technologies. The combination of the statistical analysis of publications (bibliometrics) and network analysis allows <b>monitoring</b> <b>technological</b> <b>developments</b> and can be used for the identification of emerging topics. Renewable energy has been addressed by the European Commission and in bibliometric studies e. g. On offshore wind energy, Tsai et al. (2016) identified technology development priorities, and Gao et al. (2016) reviewed worldwide progress of wind power prices. On solar photovoltaics, thermodynamics fundamentally limit efficiency, and there is much research on alternative approaches to improving efficiency and/or production costs. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS, providing energy from deep fractured rocks) is an emerging technology requiring significant development to reach commercial readiness, with innovation so far limited by costs, exploration risks and technological improvement needs.

40|$|At present, {{industries}} {{within the}} health and life science sector are moving towards one another resulting in new industries such as the medical nutrition industry. Medical nutrition products are specific nutritional compositions for intervention in disease progression and symptom alleviation. Industry convergence, described as the blurring of boundaries between industries, {{plays a crucial role}} in the shaping of new markets and industries. Assuming that the medical nutrition industry has emerged from the convergence between the food and pharma industries, it is crucial to research how and which distinct industry domains have contributed to establish this relatively new industry. The first two stages of industry convergence (knowledge diffusion and consolidation) are measured by means of patent analysis. First, the extent of knowledge diffusion within the medical nutrition industry is graphed in a patent citation interrelations network. Subsequently the consolidation based on technological convergence is determined by means of patent co-classification. Furthermore, the medical nutrition core domain and technology interrelations are measured by means of a cross impact analysis. This study proves that the medical nutrition industry is a result of food and pharma convergence. It is therefore crucial for medical nutrition companies to effectively <b>monitor</b> <b>technological</b> <b>developments</b> within as well as across industry boundaries. This study further reveals that although the medical nutrition industry’s core technology domain is food, <b>technological</b> <b>development</b> is mainly driven by pharmaceutical/pharmacological technologies Additionally, the result...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In 1994, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} began discussing a number of important scientific questions that could be addressed by drilling a series of short cores on the Antarctic continental shelf. The group adopted the name SHALDRIL, for SHALlow DRILling, and soon learned that the technology for high-quality sampling of the upper few hundred metersof the stratigraphic column was still lacking. After {{more than a decade of}} discussion and several years of detailed planning, SHALDRIL sailed from Punta Arenas, Chile, in March 2005. The objectives of this first SHALDRIL cruise are to demonstrate the feasibility of drilling from an icebreaker platform into the Antarctic continental shelf and to obtain cores from three different sedimentary sequences that previously have not been sampled. The principal objective of SHALDRIL originally was to <b>monitor</b> <b>technological</b> <b>developments</b> in shallow drilling from conventional icebreaking research vessels. In 2000, the SHALDRIL steering committee learned about new and improved drilling systems that can core through gravelly glacial deposits in water depths of several hundred meters and to subbottom depths of a few hundred meters(SHALDRIL Steering Committee, 2001). These systems can be operated from the icebreaking research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer (Fig. 1); thus, the long-term project has now entered the next phase of testing this proven drilling technology aboard a U. S. Antarctic Program vessel...|$|R

40|$|Companies {{acting on}} a global scale face {{increasing}} pressure to innovate. Timely access to relevant 'knowledge sources', such as research institutes, universities or technology based firms and, hence, the ability to <b>monitor</b> <b>technological</b> <b>developments</b> and establish relations with relevant centres of excellence is increasingly important. At the same time it is increasingly difficult to fulfill these tasks adequately. First of all, the amount of technological and market information has expanded at a high rate over the past twenty years and there are no signs that this trend will decrease in the near future. In addition, the number and geographical spreading of knowledge sources increased significantly {{and will continue to do}} so. The share of GL in the flow technological information has also increased due to rapid <b>technological</b> <b>developments,</b> increasing complexity of products as well as increasing globalisation of business and R&D. In addition the use of advanced information and communication technology has stimulated electronic production and supply of GL. Unfortunately, tapping relevant information from these huge electronic resources is not always easy due to lack of organisation, poor presentation of stored information and uncertainty about the reliability of knowledge sources. Despite the increasing communication support offered by internet, access to relevant grey literature very often still depends on the ability to communicate with authors, owners, or librarians. Good relations are often crucial to acquire specific documents in time. The ability to communicate with authors or owners is even more important if one wants to turn information into applicable knowledge. Real understanding and valuation of written information require discussions with the authors or other experts well acquainted with the contents. Communication barriers often become bottlenecks for collaboration which looks promising on the basis of paper information. With respect to accessing foreign knowledge sources, small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs are disadvantaged compared to large companies due to lack of resources. This particularly applies to many small "new technology based firms" manufacturing very specialised advanced products for which a European market is essential. Solving the problems outlined above requires European agreements and collaboration aimed at the organisation and management of information flows and repositories. In addition a favourable communication climate should be created to cross cultural and language borders. We believe that these objectives can only be met if knowledge transfer is supported by European networks of intermediary organisations focused on specific industrial or technological areas. First of all interest in and understanding of specific target groups shared by these organisations is essential for effective information management. Secondly common understanding of specific industrial target groups in different countries is essential to overcome the communication barriers mentioned above.

In 1995, R&D expenditures by Canadian affiliates, {{only in the}} United States, represented some US$ 1. 4 billion and employed some 6300 persons. Nearly 60 Canadian-owned and-controlled corporations conduct overseas R&D, mostly in the US, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia. Canadian corporations are performing commercial R&D abroad {{in order to support}} their manufacturing subsidiaries and to come closer to customers and markets. A secondary motivation is to hire skilled personnel, <b>monitor</b> foreign <b>technological</b> <b>development</b> and increase the inflow of new ideas into the corporation. They also chose friendly socio-political environments from a regulatory point of view. Technology transfer and adaptation to local markets is also an important mission of the foreign R&D establishment. Foreign R&D activities of Canadian firms are fairly decentralized and autonomous. Most of the foreign subsidiaries undertook R&D abroad before they were acquired by the Canadian corporation; also the number of Canadian managers was reduced and the R&D projects were usually decided in the affiliate. Three main types of expatriate R&D were found: a majority of the subsidiaries were producing goods in the same or related. industries as in Canada such as machines, transportation equipment or housing equipment. A second group of firms were vertically integrated firms, that conducted process research in Canada and advanced materials and final products research abroad, closer to the markets for this type of goods; they were active in the chemical and metal industries.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an envisioned technology roadmap {{for the development}} of mobile and wireless communications until the year 2010. The roadmap description is based on a 3 -years study (2001 - 2004) and <b>monitoring</b> of the <b>technological</b> <b>developments</b> of characteristically chosen mobile and wireless communication areas. The final definition of the technology roadmap was based on selected areas of high value that the authors consider as the corner aspects of the evolution of mobile communications. Two main groups of areas were defined and analyzed from a technological and from a service perspective. From technological perspective the areas of high research interest include radio technologies with effect on spectrum use, access and radio interface technologies, and technologies related to mobile terminals. From service perspective, we considered interactive broadcasting, location technologies and location based services (LBS) and personalization of services. The paper identifies the open issues to be solved to realize the future of wireless communications and describes the enabling technologies for next generation communications. It identifies the technology and non-technology barriers to development, deployment, as well as guidelines for the use of technology. Finally, a visionary scenario is described to illustrate the necessary evolution of the value chain for the successful deployment of any new service or technology. © Springer Science + Business Media LLC 2007...|$|R
