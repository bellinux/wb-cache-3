The attested markers of lesser relevance derive from a close reading of 40 lectures from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus {{and their use}} is documented with evidence from the whole BASE corpus of 160 lectures. Five basic types of markers were found, viz. markers of <b>message</b> <b>status</b> (e. g. irrelevant), topic treatment (e. g. briefly), lecturer knowledge (e. g. not remember), assessment (e. g. not learn), and attention and note-taking (e. g. ignore, not write down). Most markers denote partial relevance rather than irrelevance and require interpretation using contextual information. Some markers also have interpersonal functions. Our findings provide valuable input for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses aimed at improving lecture delivery, note-taking and comprehension, for subject lecturer training and for educational research. Since the study also addresses {{a gap in the}} literature on relevance marking, the results should also interest analysts of academic discourse specifically and spoken discourse generally...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus, {{this paper}} {{presents}} an overview of how lecturers mark important and less important discourse using verbal cues. Such relevance markers (e. g. the point is, remember, that is important, essentially) and markers of lesser relevance (e. g. anyway, a little bit, not go into, not write down) combine discourse organisation with evaluation and can help students discern {{the relative importance of}} points, thus aiding comprehension, note-taking and retention. However, until the research reported here was undertaken little was known about this metadiscursive feature of lecture discourse and markers found in the existing literature and EAP materials were rather few and typically not based on corpus linguistic evidence. Combining corpus-based and corpus-driven methods, the research started from a close reading of 40 lectures to identify candidate markers. These were next retrieved from the whole corpus {{and in the case of}} relevance markers supplemented with other approaches yielding further markers. Relevance markers were mainly classified into lexicogrammatical verb, noun, adjective and adverb patterns, while the markers of lesser relevance were classified pragmatically as indications of <b>message</b> <b>status,</b> topic treatment, lecturer knowledge, assessment, and attention and note-taking directives. This account of relevance marking is valuable for EAP practitioners, will interest lecturer trainers, and provides input for experimental research on lecture listening, note-taking and lecture effectiveness. Furthermore, the paper offers insights into the use of discourse markers such as “the thing is”, “anyway”, “I don’t know” and “et cetera” and illuminates the understudied linguistic phenomenon of relevance marking. Finally, it illustrates the importance of corpus linguistic research and touches upon some difficulties pertaining to assigning discourse functions based on an examination of transcripts only...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} British Academic Spoken English corpus to survey how lecturers {{verbally}} indicate comparatively (un) important points. Educational and EAP literature generally advocates discourse organizational signals to aid lecture comprehension, note-taking and recall. The ability {{to distinguish between}} points that merit special attention and those requiring less attention is arguably particularly beneficial, especially for non-native speakers. However, until the research reported here was undertaken we {{knew very little about}} how such ‘relevance marking’ was achieved. I present a wide variety of markers, which often are not the ones that intuitively come to mind and rarely refer to assessment. Some prevalent markers may furthermore be difficult to discern. The findings can be used in lecturer training, EAP courses in lecture listening and educational research. The paper summarizes the findings of two projects. The first on markers of important points (Authors 2012 a) combines a manual analysis of 40 lectures from different disciplines with other methods identifying further markers. The markers were then automatically retrieved from and quantified in all 160 lectures. They were mostly classified according to their main element (adjective, noun, verb, adverb) and how it forms a pattern with co-occurring elements. The predominant markers are ‘remember’ and constructions of ‘the point is’ type. The second study (Authors 2012 b) identified potential markers of less important information through a close reading of 40 lectures and retrieved instances from all 160 lectures. They were classified pragmatically as indications of <b>message</b> <b>status</b> (e. g. the detail is not pertinent), topic treatment (e. g. i’m not going to say very much about this), and teacher knowledge (e. g. I can’t remember), and as attention- and note-taking directives (e. g. don’t copy it down) and references to assessment (e. g. it won’t come up on an exam paper) ...|$|E
