In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E

Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island.

The latest work on performance analysis of the cloud computing gives approximated analytical model which provides relationship between the input buffer size and number of servers available. It also gives the performance parameters like task blocking probability, immediate service probability, departure probabilityetc. In current system, the analysis is done only at arrival of requests and departure of responses.

5|$|The {{details of}} the murder are sketchy. Carol was killed due to blunt trauma to her face by means of some instrument, alleged in court {{to have been an}} ice axe. She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown {{overboard}} from a boat on Coniston Water. The body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers. Had it been dropped a few metres further from the shore, it would have sunk to the <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> bottom and probably never have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At {{the opposite end of the}} scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself.

It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary Rock Bottom Creek from the right as its valley becomes <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest {{for more than a}} mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 before turning south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering Roaring Brook Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little Roaring Brook from the right before turning south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 before turning southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} shows a fictive Flemish city. As in the diptych in New York, some {{buildings and}} landmarks {{can be identified}} with Jerusalem. It closely resembles {{the background of the}} Rolin panel, which has undergone <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> attention from scholars, with a number of identifications made with structures in Jerusalem, including the Mosque of Omar, known to van Eyck through second-hand textual and visual descriptions. People and animals populate the city walls, but some are only visible under magnification in the Philadelphia painting. The lake by the city shows a boat whose shadow is reflected in the water. Reflective water surfaces were another typical Eyckian innovation, one he seems to have mastered early, evidenced by the water scenes in the Turin-Milan Hours, and which requires a considerable degree of artistry. Plants consist of tiny foreground flowers, larger mid-ground grasses and background bushes and trees. The small carpet of white flowers in the foreground is reminiscent of those in the Ghent Altarpieces central panel; behind Francis are dwarf palms.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating <b>much</b> <b>deeper</b> in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E
