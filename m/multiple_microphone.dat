The projection of the patient data using a single microphone yields significant corre-lations between the coordinates on the map and certain criteria of the disorder which were perceptually rated. However, projec-tion of data from <b>multiple</b> <b>microphones</b> reduces this correlation. Usually, the acoustical mismatch between the microphones {{is greater than the}} mismatch between the speakers, i. e., not the disorders but the microphones form clusters in the visualiza-tion.

40|$|Abstract—When {{performing}} speaker diarization on recordings from meetings, <b>multiple</b> <b>microphones</b> {{of different}} qualities are usually available and distributed around the meeting room. Although several approaches {{have been proposed}} {{in recent years to}} take advantage of <b>multiple</b> <b>microphones,</b> they are either too computationally expensive and not easily scalable or they can not outperform the simpler case of using the best single microphone. In this work the use of classic acoustic beamforming techniques is proposed together with several novel algorithms to create a complete frontend for speaker diarization in the meeting room domain. New techniques we are present include blind reference-channel selection, two-step Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA) Viterbi postprocessing, and a dynamic output signal weighting algorithm, together with using such TDOA values in the diarization to complement the acoustic information. Tests on speaker diarization show a 25 % relative improvement on the test set compared to using a single most centrally located microphone. Additional experimental results show improvements using these techniques in a speech recognition task.
