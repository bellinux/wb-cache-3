50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{pattern matching}} is {{the act of}} checking a given sequence of tokens {{for the presence of}} the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually has to be exact. The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures. Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations (if any) of a pattern within a token sequence, to output some component of the matched pattern, and to substitute the <b>matching</b> <b>pattern</b> with some other token sequence (i.e., search and replace).|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{approaches}} {{to the problem of}} mixture decomposition have been proposed, many of which focus on maximum likelihood methods such as expectation maximization (EM) or maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP).

Some notable departures are the graphical methods as outlined in Tarter and Lock [...] and more recently minimum message length (MML) techniques such as Figueiredo and Jain [...] and to some extent the moment <b>matching</b> <b>pattern</b> analysis routines suggested by McWilliam and Loh (2009).|$|E

40|$|A {{universal}} lossless {{data compression}} code called the multilevel <b>pattern</b> <b>matching</b> code (MPM code) is introduced. In processing a finite alphabet data string of length n, the MPM code operates at O(log log n) levels sequentially. At each level, the MPM code detects <b>matching</b> <b>patterns</b> in the input data string (substrings {{of the data}} appearing in two or more nonoverlapping positions). The <b>matching</b> <b>patterns</b> detected at each level are of a fixed length which decreases by a constant factor from level to level, until this fixed length becomes one at the final level. The MPM code represents information about the <b>matching</b> <b>patterns</b> at each level as a string of tokens, with each token string encoded by an arithmetic encoder. From the concatenated encoded token strings, the decoder can reconstruct the data string via several rounds of parallel substitutions. A O(1 = log n) maximal redundancy/sample upper bound is established for the MPM code with respect to any class of finite state sources of unifo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} task allocation {{schemes for}} MIN-based multiprocessors. Two types of allocation policies, cubic and noncubic, are discussed here. Conflicts through {{the network and}} inability to partition the system effectively are the main bottlenecks in a MIN-based system. To solve both the problems, a renaming scheme for input and output ports of a MIN is proposed. We use the baseline MIN as an example in this work and call the renaming scheme as bit reversal (BR) <b>matching</b> <b>pattern.</b> Allocation with the new <b>matching</b> <b>pattern</b> minimizes conflicts and partitions the system completely into independent subsystems. The novelty of this <b>matching</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is that we can}} use any dynamic cubic allocation and/or scheduling scheme developed for the hypercubes also for the MIN machines. The BR <b>matching</b> <b>pattern</b> can be used with any kind of MIN. An allocation policy for noncubic tasks is also presented with this <b>matching</b> <b>pattern.</b> Various performance measures with different allocation algorithms are compared via simulation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an application of}} a generalized suffix tree extended {{by the use of}} frequency of patterns, to perform accurate and faster biological sequence analysis as an improvement on the computation time of existing tools in this area. This application utilizes the knowledge of frequency of prefixes shared by two or more sequences in a generalized suffix tree, to identify with good accuracy, sequences in a database which are highly similar to a given query sequence. The speedup is achieved by reducing the size of the database to very few sequences which are found closest to the query sequence in question. This results in a faster computation. It can also be viewed as an extension of exact <b>pattern</b> <b>matching,</b> where cumulative results of <b>matched</b> <b>patterns</b> indicate the closest sequences. The specific strategy is to pick <b>matched</b> <b>patterns</b> of the query sequence and identify sequences in the database which share a large number of these <b>matched</b> <b>patterns.</b> Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that this application outperforms BLAST by obtaining a better computation time, while preserving the accuracy of alignments...|$|R

The JMatch {{language}} extends Java with iterable abstract pattern <b>matching,</b> <b>pattern</b> matching that {{is compatible}} with the data abstraction features of Java and makes iteration abstractions convenient.

Modal abstraction simplifies specification and implementation of abstract data types. This paper describes the JMatch language and its implementation. ...|$|E

40|$|We explore {{probabilistic}} lexico-syntactic <b>pattern</b> <b>matching,</b> {{also known}} as soft <b>pattern</b> <b>matching,</b> in a definitional question answering system. Most current systems use regular expression based hard <b>matching</b> <b>patterns</b> to identify definition sentences. Such rigid surface matching often fares poorly when faced with language variations. We propose two soft matching models to address this problem: one based on bigrams {{and the other on}} Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models provide a theoretically sound method to model <b>pattern</b> <b>matching</b> as a probabilistic process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We show that both models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art manually constructed hard <b>matching</b> <b>patterns</b> on recent TREC data. A critical difference between the two models is that the PHMM has a more complex topology. We experimentally show that the PHMM can handle language variations more effectively but requires more training data to converge. While we evaluate soft pattern models only on definitional question answering, we believe that both models are generic and can be extended to other areas where lexico-syntactic <b>pattern</b> <b>matching</b> can be applied...|$|R
