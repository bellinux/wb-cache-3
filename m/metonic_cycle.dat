25|$|The cycle {{was used}} in the Babylonian {{calendar}}, ancient Chinese calendar systems (the 'Rule Cycle' 章) and the medieval computus (i.e. the calculation of the date of Easter). It regulates the 19-year cycle of intercalary months of the modern Hebrew calendar. The start of the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> depends on which of these systems is being used; for Easter, {{the first year of the}} current <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> is 2014.|$|E
25|$|First, {{one must}} {{determine}} whether each year is an ordinary or leap year by {{its position in}} the 19-year <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are leap years.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a 19year cycle has existed in some form since the 4thcenturyBCE. The <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> {{represents}} an invented measure that approximately correlates solar and lunar markings of time and which appears in several calendar systems.|$|E
25|$|The Thai Chulasakarat {{calendar}} uses {{a slightly}} different method to place the intercalary day. Instead {{of it in a}} leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days. Both systems arrive at the same number of days in a 19-year cycle however. Furthermore, in contrast to Indian calendars, the Burmese calendar follows a <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> in which intercalary months are inserted on a set schedule. However, because the Burmese calendar has to adjust for the use of Indian-calendar-derived sidereal years with the Metonic cycle's tropical years, maintaining a set <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> has been a challenge.|$|E

25|$|Notes: 1. Astronomical Easter is {{the first}} Sunday after the Astronomical full moon.

25|$|Traditionally, for the Babylonian and Hebrew lunisolar calendars, {{the years}} 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long (13-month) {{years of the}} <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle.</b> This cycle, {{which can be used}} to predict eclipses, forms the basis of the Greek and Hebrew calendars, and is used for the {{computation}} of the date of Easter each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{calendar}} {{seems to}} have employed several schedules to determine which of the 19 years will be intercalary years. To find out which year will have an intercalary month, divide the Burmese year by 19. The quotient is the expired cycles.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Meton, axial {{precession}} {{had not yet been}} discovered, and he could not distinguish between sidereal years (currently: 365.256363 days) and tropical years (currently: 365.242190 days). Most calendars, like the commonly used Gregorian calendar, are based on the tropical year and maintain the seasons at the same calendar times each year. Nineteen tropical years are about two hours shorter than 235 synodic months. The <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle's</b> error is, therefore, one full day every 219 years, or 12.4 parts per million.|$|R
25|$|According to Livy, {{the king}} of Rome Numa Pompilius (753-673 BC) {{inserted}} intercalary months {{in such a way}} that in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started. As the twentieth year takes place nineteen years after the first year, this seems to indicate that the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> was applied to Numa's calendar.|$|E
25|$|Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 of the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> are leap years. To {{assist in}} remembering this sequence, some {{people use the}} {{mnemonic}} Hebrew word GUCHADZaT , where the Hebrew letters gimel-vav-het aleph-dalet-zayin-tet are used as Hebrew numerals equivalent to 3, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 9. The keviyah records whether the year is leap or common: פ for peshuta (פשוטה), meaning simple and indicating a common year, and מ indicating a leap year (me'uberet, מעוברת).|$|E
25|$|Historically the paschal {{full moon}} date {{for a year}} was found from its {{sequence}} number in the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle,</b> called the golden number, which cycle repeats the lunar phase on a certain date every 19 years. This method was abandoned in the Gregorian reform because the tabular dates go {{out of sync with}} reality after about two centuries, but from the epact method a simplified table can be constructed that has a validity of one to three centuries.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, Chulasakarat uses three {{similar but}} not {{identical}} types of lunar years {{used by the}} Burmese calendar. Each calendar has the same regular year of 354 days and a leap year of 384 days. However, whereas the Burmese calendar adds the intercalary day only in a leap cycle according to its <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle,</b> the Siamese calendar adds the intercalary day to a regular year. The Siamese calendar does add the extra day {{in the same place}} (Jyestha/Nayon), however.|$|E
25|$|The {{mean year}} of the current mathematically based Hebrew {{calendar}} is 365 days 5 hours 55 minutes and 25+25/57 seconds (365.2468 days) – computed as the molad/monthly interval of 29.530594 days × 235 months in a 19-year <b>metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> ÷ 19 years per cycle. In relation to the Gregorian calendar, the mean Gregorian calendar year is 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes and 12 seconds (365.2425 days), and the drift of the Hebrew calendar in relation to it is about a day every 231 years.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> equates to 235 lunar {{months in}} each 19-year cycle. This gives {{an average of}} 6939 days, 16 hours, and 595 parts for each cycle. But due to the Rosh Hashanah {{postponement}} rules (preceding section) a cycle of 19 Jewish years can be either 6939, 6940, 6941, or 6942 days in duration. Since none of these values is evenly divisible by seven, the Jewish calendar repeats exactly only following 36,288 Metonic cycles, or 689,472 Jewish years. There is a near-repetition every 247 years, except for an excess of about 50 minutes (905 parts).|$|E
25|$|The Runic {{calendar}} is {{a perpetual}} calendar {{based on the}} 19-year-long <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Also known as a Rune staff or Runic Almanac, {{it appears to have}} been a medieval Swedish invention. This calendar does not rely on knowledge of the duration of the tropical year or of the occurrence of leap years. It is set at the beginning of each year by observing the first full moon after the winter solstice. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is the Nyköping staff, which is believed to date from the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|In any case, the {{translation}} of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the cuneiform script, the language, and the procedures, so {{it seems likely that}} it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> like they did later), but started a new month based on observations of the New Moon. This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew lunar year {{is about}} eleven days {{shorter than the}} solar year and uses the 19-year <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> to bring it into line with the solar year, with the {{addition}} of an intercalary month every two or three years, for a total of seven times per 19 years. Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean tropical year, so that every 216 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean tropical year; and about every 231 years it will fall a day behind the mean Gregorian calendar year.|$|E
25|$|The Metonic Dial is {{the main}} upper dial on {{the rear of the}} mechanism. The <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle,</b> defined in several {{physical}} units, is 235 synodic months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.|$|E
25|$|The {{method for}} {{computing}} {{the date of}} the ecclesiastical full moon that was standard for the western Church before the Gregorian calendar reform, and is still used today by most eastern Christians, made use of an uncorrected repetition of the 19-year <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> in combination with the Julian calendar. In terms of the method of the epacts discussed above, it effectively used a single epact table starting with an epact of 0, which was never corrected. In this case, the epact was counted on 22 March, the earliest acceptable date for Easter. This repeats every 19 years, so there are only 19 possible dates for the paschal full moon from 21 March to 18 April inclusive.|$|E
25|$|In sum, {{both systems}} are about 24 minutes per year {{ahead of the}} actual {{tropical}} year; the systems' methods of intercalation fixes only their internal error; and Thandeikta slightly accelerates the annual drift. The accumulating error means the New Year's Day which used to fall near the vernal equinox at its launch in 638 now falls on 17 April in 2013—a drift of 15 days, (after adjusting to the Julian and Gregorian calendar switch). Burmese calendarists {{have dealt with the}} issue by using apparent reckoning and periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle.</b> One major downside of this approach {{is that it is not}} possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.|$|E
25|$|At the {{simplest}} level, most well-known lunar calendars {{are based on}} the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month — but this is only roughly accurate, and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of leap days. Additionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the year, which makes accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle,</b> which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years (which add up to not quite 6940 days). However, a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the Antikythera Mechanism about 2000 years ago, and the Hebrew calendar.|$|E
25|$|To {{approximate}} his {{tropical year}} Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and Days (now lost), {{as described by}} Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1 (Toomer 1984, p.139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), {{but it did not}} use a specified number of days. The <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> (432 BC) assigned 6,940 days to these 19 years producing an average year of 365+1/4+1/76 or 365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle (330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles (76 years) for an average year of 365+1/4 or 365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles (304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of 365+1/4−1/304 or 365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of 365+1/4−1/300 or 365.24667 days.|$|E
25|$|The {{new system}} was a hybrid between the {{original}} and the updated Surya schools. Unlike the new Surya, Thandeikta does not adopt the system of apparent reckoning; mean years and mean months are still used. It also retains the practice of placing the intercalary month always next to Waso and the intercalary day always {{at the end of}} Nayon, and only in a year which has an intercalary month. But Thandeikta follows the new Surya in small alterations of the length of the year and the month. The prevailing Metonic schedule was modified, and intercalary months were so fixed as to prevent further divergence between the solar and luni-solar years. With the support of Princess Sekkya Dewi, who later became the chief queen of King Mindon, the new system was fully adopted in 1853. The first adjustment to then existing <b>Metonic</b> <b>Cycle</b> was made by putting an intercalary month in 1201 ME (1839 CE) instead of 1202 ME (1840).|$|E
25|$|The method from Alexandria became authoritative. In its {{developed}} form it {{was based}} on the epacts of a reckoned moon according to the 19-year <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Such a cycle was first proposed by Bishop Anatolius of Laodicea (in present-day Syria), c. 277. Alexandrian Easter tables were composed by Pope Theophilus about 390 and within the bishopric of his nephew Cyril about 444. In Constantinople, several computists were active over the centuries after Anatolius (and after the Nicaean Council), but their Easter dates coincided with those of the Alexandrians. Having deviated from the Alexandrians during the 6th century, churches beyond the eastern frontier of the former Byzantine Empire, including the Assyrian Church of the East, now celebrate Easter on different dates from Eastern Orthodox Churches four times every 532 years. The Alexandrian computus was converted from the Alexandrian calendar into the Julian calendar in Rome by Dionysius Exiguus, though only for 95 years. Dionysius introduced the Christian Era (counting years from the Incarnation of Christ) when he published new Easter tables in 525.|$|E
25|$|Careful Fourier data {{analysis}} over a nineteen-year period (the National Tidal Datum Epoch in the U.S.) uses frequencies called the tidal harmonic constituents. Nineteen years is preferred because the Earth, moon and sun's relative positions repeat almost {{exactly in the}} <b>Metonic</b> <b>cycle</b> of 19years, which is long enough to include the 18.613 year lunar nodal tidal constituent. This analysis can be done using only {{the knowledge of the}} forcing period, but without detailed understanding of the mathematical derivation, which means that useful tidal tables have been constructed for centuries. The resulting amplitudes and phases can then be used to predict the expected tides. These are usually dominated by the constituents near 12hours (the semi-diurnal constituents), but there are major constituents near 24hours (diurnal) as well. Longer term constituents are 14day or fortnightly, monthly, and semiannual. Semi-diurnal tides dominated coastline, but some areas such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily diurnal. In the semi-diurnal areas, the primary constituents M2(lunar) and S2(solar) periods differ slightly, so that the relative phases, and thus the amplitude of the combined tide, change fortnightly (14day period).|$|E
