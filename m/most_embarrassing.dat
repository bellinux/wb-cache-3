A few attempts were mounted to break the blockade, {{but they were not}} large enough to have lasting impact. Among the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> episodes of the war for the U.S. Navy was the passage of the raider CSS Florida through the blockade into Mobile Bay on September 4, 1862; this was followed by her later escape through the same blockade on January 15, 1863.|$|E
50|$|Silva was criticised for his performance, with Dana White {{saying that}} it was the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> he has ever been since {{becoming}} UFC president. Midway through the fourth round, White walked away and gave the championship belt to Silva's manager, Ed Soares, as he was so annoyed {{that he did not want}} to place the belt around Silva's waist personally. It was also claimed that Silva verbally insulted Maia during the fight.|$|R
5000|$|The volume Strofe cu pelin de mai pentru/contra Iorga Neculai ("Stanzas in May Wormwood for/against Iorga Neculai") was {{published}} in 1931, reportedly {{at the expense of}} Păstorel's friends and allies, since it had been refused [...] "by all of the nation's publishing houses". However, bibliographies list it as put out by a Viața Românească imprint. The book came out just after Iorga had been appointed Prime Minister. According to one anecdote, the person <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by the Strofe was Osvald Teodoreanu, who had been trying to relaunch his public career. Osvald is said to have toured the Iași bookstores on the day Strofe came out, purchasing all copies because they could reach the voters.|$|R
60|$|How {{much of the}} {{substance}} of this and previous letters Flip had confided to her father I cannot say. If she suppressed anything it was probably that which affected Lance's secret alone, and it was doubtful {{how much of that}} she herself knew. In her own affairs she was frank without being communicative, and never lost her shy obstinacy even with her father. Governing the old man as completely as she did, she appeared <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> when she was most dominant; she had her own way without lifting her voice or her eyes; she seemed oppressed by mauvaise honte when she was most triumphant; she would end a discussion with a shy murmur addressed to herself, or a single gesture of self-consciousness.|$|R

On {{the day of his}} arrival at the Kimpo International Airport in Seoul, the entire airport had been crowded by thousands of fans and media trying to get the first look at Seo Taiji. There was great talk between fans and the media about Seo Taiji's feminine style and his clothes worn on that day, which was a checkered black and white shirt. At a comeback interview in 2008, he jokingly referred to it as one of the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> moments of his music career.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} game in charge, Pardew led Newcastle to a 3–1 win over Liverpool at St James' Park on 11 December 2010, with goals from Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and Andy Carroll. In the club's first home match of 2011, he {{achieved}} a notable 5–0 victory over his former club West Ham. He brought in his own coaching staff {{in the form of}} John Carver as assistant manager, who had worked as assistant to Sir Bobby Robson six years earlier. Andy Woodman was also Pardew's appointment as goalkeeping coach. Soon after, however, Pardew suffered one of the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> defeats in the club's history as Newcastle went down 3–1 to League Two side Stevenage in the third round of the FA Cup.|$|E
500|$|In January, Carlsen {{participated in}} the 79th Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He started well, scoring 2 wins and 4 draws in his first 6 games, but missed mate-in-3 versus Giri in round 7, which Giri {{described}} as [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> moment" [...] of Carlsen's career. Carlsen then lost in round 8 to Richárd Rapport, and ultimately placed second with 8/13 (+4–1=8), one point behind winner Wesley So.|$|E

500|$|From 1995 he {{also spent}} three years at Talk Radio UK, {{presenting}} Starkey on Saturday, later Starkey on Sunday. [...] An interview with Denis Healey proved {{to be one of}} his <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> moments: [...] "I mistakenly thought that he had become an amiable old buffer who would engage in amusing conversation, and he tore me limb from limb. I laugh about it now, but I didn't feel like laughing about it at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Mansize Rooster" [...] {{is said to}} {{be about}} a young boy with a large penis, {{although}} this is not obvious from the lyrics.

[...] This was one of the many exclamations made between tracks on I Should Coco in the sped-up voices of the band members. It was said before the song [...] "We're Not Supposed To" [...] began.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "discovery" [...] excited {{international}} interest and many physicists worked {{to replicate the}} effects. However, the notable physicists Lord Kelvin, William Crookes, Otto Lummer, and Heinrich Rubens failed to do so. Following his own failure, self-described as [...] "wasting a whole morning", the American physicist Robert W. Wood, who {{had a reputation as}} a popular [...] "debunker" [...] of nonsense during the period, was prevailed upon by the British journal Nature to travel to Blondlot's laboratory in France to investigate further. Wood suggested that Rubens should go since he had been the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> when Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany asked him to repeat the French experiments, and then after two weeks Rubens had to report his failure to do so. Rubens, however, felt it would look better if Wood went, since Blondlot had been most polite in answering his many questions.|$|R

Believe me, I respected you even when I was <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by your active attempts to investigate our family misfortunes. You showed yourself more worthy of Miss Neville than I, by the spirit with which you persisted in vindicating her reputation even after her death. But the firm belief that your well-meant efforts could only serve to bring to light a story too horrible to be detailed, induced me to join my unhappy mother in schemes to remove or destroy all evidence of the legal union which had taken place between Eveline and myself.

The subsequent court ruling went in her favour, and on December 13, 2002, she became only the second person in the Republic of Korea to legally change their sex. Speaking of the difficulties she had previously encountered, Harisu has said: [...] "My <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> moments were when I have had to show my personal identification card in public... I couldn't get a passport, visa or even my own bank accounts because I was legally a man".|$|E
500|$|Sandra Dee, Dodd Darin, Jimmy Scalia and Steve Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey's {{work on the}} film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt Spacey {{looked too}} old to portray Darin convincingly and called the film [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> {{spectacles}} of 2004" [...] and [...] "jaw-droppingly awful, a misbegotten and ill-conceived vanity project." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post praised the actor's work, but also felt Spacey did not convincingly portray Darin in his early music career. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli found the storyline to be overtly clichéd, but added, [...] "Despite the choppy narrative and inappropriate casting of Spacey, Beyond the Sea managed to keep me entertained." ...|$|E
500|$|Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment gave Think Like a Cat {{one star}} out of five. Grosvenor {{thought that the}} show should be [...] "put down", saying that its only pros were Woolery's hosting {{and the fact that}} the episode was [...] "only 30 minutes long". Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was equally unimpressed, calling the special [...] "not only one of the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> half-hours in the history of television, [...] also a {{significant}} step toward the collapse of civilized society". Genzlinger also called the games [...] "idiotic" [...] and added that the infomercial feeling of the show was its [...] "overarching problem". Despite the criticism, over 1,000,000 combined viewers watched the show at some point during its five airings.|$|E
5000|$|Silva {{was widely}} criticized for his performance. Dana White {{said it was}} the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> he had ever been since {{becoming}} UFC president. Midway through the fourth round, White walked away from the fight and gave the championship belt to Silva's manager, Ed Soares. White was so annoyed that he declined to personally place the belt around Silva's waist, claiming {{it was the first time}} he had done so after a title match. It was also claimed that Silva verbally taunted Maia, saying, [...] "Come on, hit me in the face, playboy." [...] In the immediate post-fight interview, Silva apologized and said that he wasn't himself and that he would need to go back and reevaluate the humility that got him to where he is. In the post-fight interview, Silva made multiple references about how Demian insulted him before the bout. However, the pre-fight banter was seen by many as not out of the ordinary.|$|R
5000|$|When Caesar {{approached}} the speaker's dais, a hush {{fell over the}} mutinous soldiers. <b>Most</b> were <b>embarrassed</b> by {{their role in the}} mutiny in Caesar's presence. Caesar asked the troops what they wanted with his cold voice. Ashamed to demand money, the men began to call out for their discharge. Caesar bluntly addressed them as [...] "citizens" [...] instead of [...] "soldiers," [...] a tacit indication that they had already discharged themselves by virtue of their disloyalty.|$|R
500|$|Also in 2008, Beckinsale {{starred in}} Nothing but the Truth as a {{journalist}} who refuses to reveal her source. The film, co‑starring Vera Farmiga and Matt Dillon, {{was inspired by the}} case of Judith Miller. As part of her research for the role, [...] "I spent some time at The L.A. Times with some female reporters, and I spoke to Judith Miller about her experience....I really researched the hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling, brilliant experience." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played [...] "two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they've been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working {{at the top of her}} game." [...] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance. The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy and the film has grossed just $186,702 worldwide. [...] "I have prayed—prayed—for film companies to go bankrupt on films I've made, and then this happens on the one I love," [...] said Beckinsale. [...] "Usually it's the ones you're <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> about that are on the side of every bus." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to end the}} ban was welcomed by broadcasters. Michael Grade, who was then chief executive of Channel 4, said it had ended [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> attempts to censor coverage {{of the most important}} domestic political story of post-war years", while John Birt commented, [...] "We can once again apply normal and testing scrutiny to all sides in the debate". Sinn Féin also signalled their approval, but the ban's lifting was viewed with more caution by unionist politicians. Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party felt the decision was premature while the IRA remained an armed organisation. [...] "It gives de facto recognition to a body of men who still have their guns and bombs under the table, who still reserve the right to murder if they don't get their way".|$|E
500|$|The Browns had {{a perfect}} season the {{following}} year, winning the championship for a third straight time. Speedie {{led the league in}} receiving and was named an All-Pro again. The 1949 season brought another championship and another All-Pro season for Speedie, who led the league in receptions for the third year in a row. He had 228 receiving yards in a game against the Yankees, which remains a Browns record. Tom Landry, a Yankees cornerback who went on to coach the Dallas Cowboys, was assigned to cover Speedie and called it [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> athletic performance of my entire life". The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season and the Browns, along with two other teams, were absorbed by the more established NFL. Speedie was the AAFC's all-time leader in receptions and receiving yards, with 3,554.|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{said that}} the song is the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> moment of the album {{and as a result}} makes the album come to an {{intermediate}} halt thus ruining the [...] "bad-girl party atmosphere". Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle said that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] is a bouncy standout with some vocal personality. He also added that [...] " [...] would have made a killer Spice Girls single." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club called the track scaled-back and criticized Gaga's vocal abilities in the song. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song listless. Catherine P. Lewis from The Washington Post called the song a chirpy ballad. Christina Martin from The Meridian Star felt that the song, along with [...] "Summerboy" [...] from The Fame, is breezy and upbeat in nature. Matt Busekroos from Quinnipiac Chronicle {{said that the}} song seemed like a filler to him.|$|E
40|$|Media {{allows us}} to witness to the moments – to the wars in which {{humanity}} remains <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed,</b> <b>most</b> vulnerable and most desperate - today via the latest technologies. It is known that the Gulf War {{was a turning point}} in media’s illustration of a war, meaning that its representation of actual war footage as a cinematography to the audience in a way never seen before. The point where we have arrived at today seems that it has gone beyond watching the war in our safe places by feeling as if we were directly involved in it. Media receivers/target audiences are now facing the witnessing and being aware of the incidents that all civilians –especially the most affected ones, children, women and elderly people- experienced. This situation brings along the demands of societies who are willing to take responsibilities and initiatives about the events they witnessed, besides the countries and the governments. In this study, the extent to which Multeci-Der as a non-governmental organization that works for refugee problems can represent itself in the media is analyzed by content analysis and discourse analysis methods. In what extent the association is represented and with what types of news it is represented is considered significant, since it shows Multeci-Der’s contributions for creating an agenda on the subject. With reference to the ongoing war in Syria since 2011, the media news regarding Syrian refugees have been analyzed over Multeci-Der, which was established as a non-governmental organization in order to work for refugees. As a result, it is seen that the national press reserves a limited attention about the association’s activities and statements, and the news of local press seem to be far from creating an agenda and public opinion throughout the country...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Rosacea is {{characterized}} by extremely sensitive skin and persistent facial flushing, perhaps initiated or exacerbated by frequent or intense blushing. To investigate this, blushing was assessed in rosacea sufferers and controls during embarrassing laboratory tasks. Methods: Changes in forehead blood flow were monitored with laser Doppler fluxmetry in 31 rosacea sufferers (12 with severe symptoms and 19 with mild symptoms) and 86 controls while singing, giving an impromptu speech, and listening to recordings of these activities. Results: Changes in forehead blood flow were similar in rosacea sufferers and controls, and were similar in subgroups with mild and severe rosacea. Even so, rosacea sufferers thought that that they blushed more intensely and were more embarrassed than controls {{during most of the}} tasks. Likewise, changes in forehead blood flow were similar in participants with mild and severe rosacea. Nevertheless, ratings of embarrassment and blushing were greater in those with severe than mild symptoms. Within the rosacea group, increases in blood flow while singing were greatest in participants with the highest blushing ratings, whereas increases in blood flow while listening to the speech were greatest in the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassed</b> participants. Conclusions: These findings do not support the hypothesis that blushing is abnormal in rosacea but, nevertheless, suggest that rosacea sufferers are more aware of and embarrassed by blushing than controls. This might contribute to social anxiety in rosacea sufferers...|$|R
5000|$|Erik Wemple of The Washington Post disparaged Green's {{questions}} as [...] "dumb, loaded, and prejudicial," [...] {{calling for the}} Fox News Channel to apologize to Aslan.

Franck criticized Aslan for his claim of a degree {{in the history of}} religions, as he teaches creative writing and holds a PhD in Sociology of Religion rather than a degree in history.

500|$|The Huffington Post writer Cat Blake cited Cinnamon Bun {{gaining the}} affection of Flame Princess {{as a reason}} for {{secondary}} schoolers not to underestimate people. Staff writers of TV.com called this character progression for [...] "seemingly one-note characters" [...] a strength of the show, as similarly applied to the Ice King. Writing in DVD Talk, Adam Tyner described the episode as showing Finn at his <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> In memoriam of Piper, who died in July 2015, Brandon Stroud of Uproxx called Don Jon one of his best roles in pop culture. In the Official Tribute Commemorative Magazine for Piper, editor Jeff Ashworth and staff supposed that fans of the series were likely foreign to the [...] "grizzly tones" [...] of Piper's voice. The commemoration saw his guest role as showing his mastery of pop culture while calling Don Jon's bizarre fate normal in the show's universe.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} song {{a list of}} celeb perks: trainer, butler, assistant, three nannies, a {{bodyguard}} or five. It seems, at first, not like the clever self-twitting she clearly intended, but rather a facile confirmation of her haters' conviction: that the middle-aged Madonna {{does not have a}} worldview beyond her next Pilates appointment. In 2004, Blender magazine listed the song at number nine on the list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever, stating that Madonna [...] "updates the 'Material Girl'-era satire of commercialism and spiritual emptiness... with what is hands-down the <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> rap ever recorded. Nervous and choppy, she makes Debbie Harry sound as smooth as Jay-Z." [...] The magazine also said that the worst moment of the song is when after rapping, Madonna sings 'Nothing is what it seems' with no profundity. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song to be [...] "jittery, tuneless, and shallow to the point of self-parody".|$|E
500|$|The score {{remained}} 1–0 at half-time, {{and it was}} {{the same}} story in the second half: England missed a multitude of easy chances, hit the woodwork numerous times and had one effort that appeared to cross the line not given. The England captain Billy Wright recalled that [...] "even Alf Ramsey, who used to be expressionless throughout a game, threw up his arms and looked to the sky when a perfect free-kick was somehow saved by their unorthodox keeper". No England goal came—the United States won 1–0 in what entered English football history as the national team's <b>most</b> <b>embarrassing</b> upset. Ramsey, who was fiercely patriotic, took the result as an acute personal humiliation. One journalist recalled that on hearing the match mentioned years later, [...] "his face creased and he looked like {{a man who had been}} jabbed in an unhealed wound". England could remain in the competition if they beat Spain in their last group game, but a 1–0 defeat saw them crash out.|$|E
