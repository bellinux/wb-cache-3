5|$|Nearly all {{mountains}} {{appear to}} be in some stage of degradation. Large landslide deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.|$|E
5|$|The park's <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> {{habitat for}} the {{threatened}} American crocodile. The construction {{of miles of}} cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals' warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne's somewhat saltier estuarine waters.|$|E

5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and back <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} scutellum) and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal plate of the prothorax) is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton plate of the mesothorax) is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E

50|$|CCPDMA {{is subject}} to the basic {{principles}} of histology sectioning. From a physical standpoint, the true <b>margin</b> <b>is</b> never assessed because a thin face <b>margin</b> has to <b>be</b> cut through {{in order to make the}} slide for examination. Therefore, a true and complete assessment of all <b>margins</b> <b>is</b> never achieved. Serial sectioning allows CCPDMA approaches near-complete evaluation of the surgical <b>margin</b> and may <b>be</b> performed by pathologists, dermatologists, and surgeons.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} margin {{recorded in}} an individual poll {{was found in the}} October 26, 2006, SurveyUSA poll which showed Strickland leading by 30 points.

25|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mitotic stingaree {{is more or}} less diamond-shaped and slightly wider than long. The leading <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> nearly straight, while the outer corners and trailing <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> rounded. The snout forms an obtuse angle, with the tip extending slightly past the disc. The eyes are large and followed by the spiracles, which are comma-shaped with rounded or angular posterior rims. There may be a small knob on the posterior corner of each nostril. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a subtly fringed trailing margin, which is drawn out into lobes at either corner. The mouth is somewhat large with 34 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor; a few papillae are also present on the lower jaw. The teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and the five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
25|$|A gastric {{peptic ulcer}} is a mucosal {{perforation}} which penetrates the muscularis mucosae and lamina propria, usually produced by acid-pepsin aggression. Ulcer <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> perpendicular and present chronic gastritis. During the active phase, {{the base of}} the ulcer shows 4 zones: fibrinoid necrosis, inflammatory exudate, granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. The fibrous base of the ulcer may contain vessels with thickened wall or with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Marginocephalian remains reveal {{significant}} {{evidence of}} being social creatures, {{much of which}} {{is related to the}} many possible functions of the bony skull margins. Some possible functions of the variably shaped and sized <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> to ward off predators, display, ritualized combat, defense of territory, of establishing social ordering. Both pachycephalosaurs and ceratopsians show evidence of interspecific communication, and there may be evidence of intraspecific communication.|$|E

25|$|Fruits form {{abnormal}} morphologies when auxin transport is disturbed. In Arabidopsis fruits, auxin {{controls the}} release of seeds from the fruit (pod). The valve <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> a specialised tissue in pods that regulates when pod will open (dehiscence). Auxin must {{be removed from the}} valve margin cells to allow the valve margins to form. This process requires modification of the auxin transporters (PIN proteins).|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} IGRT {{process is}} to improve the {{accuracy}} of the radiation field placement, and to reduce the exposure of healthy tissue during radiation treatments. In years past, larger planning target volume (PTV) margins were used to compensate for localization errors during treatment. This resulted in healthy human tissues receiving unnecessary doses of radiation during treatment. PTV <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> the most widely used method to account for geometric uncertainties. By improving accuracy through IGRT, radiation is decreased to surrounding healthy tissues, allowing for increased radiation to the tumour for control.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} usually {{alternate}} and compound. Most {{often they are}} even- or odd-pinnately compound (e.g. Caragana and Robinia respectively), often trifoliate (e.g. Trifolium, Medicago) and rarely palmately compound (e.g. Lupinus), in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. Acacia, Mimosa). They always have stipules, which can be leaf-like (e.g. Pisum), thorn-like (e.g. Robinia) or be rather inconspicuous. Leaf <b>margins</b> <b>are</b> entire or, occasionally, serrate. Both the leaves and the leaflets often have wrinkled pulvini to permit nastic movements. In some species, leaflets have evolved into tendrils (e.g. Vicia).|$|E
