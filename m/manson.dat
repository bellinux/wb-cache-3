5|$|As {{a result}} of a chance {{encounter}} in late spring 1968, according to some accounts, drummer Dennis Wilson was driving through Malibu when he picked up two hitchhiking women of the <b>Manson</b> Family, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey, and brought them to his house in Pacific Palisades for a few hours. Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles <b>Manson.</b> At first, Wilson was frightened by <b>Manson,</b> but <b>Manson</b> assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the <b>Manson</b> Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Henry Rollins {{produced}} {{an album of}} acoustic songs for the famed convict Charles <b>Manson</b> titled Completion. The record {{was supposed to be}} released by SST Records, but the project was canceled because the label received death threats for working with <b>Manson.</b> Only five test presses of Completion were pressed, two of which remain in Rollins' possession.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} (set in 1964) terrorists build an android replica of Shirley <b>Manson,</b> who can kill her targets with a kiss, on an unnamed Pacific island. The android is {{fitted with a}} bomb, primed before it leaves on its mission. The android makes its way to Chicago's New Globe Theater and lets itself into Shirley Manson's {{dressing}} room, killing <b>Manson</b> and assuming her identity to perform the coda of a song on a large steel globe. As the android and the band receive a standing ovation from the audience, the bomb counts down. Smiling, the android <b>Manson</b> thrusts its arms in the air; the screen blacks out as the timer reaches zero, and an explosion is heard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manson</b> {{first began}} work on the album with guitarist Tim Sköld. However, Sköld left the band when the vocalist reunited with former bassist Twiggy Ramirez. The album was {{produced}} by <b>Manson</b> and Twiggy (who dropped the Ramirez moniker) along with former Nine Inch Nails co-producer and keyboardist Chris Vrenna, as well as Antichrist Superstar (1996) and Mechanical Animals (1998) co-producer Sean Beavan. It was the last album to feature the band's long-time drummer Ginger Fish.|$|E
5|$|Relapses {{were first}} noted in 1897 by William S. Thayer, who recounted the {{experiences}} of a physician who relapsed 21 months after leaving an endemic area. He proposed {{the existence of a}} tissue stage. Relapses were confirmed by Patrick <b>Manson,</b> who allowed infected Anopheles mosquitoes to feed on his eldest son. The younger <b>Manson</b> then described a relapse nine months after his apparent cure with quinine.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins a}} short prologue {{sequence}} with several children dressed in animal costumes playing in an overcast field, before cutting to Garbage upon {{the commencement of}} the song. Garbage are located in a litter-strewn warehouse, where the male members of the band destroy vinyl records, videotape and musical instruments as <b>Manson</b> performs to the camera. Some sequences feature <b>Manson</b> performing the song while on her own in dilapidated toilet stalls. The video ends with inter-cut footage of <b>Manson</b> joining the children on the field.|$|E
5|$|Antichrist Superstar was {{recorded}} at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians, {{including members of}} Marilyn <b>Manson</b> (namely the band's eponymous vocalist, Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Daisy Berkowitz, and Ginger Fish) and Nine Inch Nails (guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner, and drummer Chris Vrenna). <b>Manson,</b> Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The process of creating the album was reputedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with <b>Manson</b> indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, with most of this directed toward founding member Daisy Berkowitz.|$|E
5|$|Following Nine Inch Nails' success, Marilyn <b>Manson,</b> {{led by a}} protégé of Reznor's, came to prominence. The group's live {{performance}} and its transgressive appeal was often more commented on than their music.|$|E
5|$|Produced by <b>Manson</b> and {{newcomer}} Tyler Bates, who <b>Manson</b> {{met through}} their mutual {{involvement in the}} TV series Californication, The Pale Emperor eschews the band's usual industrial rock style {{in favor of a}} sparser, blues rock-influenced sound. The album features drummer Gil Sharone, formerly of Stolen Babies and The Dillinger Escape Plan. It was the first album since his return to the band in 2008 to not include songwriting or performance contributions from bassist Twiggy, who was busy with his own projects. The album is dedicated to Manson's mother, who died of Alzheimer's disease during production.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Beck {{wakes up}} in a shallow grave {{in the woods with}} rope burns on her neck and no memory of how she got there. She hitchhikes to her house in <b>Manson,</b> Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a mortician, examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in <b>Manson</b> are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of <b>Manson</b> for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close to bringing about the End times, which will also destroy <b>Manson.</b> During their conversation, Zoe slits her wrists and Malus leaves her body to find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Marilyn <b>Manson</b> and Sköld, with co-production from Ben Grosse. Musically, it is less metallic as the band's earlier work, instead being more electronic and beat-driven. This was done to avoid creating music similar to nu metal, a then-predominant genre of hard rock which the vocalist considered cliché. <b>Manson</b> collaborated with artist Gottfried Helnwein to create several projects associated with the album, including Doppelherz, a 25-minute surrealist short film which was released on limited edition units of the record as a bonus DVD. The Golden Age of Grotesque was also {{the title of the}} Manson's first art exhibition.|$|E
5|$|After Pierroth, Jr. won {{the title}} in 1995, he left CMLL and signed with AAA, {{bringing}} the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship with him. When Máscara Sagrada became the champion in 1996, it was officially acknowledged by the Commission that AAA controlled the booking of the championship {{from that point}} forward. El Halcón, also billed as Halcón Ortiz and Super Halcón, has the record for most championship reigns, with five. On September 13, 2006, AAA created the new AAA Mega Championship and the National title was not promoted in the promotion. The then champion, Charly <b>Manson</b> left AAA in 2009 and defended the title on the independent circuit. <b>Manson</b> later lost the championship to Héctor Garza until his death on May 23, 2013, after which it became inactive once more. In October 2017 CMLL announced that they were bringign the championship back under their control.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aemula {{was called}} wallum by the Kabi {{people of the}} Sunshine Coast, giving rise not only to its common name of wallum banksia {{but also to the}} name of the {{ecological}} community it grows in. Frederick <b>Manson</b> Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island knew it as mintie. Banyalla is another aboriginal name for the species.|$|E
5|$|Bleeding Through headlined the Darkness Over Europe 2007 Tour with I Killed The Prom Queen, All Shall Perish, and Caliban from February to March. The band then toured as {{the opening}} act for the Slayer and Marilyn <b>Manson</b> summer tour.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Alloxylon flammeum was mistakenly known as Embothrium (and later Oreocallis) wickhamii—Queensland {{botanist}} Frederick <b>Manson</b> Bailey had illustrated it using Embothrium wickhamii in the Queensland Agricultural Journal in 1899. Ferdinand von Mueller had described {{what is now}} known as Alloxylon wickhamii but also collected material of A. flammeum at Trinity Bay in 1881, not realising it was a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Her {{personal}} life, particularly {{her relationship}} with Marilyn <b>Manson,</b> to whom she was previously engaged, has attracted press attention. In 2012, she married English actor Jamie Bell, with whom she has one son. They separated in 2014 {{after two years of}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 <b>Manson</b> was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. <b>Manson</b> had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so {{they were the same}} as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In May 1900, Edmiston, {{along with}} notables Alex Taylor, John Alexander McDougall, James McDonald, William Johnston Walker, Robert <b>Manson,</b> Thomas Bellamy, Herman McInnes, and Hedley C. Taylor, were named to The Edmonton Public Hospital {{corporate}} governing board, {{on the advice}} of the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also the}} 'Papa' of Vagaland's poem Da Sang o da Papa men, now adopted {{as part of the}} folksong tradition, as set to music by T.M.Y. <b>Manson.</b> The insistent chorus chant, 'Rowin Foula Doon!', is {{particularly}} striking.|$|E
5|$|Lilith reincarnates {{two of her}} {{followers}} {{into the}} bodies of the other two dead women, and the three begin to terrorize <b>Manson</b> through plagues and violence. Rachel learns she is also a former witch who was resurrected by Lilith, but her memories are confused with the real Rachel Beck. Jet was brought back to life by the spirit of James, Rachel's boyfriend from her past life. Rachel, Jet, and Zoe kill the two resurrected witches and stop Lilith's plan to destroy <b>Manson.</b> James' spirit moves on to the afterlife, leaving Jet herself again. Rachel heals Jet and Aunt Johnny's wounds using her knowledge of witchcraft, and they resume the search for Rachel's killer.|$|E
5|$|Roman Polanski's 1971 {{film version}} of Macbeth {{contained}} many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles <b>Manson</b> and three women. Many critics saw this as a clear parallel to Macbeth's murders {{at the urging of}} the Three Witches within the film.|$|E
