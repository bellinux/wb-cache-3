Ernie was taken into custody but was released since there was not enough evidence to charge him. After being interrogated by the CSI’s, Ernie left a message on the killer’s answering machine, telling her that he saw her models, and knew that she was the killer before stating that he was heading over to talk.

He demanded the free command of the Cape's indigenous forces to operate and contain the violence, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he was content to sacrifice his job rather than tolerate further British interference.|$|E
25|$|The West, {{including}} the U.S., {{was accused of}} failing to respond forcefully to the erection of the Wall. Officially, Berlin was under joint occupation by the four allied powers, each with primary responsibility for a certain zone. Kennedy's speech marked the first instance where the U.S. acknowledged that East Berlin {{was part of the}} Soviet bloc {{along with the rest of}} East Germany. On July 25, 1961, Kennedy insisted in a presidential address that the U.S. would defend West Berlin, asserting its Four-Power rights, while <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> challenging the Soviet presence in Germany was not possible.|$|E

On 16 August 1914, Obregón and 18,000 of his troops marched triumphantly into Mexico City. He was joined shortly by Carranza, who marched triumphantly into Mexico City on 20 August.|$|E
25|$|Four other {{circuits}} accepted this. In Conover v. Dean Witter Reynolds, the Ninth Circuit examined White's critique at length. Judge Mary M.

When Congress had overhauled the 1934 Act in 1975, the conference committee report had contained statements referring to Wilko and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the conferees did not intend to require arbitration. She reiterated the concern that arbitration did not fully safeguard the rights of an unsophisticated investor, and noted that the right to sue was so well established by case law that an implied cause of action was not necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{second most}} common metre in Roman comedy in terms of lines (or the commonest, {{in terms of the}} number of words) is the trochaic septenarius (tr7). Like the other long iambic and trochaic lines, it is {{believed}} to have been chanted to the music of the tibiae (double pipes). There is usually a diaeresis in the centre of the line, and there may sometimes also be a hiatus (lack of elision) or brevis in longo (a short syllable made long by position) at this point. Trochaic lines generally start with a word which is stressed on the first syllable, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the line has a trochaic not an iambic rhythm.|$|E

25|$|Kamenev {{continued}} to oppose Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, resulting in his expulsion from the Central Committee in October 1927. After {{the expulsion of}} Zinoviev and Trotsky from the Communist Party on 12 November 1927, Kamenev was the United Opposition's chief spokesman within the Party, representing its position at the XVth Party Congress in December 1927. Kamenev used the occasion to appeal for reconciliation among the groups. His speech was interrupted 24 times by his opponents - Bukharin, Ryutin, and Kaganovich, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Kamenev's attempts were futile. The Congress declared United Opposition views incompatible with Communist Party membership; it expelled Kamenev and dozens of leading Oppositionists from the Party. This {{paved the way for}} mass expulsions in 1928 of rank-and-file Oppositionists, as well as sending prominent Left Oppositionists into internal exile.|$|E
25|$|Sembène drew on many {{of these}} {{experiences}} for his French-language first novel, Le Docker Noir (The Black Docker, 1956), the story of Diaw, an African stevedore who faces racism and mistreatment on the docks at Marseille. Diaw writes a novel, which is later stolen by a white woman and published under her name; he confronts her, accidentally kills her, and is tried and executed in scenes highly reminiscent of Albert Camus's The Stranger (also translated as The Outsider). Though the book focuses particularly on the mistreatment of African immigrants, Sembène also details the oppression of Arab and Spanish workers, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the issues are as much economic as they are racial. Like most of his fiction, it is written in a social realist mode. Many critics today consider the book somewhat flawed; however, it began Sembène's literary reputation and provided him with the financial support to continue writing.|$|E
25|$|Chirwa and Aleke Banda {{had only}} been {{detained}} {{for a short time}} and in 1959 they had formed the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) to replace the banned Nyasaland African Congress, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they were acting on behalf of the imprisoned Banda. The reconstitution of Congress as the Malawi Congress Party from September 1959 marked a major shift in its character. The Nyasaland African Congress was an anti-colonial liberation movement but after the 1961 elections, the MCP was in government. There was a regional shift in support for the MCP: in both the Southern and Central Provinces, people flocked to join the party but, in the north, branches were formed only in a limited number of places. The MCP quickly emerged as a larger party, distinctly more authoritarian in its approach, than Congress had been. It became a mass party, but Chipembere and the Chisizas were unknown to many of the new members, who regarded Banda as the sole leader.|$|E

25|$|A new Secretary of State, John Selwyn Gummer, {{had taken}} over in May, {{and he did not}} like these proposals, or the long time it took to produce them. Gummer sped-up the work plan and {{directed}} that all remaining reviews should start in December and be complete by the end of 1994. Gummer also issued new guidance, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> wholly unitary solutions should be preferred, particularly ones smaller than existing counties but larger than existing districts. He further announced that Derbyshire and Durham would be referred back to the Commission for consideration under the new guidance. Gummer accepted the Commission's proposal to abolish Cleveland, but asked the Commission to consider Durham and Derbyshire again under the new guidance. The Labour Party, while remaining broadly in favour of unitary authorities, attacked the Commission for inconsistency. The leader of the Labour-controlled Derbyshire County Council questioned the inclusion of Derbyshire in the first tranche, which otherwise consisted mainly of counties newly created in 1974 and their neighbours.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Jung {{published}} Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (published in English in 1916 as Psychology of the Unconscious) <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{his views}} {{were taking a}} direction quite {{different from those of}} Freud. To distinguish his system from psychoanalysis, Jung called it analytical psychology. Anticipating the final breakdown of the relationship between Freud and Jung, Ernest Jones initiated the formation of a secret Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical coherence and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and Hanns Sachs. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of psychoanalytic theory before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the Jarhbuch and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Zürich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.|$|E

Her persona non grata status at the Walpole-controlled court prevented her from suppressing the rise of the Tories; Walpole's taxes and peace with Spain were deeply unpopular with ruling class English society, and the Tories were gaining much more support as a result.|$|E
