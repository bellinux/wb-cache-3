50|$|Malicious caller {{identification}} facility, also called <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> trace or caller activated <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> trace, when subscribed or enabled, works by allowing {{a phone call}} recipient to mark or flag the preceding phone call connection as malicious (i.e. harassing, threatening, obscene, etc.) The phone system will then automatically trace the call by flagging station to station billing and routing data including start and end times. The call trace is not dependent upon call duration (as envisioned in dramatic movie plots) and will record all meta-data regardless of source conditions - even if the call was made from an unlisted number, a payphone or a number with {{caller identification}} disabled. To protect privacy the resulting trace data is only made available to law enforcement.|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{telecommunications}} fraud detection {{has become}} a hot research direction gradually. Some researchers have used blacklisting and whitelisting methods to prevent telecommunications fraud (Jiang et al. 2012; Zhang & Fischer-Hubner  2011; Patankar et al.  2008; Wang et al. 2007). More researchers use machine learning techniques {{to determine if they}} are malicious. They extract a variety of features for <b>malicious</b> <b>call</b> detection, and most of the features include telephone numbers, call-time, domain names, call networks, and the actions of listeners and callers, etc. (Kolan et al. 2008; Azad & Morla  2011; Azad & Morla 2013; Jiang et al  2013; Leontjeva et al. 2013; Rebahi & Sisalem 2005; Rebahi et al. 2006; Sorge & Seedorf 2009; Srivastava & Schulzrinne 2004; Wang et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2009; Zhang and Gurtov 2009). In 2015, Subudhi and Panigrahi (2015) published their research on telecommunication fraud using the features of a telephony communication as the input and Quarter-Sphere Support Vector Machine to distinguish fraudulent calls. The input features include call duration, call type, call frequency, location and time, and it has achieved good recognition accuracy. Then, in 2017, they used a type of C-means clustering for telecommunication fraud detection again (Subudhi and Panigrahi 2017), and got a good result as well. Coincidently, Li et al. (2018) published an article on telecommunication fraud detection in recently as well. They used machine learning algorithm to detect malicious calls, and they extracted features of calls just similar to S. Subudhi et al. It seems difficult for these approaches to detect fraudulent calls with unlabeled new numbers. On the other hand, the researches on the content of conversations are rare. The work of Miramirkhani et al. (2017) is representative, and they conducted the research on the technical support scams. They recorded and analyzed the voice content of the phishing telephone fraud and malicious webpages which triggered such scams. Though they eventually put forward simple functions to help users keep away from malicious web pages, their approach did not help avoiding malicious calls directly.|$|E

30|$|A novel {{two-stage}} fraud {{detection system}} in mobile telecom networks {{has been presented}} in this paper that identifies the <b>malicious</b> <b>calls</b> among the normal ones in two stages. Initially, a genetic algorithm-based optimized fuzzy c-means clustering is applied to the user’s historical call records for constructing the calling profile. Thereafter, the identification of the fraudulent calls occurs in two stages. In the first stage, each incoming call is passed to the clustering module that identifies the <b>call</b> as genuine, <b>malicious</b> or suspicious. This is done by comparing the distance value of the new calling instance from the profile cluster centers against two predefined threshold values. The calls detected as genuine or malicious are not further processed. However, the call records that are found to be suspicious are additionally scrutinized in the second stage by a previously trained group method of data handling model for final decision making. The legitimate and forged labeled call records generated out of the clustering module are utilized for training the supervised classifier. Experimentation is done on a real-world call dataset to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model. A comparative analysis of the current approach with one of our earlier propositions and another recent fraud detection system clearly illustrates the efficacy of the developed model.|$|R

30|$|With {{the surge}} in the {{subscription}} of mobile phone services, the telecom service provider companies have been plagued {{with the problem of}} telecom fraud which occurs when a person employs deceitful techniques to successfully obtain the telephonic amenities freely or at a lower rate [18]. According to a survey conducted by the Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA), the telecommunication industry has lost nearly $ 46.3 billion worldwide in 2013 [38]. Another study done by the organization FFA UK (Financial Fraud Action United Kingdom) stated that due to various telephonic scams, the UK telecom companies have suffered a loss of £ 23.9 million in 2014, which is three times higher than that of the previous year [27]. The telecom fraud can be segmented into various types, out of which the superimposed fraud represents the most typical one that can be defined as accessing a genuine subscriber’s calling account to make <b>malicious</b> <b>calls</b> [10]. As per a report published by CFCA, the telecom companies worldwide have lost $ 38.1 billion due to the fraudulent activities in 2015, out of which the superimposed fraud accounted for nearly 6 % of the total amount [23]. Therefore, in this work, we aim at detecting this type of fraud since it constitutes a more bigger and riskier issue for the telecom business.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a multi hop {{infrastructure}} less wireless networks {{which offers}} unrestricted mobility. As wireless ad-hoc networks lack a centralized infrastructure, {{they are exposed}} to a lot of attacks such as DOS attacks, Spoofing, and etc. So the security is the main concern for these networks. Especially secure routing is important given the fact that potential attackers aim to disrupt the appropriate operation within a MANET. In this paper we used non-zero noncooperative game theory is used model the security game between MANET, which is defended by Intrusion Detection System (IDS) operating at each node and a group of collaborative <b>malicious</b> nodes <b>called</b> <b>malicious</b> coalition. We used the mixed strategies to find the defend and attack probability distributions of any MANET and malicious coalition nodes that maximize the utility of the players in a non-cooperative security game between the afore mentioned entities at the Nash Equilibrium (NE). In this paper we propose an routing approach called NCGSE (Non Cooperative Game theory for Security enhancement) for defending legitimate nodes of MANET from the malicious activities of the adversaries. Our simulations were implemented by means of the popular discrete event network simulator NS- 2 illustrated that the proposed NCGSE protocol outperforms the reputed Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) within the MANET...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is to}} show how existing model checking technique, with CSP and FDR, used for traditional message-based security protocols, can be adapted to specify and verify AXML document-based security. To illustrate our approach, we present the framework for modelling and analyzing AXML document’s security.

The fundamental difference between these agents is that the intelligent agent uses deliberate transport infrastructure while the malicious agent hijacks the resources. The intelligent agents are used in a distributed environment because they are not cumbersome for the network traffic; they overcome network latency, operate in heterogeneous environment and possess fault-tolerant behavior, on the other hand the malicious agents are inefficient and wasteful for computer network resources. This is a discussion paper; we present a comparative study of intelligent and malicious agent and also draw a comparison between an intelligent agent and a distributed object...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increase}} in the use of internet, the job of malicious people has been made easy to exploit vulnerabilities in existing system. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) {{plays a major role in}} computer/network security in recognizing such <b>malicious</b> activity <b>called</b> intrusion. IDSs’ quick and correct detection of unknown intrusions help in reducing damage/loss to the sensitive information. IDS with such quality need to be encouraged. An IDS must analyse a different set of attributes to decide upon a monitored information as normal or abnormal. This becomes a time consuming task if the number of attributes to be analysed are more. Hence this becomes a barrier for fast detection. This paper proposes and implements an intrusion detection approach that breaks this barrier and helps in correct detection of novel attacks. This is achieved by using significant feature set extracted from KDDcup 1999 dataset and Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) an Artificial Immune System concept...|$|R
40|$|Many {{security}} protocols {{have the}} aim of authenticating one agent to another. Yet there is no clear consensus in the academic literature about precisely what "authentication" means. In this paper we suggest that the appropriate authentication requirement will depend upon the use to which the protocol is put, and identify several possible definitions of "authentication". We formalize each definition using the process algebra CSP, use this formalism to study their relative strengths, and show how the model checker FDR can be used to test whether a system running the protocol meets such a specification. 1 Introduction Many security protocols have appeared in the academic literature; these protocols often have {{the aim of}} achieving authentication, i. e., one agent should become sure of the identity of the other.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present an {{approach}} to develop and verify a method of formal modeling of cyber threats directed at computer systems.

The most common cyber threats targeting end users and terminals are caused by <b>malicious</b> software, <b>called</b> malware. The malware detection process can be performed either by matching their digital signatures or analyzing their behavioral models. As the obfuscation techniques make the malware almost undetectable, the classic signature-based anti-virus tools must be supported with behavioral analysis.

The method {{is based on a}} goal-oriented framework that addresses <b>malicious</b> goals (<b>called</b> anti-goals) set up by attackers to threaten security goals. Threat trees are built systematically through specializations of attack patterns. Such patterns abstract the attacker’s anti-goals for known attacks. Once specialized to the specific vocabulary of the application, the patterns are further refined until finegrained anti-goals are obtained that are either software vulnerabilities observable by the attacker or anti-requirements implementable by this attacker. New security requirements are then obtained as specializations of generic countermeasures associated with the attack pattern. The method is illustrated with an attack pattern for replay attacks and its specializations to an e-commerce system and a mailing system. 1...|$|R
