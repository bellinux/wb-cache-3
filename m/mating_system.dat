5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} the {{few times}} the Sunda slow loris {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following her. This may suggest a more promiscuous <b>mating</b> <b>system,</b> where females mate with more than one male. Despite this, its testis size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of the <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> of {{this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

50|$|The primary <b>mating</b> <b>systems</b> {{in plants}} are outcrossing (cross-fertilisation), autogamy (self-fertilisation) and {{apomixis}} (asexual reproduction without fertilization, {{but only when}} arising by modification of sexual function).

5|$|Assessments of the <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> of {{this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations. Populations in {{relatively}} intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more inbred on average, and more variable. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar <b>mating</b> <b>system,</b> whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a petri dish, the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> {{of bears}} has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E
50|$|The {{relative}} size {{of human}} male testes {{is comparable to}} those primates who have single-male (monogamous or polygynous) <b>mating</b> <b>systems,</b> such as gorillas and orangutans, while it is smaller when compared to primates with polyandrous <b>mating</b> <b>systems,</b> such as bonobos and chimpanzees. While {{it is possible that}} the large testis size of some primates could be due to seasonal breeding (and consequently a need to fertilize a large number of females in a short period of time), evidence suggests that primate groups with multi-male <b>mating</b> <b>systems</b> have significantly larger testes than do primates groups with single-male <b>mating</b> <b>systems,</b> regardless of whether that species exhibits seasonal breeding. Similarly, primate species with high levels of sperm competition also have larger ejaculate volumes and larger sperm midpieces.|$|R

50|$|High {{levels of}} sperm {{competition}} among the great apes are generally seen among species with polyandrous (multimale) <b>mating</b> <b>systems,</b> while {{lower rates of}} competition are seen in species with monogamous or polygynous (multifemale) <b>mating</b> <b>systems.</b> Humans have low to intermediate levels of sperm competition, as seen by humans’ intermediate relative testis size, ejaculate volume, and sperm midpiece size, compared with other primates. This suggests {{that there has been}} a relatively high degree of monogamous or polygynous behavior throughout our evolutionary history. Additionally, the lack of a baculum in humans suggests a history of monogamous <b>mating</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its active time was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes up a very {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> with the offspring living with the parents. It sleeps during the day, rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, palm fronds, or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} <b>mating</b> <b>system.</b> It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> of {{pinnipeds}} {{varies from}} extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E

25|$|Males {{in these}} mating systems are {{generally}} monogamous, if not bigynous, and have sexually evolved accordingly.

25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that polyandry is the dominant social structure in the Callitrichidae subfamily of New World monkeys. The Callitrichidae family includes marmosets and tamarins, two groups of small New World monkeys found in South America. Wild groups usually consist of three to ten individuals, with one reproductively active female, one or more reproductive males, and several nonreproductive helpers that can be either male or female. Interestingly, cooperative polyandry {{is not the only}} <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> found in these primates. Polyandrous, monogamous, and polygynous groups can be found within the same population, and a group can even change mating systems, making it the most flexible <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> of any non-human primate. Unlike most primates who typically give birth to single young, twins are the average litter size for tamarins and marmosets. The entire group participates in raising the offspring, sharing the responsibilities of infant carrying, feeding, and grooming. The presence of nonreproductive helpers appears {{to be the most important}} factor in determining which <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> is used, as ecological and environmental variability have not been found to have a significant impact. Goldizen (1987) proposed the hypothesis that monogamy in Callitrichidae should develop only in groups with nonreproductive helpers to help raise the young, and in the absence of these helpers, both polyandrous males and females would have higher reproductive success than those in lone monogamous pairs. Indeed, in studies of Saguinus fuscicollis, common name saddle-back tamarin, no monogamous lone pairs have ever been seen to attempt a breeding cycle.|$|E
25|$|Cichlids mate either monogamously or polygamously. The <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> {{of a given}} cichlid {{species is}} not {{consistently}} associated with its brooding system. For example, although most monogamous cichlids are not mouthbrooders, Chromidotilapia, Gymnogeophagus, Spathodus and Tanganicodus all include - or consist entirely of - monogamous mouthbrooders. In contrast, numerous open- or cave-spawning cichlids are polygamous; examples include many Apistogramma, Lamprologus, Nannacara, and Pelvicachromis species.|$|E
25|$|In {{behavioral}} ecology, polyandry is a {{class of}} <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> where one female mates with several males in a breeding season. Polyandry is often compared to the polygyny system based on the cost and benefits incurred by members of each sex. Polygyny is where one male mates with several females in a breeding season (e.g., lions, deer, some primates, and many systems where there is an alpha male).|$|E
