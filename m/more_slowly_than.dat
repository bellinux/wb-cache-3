This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health.

5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E

The researchers hope these data may help conservationists save the endangered ape, and also prove useful in further understanding of human genetic diseases.

Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E

5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> {{the world as}} a whole or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just nearly half of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned pilot whale females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales grow <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E

5|$|The solar arrays {{themselves}} were launched and installed {{over a period}} of eleven years, <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> originally planned, with the station continually suffering from a shortage of power as a result. The first two arrays, each 38m2 (409ft2) in area, were launched on the core module, and together provided a total of 9kW of power. A third, dorsal panel was launched on Kvant-1 and mounted on the core module in 1987, providing a further 2kW from a 22m2 (237ft2) area. Kvant-2, launched in 1989, provided two 10m (32.8ft) long panels which supplied 3.5kW each, whilst Kristall was launched with two collapsible, 15m (49.2ft) long arrays (providing 4kW each) which were intended to be moved to Kvant-1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the EO-8 crew in 1991.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, Japan {{was one of}} the world's {{two largest}} {{producers}} of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country's film industry {{was among the first to}} produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> <b>than</b> in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, Reimai (Dawn), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: Taii no musume (The Captain's Daughter) and Furusato (Hometown), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country's leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujirō Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.|$|E
