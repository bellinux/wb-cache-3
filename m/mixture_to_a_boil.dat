50|$|In Uganda, most tribes have {{different}} cuisines {{but the most}} popular breakfast dishes are Porridge and Katogo. Porridge is made by mixing maize flour or millet flour with water and bringing the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil.</b> While Katogo is made from matoke (green bananas), peeled and cooked in the same pot with a sauce (Beef, peanuts, beans or greens), Katogo is served with tea or juice. Both dishes are popular in all regions of Uganda.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the pastry {{is made by}} heating water, melting the fat in it, {{bringing}} the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> and finally incorporating the flour. This {{can be done by}} beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste {{that can be used for}} hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. The molded crust retains its shape as it cools, and is prepared for baking with a filling and additional layer of pastry crust on top. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to bake the pastry in a mould, as with other pies.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this {{invention}} <b>to</b> provide <b>a</b> continuous optimum process for the dissolution of aluminum, without the use of a mercury catalyst. Ile invention generally stated is: a process for dissolution of aluminum comprising: preparing a mixture of nitric acid`and fluoboric acid in a makeup vessel or individual reagents in separate vessels; placing an aluminum element in a dissolver vessel having an overflow; transferring a portion of the mixture of nitric acid and fluoboric acid to the dissolver vessel from the makeup vessel; heating the dissolver vessel and <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature and holding that temperature until a desired concentration of dissolved aluminum is achieved; adding a constant flow influent of the mixture of nitric acid and fluoboric acid to the dissolver vessel; and collecting an effluent from the dissolver vessel overflow, said effluent containing a mixture of aluminum nitrate, nitric acid, fluoboric acid, water, and dissolved fuel components. The variables in the above process can be temperature, effluent flow rate, and concentration of the acids as will be discussed later. For corrosion control, {{it may be necessary to}} initiate reaction at a decreased HNO{sub 3 } concentration and to increase it after a sufficient concentration of aluminum nitrate has accrued. The process may be adapted to batch processing, as well. Again, acid concentrations may be initially relatively small and, then, gradually increased as reaction proceeds until the desired excess of HNO{sub 3 } above stoichiometric quantity has been added. Other objects, advantages, and capabilities of the present invention will become more apparent as the description proceeds...|$|R
40|$|Naturally-contaminated roasted peanuts {{containing}} approximately 1500 ppb total aflatoxins were {{ground and}} cooked {{with water to}} simulate the preparation of a typical African sauce. The peanut sauce was prepared by mixing 200 g. ground peanuts with 700 ml of water, then bringing the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil.</b> Five minutes after the peanut sauce began to boil under slow heat, hydrogen peroxide at 0 %, 1 % or 5 % was added {{in combination with other}} food additives and the mixture was cooked for 30 minutes. Additives used were: 2 % sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃); 2 % ammonium bicarbonate (NH₄CO₃); 2 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH); ammonium persulfate [(NH₄) ₂S₂O₈] and 2 % ammonium hydroxide. For analysis two methods of aflatoxin extraction were used. The AOAC-approved CB method produced a stable emulsion with sauces treated with sodium and ammonium hydroxide, so that extraction was not possible. The second, more successful method used methanol extraction. Both TLC and HPLC were used for aflatoxin analysis. Cooking alone reduced aflatoxins B₁, B₂ and G₂ to half or more of the original values, but no significant reduction was observed for aflatoxin G₁. Although cooking with food additives further reduced aflatoxin, none of the chemicals alone or in combiI. ation with hydrogen peroxide were successful in eliminating aflatoxins from the peanut sauce. However, the peanut sauce treated with sodium bicarbonate and 1 % hydrogen peroxide had the aflatoxins reduced to nearly the 20 ppb FDA action level...|$|E

30|$|This <b>mixture</b> {{was added}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boiling</b> {{solution}} of NaOH (0.1  M dissolved in 1000  ml of distilled water) under constant stirring. Nanoferrites are formed {{due to the}} conversion of metal salts into hydroxides that take place immediately, followed by the transformation of hydroxides into ferrites. The solutions were maintained at 358  K (85  °C) for 1  h, and sufficient amount of fine particles were collected at this stage using magnetic separation. The particles were washed several times with distilled water followed by washing with acetone and are then dried at room temperature. For {{the preparation of the}} coated particles, a suitable surfactant (oleic acid) is added to the boiling solution of NaOH along with the solution mixture. The powdered samples were then pelletized at a pressure of 300  Kg/cm 2 to yield pellets of 10  mm diameter and approximately 2  mm thickness for all the three compositions.|$|R
50|$|The second style, more {{characteristic}} of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is Cajun jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the {{farther away from}} New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes). The meat is browned in a cast-iron pot. The bits of meat that stick {{to the bottom of}} the pot (sucs) are what give a Cajun jambalaya its brown color. A little vegetable oil is added if there is not enough fat in the pot. The trinity (of 50% onions, 25% celery, and 25% green or red bell pepper, although proportions can be altered to suit one's taste) is added and sautéed until soft. Stock and seasonings are added in the next step, and then the meats are returned to the pot. This mixture is then simmered, covered, for at least one hour. Lastly, the <b>mixture</b> is brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and rice is added to the pot. It is then covered and left to simmer over very low heat for at least 1/2 hour without stirring. The dish is finished when the rice has cooked.|$|R
30|$|To isolate {{cellulolytic}} and xylanolytic bacteria from agricultural waste-impacted soils, aliquots {{from various}} dilutions (10 − 3 – 10 − 6) were plated in duplicate on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) agar (Apun et al. 2000) and xylan agar (Khasin et al. 1993; Agustini et al. 2012), respectively. The CMC agar [comprising (g/L) carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 5; NaNO 3, 1; K 2 HPO 4, 1; KCl, 1; MgSO 4, 0.5; yeast extract, 0.5; glucose, 1 and agar powder, 17] and xylan agar (containing in 1  L of distilled water: 5  g Beechwood xylan; 1  g yeast extract; 0.2  g (NH 4) 2 SO 4; 0.5  g MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 0.25  g CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O; 0.6  g KH 2 PO 4 and solidified with 16  g agar powder) were prepared by dissolving their respective ingredients in 1 L distilled water.

40|$|The unique {{combination}} of properties of bipyridinium salts {{and their use}} in biological systems, chemical reactions, and as herbicides in agriculture have made them a discovery of major international importance. The controversy about the position of attack of the cyanide ion on the pyridine ring and {{the discovery of the}} formation of unsubstituted bipyridinium salts from the reaction of pyridinium salt with cyanide ion opened a new area of research. The current work involved a study of reactions of substituted pyridinium salts with cyanide ion. The substituted pyridinium salts were prepared by the literature methods. The 2 - and 3 - cyanopyridinium salts reacted with cyanide ion to form 4 -cyano- 1, 4 -dihydropyridines. The 3, 4 -dicyano- 1, 4 -dihydropyridines were very stable; therefore, they were isolated and characterized. An unusual product, 1 -methyl- 2 -oxo- 1, 2 -dihydro- 4 -pyridine carbonitrile, was isolated from the reaction of 1 -methyl- 2 -cyanopyridinium iodide with cyanide ion. The reaction of 1 -benzyl- 2 -(acylamino) pyridinium bromide with cyanide ion did not form a 1, 4 -dihydropyridine; rather, hydrogen bromide was lost when the reaction <b>mixture</b> was heated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and 1 -benzylpyridinium- 2 -acylimide was formed. The reaction of the 1 -benzyl- 2 -acetylpyridinium salt, the 1 -benzyl- 2 -bromopyridinium salt, and the 1 -benzyl- 2 -ethylpyridinium salt with cyanide ion formed complicated products that were not characterized.
