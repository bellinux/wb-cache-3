40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to analyze the relationship of suppliers and customer participation in product development process and effects of such participation on product innovation since it is getting more and more weight in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies.</b> It is also aimed in this study to explore if business performance of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> might be affected by the suppliers participation as well as product innovation that is realizable by such participation. From the analysis, following conclusions could be drawn: First, suppliers participation in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> turned out to have influence upon product innovation (standardized coefficient= 0. 193, C.

40|$|Research objectives: This study aims at {{discovering}} 1) at what stage <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> are {{in their}} sustainability implementation on a global level, 2) whether these companies can benefit financially from sustainability implementation, and 3) are there differences both {{in the level of}} sustainability implementation and its financial implications between large and medium-sized <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies.</b> Academic background and methodology: The study consists of a literature review and a data analysis. The dataset used in the analyses was obtained from the sixth International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI) conducted in fall 2013. The international dataset originally consisted of 931 responses from 22 countries and involved <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> belonging to ISIC codes 25 to 30. The main methods of analysis used in this thesis are structural equation modeling and Mann-Whitney U test. Main findings and conclusions: 1) Most of the studied <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> had started their sustainability journey, yet only a minority had reached a high level of implementation 2) There is a significant positive relationship between overall sustainability performance and financial performance of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies,</b> yet 3) the dataset did not allow to test whether this relationship is similar for both large and medium-sized <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies.</b> 4) In addition, medium-sized <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> seem to receive less external sustainability related pressure and their implementation level of sustainability management systems and programs is lower than that of larger <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies.</b> Yet, {{there was no significant difference}} between medium-sized and large <b>manufacturing</b> <b>companies</b> when it came to the level of operational sustainability performance...|$|R
