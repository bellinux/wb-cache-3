5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa <b>Macula</b> may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: While {{a number}} of studies have {{illustrated}} and analyzed 3 D models of inner ears in higher vertebrates, inner ears in fishes have rarely been investigated in 3 D, especially with regard to the sensory epithelia of the end organs, the <b>maculae.</b> It has been suggested that the 3 D curvature of these <b>maculae</b> may also play an important role in hearing abilities in fishes. We therefore set out to develop a fast and reliable approach for detailed 3 D visualization of whole inner ears as well as <b>maculae.</b> Results: High-resolution microCT imaging of black mollies Poecilia sp. (Poeciliidae, Teleostei) and Steatocranus tinanti (Cichlidae, Teleostei) stained with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) resulted in good tissue contrast, enabling us to perform a reliable 3 D reconstruction of all three sensory <b>maculae</b> of the inner ears. Comparison with <b>maculae</b> that have been 3 D reconstructed based on histological serial sections and phalloidin-stained <b>maculae</b> showed high congruence in overall shape of the <b>maculae</b> studied here. Conclusions: PTA staining and subsequent high-resolution contrast enhanced microCT imaging is a powerful method to obtain 3 D models of fish inner ears and <b>maculae</b> in a fast and more reliable manner. Future studies investigating functional morphology, phylogenetic potential of inner ear features, or evolution of hearing and inner ear specialization in fishes may benefit from the use of 3 D models of inner ears and <b>maculae...</b>|$|R

25|$|Renin is {{secreted}} from juxtaglomerular kidney cells, which sense {{changes in}} renal perfusion pressure, via stretch receptors in the vascular walls. The juxtaglomerular cells are also stimulated to release renin by signaling from the <b>macula</b> densa. The <b>macula</b> densa senses changes in sodium delivery to the distal tubule, and responds to {{a drop in}} tubular sodium load by stimulating renin release in the juxtaglomerular cells. Together, the <b>macula</b> densa and juxtaglomerular cells comprise the juxtaglomerular complex.|$|E
25|$|Lutein is {{concentrated}} in the <b>macula,</b> a small area of the retina responsible for three-color vision.

25|$|Maculae flavae {{are located}} at the {{anterior}} and posterior ends of the membranous parts of the VF. The histological structure of the <b>macula</b> flava is unique, and Sato and Hirano speculated that it could {{play an important role}} in growth, development and aging of VF. The <b>macula</b> flava is composed of fibroblasts, ground substances, elastic and collagenous fibers. Fibroblasts were numerous and spindle or stellate-shaped. The fibroblasts have been observed to be in active phase, with some newly released amorphous materials present at their surface. From a biomechanical point of view, the role of the <b>macula</b> flava is very important. Hirano and Sato studies suggested that the <b>macula</b> flava is responsible for the synthesis of the fibrous components of the VF. Fibroblasts have been found mostly aligned in the direction of the vocal ligament, along bundles of fibers. It then was suggested that the mechanical stresses during phonation were stimulating the fibroblasts to synthesize those fibers.|$|E

Ground-based research, already begun, using computer-assisted, three-dimensional reconstructions of macular terminal fields will lead to development of computer models of functioning <b>maculas.</b> This research should continue in conjunction with physiological studies, including work with multichannel electrodes...|$|R
40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: The late {{stages of}} age-related maculopathy (ARM), {{especially}} {{neovascular macular degeneration}} (ARMD), can severely affect central vision and are {{the main cause of}} blindness in the elderly in the Western world. It has been shown that angiogenic growth factors are present in neovascular membranes in ARMD. However, it is not known if angiogenic growth factors {{play a role in the}} onset of neovascularisation. METHODS: In order to elucidate the involvement of angiogenic growth factors in the initiation of neovascularisation in early stages of ARM, the expression patterns of VEGF, TGF-beta, b-FGF, and PDGF-AA on 18 human <b>maculae</b> with ARM, and on 11 control specimens were investigated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: A significantly increased expression of VEGF (p = 0. 00001) and TGF-beta (p = 0. 019) was found in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of <b>maculae</b> with ARM compared with control <b>maculae.</b> Furthermore, an increased expression of VEGF and PDGF was found in the outer nuclear layer of <b>maculae</b> with ARM. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate an increased expression of VEGF in the RPE, and in the outer nuclear layer in <b>maculae</b> with ARM, that could be involved in the pathogenesis of neovascular macular degeneration. Furthermore, enhanced TGF-beta expression in the RPE cells of <b>maculae</b> with early stages of ARM was shown...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Vocal fold stellate cells (VFSCs) in the <b>maculae</b> flavae {{have many}} {{morphological}} differences from conven-tional fibroblasts {{in the human}} vocal fold mucosa. It is uncertain whether the VFSCs are derived from the same embryon-ic source as conventional fibroblasts. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the stemness of the VFSCs and whether the pericellular matrices in the <b>maculae</b> flavae are a hyaluronan-rich matrix, which is required for a stem cell niche. Methods: Paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with Alcian blue (pH 2. 5) for a hyaluronidase digestion study. Im-munoreactivity to antibodies directed to CD 44, CD 133, Oct- 4, Ki 67, and telomerase was investigated in 5 human adult vocal fold mucosae. Results: The VFSCs were resting cells (G 0 -phase) and expressed a mesenchymal stem cell marker. The VFSCs did not express hematopoietic or embryonic stem cell markers. Telomerase resided in the VFSCs. The hyaluronan concentration in the <b>maculae</b> flavae was high and the VFSCs expressed hyaluronan receptors, indicating that <b>maculae</b> flavae are char-acterized by a certain criterion of hyaluronan-rich matrix. Conclusions: There is growing evidence that the VFSCs in the human <b>maculae</b> flavae are somatic (mesenchymal) stem cells of the vocal fold, and that the <b>maculae</b> flavae may be a candidate for a stem cell niche that is a microenvironment nurturing a pool of VFSCs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{vestibular}} nerve travels from the vestibular {{system of the}} inner ear. The vestibular ganglion houses the cell bodies of the bipolar neurons and extends processes to five sensory organs. Three of these are the cristae located in the ampullae of the semicircular canals. Hair cells of the cristae activate afferent receptors in response to rotational acceleration. The other two sensory organs supplied by the vestibular neurons are the <b>maculae</b> of the saccule and utricle. Hair cells of the <b>maculae</b> in the utricle activate afferent receptors in response to linear acceleration while hair cells of the <b>maculae</b> in the saccule respond to vertically directed linear force.|$|R

Findings of ground-based studies would suggest that neural structures of <b>maculas</b> are adaptable to microgravity but might show changes over time. Moreover, <b>maculas</b> have the potential for integration of the sort ascribed to brain and retina, although on a less complex scale.
