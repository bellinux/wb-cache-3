2500|$|Denis Healey, {{a member}} of {{parliament}} from 1952 to 1992, later said this speech was [...] "the greatest parliamentary speech I ever heard... it had all the moral passion and rhetorical force of Demosthenes". The Daily Telegraph report of the speech said that [...] "as <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> sat down, {{he put his hand}} across his eyes. His emotion was justified, for he had made a great and sincere speech".|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{considerable}} hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, {{the time when}} adverse possession began was when [...] "possession" [...] was taken. This {{had to be more}} than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period. But [...] "possession" [...] did not require actual occupation. So in Powell v McFarlane, it was held to be [...] "possession" [...] when <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell,</b> from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered [...] "adverse" [...] if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in BP Properties Ltd v Buckler, Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.|$|E
2500|$|The house {{consists}} of a central stuccoed block of three floors with a basement divided into five bays, with a flanking pavilion of two stories in four bays, to either side connected by low flanking quadrant walls. In {{the centre of the}} front is a large classical pedimented portico fronted by four [...] Ionic columns. The flanking walls screen the service wings behind. The rear elevation [...] has on either side full-height semi-circular bays. The interior contains much Adam style decorative plasterwork, apparently the work of a certain <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> [...] referred to in the invoice from the builder Bellman, and ornamental fittings. Robert Adam did much work for the Parkers at Saltram House near Plymouth between 1768–72 and 1779–82. The Poles are likely to have been guests at their neighbours at this time, but in any case as they also spent much time in London at their house in Bedford Square, they would have been familiar with Adam's work in London and elsewhere. The north-east pavilion contains a [...] theatre of circa 1900. The top floor housed the servants' quarters. The kitchens were originally situated in the left hand pavilion, later converted into a theatre. A large Palladian style stables block is situated around a semi-circular courtyard, several [...] hundred yards from the house, now converted into several separate residences. It had stabling for twelve horses and accommodation for grooms.|$|E
50|$|The Freak briefly becomes {{governor}} when Ann Reynolds {{was recovering}} from breast cancer and Colleen Powell was discredited. Erica Davidson helped expose Ferguson, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell</b> was reinstated. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell's</b> family was then murdered in an explosion, in a storyline similar to Jim Fletcher's.|$|R
50|$|Gomperts remains CEO and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell</b> {{continues}} to chair {{the board of}} directors, which includes notable members such as Miami Foundation President Javier Soto, former First Lady of Kentucky Jane Beshear, former Philadelphia Mayor Rev. Dr. Wilson Goode, and NCTA - The Internet and Television Association President, and General and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell’s</b> son, Michael K. Powell.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Powell</b> was {{the first}} woman to appear in the role in London in 1796.|$|R
60|$|And meeting sullenly the {{withering}} stare of <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> {{the steward}} retreated backwards.|$|E
60|$|A {{minute or}} two later all those in the cabin heard <b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell</b> give a shout.|$|E
60|$|A deep sigh {{was heard}} {{followed}} by the mate's voice asking dismally {{if that was the}} way one would speak of a man to whom one wished well? No better proof of something wrong was needed. Therefore he hoped, as he vanished at last, that <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> would be on their side. And this time <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> did not answer this hope with an embarrassed laugh.|$|E
60|$|I saw tears, {{a shower}} of them fall down <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell's</b> face. His voice broke.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell's</b> coming {{inspired}} Dick with immediate confidence. He was a clean-cut man, with {{a shrewd}} manner but {{a look of}} absolute honesty.|$|R
5000|$|Powell was patronized by Senator and Mrs. John B. Henderson, who {{established}} a studio {{for him in}} their [...] "Castle." [...] Mrs. Henderson grew very fond of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell's</b> artistic talent and came to own over seventy of his paintings. A few years after her death, Adam Weschler & Son held her estate auction. This auction, held in 1935, {{is believed to be}} the largest known sale of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell's</b> works. J. Edgar Hoover also owned more than a dozen of Powell's works.|$|R
60|$|At this <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> who evidently {{could be}} rebellious too {{turned his back}} {{squarely}} on the window.|$|E
60|$|And <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell,</b> flattered and embarrassed, could but emit a vague {{murmur of}} protest. For the {{statement}} was true in a sense, though the fact was in itself insignificant. The feelings of the ship's company could not possibly matter to the captain's wife and to Mr Smith--her father. Why the latter should so often allude to it was what surprised our <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell.</b> This {{was by no means}} the first occasion. More like the twentieth rather. And in his weak voice, with his monotonous intonation, leaning over the rail and looking at the water the other continued this conversation, or rather his remarks, remarks of such a monstrous nature that <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> had no option but to accept them for gruesome jesting.|$|E
60|$|When the aggrieved Franklin came on deck <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> made {{a remark}} to that effect. For his curiosity was aroused.|$|E

60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell</b> had {{now come}} up, and the Rovers told him who the men were. He at once {{took charge of}} matters.|$|E
60|$|After that he {{questioned}} Spouter concerning the ranch <b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell</b> had purchased and {{spoke of the}} men who had previously owned the place.|$|E
60|$|We were on {{our feet}} in the room by then, and Marlow, brown and deliberate, {{approached}} the window where <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> and I had retired.|$|E
60|$|In {{the living}} room Mrs. Rover and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell</b> were sitting doing some sewing. The sudden {{appearance}} of the Chinaman caused them to look up in astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|Shortly afterwards, Mr Smith came up {{alone and}} {{manifested}} {{a desire for}} a little conversation. He, too, if not so mysterious as the captain, was not very comprehensible to <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell's</b> uninformed candour. He often favoured thus the second officer. His talk alluded somewhat enigmatically and often without visible connection to <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell's</b> friendliness towards himself and his daughter. [...] "For I am well aware {{that we have no}} friends on board this ship, my dear young man," [...] he would add, [...] "except yourself. Flora feels that too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean it for any impertinence, Mr Jones; but wouldn't it {{be better}} just {{to come in and}} to go out quiet in one of <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell's</b> flies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`This office closes at four,' repeats <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> {{glancing up}} and down the pages and {{touching}} up a letter here and there with perfect indifference.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would that}} amount to?" [...] asked <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell.</b> [...] "I'm afraid they couldn't give the place {{back to the}} young lady because of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`I'll {{take your}} young friend willingly, <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell.</b> If {{you let him}} sign on as second mate at once I'll take the Articles away with me now.' ...|$|E
60|$|The men did {{not return}} until ten o'clock that night. All were tired and hungry and glad to sit down to the meal which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell</b> and the cook provided.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see {{anything}} the matter here except {{that some of}} your fish are on the floor," [...] remarked <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell</b> calmly. [...] "You had better pick them up and wash them off." ...|$|R
50|$|Fort Mandan was {{launched}} on 2 June 1945 by Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, sponsored by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Powell</b> M. Rhea; and commissioned on 31 October 1945, Lieutenant Commander W. A. Caughy, USNR, in command.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did <b>Mr.</b> <b>Powell</b> have to {{say about}} it?" [...] {{questioned}} Tom, for he and Sam had been out hunting for clews when the lawyer had called.|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not finish}} the phrase which {{certainly}} was turning bitter in his mouth. <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell</b> thought to himself: [...] "There he goes again." [...] He laughed a little.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why! That {{you should}} go to sleep. That you should rest." [...] And Captain Anthony frowned. Then sharply, [...] "You stay here, <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell.</b> I shall want you presently." ...|$|E
40|$|What {{are human}} rights? In this article Enoch Powell, MP (a former Conservative Minister of Health), {{approaches}} this question through a critical discussion of Article 25 (I) of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Professor R S Downie in his accompanying commentary analyses <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell's</b> statements and takes up in particular <b>Mr</b> <b>Powell's</b> argument that claiming rights {{for one person}} entails compulsion on another person. In Professor Downie's view {{there is nothing in}} Article 25 (I) that cannot embody acceptable moral rights, the commonly accepted interpretation of that Article of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights which many people think is wholly acceptable...|$|R
