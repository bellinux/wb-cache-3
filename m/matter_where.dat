5|$|Condensed matter {{physics is}} {{a branch of}} physics that deals with the {{physical}} properties of condensed phases of <b>matter,</b> <b>where</b> particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E
5|$|Both Spykers {{and both}} Super Aguris were {{knocked out of}} the first phase of qualifying, along with Alexander Wurz's Williams and Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso. For Super Aguri's Takuma Sato, it did not <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> he qualified, as he was docked ten places, due to {{overtaking}} Jenson Button under yellow flags at the last Grand Prix. Spykers Adrian Sutil was hoping for a wet race after an unspectacular qualifying. At {{the front end of the}} grid, the McLarens were first and fourth, with Hamilton on top, and the Ferraris splitting them in third and fourth. Heikki Kovalainen rounded out the top five.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass {{is higher than}} what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E
5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> they were, wanted {{to know what was going}} on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E

5|$|Rhimes is {{the series}} head writer, or its most {{prolific}} writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account. Other {{members of the}} writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn. From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey <b>Matter,</b> <b>where</b> the writer of an episode discussed the motives behind the writing. Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed {{a substantial number of}} episodes. Cast members Chandra Wilson and Kevin McKidd have both directed multiple episodes.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater {{for longer periods of}} time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant <b>matter.</b> <b>Where</b> periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E

Hodges, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 {{that the}} Constitution {{requires}} that same-sex couples {{be allowed to}} marry no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> {{they live in the}} United States.

25|$|In 1969, Reid {{played in}} what {{is thought to be}} the first cricket match at the South Pole, with the striped barber's-type pole with a silver {{reflecting}} glass ball on top representing the actual Pole acting as the wicket.

25|$|Quark matter or QCD matter {{refers to}} any {{of a number of}} theorized phases of matter whose degrees of freedom include quarks and gluons. These {{theoretical}} phases would occur at extremely high temperatures and/or densities, billions of times higher than can be produced in equilibrium in laboratories. Under such extreme conditions, the familiar structure of <b>matter,</b> <b>where</b> the basic constituents are nuclei (consisting of nucleons which are bound states of quarks) and electrons, is disrupted. In quark matter it is more appropriate to treat the quarks themselves as the basic degrees of freedom.|$|E
