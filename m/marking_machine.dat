50|$|Other {{equipment}} {{is often used}} with road marking machines. The main auxiliary equipment includes thermoplastic paint pre-heaters, hand-push pre-markers and road marking removers. Thermoplastic paint pre-heater is used to melt the solid powder coating into a viscous liquid, providing {{a steady supply of}} paint to the <b>marking</b> <b>machine.</b> Pre-markers are used to draw a field sketch in advance to avoid faulty marking. Road marking removers are used to remove old or incorrect markings. Large self-propelled machines usually do not need any support equipment, as equivalent functionality is built in.|$|E
5000|$|Thermoplastic {{markings}} {{are applied}} using specially designed vehicles. Usually thermoplastic marking mode should apply with equipment called a road <b>marking</b> <b>machine</b> to coat traffic lines, {{and the road}} paint needs preheating by a device commonly called a preheater. The thermoplastic mix is heated in trucks to about [...] before being fed to the application apparatus. This is often a screed box or ribbon gun. Immediately after the thermoplastic has been applied, glass beads are laid onto the hot material so that they embed before the plastic hardens. These beads provide initial retroreflection. As the marking wears during use and the initial beads are lost, the beads mixed with the binder are uncovered, providing long term retroreflectivity. These can be made exceptionally thick to produce a rumble strip effect.|$|E

It remains open if syntactic incremental branching programs are as powerful as unrestricted branching programs for GEN problems...|$|R

Engraving and other types of laser marking of different types of materials are very actual technologies these days. Laser marking decreases the waste creation in comparison with the other classical marking technologies, which use paintings or created chips.

Silicon carbide has been chosen as the material of stationary ring for its high hardness and thermal conductivity, low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and good compatibility with carbon [22]. The stationary ring is larger in size and textured with two different types of grooves: spiral groove and bionic cluster spiral groove which is made for comparison purpose, and the friction surfaces are polished.

The groove depth is controlled by the laser power, scanning speed and interval of the laser beam. In this experiment, when the laser power set to 30 % of its full capacity, scanning speed of 100  mm/s and scanning internal of 0.05, the measured groove depth is about 9  μm.

40|$|High-quality {{products}} and shorten manufacturing lead time {{are very important}} factors addressed by many companies. Typically, low-quality products are induced by inconsistent of manufacturing process performance. To get a constant laser power in Infrared (IR) Laser Marking process was a common problem facing by many engineers in the manufacturing industry. This consequences might effect on laser marking characteristics such as the possibility of burn marking or blur marking particularly on the products. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper is to study the interaction between Infrared (IR) Laser Marking input parameters such as current (amp), frequency (Hz), water flow (l/min) and laser beam size (mm) on laser power (watt) as the main response. Furthermore, the response of laser power from Infra-Red laser process can be predicted when all combinations of parameters are tested. The IR <b>marking</b> <b>machine</b> was deployed and experimental studies were conducted in order to meet this objective. The experiments were based on Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) because second order model or polynomial equation was needed to fit for the response. The relationship between input and output parameters can be visualized by 3 D graphs which were developed from Mathematical modeling. Based on the experiment results, the parameters that have significant effects on the laser power are current, laser beam size and water flow. However, frequency does not have a significant factor in this study...|$|E
