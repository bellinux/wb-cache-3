40|$|Gravity {{value at}} Astronomical point, Syowa station, was {{determined}} by observations with a WORDEN gravimeter in the third Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition 1958 - 59, and the following result has been obtained: g_ = 982. 540 cm/sec^ 2 Latitude 69 ° 002 ̆ 74 S Longitude 39 35. 4 E Height 29. 2 m relative to g_ = 979. 6470 cm/sec^ 2. The accuracy of this value {{was estimated to be}} a few milligals by investigating the drift of the gravimeter during the period of the expedition and considering the uncertainty in the scale value of the gravimeter. This estimation was, however, based on several assumptions and the result may include a serious error. Fortunately, Syowa Station has been built on the ground and not on ice, therefore, we can reoccupy the very point of the station with our gravimeter and confirm the observed result. In the fourth expedition 1959 - 60, a re-measurement of the gravity value at Syowa Station was planned and carried out by using the same gravimeter in the way similar to the preceding expedition. It was confirmed that the gravimeter had a small and linear drift during the whole period of the expedition by continuous observations in Tokyo, Singapore, Cape Town as well as at Syowa Station. The drift rate for the period of 77 days during the forward and backward voyage between Cape Town and Antarctica was deduced to be + 0. 24 <b>milligal</b> per day. This value agreed well with a value, + 0. 25 <b>milligal</b> per day, which was deduced for the period of stay at Syowa Station. We have obtained a mean value of gravity, 982. 5427, from observations at the station in this expedition. This is 2. 6 <b>milligal</b> higher than the former mean value. Errors due to the drift and the changing in the scale value might have caused this difference. It is considered, however, that this is accurate enough to be used safely as a reference value in gravity measurement in this district. Therefore, we have concluded that the former value has an expected, accuracy and it is unnecessary to correct it by present result. On the way to and from Antarctica, observations with the gravimeter were made in Singapore Island. Ten stations were re-occupied and ten other stations were newly established. The distribution of gravity in this island has been made fairly clear by our survey. Similar observations were carried out in Naha, Ryukyu, on the return way of the expedition...|$|E

At scales between entire mountain ranges and ore bodies, Bouguer anomalies may indicate rock types. For example, the northeast-southwest trending high across central New Jersey (see figure) represents a graben of Triassic age largely filled with dense basalts. Salt domes are typically expressed in gravity maps as lows, because salt has a low density compared to the rocks the dome intrudes.

The most striking feature of the gravity field is a pronounced negative anomaly over the main granodiorite with very steep gradients over the country rock to the north-west of the granodiorite but smoother gradients on the south-east Side. The suggested interpretation, based on three dimensional computer methods, is that the main granodiorite mass extends to a depth of eight miles and exhibits a marked gradational increase in density in its south-eastern portions. It is thought that this is the result of magmatic flow within the intrusion, the magma trailing up at a centre slightly offset from the present centre of the outcrop, becoming contaminated by the country rock and flowing down on the south-east side.

During the months of March, April, and May, 1964, about 130 gravity observations were made in Arizona, with LaCoste Romberg Gravity Meter DL- 1 and Worden Gravity Meter (Educator) No. 461. The purpose of this program was to establish 1) a 1 st order control airport gravity base network, 2) a standard calibration range for the State of Arizona, and 3) to gain a structural interpretation of the Tucson Basin. Gravity data were analyzed as to their accuracies and reliabilities, taking into consideration errors involved in tidal corrections, drift corrections, reference datum, and nonlinearity of scale factor of the meters. It is concluded that the reliability of these data is. 1 <b>milligal</b> or better. While correcting for the tidal variation of gravity, it was noticed {{that there was a}} discrepancy between the theoretical and observed tidal correction values. For any additional precise work, it is desirable to correct for tidal variations from actual records, if available, in conjunction with the theoretical tables. Causes for this discrepancy in tidal gravity variation need further study. Programs were written for a digital computer to calculate 1) the theoretical gravity values from the International Gravity Formula, and 2) Free-Air Anomalies, Bouguer Anomalies and Special Bouguer Anomalies from field data for various stations. Free-Air and Bouguer Anomaly values for different stations were analyzed as to their implications in terms of isostasy, crustal structures and local geological structures. Results from Simple Bouguer Anomaly values indicate a crustal thickness of 49 km to 33 km for Arizona with broad isostatic compensation for regional surface irregularities. An analysis of residual Bouguer gravity anomalies of the Tucson Basin in terms of local geological structures, indicates a basin and range structure for this region. The thickness of sediments ranges from more than 700 feet on the north to more than 8000 feet towards the south of the basin with faults indicated in it. Application of a limiting -depth interpretation method implies that the tops of the disturbing bodies can be no deeper than 2 miles below sea level. A total mass deficiency corresponding to the residual gravity low in this basin comes out to be 1. 8 x 10 ¹⁷ grams according to two – dimensional form of Gauss' Theorem. This corresponds to a 135 cubic mile volume of material with a density. 3 grams per cubic centimeter less than the enclosing rocks.

However, for the short wavelengths (less than 10 deg), tracking coverage from ground stations of sufficient density is impossible to obtain. But one or more satellites can observe another satellite and obtain the needed global data coverage. Results are presented of error analyses of possible satellite-to-satellite tracking missions to determine the geopotential at a resolution of 1 x 1 deg. To achieve an accuracy of a few <b>milligals</b> at this resolution requires a satellite altitude at or near 150 km and measurements of intersatellite speed to 10 to the - 6 th m/s...|$|R
40|$|Dense Doppler {{tracking}} {{coverage of}} the Apollo 15 and 16 subsatellites over ten and eighteen day periods when periapsis altitudes were 15 - 50 km has provided detailed gravity mapping of the lunar frontside. Many new gravity features are revealed, including {{one that does not}} correlate with any visible topographic structure. All unfilled craters sampled are negative anomalies. The mascons consistently produce gravity heights that load the surface with about 800 kg/sq cm excess mass. The Orientale region is represented with a solution grid of 177 point masses that clearly show the ringed structure. The eastern limb is also displayed with a solution grid of point masses. The gravity variations over the central portion of the frontface are shown as line-of-sight acceleration contours in <b>milligals...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} made of the {{positive}} gravity anomaly (about 70 <b>milligals</b> free-air) over Bombay {{on the west coast}} of India with the help of new gravity observations made at sea and on land. The Bouguer gravity anomalies are interpreted by considering the geology of the area and constructing a model which best fits the observed anomalies. It is suggested that the positive anomaly is due to a mass of high density rocks (probably olivine gabbro) emplaced in the crust just below the Deccan traps in Bombay area. The mass is about ten kilometres thick with a thinner sill-like extension to the west. This interpretation is compared with that proposed by Glennie (1951) which was based on more restricted data...|$|R
40|$|The lunar mascon basins have {{strongly}} {{free air}} gravity anomalies, generally exceeding 100 <b>milligals</b> at {{an elevation of}} 100 km. The source of the anomalies {{is a combination of}} mantle uplift beneath the impact basins and subsequent infilling by high-density mare basalts. The relative contribution of these two components is still somewhat uncertain, although it is generally accepted that the amount of mantle uplift greatly exceeds the thickness of the basalts. Extensive studies have been carried out of the crustal structure of mare basins, based on gravity data, and their tectonic evolution, based on compressive and extensional tectonic features. The present study endeavored to develop a unified, self-consistent model of the lunar crust and lithosphere incorporating both gravity and tectonic constraints...|$|R
