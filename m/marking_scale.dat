40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} acquiring on-job performance evaluation marks for enlisted personnel is deficient in two important respects: (1) the scales do not adequately differentiate among actual levels of ratee performance, and (2) the manual forms and procedures do not per-mit timely processing {{and application of}} the data for important indi-vidual personnel actions (e. g., advancement, assignment, and quality retention). In 1968 the Navy began its transition from a manual to an auto-mated system, starting with {{the development and implementation}} of an Optical Mark Reader (OMR) document for the top three enlisted Pay Grades, E- 7 / 8 / 9.

40|$|The {{provision}} of interpretative advice on laboratory results is a post-analytic activity and {{an integral part}} of clinical laboratory services. It is valued by healthcare workers and has the potential to prevent or reduce errors and improve patient outcomes. It is important to ensure that interpretative comments provided by laboratory personnel are of high quality: comments should be patient-focused and answer the implicit or explicit question raised by the requesting clinician. Comment providers need to be adequately trained and qualified and be able to demonstrate their proficiency to provide advice on laboratory reports. External quality assessment (EQA) schemes can play a part in assessing and demonstrating the competence of such laboratory staff and have an important role in their education and continuing professional development. A standard structure is proposed for EQA schemes for interpretative comments in clinical chemistry, which addresses the scope and method of assessment including nomenclature and <b>marking</b> <b>scales.</b> There is a need for evidence that participation in an EQA program for interpretative commenting facilitates improved quality of comments. It is proposed that standardizing goals and methods of assessment as well as nomenclature and <b>marking</b> <b>scales</b> may help accumulate evidence to demonstrate the impact of participation in EQA for interpretative commenting on patient outcome...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{communication}} is to describe {{the results of a}} pilot project for the assessment of the transversal competency "the capacity for learning and responsibility". This competency is centred on the capacity for the analysis, synthesis, overview, and practical application of newly acquired knowledge. It is proposed by the University of Barcelona in its undergraduate degree courses, through multidisciplinary teaching teams. The goal of the pilot project is to evaluate this competency. We worked with a group of students in a first-year Business Degree maths course, during the first semester of the 2012 / 2013 academic year. The development of the project was in two stages: (i) design of a specific task to share with the same students in the following semester when the subject would be economic history; and (ii) the elaboration of an evaluation rubric in which we defined the content, the aspects to evaluate, the evaluation criteria, and the <b>marking</b> <b>scale.</b> The attainment of the expectations of quality on the specific task was scored following this rubric, which provided a single basis for the precise and fair assessment by the instructor and for the students' own self-evaluation. We conclude by describing the main findings of the experience. There particularly stood out the high score in the students' self-evaluation given to one aspect of the competency – their capacity for learning – in stark contrast to their instructor's quite negative evaluation. This means that we have to work both to improve teaching practice and to identify the optimal competency evaluation methodology. 2012 PID-UB/ 00...|$|E
40|$|Written Corrective Feedback (WCF) is a {{controversial}} topic among theorists and researchers in L 2 studies. Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, and Takashima (2008) identify two dominant dichotomies in this regard, that is focused vs. unfocused WCF and direct vs. indirect WCF. This study considered both dichotomies in a matrix format, {{resulted in the}} recognition of four types of operationally defined WCF, and aimed at: (1) investigating the effects of four types of WCF (i. e., focused direct CF, unfocused direct CF, focused indirect CF, and unfocused indirect CF) on intermediate EFL learners’ writing performance; (2) finding out the most effective type of WCF for intermediate EFL learners’ writing performance; (3) determining learners’ attitudes toward the effectiveness of using WCF and the types which they had received. After conducting Nelson English Language Test (Test 300 D), out of 140 male and female Iranian EFL learners, 120 of them were selected as intermediate learners, aging from 14 - 18. The subjects were then assigned randomly to four homogeneous groups (each group including 30 participants). The pre-test and post-test both included a writing test which assessed learners’ writing performance, and then their scores were analyzed by using analytic <b>marking</b> <b>scale.</b> The results indicated that, learners outperformed {{in all of the}} four groups, validating WCF as an effective technique which can be used in EFL classes. A clear implication of the study is that WCF types (specially unfocused direct CF) should be emphasized as an essential tool for developing writing ability of intermediate EFL learners.

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Teaching to Speakers of Other Languages, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references. This study examines {{the effectiveness of the}} ELT/, TESOL curriculum in Bangladesh. More particularly, this provides an overview of {{the current state of the}} programs and students feedback on their learning, expectations, and any discrepancies in academic grading through <b>marking</b> <b>scale</b> comparing to public and private university grading system. Also to be singled out, level of expertise of instructors has also appeared to evaluate their acceptability and efficiency in this field along with the cost effectiveness of the programs. However, to conduct this research, researcher has followed mixed-method approach where both qualitative and quantitative data are collected from enrolled or passed out MA in ELT, TESOL students and their instructors from 2 public universities and 3 private universities. Hence, two separate questionnaires for instructors and students are used as tools for data collection following Stufflebeam’s CIPP model of program Evaluation. Finally, this study has illustrated a number of striking findings where it is clearly presented that the current Professional Post-graduate ELT/TESOL programs are moderately fulfilling students’ expectations and job market’s demand. It is also evident that these programs are moderately cost effective in our country. Moreover, most of the instructors involved in teaching do not possess any relevant degree to teach at these programs. Majority are joining from different background like literature. However, there is also a large discrepancy found in the grading scale and curriculum of public and private universities who offer MA in ELT/TESOL program. In fine, the study ends with some important recommendation and suggestions how to develop and sort out any debatable issues form the findings. Md. Abdul KaderM. in TESO...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{served two}} purposes. The first {{was to develop}} a method of detecting differential item functioning (DIF) within tests containing both dichotomously and polytomously scored items. The second was related to gender and aimed a) to investigate if those items that were functioning differently for girls and boys showed any characteristic properties and, if so, b) determine if these properties could be used to predict which items would be flagged for D 1 F. The method development was based on the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method used for dichotmously scored items. By dichotomizing the polytomously scored items both types of item could be compared on the same statistical level as either solved or non-solved items. It was not possible to compare the internal score structures for the two gender groups, only overall score differences were detected. By modelling the empirical item characteristic curves it was possible to develop a MH method for identifying nonuniform DIF. Both internal and external ability criteria were used. Total test score with no purification was used as the internal criterion. Purification was not done for validity reasons, no items were judged as biased. Teacher set marks were used as external criteria. The <b>marking</b> <b>scale</b> had to be transformed for either boys or girls since a comparison of scores for boys and girls with the same marks showed that boys always got higher mean scores. The results of the two MH analyses based on internal and external criterion were compared with results from P-SIBTEST. All three methods corresponded well although P-SIBTEST flagged considerably more items in favour of the reference group (boys) which exhibited a higher overall ability. All 200 items included in the last 15 annual national tests in physics were analysed for DIF and classified by ten criteria The most significant result was that items in electricity were, to a significantly higher degree, flagged as DIF in favour of girls whilst items in mechanics were flagged in favour of boys. Items in other content areas showed no significant pattern. Multiple-Choice items were flagged in favour of boys. Regardless of the degree of significance by which items from different content areas were flagged on a group level {{it was not possible to}} predict which single item would be flagged for DIF. The most probable prediction was always that an item was neutral. Some possible interpretations of DIF as an effect of multidimen-sionality were discussed as were some hypotheses about the reasons why boys did better in mechanics and girls in electricity. digitalisering@um...|$|E
