40|$|Two Antarctic aubrites, Yamato (Y) - 793592 and Allan Hills (ALH) - 78113,were mineralogically studied, for {{comparison}} with minerals in non-Antarctic aubrites and enstatite chondrites. The Antarctic aubrites are breccias consisting of coarse-grained enstatite fragments and fine-grained matrix. ALH- 78113 has 200 - 300 μm dark clasts that are fine-grained aggregates of silicate and opaque minerals. FeO-rich pyroxene (up to Fs_) {{occurs in the}} dark clasts. One dark clast has K-feldspar. These dark clasts seem to be exotic inclusions with distinct mineralogy. Daubreelite in the two Antarctic and non-Antarctic aubrites is lower in Zn than those in EH 3 - 5 chondrites. This reflects the depletion of volatile elements in aubrites. Hydrated Na-Cr-sulfides were also found. Djerfisherite is a common accessory mineral in aubrites. It is characterized by low contents of Cu and Na, and high content of Ni, in comparison to djerfisherite in EH 3 - 5 chondrites. Y- 793592 has many roedderite grains.

The island is {{extensively}} affected by two periods of volcanism with the oldest erupting during the Pleistocene and the younger during the Holocene period. This study focused on inclusions present within several enormous megacrysts retrieved from a scoria cone on Marion, named Pyroxene Hill. Microfocus CT, electron microprobe, and Raman spectroscopy are used to identify all the mineral phases present within the clinopyroxene megacrysts {{as well as to}} determine their textural relationships in order to visualise their internal features without obliterating any of these rare megacrysts. Inclusions of olivine, Fe-Ti-Al-Cr oxides (magnetite, chromite, and ilmenite), rhomb oxides (hematite) and sulphides were identified. Amphibole was also identified as secondary product. Their textural relationships are used to determine the major magmatic processes and formation mechanisms influencing their formation and preservation.

These relics originate from magmatic veinlets, emplaced at an early stage of the <b>magmatic</b> <b>process</b> and later recrystallized at high temperature (> 800 °C) by a CO 2 -dominated fl uid (stage 1). Such fl uid probably resulted from the reaction of calcite with the main intrusive body {{at the time of its}} emplacement, a reaction also witnessed by the development of a symplectitic association of anorthite and aluminous pyroxene at the intrusive margins, and by the (exceptional) occurrence of Na-rich melilite. Part of the intrusive boundaries were later invaded by pegmatite-forming liquids or fl uids that, upon reaction with calcite, fi rst produced idiomorphic crystals of (Fe,Mg) -rich wollastonite (stage 2), occasionally hosting minerals of stage 1, followed by the development of a fi brous wollastonite – grossular association (stage W) accompanied by an (Al-poor) diopside that progressively became Al-rich (stage P) through further modifi cation of the fl uid by reaction wit...|$|E
40|$|Ilopango Caldera, {{which is}} part of the Central American {{volcanic}} arc in El Salvador, is a lake-filled caldera located approximately 10 km east of the capital city has an eventful history of eruption; the most recent pyroclastic eruption, known at the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ), took place ~ 1600 years ago. In 1880 a lava dome was erupted into the center of the caldera lake. The aim of this study is to understand the nature of Ilopango eruptions, the magmatic evolution of Ilopango through time and attempt to place Ilopango into a regional context. I conclude that the intracaldera stratigraphy is mostly subaqueously emplaced and that the caldera was occupied by a lake > 53, 000 years ago during formation of the San Agustin Block unit. The eruption which formed the San Agustin Block unit began with a phreatomagmatic phase and progressed to a more degassed phase, spalling pumices from the quenched carapace of the lava dome. The magmatic evolution of Ilopango is not a progressive <b>magmatic</b> <b>process</b> related to a time factor, but rather reflected by a reservoir that experiences replenishment of a more mafic composition causing fluctuations in magma composition over time. Ilopango is less evolved than other Central American silicic centers such as Atitlan, Amatitlan and Zunil, but is similar in composition to Santa Maria, Santiaguito and Acantenango...|$|E

The two-pyroxene hornfels {{recovered from the}} base of the sheeted dike sequence at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site 1256 (equatorial Eastern Pacific) are interpreted as a conducting boundary layer between the underlying axial melt lens and the hydrothermally cooled sheeted dikes. They are cut by numerous small, felsic veins, which were recently interpreted as a product of hydrous partial melting of sheeted dikes. Here, we present trace element compositions of products (melts and residues) of hydrous partial melting experiments using basalts and hornfels from IODP Site 1256 as starting material. The experimental products generated between 910 °C and 970 °C match the natural lithologies from Site 1256 in terms of major and trace element compositions. The compositions of the anatectic melts correspond to the compositions of the felsic veins, while the residual minerals match the compositions of the two-pyroxene hornfels, evidencing that hydrous partial melting is an important <b>magmatic</b> <b>process</b> in the gabbro/dike transition of fast-spreading mid-oceanic ridges. Our results complement previous experimental studies on anatectic processes occurring at the roof of the magma chambers from fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges.

40|$|Tourmaline nodules {{occurring}} in the Capo Bianco (Elba Island, Italy) aplitic rocks are here investigated by X‑ray microtomography 3 D imaging. This non-invasive technique provides 3 D images of the tourmaline nodules, revealing an irregular morphology consisting of branches that extend radially from the cores. The nodules present scale-invariant features that can be described by a box-counting fractal dimension. The value of the fractal dimension {{is proportional to the}} size of the nodules and tends asymptotically to a value of 2. 5, in agreement with the results obtained from the simulation of virtual nodules, by means of a diffusion-limited aggregation model based on a Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm, in which the growth probability at the tips of the nodule is an inverse function of the diffusion coefficient. The results support the hypothesis that tourmaline formed by a disequilibrium <b>magmatic</b> <b>process,</b> in which diffusion represents the rate-limiting step, inducing the formation of nodules with irregular shapes. This study shows the potential of X‑ray microtomography, in combination with numerical modeling, as a probe for accessing the 3 D microstructural information of complex mineral morphologies with a non-invasive approach.

40|$|The early Cretaceous thermal {{perturbation}} {{beneath the}} eastern continental {{margin of the}} Indian shield resulted in the eruption of the Rajmahal Traps. To understand {{the impact of the}} <b>magmatic</b> <b>process</b> that originated in the deep mantle on the lower crustal level of the eastern Indian shield and adjoining Bengal basin the conspicuous gravity anomalies observed over the region have been modelled integrating with available geophysical information. The 3 -D gravity modelling has delin-eated 10 – 15 km thick high-density (ρ = 3. 02 g/cm 3) accreted igneous layer {{at the base of the}} crust beneath the Rajmahal Traps. Thickness of this layer varies from 16 km to the west of the Rajmahal towards north to about 12 km near Kharagpur towards south and about 18 km to the east of the Raniganj in the central part of the region. The greater thickness of the magmatic body beneath the central part of the region presents itself as the locus of the potential feeder channel for the Rajmahal Traps. It is suggested that the crustal accretion is the imprint of the mantle thermal perturbation, over which the eastern margin of the eastern Indian shield opened around 117 Ma ago. The nosing of the crustal accretion in the down south suggests the possible imprint of the subsequent magmatic intrusion along the plume path. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} (mineralogical, geochronological, and geochemical) {{study of}} zircons from an eclogitized gabbronorite dike {{was carried out}} in order to identify reliable indicators (mineralogical and geochronological) of genesis of the zircons in their various populations and, correspondingly, ages of certain geological events (magmatic crystallization of the gabbroids, their eclogitization, and overprinted retrograde metamorphism). Three populations of zircons separated from two rock samples comprised xenogenic, magmatic (gabbroic), and metamorphic zircons, with the latter found exclusively in the sample of retrograded eclogitized gabbroids. Group I zircons are xenogenic and have a Meso- to Neoarchean age. Mineral inclusions in them (quartz, apatite, biotite, and chlorite) are atypical of gabbroids, and geochemistry of these zircons is very diverse. Group II zircons contain mineral inclusions of ortho- and clinopyroxene and are distinguished for their very high U, Th, Pb, and REE concentrations and Th/U ratios. These zircons formed during the late magmatic crystallization of the gabbroids at temperatures of 1150 - 1160 °C, and their U-Pb age 2389 ± 25 Ma corresponds to this process. Eclogite mineral assemblages crystallized shortly after the <b>magmatic</b> <b>process,</b> as follows from the fact that marginal portions of prismatic zircons contain clinopyroxene inclusions with elevated contents of the jadeite end-member. Group III zircons contain rare amphibole and biotite inclusions and have low Ti, Y, and REE concentrations, low Th/U ratios, high Hf concentrations, contain more HREE than LREE, and have U-Pb age 1911 ± 9. 5 Ma, which corresponds to age of overprinted amphibolite-facies metamorphism...|$|E
