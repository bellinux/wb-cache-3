He was keen to exercise as soon as he could during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt to find one that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{a problem}} in the McCartney house, as Jim only earned up to £6.00 a week, which was less than his wife. Because of their {{financial}} situation, the McCartney family could not afford to buy a television set until the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and never owned a car. His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars. When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside and stare through the windows, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable and nervous. Eight years after Mary's death, Jim married , on 24 November 1964. Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth, whom Jim legally adopted.|$|E

60|$|Ginger Dick {{sat down}} agin, {{and when the}} murder was over 'e said it <b>made</b> <b>'im</b> <b>feel</b> faint, and <b>'im</b> and Peter Russet {{went out for a}} breath of fresh air. They 'ad three at the first place, and then they moved on to another and forgot all about Isaac and the {{dissolving}} views until ten o'clock, when Ginger, who 'ad been very liberal to some friends 'e'd made in a pub, found 'e'd spent 'is last penny.|$|R

5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> better.|$|E
5|$|Having {{worked with}} Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> ready to be a father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] I thought, [...] "the care I've {{taken of}} <b>him</b> has <b>made</b> <b>him</b> really <b>feel</b> a little {{grateful}} to me." [...] So I dozed off and thought nothing {{more at the}} moment about it.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{actually}} <b>feel</b> {{as if it}} were a {{cruel and}} unmerited suspicion, but she did not over come him. [...] "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "it would be against my orders, as father of a family, to give my child away without doing my poor best for her." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{only thing}} about 'im that they didn't like was that 'e was a teetotaler. He'd go into public-'ouses with 'em, but he wouldn't drink; leastways, {{that is to}} say, he wouldn't drink beer, and Ginger {{used to say that}} it <b>made</b> <b>'im</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable to see Bill put away a bottle o' {{lemonade}} every time they 'ad a drink. One night arter 'e had 'ad seventeen bottles he could 'ardly got home, and Peter Russet, who knew a lot about pills and such-like, pointed out to 'im 'ow bad it was for his constitushon. He proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o' Bill's stomach, and that if 'e kept on 'e might drop down dead at any moment.|$|R
5|$|In 1946 until mid-1947, the Piccards were {{consultants}} to General Mills (the cereal company and dominant industry in Minneapolis) working under Otto Winzen, who Jean had met through the university. Winzen and Jean proposed a stratosphere flight with 100 cluster balloons and secured a government {{contract with the}} Navy. Featured in Navy press releases, Jean was named a project scientist responsible for gondola design and for testing the balloon film materials. But he balked, both at making weekly status reports that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> like a lower-level employee, and {{at the prospect of}} General Mills owning the patents to his ideas. Working as a consultant, Jeannette threatened to break off ties with the Navy and General Mills unless she was allowed to fly with Jean. Unfortunately this began a rift between General Mills and the Piccards. They were both were fired in 1947, for they were too critical of Winzen and General Mills staff.|$|E
25|$|Sassoon {{refers to}} Edward Carpenter's writing on {{sexuality}} The Intermediate Sex, {{and it is}} implied that Sassoon is a homosexual because he states that such works <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> normal about his sexuality.|$|E
25|$|He {{then left}} for Hong Kong {{and on to}} Taipei. He had chosen Taipei as the final {{stopover}} when he learned the Philippines had severed diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan). This <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> more secure; the Taiwan government could pretend they {{were not aware of}} his presence. There would also be a couple of Taiwanese friends accompanying him. From Taipei he flew to Manila on then Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines Flight 811.|$|E
60|$|She {{used the}} word gentilhomme, which {{conveyed}} the sense of nobility of blood, and the Marquis acknowledged the introduction {{with one of those}} graceful bows that Arthur hated, because they <b>made</b> <b>him</b> doubly <b>feel</b> the stiffness of his own limitation. He was glad to linger with Lanty, who was looking in wonder at the grim buildings.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 Simon Weston {{undertook}} {{his first}} goodwill tour, to Australia, {{at the request}} of the Guards Association of Australasia. The resulting donations to children's burns units <b>made</b> <b>him</b> begin to <b>feel</b> useful again.|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} much {{attracted}} by him. He looked so preoccupied, and his strange, blank silences, which she could not read, moved her and made her wonder over <b>him,</b> <b>made</b> her <b>feel</b> reverential towards <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following {{operations}} in {{observation of the}} Elbe and the relief of a POW camp containing around 100 Belgians the regiment entered Hamburg after the surrender of that city. The condition {{of the city and}} its people <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> very uncomfortable and his feelings towards the German populace mellowed from that of hate to that of pity. After VE Day he was able to work alongside the Catholic relief agency CCRA based at Greven near Münster, helping displaced persons.|$|E
25|$|Argento {{moved to}} Minneapolis in 1958 {{with his new}} wife, soprano Carolyn Bailey, to begin {{teaching}} theory and composition at the University of Minnesota. Within a few years he received commissions from virtually every major performing group there. He has remarked that this constant feeling of strong community interest in his work <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> particularly at home in Minnesota, although he had at first resisted moving there. For several years, he hoped that a position on his native East Coast would develop.|$|E
25|$|While Strom {{earned more}} than twice as much in the ABA than the NBA, he soon became disenchanted with the ABA for the lack of big name superstars and arenas that the NBA provided. Strom had {{anticipated}} that the ABA product would be inferior to the NBA, but assumed that the increase in pay would compensate for the level of play. However, he fed off the energy of the fans when officiating games and the small attendance sizes in the ABA <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> depressed.|$|E
60|$|The captain readily {{showed him}} a hammock, in the after-cabin, into which he threw himself, to seek that repose which the {{exercise}} and agitation of the preceding day, {{as well as the}} lateness of the hour, <b>made</b> <b>him</b> now <b>feel</b> desirable. Sleep, deep and heavy, sunk down on him in a few minutes, but it did not endure long. In his sleep he was disturbed by female cries; and at length, as he thought, distinctly heard the voice of Alice Bridgenorth call on his name.|$|R
60|$|Quiet and dark, {{beside him}} stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused {{himself from his}} {{thoughtful}} quest, he fancied, {{from the turn of}} the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at <b>him</b> keenly. It <b>made</b> <b>him</b> shudder, and <b>feel</b> very cold.|$|R
50|$|Marvin Gaye {{was going}} through a {{personal}} crisis in the summer of 1976. In November 1975, Gaye's estranged first wife, Anna Gordy Gaye, sued Gaye for divorce, claiming irreconcilable differences, and sought child support for their adopted son, Marvin Gaye III. Gaye later argued his spending habit was causing him to fall behind on payments. In September 1976, a warrant was issued for Gaye's arrest after he failed to pay alimony; this <b>made</b> <b>him</b> to <b>feel</b> vulnerable during the recording sessions causing the singer to hide from the public for several days.|$|R
25|$|Six months later, when Genie was 20 months old, her {{paternal}} grandmother {{died in a}} hit-and-run traffic accident. Her death affected Genie's father far beyond normal levels of grief, and because his son had been walking with her he held his son responsible, further heightening his anger. When the truck's driver received only a probationary sentence for both manslaughter and drunk driving, he became delusional with rage. Scientists believed these events <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> society had failed him and convinced him {{he would need to}} protect his family from the outside world, and that in doing so he lacked the self-awareness to recognize the destruction his actions caused. Because Genie's father believed Genie was severely mentally retarded he thought she needed additional protection from society, and therefore decided he needed to entirely hide her existence. He immediately quit his job and moved his family into his mother's two-bedroom house, where he insisted on leaving his mother's car and bedroom completely untouched as shrines to her, and further increased the family's isolation.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

60|$|He {{seemed to}} have a power of {{reaching}} rather intimate conversation in one silent and cat-like bound, as he had scaled the steep road, and it <b>made</b> her <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> to be dangerous, and perhaps unscrupulous. She changed the subject sharply, not without it movement toward gratifying her own curiosity.|$|R
60|$|I {{have said}} that under his calm {{exterior}} he had a fervor which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> easily <b>feel</b> the presence of poetry in everyday events; and the forms of the Juden-gasse, rousing the sense of union with what is remote, set him musing on two elements of our historic life which that sense raises into the same region of poetry;--the faint beginnings of faiths and institutions, and their obscure lingering decay; the dust and withered remnants {{with which they are}} apt to be covered, only enhancing for the awakened perception the impressiveness either of a sublimely penetrating life, as in the twin green leaves that will become the sheltering tree, or of a pathetic inheritance in which all the grandeur and the glory have become a sorrowing memory.|$|R
6000|$|... "That fellow Dunster, on the platform, {{the first}} moment I spoke to <b>him,</b> <b>made</b> me <b>feel</b> like a cur," [...] the boy said, with a sudden access of vigour in his tone.

500|$|Herriman had a {{great love}} of animals, and had {{a large number of}} dogs and cats; he had five dogs and {{thirteen}} cats in 1934. [...] He usually kept to a vegetarian diet, except when it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> too weak, and he refused to ride horses. [...] He so admired Henry Ford's pacifist stance that he would only buy Ford automobiles. He purchased a new model annually.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} scientists, inventors, and science fiction writers have also {{credited}} Tom Swift with inspiring them, including Ray Kurzweil, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. The Tom Swift, Jr. adventures were Steve Wozniak's favorite reading {{as a boy}} and inspired {{him to become a}} scientist. According to Wozniak, reading the Tom Swift books <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "that engineers can save the world from all sorts of conflict and evil".|$|E
60|$|Her eyes always grew wet {{when she}} thought like that, and {{she turned to look}} at herself in the glass. His heart had beat inside that coat, and his brain had worked under that hat at levels of thought she would never reach. The {{consciousness}} of her weakness beside <b>him</b> <b>made</b> her <b>feel</b> quite sick. Before she had got the things off her the door opened, and her husband entered the room.|$|R
60|$|Now King Aegeus {{had been}} gazing earnestly {{at the young}} stranger, as he drew near the throne. There was something, he knew not what, either in his white brow, or in the fine {{expression}} of his mouth, or in his beautiful and tender eyes, that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> indistinctly <b>feel</b> {{as if he had}} seen this youth before; as if, indeed, he had trotted him on his knee when a baby, and had beheld him growing to be a stalwart man, while he himself grew old. But Medea guessed how the king felt, and would not suffer him to yield to these natural sensibilities; although they were the voice of his deepest heart, telling him as plainly as it could speak, that here was our dear son, and Aethra's son, coming to claim him for a father. The enchantress again whispered in the king's ear, and compelled him, by her witchcraft, to see everything under a false aspect.|$|R
50|$|Hank Heywood Jr. {{appears as}} Captain Steel in The New 52 title, Earth-2. The modern version of Hank is {{revealed}} to be a young Asian man of Filipino descent. It is stated that Hank was originally a young boy born with a degenerative bone disorder that would have killed him by his 18th birthday, and that his father replaced all of his bones with an experimental metal {{to save his life}} (although it also <b>made</b> <b>him</b> unable to <b>feel</b> emotion). During Darkseid's invasion of Earth-2, Hank's father killed himself and destroyed his research in order to prevent the Parademons from getting their hands on it.|$|R
