The Metal Casting Technology Station at the University of Johannesburg (MCTS-UJ) {{has been a}} reputed Technology Station and center of excellence for trouble shooting foundry problems and conducting research in South African foundries. The Department of Science and Technology in South Africa funds the Technology Stations Programme (TSP) through the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA). There are eighteen technology stations across the country at various universities and three of these focus in supporting the foundry industry. The mandate of the Technology Station is to develop human capital and support localization through technology and skills transfer.

Thermal properties of the mould constitute therefore an important factor which is necessary to consider while seeking for the mentioned improvement.

It is also available at: [URL] (SL) can be used rapidly to produce injection moulding tools. The disadvantage of the technique is that it is capable of producing {{only a small number of}} parts before failure. Stereolithography tools may break under the force exerted by part ejection when the friction between a moulding and a feature of the tool is greater than the tensile strength of the tool, resulting in tensile failure. Very few justified recommendations exist concerning the choice of mould design variables that can lower the part ejection force experienced and reduce the risk of SL tool failure. This research investigates the ejection forces resulting from the injection moulding of polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and polyamide 66 (PA 66) parts from SL tools that are identical in all respects except for their build layer thickness (a process variable when generating the SL tooling cavities) and incorporated draft angles (a tooling design variable). This work attempts to identify appropriate evidence for recommendations with respect to these variables and SL injection moulding. The results show that linear adjustment of draft angle results in a fairly minor linear change in part ejection force according to the <b>moulding</b> <b>material.</b> A linear adjustment of the build layer thickness results in a greater change in part ejection force as a more non-linear relationship. In both cases the greatest ejection forces were experienced by PA 66, then ABS and then the PP parts.

A mathematical model was used in an attempt to predict ejection forces according to the <b>moulding</b> <b>material</b> used. This model did reflect the experimental results in terms of relative values but not in absolute values, which may be due to the limitations imposed by the development of the expressions and uncertainty about some specific values...|$|E

Adhesion is an important physical phenomenon commonly observed in many food-related situations. With respect to chocolate adhesion {{it is expected that}} the balance of the adhesion force between the chocolate and the mould and the cohesion force within the chocolate itself determines the stickiness at the chocolate-mould interface during demoulding. The research presented investigated the effect of surface thermodynamics and processing conditions on the observed extent of adhesion of (aerated) chocolate to four different <b>mould</b> <b>materials</b> (quartz glass, stainless steel, polycarbonate, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)). Surface energy of solid <b>mould</b> <b>materials</b> was calculated from experimental surface tension and contact angle data. An experimental set-up build around a Texture Analyser was developed for the experimental surface adhesion force determination, using a simple separation test between the solidified chocolate and a mould probe. Process conditions specific to the moulding and demoulding phases of the commercial chocolate manufacturing process have been investigated using this set-up. Surface energy (thermodynamics) {{has been shown to be}} the major factor controlling the adhesion between chocolate and a <b>mould</b> <b>material.</b> Chocolate-mould adhesion can be minimized if the total surface energy of the <b>mould</b> <b>material</b> is < 30 mN m-l,and the electron donor component 15 mN m- l.
