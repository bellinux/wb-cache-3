As Cole's salary increased {{and he was able}} to support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship.

According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time to the church.
