5|$|One of {{the reasons}} White sought to leave Harveys was {{that the size of}} the kitchen was {{insufficient}} to allow him to expand the range of techniques in the dishes he served. With the move to The Restaurant, he added dishes with techniques such as confit, braising and en vessie highlighted. The move also saw an expansion to the number of different options served; while Harveys may have had a handful of <b>main</b> <b>courses,</b> this was increased to around 15 or more at The Restaurant. White's concept for the food was simplified versions of classical French cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian {{culture and}} life {{revolves}} around food in every aspect, {{whether it is}} an ordinary day or a special occasion such as a wedding or holiday. Meals are structured in a cyclical order by Palestinians and span into two <b>main</b> <b>courses</b> and several intermediate ones like coffee, fruits and sweets as well as dinner. Like in most Arab cultures, meals are a {{time to spend with}} family and could last 1–2 hours depending on the specific time of the day. Unlike other cultures, lunch is the primary course and breakfast and dinner are lighter in contents.|$|E
50|$|In formal dining, a well-planned <b>main</b> <b>course</b> can {{function}} {{as a sort of}} gastronomic apex or climax. In such a scheme, the preceding courses are designed to prepare for and lead up to the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> {{in such a way that}} the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> is anticipated and, when the scheme is successful, increased in its ability to satisfy and delight the diner. The <b>courses</b> following the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> then calm the palate and the stomach, acting as a sort of dénouement or anticlimax.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{repeated}} exposure, randomized, cross-over quasi-experimental {{study was to determine}} the individual and combined impact of (a) the timing of serving dessert and (b) portion size of <b>main</b> <b>course</b> in 2 – 5 year old children (n= 23) on energy intake at lunch in a childcare setting. Children were served two study lunches (fish or pasta, each with dessert) twice a week for 12 weeks that differed in the timing of dessert (served with or after the <b>main</b> <b>course)</b> and portion size of the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> (reference portion or 50 % larger portion). Analyses of variance revealed that serving dessert after the meal resulted in higher energy intakes from both the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> and from dessert, and therefore greater total intake at the meal. Portion size of the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> did not influence total energy intake at the meal. Results indicate that the timing of serving dessert affects children’s energy intake regardless of the portion size of the <b>main</b> <b>course.</b> Specifically, serving dessert with the meal reduces total energy intake regardless of the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> portion size. This suggests that offering dessert with the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> may be an effective strategy for decreasing total energy intake at meals in preschool-aged children...|$|R

50|$|A Vietnamese feast has two courses: <b>main</b> <b>course</b> (món mặn - salty dish) {{and dessert}} (món ngọt - sweet dish). All dishes, except for {{individual}} bowls of rice, are enjoyed collectively. All <b>main</b> <b>course</b> dishes are served simultaneously {{rather than one}} after another. The major dish of the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> {{is placed in the}} centers of the tables, usually big pots of soup or hot pot.|$|R
50|$|In certain areas, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for a digestif to be taken before a <b>main</b> <b>course.</b> One example is le trou Normand, a glass of Calvados taken before the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> of a meal.|$|R

25|$|At some point, the amuse-bouche {{transformed}} from an unexpected bonus to a de rigueur offering at Michelin Guide-starred restaurants and those aspiring to that category (as recently as 1999, The New York Times provided a parenthetical {{explanation of the}} course). This in turn created a set of logistical challenges for restaurants: amuse-bouche must be prepared in sufficient quantities to be served to all guests, usually just after the order is taken or between <b>main</b> <b>courses.</b> This often requires a separate cooking station devoted solely to producing the course quickly {{as well as a}} large and varied collection of specialized china for serving the amuse. Interesting plates, demitasse cups, and large Asian-style soup spoons are popular choices. In addition, the kitchen must try to accommodate guests that have an aversion or allergy to ingredients in the amuse.|$|E

50|$|Although {{intended}} to imitate a meal {{that might have}} been served during the Middle Ages, the food at a madrigal dinner is often regional and will vary from show to show. Courses usually include a wassail or drinks <b>course,</b> salad, a <b>main</b> <b>course</b> and dessert. Although the Boar's Head Carol is the most popular madrigal song to announce the <b>main</b> <b>course,</b> the most popular meat for the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> is chicken, often specifically Cornish game hen.|$|R
25|$|In Pakistan, <b>main</b> <b>courses</b> {{are usually}} served with wheat bread (either roti or naan) or rice. Salad is {{generally}} {{taken as a}} side dish with the main course, rather than as an appetizer beforehand. Assorted fresh fruit or sometimes desserts are consumed {{at the end of a}} meal. Meat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other South Asian cuisines. According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian. Of all the meats, the most popular are goat, mutton, beef and chicken, which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).|$|E

500|$|The [...] "culinary jewel" [...] of the Augustus Tower is the Restaurant Guy Savoy, namesake of the three-star Michelin chef, whose {{restaurant}} in Paris has been ranked {{as one of}} the finest dining establishments in the world. When Savoy was approached to open a second {{restaurant in}} Vegas, he initially said no, until Caesars told him they wanted him to recreate what he had done in Paris with the same ambiance, quality and cuisine. His request was that to maintain quality, the restaurant must be limited to service five days a week, to which the management agreed. The restaurant opened in 2006 and in 2008, Savoy brought his executive chef from the Paris restaurant to Vegas. The establishment is managed by Savoy's son, Franck Savoy. The menu features signature dishes including artichoke and black truffle soup; buttered, roasted veal sweetbreads; crispy sea bass; and pan-seared quail, as <b>main</b> <b>courses</b> and dessert of chocolate ganache served with tonka beans. The wine cellar features 15,000 bottles from which to select and it is the only Champagne Krug Chef's Table restaurant in the United States.|$|E

Winner found that the hotel's entrance to the restaurant was still under refurbishment, and that the service was sub par with items being dropped by their waiter. Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course of pot roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes with parsley, [...] "as good a main course as I have ever eaten, and I had the sense to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood." [...] He called the desserts [...] "to die for", and stole Caine's dessert to eat in addition to his own. John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both <b>main</b> <b>courses</b> [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit.

2500|$|Narbonne itself {{fell into}} a slow decline in the 14th century, {{for a variety of}} reasons. One was due to a change {{in the course of the}} Aude River, which caused {{increased}} silting of the navigational access. The river, known as the Atax in ancient times, had always had two <b>main</b> <b>courses</b> which split close to Salelles; one fork going south through Narbonne and then to the sea close to the Clappe Massif, the other heading east to the etang at Vendres close to the current mouth of the river well to the east of the city. The Romans had improved the navigability of the river by building a dam near Salelles and also by canalising the river as it passed through its marshy delta to the sea (then as now the canal was known as the Robine.) A major flood in 1320 swept the dam away. The Aude river had a long history of overflowing its banks. When it was a bustling port, the distance from the coast was approximately , but at that time the access to the sea was deep enough when the river was in full spate which made communication between port and city unreliable. However, goods could easily be transported by land and in shallow barges from the ports (there were several: a main port and forward ports for larger vessels; indeed the navigability from the sea into the etang and then into the river had been a perennial problem!) ...|$|E
