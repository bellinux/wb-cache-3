40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1990 In the {{research}} for this paper, which concerns a conceptual model for a <b>management</b> <b>information</b> system (MIS) for a regional office, {{it was found that}} the regional office could be seen as a typical mini organisation. The regional office as organisation needs educational leaders in order to function. This educational management can be embodied in a pyramid structure comprising top management, middle management and first-line <b>management.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>information</b> is therefore essential for the effective management of a regional office. Effective management in a regional office can only take place when the educational leaders are supported in the execution of their different managerial tasks. This support of the educational leaders necessitates the timely and relevant supply of <b>management</b> <b>information.</b> Research showed that a <b>management</b> <b>information</b> system is a computer based system which provides information to the educational leaders in support of their different management responsibilities. Not only the hardware and software, but also the guidelines and supporting staff can be classified as components of the <b>management</b> <b>information</b> system. The demands of an educational leader from a <b>management</b> <b>information</b> system comprises information on pupils, college and school educators, as well as information regarding physical matters. These three categories of information can be compiled into three integrated files on a database for each regional office.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to explore the feasibility of building <b>management</b> <b>information</b> gateways that relay <b>management</b> <b>information</b> at regular intervals between the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Common <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> Protocol (CMIP). This <b>management</b> <b>information</b> is stored in an object-oriented <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> Base (MIB) that can be accessed by Common <b>Management</b> <b>Information</b> Service (CMIS) <b>management</b> applications. An approach for polling based on a variable polling frequency is proposed. A stateful model for a simple version CMIP proxy agent for SNMP which requires <b>management</b> <b>information</b> collected from SNMP agents to be stored in the proxy agent's MIB is also proposed. The proxy agent is implemented using the so-called OSIMIS- 3. 0 software package which implements CMIP, and an existing SNMP application. A policy of variable polling frequency which is based on the cost of polling, the cost of loss of relevant <b>management</b> <b>information</b> and the frequency of update of new information is used by the proxy agent. The agent is tested on a distributed network consisting of a LAN at McGill University and another LAN at the University of Montreal. The results from the test show that using the above model of a proxy agent between CMIP and SNMP yields a better response time as compared to the stateless proxy agent model used by the Network Management Forum (NMF 93), as well as an up-to-date information about the network to a CMIS manager during critical situations...|$|R
