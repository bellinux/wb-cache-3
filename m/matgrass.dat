50|$|The {{ecology of}} the region is {{important}} because of the constant shifting of the Griese, the dolomitic screes, because this dynamic supports the existence of rare plants. In the Friedergries, for example, the rare Spirke tree grows, a species exclusively dependent on frequent movements of scree. In addition, many other rare plants occur here. The snowbell (Soldanella minima ssp. minima) and Mount Baldo sedge (Carex baldensis), which are predominantly southern Alpine species, only occur in the northern Alpine region here in the Ammergau Alps. Of internationaler significance are the diverse raised bogs and fens. Certain woodland communities are also very valuable such as the unique boulder and ravine and forests or coloured reed grass and pine woods. Extensive meadow cultivation on calcareous grassland, wet meadows and <b>matgrass</b> meadows further enrich the flora of the Ammergau Alps.|$|E
50|$|Grazing on the grinden {{lasted for}} 500 years until the 19th century. in the mid-18th century Weidbrennen {{had led to}} such large scale {{destruction}} of the forest that it was banned. With the emergence of cattle sheds, the grazing came to an end. The grinden, however, continued {{to be used for}} making hay, especially from <b>matgrass</b> (Nardus stricta), which the farmers believed had healing properties for the animals. In the mid-1950s, with the decline of cattle grazing, even this form of farming was increasingly abandoned. With the end of the agricultural use of the grinden the forest began to gradually re-establish itself. In addition to a natural reforestation by the natural seeding of pine trees, especially mountain pine, the areas were also reforested in a managed way from the 18th century. The grinden on the Enz heights were thus reforested by the 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|Because apomictic {{plants are}} genetically {{identical}} {{from one generation}} to the next, each lineage has some of the characters of a true species, maintaining distinctions from other apomictic lineages within the same genus, while having much smaller differences than is normal between species of most genera. They are therefore often called microspecies. In some genera, it is possible to identify and name hundreds or even thousands of microspecies, which may be grouped together as species aggregates, typically listed in floras with the convention [...] "Genus species agg." [...] (such as the bramble, Rubus fruticosus agg.). In some plant families, genera with apomixis are quite common, for example in Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Rosaceae. Examples of apomixis can be found in the genera Crataegus (hawthorns), Amelanchier (shadbush), Sorbus (rowans and whitebeams), Rubus (brambles or blackberries), Poa (meadow grasses), Nardus stricta (<b>Matgrass),</b> Hieracium (hawkweeds) and Taraxacum (dandelions). Apomixis is reported to occur in about 10% of globally extant ferns. [...] Among polystichoid ferns, apomixis evolved several times independently in three different clades.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{nitrification}} is a {{key process}} in regulating the relative availability of the various inorganic N forms to plants. In the current study, we investigated the effect of different plant species on numbers of ammonia-oxidizing microbial cells by measuring the potential nitrification activity (PAA). Soil from <b>matgrass</b> sward and from calcareous grassland was collected {{in the field and}} four characteristic plant species of each vegetation type were cultivated from seed. These plant species grew for 4 months in the two soil types. After those 4 months, PAA were significantly higher in calcareous soil compared to the <b>matgrass</b> sward soil and the presence of <b>matgrass</b> sward species had significantly decreased PAA in this soil. In soils from <b>matgrass</b> stands, PAA were much lower, and no effect of the different plant species could be detected. Plant biomass of the calcareous grassland species was overall positively correlated with PAA, whereas for <b>matgrass</b> plant species a negative trend was found. We conclude that <b>matgrass</b> sward plant species had a clear repressing effect on the potential ammonia-oxidizing activity in calcareous grassland soil within this 4 -month growth experiment. The observed repression of PAA is in accordance with earlier field observations of PAA in the different vegetation zones, where repressed PAA and significant higher ammonium to nitrate ratios were observed in the <b>matgrass</b> sward vegetation compared to the other vegetation zones. Major findings {{of this study indicate that}} plant species can influence the nitrification potential of their habitats, i. e. certain species can repress nitrification potential and others can increase nitrification potential of their habitats...|$|E
40|$|Soilorganisms are {{important}} in the structuring of plant communities. However, {{little is known about}} how to apply this knowledge to vegetation management. Here, we examined if soilorganisms may promote plantspecies of characteristic habitats, and suppress plantspecies of disturbed habitats.

We recorded the vegetation composition and measured biotic and abiotic soil characteristics of the sites. In a pot experiment, we mixed non-sterilized (with soilorganisms) or sterilized (without soilorganisms) soil inoculum from each field with a common sterilized background soil. We planted seedlings of characteristic <b>matgrass</b> speciesAntennaria dioica and Nardus stricta, of disturbance indicators Deschampsia flexuosa and Agrostis capillaris, or a combination of the four species. At harvest, we measured root and shoot dry mass of all plants. The vegetation composition of characteristic <b>matgrass</b> swards differed from the disturbed and unsuccessfully restored fields. The successfully restored fields were intermediate. The composition of the nematode community tended to follow the same pattern. In the pot experiment, addition of soilorganisms increased the biomass of A. dioica, N. stricta and D. flexuosa, but decreased the biomass of A. capillaris. However, the effect of soilorganisms on plant biomass was not related to field type. A. dioica showed a large variation in biomass in non-sterilized, but not in sterilized soil. Soilorganisms from some sites increased plant biomass, whereas soilorganisms from other sites did not. The biomass of characteristic <b>matgrass</b> plants was lower in the presence of plants from disturbed swards, irrespective of the presence of soilorganisms.

40|$|Measurements along a hill-slope {{vegetation}} gradient in nutrient-poor grasslands from acid grasslands via <b>matgrass</b> swards to calcareous grasslands showed increased ammonium to nitrate ratios in the <b>matgrass</b> swards. These results {{generated the}} research question whether {{there might be}} a difference in nitrification activity or nitrifying community composition between the different zones in this hill-slope gradient. In each of the vegetation types along the gradient, soil samples were taken in five grassland nature reserves. Potential nitrification rates have been determined as an indication {{of the size of the}} active ammonia-oxidising microbial communities. Additionally, the dominant ammonia-oxidising sequences related to the ß-Proteobacteria have been determined by a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based on the 16 S rRNA gene in combination with Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) at one of the nature reserves. Compared to the top and lower zones of the vegetation gradient (i. e. acid grasslands and calcareous grasslands, respectively), potential nitrification rates were clearly repressed in the middle, <b>matgrass</b> swards zone. In contrast to the differences in potential nitrification activities observed in one of the nature reserves (Bemelerberg), no differences in dominant ammonia-oxidising sequences were observed at this location. One sequence belonging to cluster 3 of the Nitrosospira lineage appeared to be dominant among the sequences belonging to the ammonia-oxidising species of the ß-Proteobacteria in all vegetation zones. Nitrification was apparently inhibited by the vegetation, whereas no shift in nitrifier populations could be shown.

40|$|The grasslands on slopes in Southern Limburg {{belong to}} the most species-rich grasslands in the Netherlands and are {{included}} in EU Habitat Directive as protected habitat types. They are located on slopes with a clear gradient in soil material with gravel deposits from the river Maas {{on top of the}} calcareous bedrock (especially {{in the western part of}} Limburg). In the 20 th century, the number and area of these grasslands decreased due to changing land use and the small, remaining reserves became fragmented, isolated, and lost characteristic species. Around 1980 restoration management started. In the first years, restoration seemed successful, but on the long-term however, the floristical quality and species-richness have declined even further. Further insight into the causes of this decline and opportunities for restoration were the main aims of a O+BN research project and the current thesis is derived from this research. Analyses of the long-term vegetation development in calcareous grassland (Chapter 2) showed that distinct calcareous grassland species declined and more common grassland species increased. Generally, the vegetation has developed towards more nutrient-rich circumstances. Eutrophication is one of the main factors hampering restoration and nitrogen is one of the most important limiting nutrients for terrestrial plant growth, especially under nutrient-poor circumstances. Experimental studies confirmed repressed potential nitrification activity in the <b>matgrass</b> sward vegetation, compared to the two adjacent vegetation zones (Chapter 3) and a four-month growth experiment revealed a negative effect of characteristic <b>matgrass</b> sward species on potential nitrification activity (Chapter 4). High ammonium concentrations and high ammonium:nitrate ratio are known to have toxic effects on the characteristic plant species, and therefore this can have contributed to the decline of this species-rich grassland vegetation. Restoration management for the accelerated re-creation of species-rich grasslands was studied on agricultural grasslands with a history of intensive use in an experimental design (Chapter 6) and on grasslands that have been abandoned for a long time (Chapter 7). The combination of sod cutting with hay transfer (the transfer of freshly mown material from a nearby well-developed grassland) was the most successful measure. In calcareous grasslands that had been fertilized in the past, the development on the longer term (25 years after the fertilisation has stopped) showed that the effects of nitrogen application have disappeared after 10 years, whereas the effects of phosphate application are still visible (Chapter 5). The results of this thesis and additional results of the O+BN research show that two approaches are needed to ensure optimal conservation and restoration. Firstly, the management in the reserves should be optimalized to ensure more nutrient removal. Secondly, the dispersal opportunities for species should be increased by enlarging and connecting the remaining grasslands, therefore reducing fragmentation and isolation. On the short term, sod-cutting in combination with the transfer of mown material seems to be a useful first step towards restoration on former agriculturally used grasslands. Additional research on the found repressed nitrification should reveal if this effect has a negative effect on the biodiversity in these grasslands and how this can be counterbalance...|$|E
40|$|A {{higher risk}} of future range losses {{as a result of}} climate change is {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} main drivers of extinction trends in vascular plants occurring in habitat types of high conservation value. Nevertheless, the impact of the climate changes of the last 60 years on the current distribution and extinction patterns of plants is still largely unclear. We applied species distribution models to study the impact of environmental variables (climate, soil conditions, land cover, topography), on the current distribution of 18 vascular plant species characteristic of three threatened habitat types in southern Germany: (i) xero-thermophilous vegetation, (ii) mesophilous mountain grasslands (mountain hay meadows and <b>matgrass</b> communities), and (iii) wetland habitats (bogs, fens, and wet meadows). Climate and soil variables were the most important variables affecting plant distributions at a spatial level of 10 × 10 km. Extinction trends in our study area revealed that plant species which occur in wetland habitats faced higher extinction risks than those in xero-thermophilous vegetation, with the risk for species in mesophilous mountain grasslands being intermediary. For three plant species characteristic either of mesophilous mountain grasslands or wetland habitats we showed exemplarily that extinctions from 1950 to the present day have occurred at the edge of the species’ current climatic niche, indicating that climate change has likely been the main driver of extinction. This is largely consistent with current extinction trends reported in other studies. Our study indicates that the analysis of past extinctions is an appropriate means to assess the impact of climate change on species and that vulnerability to climate change is both species- and habitat-specific...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the influence of}} invasion by an alien invasive species (Spartina alterniflora, smooth cordgrass) and a native aggressive species (Phragmites australis, common reed) as they have expanded into the native Cyperus malaccensis (shichito <b>matgrass)</b> -dominated wetland ecosystem in the Min River estuary of southeast China. S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study {{compared the}} above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C. malaccensis; (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, {{there was no significant}} difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C. malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C. malaccensis>S. alterniflora>P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0 – 50 cm) under S. alterniflora, P. australis and C. malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary...|$|E
