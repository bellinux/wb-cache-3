5|$|Under James the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots Protestants began, and the English {{colonisation}} of North America {{started its}} {{course with the}} foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, and Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland, in 1610.

5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E

5|$|In February 2002, Haze {{appeared}} in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. The company to her was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> business, but a family too.

Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women.
