5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and <b>most</b> <b>will</b> have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|Then a rule {{change is}} announced, {{allowing}} the tributes {{from the same}} district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses a seriously wounded Peeta, while continuing to act {{the part of a}} girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that what each contestant needs <b>most</b> <b>will</b> be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is pinned to the ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life.|$|E
5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. <b>Most</b> <b>will</b> travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E

25|$|Most {{carnivorous}} plants require bright light, and <b>most</b> <b>will</b> {{look better}} under such conditions, as this {{encourages them to}} synthesise red and purple anthocyanin pigments. Nepenthes and Pinguicula will do better out of full sun, but most other species are happy in direct sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Most genetic {{females with}} both {{forms of the}} {{deficiency}} will need replacement estrogen to induce puberty. <b>Most</b> <b>will</b> also need periodic progestin to regularize menses. Fertility is usually reduced because egg maturation and ovulation is poorly supported by the reduced intra-ovarian steroid production.|$|E

25|$|Although anti-Jo-1 {{antibodies}} {{are often}} included with ANAs, {{they are actually}} antibodies to the cytoplasmic protein, histidyl tRNA synthetase. They are highly associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and are rarely found in other connective tissue diseases. Around 20â€“40% of polymyositis is positive for Jo-1 antibodies and <b>most</b> <b>will</b> have interstitial lung disease, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DRw52 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers; collectively known as Jo-1 syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The above {{calculation}} is but an {{approximation of}} what happens when an alpha particle comes near a Thomson atom, {{but it is clear that}} the deflection at <b>most</b> <b>will</b> be in the order of a small fraction of a degree. If the alpha particle were to pass through a gold foil some 400 atoms thick and experience maximal deflection in the same direction (unlikely), it would still be a small deflection.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the number}} of {{proficient}} speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken on the street (or, for that matter, in a home), {{and is likely to}} only find the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, <b>most</b> <b>will</b> have French equivalents more prominently displayed), to remind them of the traditional language of the area.|$|E
25|$|Llamas, {{which are}} well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning, are very {{friendly}} and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and <b>most</b> <b>will</b> approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become {{extremely difficult to}} handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.|$|E
25|$|A key {{tenet of}} NKS {{is that the}} simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur {{in a wide variety}} of more {{complicated}} contexts. Therefore, NKS argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, <b>most</b> <b>will</b> be essentially meaningless. NKS has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.|$|E

25|$|The average {{human body}} with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. If the air is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, <b>most</b> <b>will</b> float in seawater. The amount of weight {{required}} to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though {{there are some people}} who require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with a large proportion of body fat. As the diver is nearly neutral, most ballasting is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver's equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{expectations}} were high that Waterford would retain their Munster title and {{challenge for the}} All-Ireland once again. After a disappointing National League campaign and a nine-point loss to Clare {{in the first round}} of the championship a players meeting was held where it was indicated that some of the team no longer wanted McCarthy in charge. From that another meeting with the County Board was held where McCarthy resigned as manager. McCarthy had a successful reign over Waterford and <b>most</b> <b>will</b> remember all the great games that he was involved in but will also remember the fact that Waterford never reached an All-Ireland final under him.|$|E
25|$|Haymitch persuades Crane {{to change}} the rules to allow two winners {{provided}} they are from the same district in an attempt to save both Katniss and Peeta, suggesting that this will quiet the unrest. Katniss searches for Peeta after the announcement, finding him gravely wounded. Another announcement tells the remaining tributes that what each survivor needs the <b>most</b> <b>will</b> be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's strong opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him. At the Cornucopia, she is ambushed by Clove. Thresh, District 11's male tribute, kills Clove, then spares Katniss for helping Rue. Katniss returns with the medicine to Peeta, after which he is healed.|$|E
40|$|Residents both {{enjoy the}} {{policies}} adopted in their cities, and choose those policies. If {{some people can}} better evaluate policies than can others, then the <b>most</b> perceptive people <b>will</b> be the <b>most</b> <b>willing</b> {{to move to the}} city with better policies, thereby making that city more likely to adopt good policies in the future. Such migration can cause agglomeration, with some cities prospering and others failing. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{inclusions}} seen in moissanite {{are also}} characteristic: <b>most</b> <b>will</b> have fine, white, subparallel growth tubes or needles oriented {{perpendicular to the}} stone's table. It is conceivable that these growth tubes could be mistaken for laser drill holes that are sometimes seen in diamond (see diamond enhancement), but the tubes will be noticeably doubled in moissanite due to its birefringence. Like synthetic rutile, current moissanite production is also plagued by an as yet inescapable tint, which is usually a brownish green. A limited range of fancy colors have been produced as well, the two most common being blue and green. Jewel-quality moissanite is produced by only one company, Charles & Colvard. Its limited availability makes moissanite about 120 times more expensive than cubic zirconia.|$|E
25|$|The Necrons are unique, {{as they do}} {{not require}} {{requisition}} to build their army. All units are {{in and of themselves}} free of requisition point cost. Power is the only resource Necrons need, in order to perform research, construct buildings and to construct and reinforce squads. However, capturing Strategic Points and building Obelisks (the Necrons listening post) on them will increase the speed of research and building, and will also expand the population cap. The Necron Monolith, their home base, is restored as more buildings are built, while also unlocking new units, and functions as the only vehicle- and troop-producing building. When fully restored it becomes mobile (albeit very slow, though it can teleport) and is armed with powerful weaponry. Many Necron units have the ability to resurrect, and <b>most</b> <b>will</b> leave persistent corpses on the battlefield that may either self-resurrect after they die or be restored by specialized Necron units (this resurrection can actually allow the Necrons to go over their population cap).|$|E
25|$|The Sow of Atholl {{is not a}} hill rich in {{geographical}} highlights, its {{steep slopes}} are covered in heather interspersed with grass and the occasional boulder. Its one noteworthy feature is the steep valley {{to the west of}} the hill which prevents a straightforward walk to the adjoining Munro of Sgairneach MhÃ²r which lies three km to the SW. The nameless steep glen has been cited as a fine example of a Parabolic glacial valley. It drops 200 metres from the summit plateau of the Sow in a short distance and although the slopes are not unmanageable for a walker, <b>most</b> <b>will</b> contour round the head of the valley when traversing between The Sow and Sgairneach MhÃ²r rather than take a direct route. The presence of this steep valley gives The Sow its required prominence to give it the status of a separate mountain. All rainfall on the hill goes south to join the drainage basin of the River Tay and reaches the east coast of Scotland at the Firth of Tay.|$|E
50|$|A will {{may also}} be revoked by the {{execution}} of a new <b>will.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>wills</b> contain stock language that expressly revokes any wills that came before them, however, because normally a court will still attempt to read the wills together {{to the extent they}} are consistent.|$|R
