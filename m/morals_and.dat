5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human <b>morals</b> <b>and</b> civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote {{a defense}} of his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his <b>morals</b> <b>and</b> political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E

40|$|Critics of realist and {{rational}} choice approaches to international law {{argue that if}} nations were motivated entirely by power or self-interest, their leaders would not make <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> legal arguments because no one would believe them.

This paper argues that even if nations are not motivated by a desire to comply with morality or law, the use of <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> legal arguments could occur in equilibrium. Signaling and cheap talk models show that nations may engage in talk in order (1) to deflect suspicion that they have unstable political systems or adversarial interests, and (2) to coordinate when gains from coordination are available. International talk is often <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> legal because the obligational vocabulary of <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> legal dispute between individuals is also useful for purely amoral strategic interactions when cooperation and coordination are involved.

Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E

In London, she is pursued by three suitors, Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Orme. This courtship is followed by more suitors: Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland Meredith and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. The final one, Pollexfen, pursues Byron vigorously, which causes her to criticise him over a lack of <b>morals</b> <b>and</b> decency of character. However, Pollexfen does not end his pursuits of Byron until she explains that she could never receive his visits again.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public <b>morals</b> <b>and</b> scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of <b>morals</b> <b>and</b> values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

On this occasion he was unable to secure his reinstatement, but in 1218 or 1219 he was restored to Penwortham through the influence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio. Norries died on 16 July or 19 July, but there is disagreement over the year of his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that he died in 1223, but the editors of Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, 940–1216 state he died in either 1224 or 1225.

40|$|Children's {{emerging}} morality {{involves the}} development of <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition. Developmental research suggests that emotions {{play an important role}} in dealing with <b>moral</b> conflict situations, <b>and</b> they help children differentiate moral concepts from other social judgments. However, emotions and their role in <b>moral</b> cognition <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> behavior have yet to be addresses systematically in empirical research. In this volume, the authors show how integrative developmental research on children's <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition can help us understand how children's morality evolves. As both <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition are related to children's moral, prosocial behavior, as well as to their immoral, aggressive behavior, studying how <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition interact is not only of conceptual significance to developmental researchers, but also of practical importance to educators. A central premise of the volume is that moral emotions interact with moral cognition in different ways across development. An integrative developmental perspective on <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition thus offers an important conceptual framework for understanding children's emerging morality and designing developmentally sensitive moral intervention strategies. The authors summarize the empirical literature linking moral emotions to <b>moral</b> cognition <b>and</b> discuss promising conceptual avenues and methodological approaches to study children's <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition. They also provide examples illustrating how the principles of integrative moral education can be applied in educational practice...|$|R
5|$|The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009) is {{therefore}} interesting {{for purposes of}} comparison. The claimant, an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres. The local authority refused the request, relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains other than in a crematorium. The claimant then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as {{it was necessary for}} the protection of public <b>morals</b> <b>and</b> of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|The devotee Pundalik, thrower of {{the brick}} (see Legend below), {{is a major}} {{character}} in the legends of Vithoba. He is commonly perceived to be a historical figure, connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba-centric Varkari sect. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be {{the founder of the}} Varkari sect and the one who promulgated the sect in Maratha country. Stevenson (1843) goes further, suggesting he might have been a Jain or a Buddhist, since Varkari tradition is a combination of Jain and Buddhist <b>morals,</b> <b>and</b> Vithoba is viewed as Vishnu in his form as Buddha. Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu, and that this sect originated in Karnataka. Ranade (1933) thinks that Pundalik, a Kannada saint, was not only the founder of the Varkari sect but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple. Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory. According to M. S. Mate, Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu, placing him in the early 12thcentury. Other scholars like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether, and dismissed him as a mythical figure.|$|E

For this purpose, the Japanese educational history and cultural aspects of <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social development were studied. In addition, one particular elementary school was observed and seven teachers were interviewed. In a typical elementary school, <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social development promote respect for society and the established order; diligence; self-criticism; and valuing group goals above individual interests. In this research, the time allocation <b>and</b> contents for <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social development were studied as to how these are actually integrated into the school curriculum. The interviewed teachers were two each in the first, fourth, and sixth grades and one administrator. A questionnaire was designed to analyze eight variables: 1. Teacher characteristics 2. Activities designed to enhance academic achievement 3. Activities designed to enhance <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social development 4. Grade integrated activities 5.
