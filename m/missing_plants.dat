The harvested biomass was weighed for fresh biomass weight after which the ears and the stubble were separated and weighed. The ears were shelled and grain yield was determined by adjusting to 12.5  % moisture content. Stubble of two stands from each plot was collected from each plot at harvest. The stubble samples were oven dried until constant weight was attained so {{that it was possible to}} calculate the dry stubble yield per plot. The dried biomass yield was determined as the sum of dry grain and dry stubble yields.|$|E
40|$|Growth {{inhibition}} due to continuous cropping of asparagus {{is a major}} problem; {{the yield}} of asparagus in replanted fields is low compared to that in new fields, and <b>missing</b> <b>plants</b> occur among young seedlings. Although soil-borne disease and allelochemicals {{are considered to be}} involved in this effect, this is still controversial. We aimed to develop a technique for the biological field diagnosis of growth inhibition due to continuous cropping. Therefore, in this study, fungal community structure and Fusarium community structure in continuously cropped fields of asparagus were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction/denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Soil samples were collected from the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Soil samples were taken from both continuously cropped fields of asparagus with growth inhibition and healthy neighboring fields of asparagus. The soil samples were collected from the fields of 5 sets in 2008 and 4 sets in 2009. We were able to distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic Fusarium by using Alfie 1 and Alfie 2 GC as the second PCR primers and PCR-DGGE. Fungal community structure was not greatly involved in the growth inhibition of asparagus due to continuous cropping. By contrast, the band ratios of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi in growth-inhibited fields were higher than those in neighboring healthy fields. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the band ratios of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and the ratios of missing asparagus plants. We showed the potential of biological field diagnosis of growt...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{pathology}} is {{an important}} area of research for maintaining food security and ecosystem services. Many model systems {{have been developed to}} study plant diseases in a more practical environment such as in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, among the ten most important pathogens for research or economy, dimorphic plantassociated yeasts and pathogens of trees are <b>missing.</b> <b>Plants</b> are constantly challenged with a huge number of potential pathogens but the development of disease remains the exception. This complete resistance against a pathogen is termed non-host resistance. Some yeasts are capable to induce resistance in plants against other pathogens. This has potential for biological control measures. Our aim was to develop a model system for studying non-host and induced resistance with the dimorphic birch pathogen Taphrina betulina in Arabidopsis. We studied the mechanistic details conferring non-host resistance to T. betulina by challenging stress signalling mutants with the pathogen and observing symptom development, root growth, fungal establishment in planta and phototoxic stress. The results suggest that type I non-host resistance protects Arabidopsis against Taphrina. This is dependent on the EIN 2 protein and mediated through an antagonism between the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid defence signalling pathways. Pre-inoculation with Taphrina betulina surprisingly increased growth of Pseudomonas syringae. We suggest that {{this is due to the}} activation of jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling which antagonise the salicylic acid defences required for Pseudomonas resistance. In this study, we showed that Arabidopsis is a non-host for Taphrina betulina and that this pathosystem can be used as a model for studying the mechanisms of nonhost resistance. These insights can give information about possible properties leading to susceptibility in the host. There is a large scope of opportunities for further study into this model...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to study by observation and simulation the effects of (1) three different dates of seedling emergence and (2) presence of short sequences of <b>missing</b> <b>plants</b> in rows of maize canopies which we refer to as skips. Trials were carried out in Belgium and France during two consecutive years. We had eight trials in total (i. e. two experimental designs in two locations for 2 years). In a field mechanically sown with a precision drill to give 'normal plants', 'late 1 plants' and 'late 2 plants' (respectively) were sown by hand when 'normal plants' had germinated or emerged. The radiation available {{at the top of}} the plants was measured for each cohort which allowed the calculation of a 'coefficient of correction for light climate' corresponding to the ratio of incident light at the top of each cohort relative to normal. Heterogeneity (skips) was created in maize canopies by removing three adjacent plants situated in the same row at 16 different locations across the field. The part of the canopy affected by the presence of these skips was considered to consist of the 12 plants bordering each skip. Radiation was measured near soil level on both sides of these plants: plants of the part of the canopy affected by skips received on average the same amount of radiation as a uniform stand with a population density equal to three quarters of the density of the parts of the stand without skips. To test if differences in radiation reaching the level of plants in each cohort could explain the effects on the plants the behaviour of each cohort of plants in each location x year was modelled separately with CERES-Maize after introducing into the model a 'coefficient of correction for light climate' corresponding to each cohort x location x year combination. Simulations generally reproduced correctly decreases in LAI, total biomass, grain number and total grain yield in the late I and late 2 cohorts, but not decrease in individual grain weight. The observed loss of grain yield per unit surface area in the parts of the canopy disturbed by skips was between 7 and 15 %, whereas corresponding simulated values were between 6 and 11 %. In the absence of compensation, values in the disturbed parts would have been 20 %. Thus in our conditions amount of light reaching the different cohorts explained a large part of the treatments effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|As progênies de cafeeiros murta são constituídas de plantas bourbon (ttNaNa), murta (ttNana) e anãs (ttnana), na proporção de 1 : 2 : 1. A fim de comparar as produções de cafeeiros bourbon e murta, progênies de 14 plantas matrizes murta foram estudadas em Campinas, cada progênie sendo inicialmente constituída de 10 plantas murta e 10 plantas bourbon. Em Pindorama estudaram-se apenas cinco progênies, constituída cada uma delas de cinco plantas murta e cinco bourbon. Tôdas foram plantadas a um pé por cova, para estudo das produções individuais. As plantas anãs não foram levadas para o campo por serem de desenvolvimento excessivamente lento e apresentarem produção pràticamente nula. Algumas delas foram conservadas em viveiro a fim de se observar seu desenvolvimento e frutificação. Verificou-se maior número de falhas entre as plantas murta do que entre as bourbon, {{principal}}mente em Campinas, indicando que os cafeeiros murta são mais fracos do que os cafeeiros bourbon. Em Pindorama esta diferença foi menos acentuada. A produção total média no período 1939 - 1952 em Campinas e em Pindorama foi analisada, confirmando-se os resultados já anteriormente obtidos, em Campinas, de que a produção do conjunto de plantas bourbon é bem maior do que a das plantas murta. A parte bourbon produziu cêrca de 70 % a mais em Campinas e 100 % a mais em Pindorama, do que a parte murta. O alelo na, além de influir sobre alguns caracteres morfológicos, deve ser o principal responsável pela drástica redução da produtividade das plantas murta. Os efeitos do alelo na não se fazem sentir no tamanho e peso dos frutos e sementes. É mais provável que a ação dêste alelo se relacione com a redução do número total {{de flores}} nas plantas murta ou no pegamento destas flôres, resultando em um menor número de frutos, em relação às plantas bourbon. The murta variety of Coffea arabica is a heterozygous ttNana, its progeny segregating bourbon (ttNaNa), murta (ttNana) and nana (ttnana) in the approximate ratio of 1 : 2 : 1. In order {{to observe the}} effects of the na allele on yield several selfed progenies from murta individuals were studied simultaneously at the experiment stations of Campinas and Pindorama. In the first of these locations 14 progeny rows of 20 plants each were planted, each progeny having initially 10 bourbon and 10 murta plants. At Pindorama only five progeny rows were planted, each of which had an initial number of five plants of each type, giving a total of 50 individuals. Dwarf (nana) plants were not transplanted to the field due to their growth habit and to their very low yield. A few dwarf plants, however, were kept in a lath-house so that their development could be followed. A few years after planting the progenies in the field it was noticed that a proportionally higher number of murta plants died from the eifects of die-back. The final percentages of misses among the murta individuals were 34 per cent at Campinas and 21 per cent at Pindorama. <b>Missing</b> <b>plants</b> among the bourbon individuals of the progenies at Campinas were much less frequent, that is, only three per cent, contrasting with 19 per cent at Pindorama. It was also observed that death of murta plants occurred more frequently in certain progenies in both locations. The average yield for the period 1939 / 52 was studied for the progenies at Campinas and at Pindorama. It was observed that the average yield of the bourbon plants in every progeny was much higher than the yield of the corresponding murta group. The average yield of all bourbon groups exceeded murta by 70 per cent at Campinas and by 100 per cent at Pindorama. These results are in agreement with the conclusions of a previous study based on the first eight consecutive yields. It seems that such a large difference in yielding ability of these two genotypes can be ascribed mainly to {{the effects of the}} na allele, which also has a marked pleiotropic effect on vegetative characteristics, particularly when in a homozygous condition. In the heterozygous condition the na allele does net affect the size of flowers, fruits and seeds, while in homozygous individuals the flowers are slightly smaller, although the size of fruits and seeds {{are similar to those of}} bourbon. Several instances of somatic mutations have been found in ttnana plants giving origin to phenotypically murta (ttlNana) branches. When these mutated branches are allowed to remain they tend to overgrow the nana parts and to yield regularly, while the nana parts rarely produce flowers and fruits. This seems to corroborate the conclusion that the na allele has a major effect in reducing the yield of murta plants. Since this gene has no visible effect on fruit and seed size, it may be assumed that the lower yield of murta plants is due to a reduction in flower number and/or to a smaller fruit setting...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} causing {{droughts}} affecting crop production {{on a global}} scale. Classical breeding and selection strategies for drought tolerant cultivars will help prevent crop losses. Plant breeders, for all crops, need a simple and reliable method to identify drought-tolerant cultivars, but such a method is <b>missing.</b> <b>Plant</b> metabolism is often disrupted by abiotic stress conditions. To survive drought, plants reconfigure their metabolic pathways. Studies have documented the importance of metabolic regulation, i. e. osmolyte accumulation such as polyols and sugars (mannitol, sorbitol); amino acids (proline) during drought. This study identified and quantified metabolites in drought tolerant and drought susceptible Camellia sinensis cultivars under wet and drought stress conditions. For analyses, GC-MS and LC-MS were employed for metabolomics analysis. %RWC results show how the two drought tolerant and two drought susceptible cultivars differed significantly (p ? 0. 05) from one another; the drought susceptible exhibited rapid water loss compared to the drought tolerant. There was a significant variation (p < 0. 05) in metabolite content (amino acid, sugars) between drought tolerant and drought susceptible tea cultivars after short-time withering conditions. These metabolite changes {{were similar to those}} seen in other plant species under drought conditions, thus validating this method. The Short-time Withering Assessment of Probability for Drought Tolerance (SWAPDT) method presented here provides an easy method to identify drought tolerant tea cultivars that will mitigate the effects of drought due to climate change on crop losses.

40|$|Abstract After {{deregulation}} of the agricultural markets in South Africa in 1997, the estimated maize crop {{could no longer be}} verified against the actual crop, {{due to the lack of}} control data from the Maize Control Board. This drove the need to explore remotely sensed data as a supplement to the current crop estimation methodology to improve crop estimations. Input data for the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) -based model consisted of objective yield point data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images and rainfall grids. Rainfall grids were interpolated from weather station data. NDVI values were obtained from the MODIS sensor aboard the Terra platform. Objective yield point field survey data for the 2001 / 2002 growing season were utilised since dry-land or irrigated conditions were recorded for that season. MODIS NDVI values corresponded well with the growing stages and age of the maize plants after being adjusted to reflect the crop’s age rather than the Julian date. Rainfall values were extracted from rainfall grids and also aligned with the age of the maize plants. This is a suggested alternative to the traditional method of using the mean NDVI for several districts in a region over a Julian growing period of 11 months according to Julian dates. South African maize production areas extend over seven (7) provinces with eight (8) different temperature and rainfall zones (du Plessis, 2004). Planting-date zones based on the uniform age of the maize plants were developed from objective yield Global Positioning System (GPS) points for the 2001 / 2002 growing season and compared with the 2004 / 2005 growing season (Frost and Kneen, 2006). Planting dates were interpolated from these planting zones for objective yield GPS points which were <b>missing</b> <b>planting</b> dates in the survey database. MODIS imagery is affordable (free) and four (4) images cover the whole of South Africa daily, while one (1) image covers the study area daily. Several recommendations, such as establishing yield equations for a normal, dry, and wet season were made.

ROS production in adjacent cells is triggered by extracellular ROS signals produced by guard cell membrane-associated NADPH oxidases encoded by the AtrbohD and AtrbohF genes. The late, tissue damage–associated component of the oxidative burst requires only the Gα protein and arises from multiple cellular sources. The early component of the oxidative burst, arising primarily from chloroplasts, requires signaling through the heterotrimer (or the Gβγ complex) and is separable from Gα-mediated activation of membrane-bound NADPH oxidases necessary for both intercellular signaling and cell death...|$|R

Kermit gets so mad that he fires Miss Piggy and asks special guest, Loretta Swit, to take her place. Swit appears in "Vet's Hospital" and "Pigs in Space", where she is a great success. Miss Piggy tries to make a dramatic exit, but gets so jealous of Swit that she invades the Swinetrek herself. Highlights include: Gonzo appears as a farmer in "There Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens"; Swit sings "I Feel the Earth Move"; and Miss Piggy sings a tearful "Some of These Days" as she packs up her dressing room...|$|R
