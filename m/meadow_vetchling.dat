40|$|This bachelor´s work {{is focused}} on the {{climbing}} legumes. Literature review summarizes the importance and ecological requirements of species of <b>meadow</b> <b>vetchling</b> (Lathyrus pratensis) and tufted vetch (Vicia cracca) and describes vegetation types with the occurrence of climbing legumes. Legumes are excellent forage, but they also contain some antinutritional substances and are often attacked by pests and diseases. Production of seed is difficult because of uneven ripening, dehiscent pods, seed dormancy and hard seeds. In the practical part were at selected localities conducted botanical images. These localities were compared with each other in terms of vegetation composition. On the localities were collected pods of monitored species. Seeds were after shelling used to determine seedling and germination...|$|E

The literature search defines watched kinds of legumes and their occurence in permanent grassland. There is summarized seed growing of legumes because of its problematic production. Legumes are valuable components of grassland especially thanks to fixation of nitrogen and high capacity of proteins. The practical part is focused on observation of floristic compilation of watched locations for three years. Particular locations were compared {{from the point of}} view of changes in land management and weather. Pods and seeds of observed kinds were collected and evaluated in single years. Experiments of seed's field germination were done after different period from picking and in case of various treatment...|$|E
