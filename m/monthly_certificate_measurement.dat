40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} uses {{a variety}} of information for which access needs to be controlled. For instance, a person's current location is a sensitive piece of information, which only authorized entities {{should be able to}} learn. Several challenges arise in the specification and implementation of policies controlling access to location information. For example, there can be multiple sources of location information, the sources can be within different administrative domains, different administrative domains might allow different entities to specify policies, and policies need to be flexible. We address these issues in our design of an access control mechanism for a people location system. Our design encodes policies as digital certificates. We present an example implementation based on SPKI/SDSI <b>certificates.</b> Using <b>measurements,</b> we quantify the influence of access control on query processing time. We also discuss trade-offs between RSA-based and DSA-based signature schemes for digital certificates...|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Rebel Industries' Spindrift One Designs began {{production}} {{using the}} Mariner molds. They started with Hull No. 4000. Spindrift {{made a small}} quantity of boats, and precipitated the one big scandal of the Mariner saga. The President of Spindrift, John Barnett, brought a new factory built boat No. 4037 to race in the 1981 Mariner Nationals. He won handily, but the boat was reputed to be about 40% lighter than boats built by O'Day. After much soul searching, the Class officers retroactively revoked the <b>measurement</b> <b>certificate</b> and rescored the Nationals results.|$|R
50|$|The 'Central Rating Office' {{establishes}} delegated Rating Office in {{each country}} with active offshore racing. Rating offices issue ORC International and ORC Club certificates, and administer their national fleets by supervising the measurement and rating of the yachts. For countries, where a national Rating Office is not established, the central ORC Rating office may provide support in issuing <b>certificates</b> and supervising <b>measurement.</b> A 'Chief Measurer' chairs the Measurement Committee. Chief Measurer since 1996 is Nicola Sironi and is only the fourth person to hold the post since 1969. National Chief Measurers are established in each national Rating Office.|$|R

The official boat specifications were established in 1956. Members of the class association had to pay dues, which covered various administrative and legal costs (such as registering the Jet-14 trademark in 1957), and official <b>measurement</b> <b>certificates</b> were drawn up and distributed. A constitution and by-laws were established for the Class as well. The first Class newsletter, [...] "Jet Blasts," [...] was published and a regatta schedule was created.|$|R

Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Café (1994), the Napa Valley winery (1995), the Balboa Café Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Café at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom's annual income was greater than $429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than $6.9 million. Newsom gave a <b>monthly</b> $50 gift <b>certificate</b> to PlumpJack Café employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, [...] "There can be no success without failure." ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAimTo {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of MOSFET (Metal – Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) detectors {{for the purpose of}} electron beam dose determination in in vivo radiotherapy. Materials/MethodsIndications of MOSFET detectors were recorded from phantom measurements, including: dose values of electron beams, the environmental temperature of the detectors, the incidence direction of an electron beam on the detector, the size of the irradiated field. The change in sensitivity of the detectors when under the effects of accumulated doses was also tested. Because of the very small dimensions of the detectors, they were placed in specially designed aluminium capsules – to ensure electron equilibrium (δ electrons) during the dose measurement. The detector indications were compared to those seen in a Markus type ionization chamber with a calibration <b>certificate.</b> The <b>measurements</b> were made for electron beams with energies of 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 MeV. ResultsThe following were established experimentally: There is a linear relationship between detector indications and the dose value. A drop in detector sensitivity is associated with increased environmental temperature (as much as 6 % as temperatures rise from 22 °C to 42 °C). There is a non-linear drop in detector sensitivity with accumulated dose. Detector indications are not affected by changes in incident beam angles within the range of – 70 ° to + 70 °. The dependency of detector indications {{on the size of the}} irradiated field conform with those recorded in the ionization chamber, with variations of up to 1. 5 %. The dependencies and correction coefficients determined in this study allow measurement of electron beam doses with an accuracy of 2. 2 %. ConclusionsMOSFET detectors are a useful tool for verification of the entrance doses in electron beam radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{imposition}} of practice, the current world, the laboratory measurement, calibration should {{be approved by}} points of credit to national or international and should be compatible with the requirements specification (ISO 17025) for the adoption of efficient laboratories. Those requirements were included the testing process or scale limits to doubt that mentioned in the <b>measurement</b> <b>certificate,</b> which recognizes the customer to achieve quality and efficiency {{in the process of}} measurement. In this study we would theoretically try to clarify, indicate what the uncertainty in the measurement, standard types of uncertainty and how to calculate the budget of uncertainty as we should show some examples of how the scientific calculation of the budget challenge with some measure the lengths of the laboratory. After analyzing the results we had found during the measurement using CMM, we had found that the value of non-statistical uncertainty in the measurement type (b) piece length of one meter was ± 1. 9257 µm. and when using the configuration measuring device, we had gotten the value of the extended standard combined uncertainty ± 2. 030 µm when measured the screws value of 1. 2707 mm. When used the configuration measuring device, we had gotten the value of the extended standard combined uncertainty ± 2. 030 µm when measuring the screws value of 1. 2707 mm.

40|$|This paper {{talks about}} THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF SLEMAN DISTRICT LAND OFFICE IN LAND REGISTRATION (OWNERSHIP) DATA MAINTAINANCE BASED ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION NUMBER 24 OF 1997 LAND ADMINISTRATION FOR ADMINISTRATION REGISTRY. The {{regulation}} sets {{that the land}} office as the executive agency for Land Registration in districts/cities. The objective is to control any Land Registration along with its data maintenance activities to match to the physical and juridical data of the map, land, and name list, <b>measurement</b> <b>certificate,</b> land book, and related certificates with the changes that occur afterward. The changes are {{in the form of}} the subject of transitional law, in a sense of the Properties on land transfer (buying and selling). Duties and functions of the land office is set up in the legislation, but in practice, the rules have been applied inappropiately and work silos from the orderly administration. Hence, the questions are: 1. How is the implementation of the duties and functions of Sleman District Land Office in the Land Registration data maintenance and the transfer of Properties on sale over land in 2013 with the enactment of Government Regulation No. 24 of 1997 on Land Registration Rules in conjunction with the State Minister of Agrarian/Head of National State Land No. 3, 1997 ? 2. Does the implementation enact the Land Administration Registry orderly? The research applied is empirical legal research, which is a legal research starts on the view that based on the facts at the sites. The result of the study is that the Sleman District Land Office institutionalized the administration of land orderly. The advice goes to the applicants of ownership registration of land transfer to meet all the requirements documents before coming and asking to the Sleman District Land Titles Registrare (PPAT) to make the deed, so that the better coordination is maintained under the framework between PPAT to achieve the orderly Land Administration Registry...|$|R
