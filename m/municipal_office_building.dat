Once a home of Waldorf and Nancy Astor, it was given by Lady Astor to the City of Plymouth as an {{official residence}} for future Lord Mayors and is also used today for civic hospitality, as lodgings for visiting dignitaries and High Court judges {{and it is also}} available to hire for private events. The Civic Centre <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> <b>building</b> in Armada Way became a listed building in June 2007 because of its quality and period features, but has become the centre of a controversy as the council planned for its demolition estimating that it could cost £40m to refurbish it, resulting in possible job losses.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{plans for}} a {{consolidated}} <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> <b>building</b> were approved by the city council in February 1963, with the $320,000 cost being funded with regular tax income, rather than a bond measure as previously attempted. The new civic center would be located {{on the south side}} of Main Street between Interstate 405 and 116th Avenue. The three-story building, which would serve as Bellevue's city hall, was dedicated on March 7, 1964, by Governor Albert D. Rosellini. A public library was opened adjacent to the municipal building in 1967, as part of the development of the [...] civic center campus.|$|E

By the time that the theater and its surrounding block (Holliday to Fayette to North Gay to East Lexington Streets) was torn down in 1917, based on the 1910 plans of Frederick Law Olmsted, to make room for the newly laid-out War Memorial Plaza and Building, as a major rearrangement of a proposed new [...] "civic center" [...] of flanking <b>municipal</b> <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> and structures providing additional space to be used in future decades, covering up the then unsightly canalized stream of Jones Falls to the east with its periodic flooding problems, and to open up a vista of the elaborate east front of the Baltimore City Hall, an influence of the then-nationwide [...] "City Beautiful" [...] movement among architects and city planners then coming to rise.

500|$|... 1951 was the 50th {{anniversary of}} the fire department, and so the village held a week-long celebration {{beginning}} on July 1, 1950 with a morning service at the Briarcliff Congregational Church, a band concert at Law Park, and a Fourth of July parade with 5,500 spectators, with a march led by Fred Messinger, followed by eight ex-chiefs. The parade included Scarborough's first fire engine (the red hand-pumped 1901 truck), many bands, and twelve fire departments from Westchester County municipalities. The ex-chief's dinner that evening drew 85 guests. In that year, {{it was noted that}} there were not yet any resident deaths from fires within village boundaries. In the late 1950s, Edna O'Brien was the first; trapped in her house and surrounded by intense flames. In 1955, the department purchased a new pumper and a Mack hook-and-ladder truck with a 75ft. ladder for $40,000 ($ in [...] ). Also in the mid 1950s, a new firehouse was decidedly needed, and more urgently when the weight of the then-new pumper and ladder trucks ruptured the municipal building's floor. For five years, the equipment was housed in Briarcliff and Ossining garages until late 1963, when the new firehouse and <b>municipal</b> <b>offices</b> <b>building</b> was completed. Also in the 1950s, additional sirens were installed for firemen outside of the central siren's range, both on Schrade and at the intersection of Long Hill and Scarborough roads, replacing a siren at Scarborough Presbyterian. During the 1960s the old municipal building's cupola bell, which the department used as a fire bell and which had tolled {{at the end of the}} World Wars, was moved to the front of the new firehouse.|$|R
