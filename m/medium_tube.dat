40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} community health agents (CHAs) to instruct women living in poor rural areas in obtaining self-collected cervical samples and compare the high-risk HPV (hrHPV) hybrid capture (HC) results obtained to those for gynecologist-collected samples. Methods: After a one-day training, CHAs visited sexually active women, instructing each {{in the use of}} collection brush and the Universal Collection <b>Medium</b> <b>tube.</b> One week thereafter, a gynecologist collected cervical samples from, and performed colposcopies on, the same women. A single reference Lab performed all HCs. Results: 878 women (Age: 15 - 69 years) participated. Among self-collected samples, hrHPV prevalence was 33. 9 % (95 % CI: 30. 8 %- 37 %), compared with 28. 6 % (95 % CI: 27 %- 30 %) among gynecologist-collected samples. However, 9. 3 % of the patients were HPV HC II-positive in the seff-collected sample and HPV HC II-negative in the gynecologist-collected samples (95 % CI: 7. 38 %- 11. 22 %), whereas 4 % tested positive in gynecologist-collected samples and negative in self-collected samples (95 % CI: 2. 7 %- 5. 3 %) (P < 0. 01; kappa= 0. 7). of 9 cases of histologically-confirmed, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, self-collected and provider-collected samples missed one each. Conclusion: Self-collected vaginal. sampling could be made an additional CHA function under existing program conditions, improving access to cervical cancer screening in poor rural settings.

40|$|Background: The Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia {{are closely}} related groups of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNBs) having a similar {{spectrum}} of infections ranging from superficial to deep-seated and disseminated infections. Identification of these lysine decarboxylase-positive NFGNBs lags behind in most Indian laboratories. A simplified identification scheme was devised for these two pathogens that allowed us to isolate them with an increasing frequency at our tertiary care institute. Materials and Methods: A simple five-tube conventional biochemical identification of these bacteria has been standardized. In the beginning, some of the isolates were confirmed from the International B. cepacia Working group, Belgium. Molecular identification and typing using recA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was also standardized for BCC. For short-term preservation of BCC, an innovative method of preserving the bacteria in Robertson&#x 2032;s cooked <b>medium</b> <b>tubes</b> kept in a domestic refrigerator was developed. Results: Thirty-nine isolates of BCC isolates were obtained from various specimens (30 from blood cultures) and 22 S. maltophilia (13 blood cultures and 9 respiratory isolates) were isolated during the year 2007 alone. Conclusions: BCC and S. maltophilia can be identified with relative ease using a small battery of biochemical reactions. Use of simplified methods will allow greater recognition of their pathogenic potential and correct antimicrobials should be advised in other clinical laboratories and hospitals...|$|R

Identification of the isolate was done by standard biochemical tests and using the line probe assay from the GenoType® CM/AS kit (Hain Life Science GmbH, Nehren, Germany). The DNA extract was also analyzed using gene sequencing. Partial gene sequencing and analysis of 16 S rRNA gene, 16 S- 23 S rRNA (ITS), rpoB and hsp 65 and phylogenetic analyses by searching GenBank using the BLAST algorithm were conducted. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using four methods, namely Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. The isolate was identified as Mycobacterium intracellulare using the GenoType® CM/AS kit and as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) by gene sequencing. The gene sequence targeting all the genes, ITS, 16 S rRNA, rpoB and hsp 65 and phylogenetic analyses indicated that this isolate presented a nucleotide sequence different from all currently published sequences, and its position was far enough from other MAC species to suggest that it might be a new species.

25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level.

In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits.

Liquid media were inoculated with conidia and the cultures were grown in constant light for 33 or 48 hours, by which time floating mycelial pads had formed.

40|$|Research on {{the cell}} fate {{determination}} of embryonic stem cells is of enormous interest given the therapeutic potential in regenerative cell therapy. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) {{have the ability to}} renew themselves and differentiate into all three germ layers. The main focus {{of this study was to}} examine factors affecting derivation and further proliferation of multipotent neuroepithelial (NEP) cells from hESCs. hESCs cultured in serum-deprived defined <b>medium</b> developed distinct <b>tube</b> structures and could be isolated either by dissociation or adherently. Dissociated cells survived to form colonies of cells characterized as NEP when conditioned medium from human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2 cell line (MEDII) was added. However, cells isolated adherently developed an enriched population of NEP cell...|$|R
