5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national <b>minorities</b> to deteriorate. Unrest among national <b>minorities</b> was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national <b>minorities</b> were increasingly problematic.|$|E

5|$|Southern states {{generally}} {{sought to}} disenfranchise racial <b>minorities</b> {{during and after}} Reconstruction. From 1868 to 1888, electoral fraud and violence throughout the South suppressed the African-American vote. From 1888 to 1908, Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting Jim Crow laws; they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents, and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible). During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial <b>minorities.</b> In Giles v. Harris (1903), the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment, the judiciary {{did not have the}} remedial power to force states to register racial <b>minorities</b> to vote.|$|E
5|$|The county prefects {{and city}} and {{municipal}} mayors are elected to four-year terms by majority of votes cast within applicable local government units. A runoff election is held if no candidate achieves {{a majority in}} the first round of voting. Members of county, city, and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation; the entire local government unit forms a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national <b>minorities</b> are represented in the council as required by the constitution.

5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial <b>minorities</b> were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial <b>minorities,</b> remove registered racial <b>minorities</b> from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E

40|$|Past {{studies on}} {{discrimination}} in home mortgage lending {{have focused on}} the loan approval process, yet results show that most of the variation in <b>minority</b> lending across banks is due to the variation in the volume of <b>minority</b> applications and not the variation in the <b>minority</b> approval rate. This paper focuses instead on the application stage and the impact of branch locations on <b>minority</b> applications and lending. The presence of branches in <b>minority</b> areas significantly increases a bank 2 ̆ 7 s volume of <b>minority</b> applications and hence its <b>minority</b> lending; however, branch locations do not appear to affect the <b>minority</b> approval rate. These finding refute the argument that banks take in deposits but do not lend in <b>minority</b> areas, and the view that technological innovations such as telephone banking have made branches obsolete. They suggest that the current policy of emphasizing branches in <b>minority</b> areas may be effective in increasing <b>minority</b> lending at individual banks, but not necessarily the overall lending in a <b>minority</b> area...|$|R

5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized <b>minorities</b> in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak <b>minorities</b> jointly elect one MP, and all other <b>minorities</b> elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized <b>minorities</b> in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
