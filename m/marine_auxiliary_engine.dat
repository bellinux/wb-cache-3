40|$|Abstract: To {{those old}} ships, {{one of the}} {{frequent}} faults is that the exhaust temperature of marine diesel generator is too high. This fault may lead exhaust pipe to be burned red, outlet valve to be burned down, piston and piston ring to be melted, and many other troubles. In this paper, aiming at the reason of fault of NO. 1 <b>marine</b> <b>auxiliary</b> diesel <b>engine</b> exhaust pipe burned red while running without load, the author analyzes the every possible causes of the malfunction, finds out the real causation of high exhaust temperature is steady ball bearing of timing gear partial wears seriously.

40|$|The {{composition}} of exhaust from a <b>marine</b> diesel <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> running on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) was investigated on-board a large cargo vessel. Measurements of particle number and size distributions {{in the range}} 5 - 1000 nm and gaseous emissions of O 2, CO, CO 2, SO 2 and NOx were made. The measurements were performed in October and November 2015 on two large cargo ships at berth and during travel. Measurements were also carried out on <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> of two ships when they were at berth. Data on engine power, engine revolution, fuel oil consumption, intercooled air temperature, scavenging air pressure, cooling fresh water and exhaust gas temperature were measured using instrumentation of the ship. Results showed that emission factors (g/kWh) are {{higher than that of}} previous studies for SO 2. This {{may be due to the}} high sulphur content of fuel used. Particle number size distribution was observed to be the highest around 35 – 45 nm in diameter, and the particle number remarkably decreased during higher engine load conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an emission measurement campaign on commercial ships plying {{the east coast}} of Australia. Detailed investigation of engine performance and emissions from main and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>marine</b> diesel <b>engines</b> using heavy fuel were undertaken. Marine diesel engine gaseous (O 2, CO, CO 2, SO 2 and NOx) and particle number and mass emissions were measured using research grade instrumentation. The measurements were performed in October and November 2015 on two large cargo ships at berth, manoeuvring and during travel between the ports of Brisbane, Gladstone and Newcastle. Detailed measurements on an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> at berth are analysed in this paper, and include engine power and RPM, fuel oil consumption, exhaust gas temperature and exhaust particle and gaseous emissions. It was found that some ship emissions were up to several orders of magnitude higher than corresponding land-based diesel emission levels.

The test results obtained showed the general validity of the approach adopted, as significant abatement of emissions was achieved. However, under the conditions used, the system showed some limitations {{with regard to the}} sulphur content of the fuel.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an interval-valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy TOPSIS model, {{which is based}} on an {{improved}} score function for detecting failure in a <b>marine</b> diesel <b>engine</b> <b>auxiliary</b> system, using groups of experts’ opinions to detect the root cause of failure in the engine system and the area most affected by failures in the diesel engine. The improved score function has been used for the computation of the separation measures from the intuitionistic fuzzy positive ideal solution (IFPIS) and intuitionistic fuzzy negative ideal solution (IFNIS) of alternatives while the criteria weight have been determined using an intuitionistic fuzzy entropy. The study is aimed at providing an alternative method for the identification and analysis of failure modes in engine systems. The results from the study show that although detection of failures in Engines is quite difficult to identify due to the dependency of the engine systems on each other, however using intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method the faults/failure can easily be diagnosed...|$|R
40|$|Engine room {{monitoring}} {{control system}} is monitoring and controlling main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> from long distance by powerline communication network and wireless network {{to ease the}} operator in operating the ship and save operational cost. To prevent error in programming the main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> a simulation using instrument software is needed to know the machine characteristic. After simulation result fulfills the requirement which is approached the value of test record, it {{can be applied to}} the real machine. In this study, some steps were done such as: getting know type of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> which performance will be simulated and programmed, getting test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> getting know how the main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> work, making simulation of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> work system, doing monitoring control simulation by powerline communication and wireless network, comparing the results between simulation and test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> Engine programming can be set after simulation result meets the requirement. Result of simulation fulfills the requirement, the difference values between machine simulation using software instrument and test record of main <b>engine</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> are around 1 %- 2 %. If engine room monitoring control system by wireless and powerline communication is applied in the ship, the ship owner will get advantages because it will prolong ship durability and can monitor operasional of main <b>engine</b> or <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> from long distance; while the operator will be easier in operating the ship.

40|$|Today, {{failure modes}} {{characterization}} and early detection {{is a key}} issue in complex assets. This {{is due to the}} negative impact of corrective operations and the conservative strategies usually put in practice, focused on preventive maintenance. In this paper anomaly detection issue is addressed in new monitoring sensor data by characterizing and modeling operational behaviors. The learning framework is performed {{on the basis of a}} machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>marine</b> diesel <b>engine.</b> Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management.
