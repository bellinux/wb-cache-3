Several technological solutions have been employed to design tactile sensors; in particular, solutions based on microfabrication present several attractive features.

These fluorescence measurements offer significant advantages {{in terms of}} sensitivity and selectivity, finding wide use {{in a range of}} applications in bioanalytical, analytical chemistry and colour technology. Depending upon the specific <b>metrological</b> requirement, different <b>properties</b> of the photoluminescent material are of interest and different measurement techniques and instrumentation have been developed. The optical properties of interest for both analytical and colorimetric applications are defined along with their basic measurement principles.

These considerations and measurement problems are identified and the impacts of standardization methods are illustrated in two typical applications. The paper also gives a detailed description of both the physical transfer standard and chemical transfer standard approaches for obtaining reliable, traceable fluorescence data.

PARTICIPANTS: 212 patients with mild cognitive impairment were tested at baseline by a standardised neuropsychological battery, which included: the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test (FCSRT), the Benton Visual Retention test, the Deno 100, verbal fluency, a serial digit learning test, the double task of Baddeley, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) similarities, the Trail-Making Test and the WAIS digit symbol test. Patients were monitored every 6 months for up to 3 years {{in order to identify}} those who converted to AD (retrospectively classified as prodromal AD). Statistical analyses were performed using a nonlinear multivariate mixed model involving a latent process. This model assumes that the psychometric tests are nonlinear transformations of a common latent cognitive process, and it captures the <b>metrological</b> <b>properties</b> of tests. RESULTS: 57 patients converted to AD. The most sensitive tests in the detection of cognitive changes due to prodromal AD were the FCSRT, the semantic verbal fluency and the Deno 100. Some tests exhibited a higher sensitivity to cognitive changes for subjects with high levels of cognition, such as the free recall, delayed free recall scores of the FCSRT and the semantic verbal fluency, whereas others showed a higher sensitivity at low levels of cognition, such as the total recall score of the FCSRT.

Here, the formula used to account for sub-pixel displacements is first recalled, and an accurate model of the sensor noise is introduced. The hypotheses required for the elaboration of this prediction are clearly stated. The formula is then validated using experimental data. Since rigid body motion between the specimen and the camera impairs the experimental data, and since sensor noise is signal-dependent, particular tools need to be introduced in order to ensure the consistency between the observed image noise and the model on which prediction hypotheses are based.

40|$|Abstract: The growing {{interest}} {{in the development of}} smart textiles for medical applications is driven by the aim to increase the mobility of patients who need a continuous monitoring of such physiological parameters. At the same time, the use of fiber optic sensors (FOSs) is gaining large acceptance as an alternative to traditional electrical and mechanical sensors for the monitoring of thermal and mechanical parameters. The potential impact of FOSs is related to their good <b>metrological</b> <b>properties,</b> their small size and their flexibility, as well as to their immunity from electromagnetic field. Their main advantage is the possibility to use textile based on fiber optic in a magnetic resonance imaging environment, where standard electronic sensors cannot be employed. This last feature makes FOSs suitable for monitoring biological parameters (e. g., respiratory and heartbeat monitoring) during magnetic resonance procedures. Research interest in combining FOSs and textiles into a single structure to develop wearable sensors is rapidly growing.
