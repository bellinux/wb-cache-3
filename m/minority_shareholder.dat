40|$|Using a 2004 Chinese {{securities}} {{regulation that}} requires equity offering proposals {{to obtain the}} separate approval of voting <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders,</b> we examine whether giving <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> increased control over corporate decisions helps to reduce value-decreasing corporate decisions for firms domiciled in weak investor protection countries. We find that the regulation deters management from submitting value-decreasing equity offering proposals in firms with higher mutual fund ownership. There is also weak evidence that <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> {{are more likely to}} veto valuedecreasing equity offering proposals in firms with higher mutual fund ownership in the post-regulation period. Overall, our evidence suggests that in weak investor protection countries, the effect of granting <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> increased control over corporate decisions on the quality of corporate decisions depends on the composition of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{protection}} of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> {{is one of}} the important topics in company law. The two major oppression of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> are from the management and the majority shareholders. In this thesis, I seek to study the two oppression and the minority protection under the company law in Hong Kong and China. This thesis discusses: (i) Whether the Hong Kong common law system provides better protection to <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> than is found in the Chinese civil law system? (ii) Whether the high degree of concentrated corporate ownership leads to the poor {{protection of}} <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> in Hong Kong and China? (iii) What are the transplantation effects of foreign company laws on the protection of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> in Hong Kong and China? (iv) Whether the existing legal remedies to <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> in Hong Kong and China are adequate? and (v) What are the problems of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> protection in Hong Kong and China? A comparative study of corporate governance and the protection of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> in Hong Kong and China is to identify the similarities and differences in the two systems for the purposes of legal reform. This thesis argues that mere adoption of Hong Kong common law system according to the legal origin theory could not improve corporate governance and <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> protection in China; Chinese corporate governance and <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> protection reform must include both legislative and structural aspects and these aspects are shaped by the initial paths according to the path dependence theory. This thesis argues that the high concentration of corporate ownership does not necessarily lead to poor legal protection of shareholders in Hong Kong, and the weak protection of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> in China is not due to its civil law origin but its structures relating {{to the rule of law}} principle. This thesis examines the theoretical debates between the legal origin theory and the path dependence theory and applies them to Hong Kong and China. This thesis contends that the basic company law has already achieved a high degree of uniformity in Hong Kong and China and the base of divergence between Hong Kong and China is in the structural and institutional differences. This thesis argues that the success of legal transplantation and minority protection in Hong Kong is dependent upon its initial structures which have been locked-in to the current structures. This thesis concludes that the issues of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> protection in China are in its socialist market economy, state intervening policy, public ownership, relation-based tradition, rule by law culture, corruption practices, dominant role of the CCP and non-independent judiciary; and the Chinese minority protection reform, in a broader sense, involves not only the legislative issue but also the structural issues which relate to the rule of law principle. This thesis proposes that the transplantation of foreign company law will not necessarily improve the protection of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders</b> and hence the corporate governance in China. This thesis also confirms that direct transplantation of foreign law is not always suitable for countries with less developed structures. These findings are also relevant to other emerging economies and developing countries in understanding the limitations on the use of foreign law to improve corporate governance and the protection of <b>minority</b> <b>shareholders.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The largest <b>minority</b> <b>shareholder,</b> the Petersen Group, held a 25% stake at {{the time}} of the renationalization, and had financed their initial {{purchase}} of 15% of the stock in 2007 with a vendor’s loan from Repsol for €1.5 billion. The chairman and majority owner of the Petersen Group, Enrique Eskenazi, was close to President Néstor Kirchner, who supported Eskenazi's bid to become YPF's principal Argentine stockholder. Eskenazi benefited from a dividend distribution rate at YPF of 90%, which allowed the Group to repay its vendor's loan in installments. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebastián Eskenazi, the son of the Petersen Group chairman and CEO of YPF until April 16, indicated however that the group would forego this option. The Group defaulted in May on a Credit Suisse loan taken in 2011 to raise its stake in YPF from 15% to 25%. Officials at Credit Suisse and at other creditors involved, including Banco Itaú, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs, announced on May 11 that the Group's shares would be repossessed as collateral. Repsol, as another of the Group's creditors affected by their default, also repossessed a block of shares, thus increasing their stake in YPF to 12%; following a steep rally in YPF shares, Repsol sold its stake a year later.|$|E
