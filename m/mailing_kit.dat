40|$|Purpose: The dual {{purposes}} of this study were: 1) to provide preliminary descriptive epidemiology data representing pedometer-determined physical activity (PA) and 2) to explore sources of intra-individual variability in steps per day. Methods: All participants (76 males, age = 48. 4 +/- 16. 3 yr, body mass index (BMI) = 27. 1 +/- 5. 1 kg[middle dot]m- 2; 133 females, age = 47. 4 +/- 17. 5 yr, BMI = 26. 9 +/- 5. 7 kg[middle dot]m- 2) resided in Sumter County, SC, and were recruited by telephone to receive a <b>mailed</b> <b>kit</b> to self-monitor PA for 1 wk. Statistical analyses compared mean steps per day between sexes, races, age groups, education and income levels, and BMI categories. Mean steps per day were also compared between: 1) weekdays versus weekend days, 2) workdays versus nonworkdays, and 3) days of sport/exercise versus no participation. Results: The entire sample took 5931 +/- 3664 steps[middle dot]d- 1 (males = 7192 +/- 3596 vs females = 5210 +/- 3518 steps[middle dot]d- 1, t = 7. 88, P < 0. 0001). Significant differences were also indicated by race, age, education, income, and BMI. In addition, weekdays were significantly higher than weekend days, workdays were higher than nonworkdays, and sport/exercise days were higher than nonsport/exercise days.

40|$|Issues addressed: The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) was {{introduced}} in Australia in 2006, offering free immunochemical Faecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) to persons aged 50, 55 or 65. The study aimed to examine the prevalence of self-reported screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using the FOBT and factors associated with not having an FOBT. Methods: A cross-sectional study of Australian general practice patients aged 50 and over with no personal history of CRC completed a health risk survey while waiting for scheduled appointments between November 2010 and November 2011. Results: A total of 5671 patients from 12 practices were approached to participate. Of the 4707 eligible patients (adults attending for care who understood English and were capable of providing informed consent), 4062 (86 %) consented to participate, with 2269 eligible to complete the FOBT items. Approximately half (52 %) of participants reported ever having an FOBT. More than one-third (39. 7 %) of the sample reported having an FOBT in the prior three years. Those who recalled receiving a <b>mailed</b> <b>kit</b> {{as part of the}} NBCSP were five times more likely to report being screened.

40|$|Background: Offering self-sampling to non-attendees of {{cervical}} screening increases screening attendance. Methods: We used {{observations from}} two Finnish {{studies on the}} use of self-sampling among the non-attendees to estimate in a hypothetical screening population of 100, 000 women the possible costs per extra screened woman and costs per extra detected and treated CIN 2 + with three intervention strategies; 1) a primary invitation and a reminder letter, 2) a primary invitation and a <b>mailed</b> self-sampling <b>kit</b> and 3) two invitation letters and a self-sampling kit. The program costs were derived from actual performance and costs in the original studies and a national estimate on management costs of HPV related diseases. Results: The price per extra participant and price per detected and treated CIN 2 + lesion was lower with a reminder letter than by self-sampling as a first reminder. When self-sampling was used as a second reminder with a low sampler price and a triage Pap-smear as a follow-up test for HPV-positive women instead of direct colposcopy referral, the eradication of a CIN 2 + lesion by self-sampling was not more expensive than in routine screening, and the addition of two reminders to the invitation protocol did not increase the price of an treated CIN 2 + lesion in the entire screened population. Conclusions: As a first reminder, a reminder letter is most likely a better choice. As second reminder, the higher costs of self-sampling might be compensated by the higher prevalence of CIN 2 + in the originally non-attending population...|$|R

Women aged 14 - 25 were randomised to receive a home kit with a pre-paid addressed envelope for mailing specimens or a clinic appointment, in Gugulethu, South Africa. Self-collected vaginal swabs were tested for gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis using PCR and self-tested for trichomoniasis using a rapid dipstick test. All women were interviewed at enrollment on sociodemographic and sexual history, and at the 6 -week follow-up on feasibility and acceptability. 626 women {{were enrolled in the}} study, with 313 in each group; 569 (91 %) completed their 6 -week follow-up visit. Forty-seven per cent {{of the women in the}} home group successfully mailed their packages, and 13 % reported performing the rapid test and/or <b>mailing</b> the <b>kit</b> (partial responders), versus 42 % of women in the clinic group who kept their appointment.

40|$|Background: Repeat {{infection}} with Chlamydia trachomatis is common {{and increases the}} risk of sequelae in women and HIV seroconversion in {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). Despite guidelines recommending chlamydia retesting three months after treatment, retesting rates are low. We are conducting the first randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of home collection combined with short message service (SMS) reminders on chlamydia retesting and reinfection rates in three risk groups. Methods/Design: The REACT (retest after Chlamydia trachomatis) trial involves 600 patients diagnosed with chlamydia: 200 MSM, 200 women and 200 heterosexual men recruited from two Australian sexual health clinics where SMS reminders for retesting are routine practice. Participants will be randomised to the home group (3 -month SMS reminder and home-collection) or the clinic group (3 -month SMS reminder to return to the clinic). Participants in the home group will be given the choice of attending the clinic if they prefer. The <b>mailed</b> home-collection <b>kit</b> includes a self-collected vaginal swab (women), UriSWAB (Copan) for urine collection (heterosexual men), and UriSWAB plus rectal swab (MSM). The primary outcome is the retest rate at 1 - 4 months after a chlamydia diagnosis, and the secondary outcomes are: the repeat positive test rate; the reinfection rate; the acceptability of home testing with SMS reminders; and the cost effectiveness of home testing. Sexual behaviour data collected via an online survey at 4 - 5 months, and genotyping of repeat infections, will be used to discriminate reinfections from treatment failures. The trial will be conducted over two years. An intention to treat analysis will be conducted. Discussion: This study will provide evidence about the effectiveness of home-collection combined with SMS reminders on chlamydia retesting, repeat infection and reinfection rates in three risk groups. The trial will determine client acceptability and cost effectiveness of this strategy. © 2014 Smith et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} notified sexually transmissible bacterial infection in Australia, where distance to health services can be a barrier. This study investigated the acceptability of a self-collection kit for chlamydia testing (sent by mail) and assessed the risk profiles of participants with respect to locality. Methods: In total, 2587 self-collection kits were distributed opportunistically or sent directly to participants upon request, as was a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The return rate was 13. 2 % (n = 341) for samples and questionnaires. The return rate did not differ with location (P = 0. 522) but with mode of distribution (opportunistic: 9. 7 %; by request: 27. 4 %; P < 0. 001). Although 37 % of participants had previously been tested for chlamydia, 77. 5 % {{said that they would}} not have sought testing otherwise. The median age of participants was 22. 6 years, 33. 8 % were male and 9. 1 % were of Aboriginal descent. Overall, 9. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 6. 1 - 12. 5) of participants were chlamydia-positive. Prevalence of chlamydia and Aboriginal participation increased with remoteness (P < 0. 001), and self-reported condom use was significantly reduced for remote and very remote locations (P = 0. 008). Within remote and very remote locations, 30. 8 % (95 % CI = 9. 1 - 61. 4) of Aboriginal participants and 38. 9 % of nonIndigenous participants were chlamydia-positive (P = 0. 718; 95 % CI = 17. 3 - 64. 3).

40|$|IntroductionFecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is an {{attractive}} approach for colorectal cancer screening at community health centers. This budget impact analysis investigated benefits and costs of FIT outreach—with FIT <b>kits</b> <b>mailed</b> to patients, followed by reminders and phone calls—compared with point-of-care (POC) strategies. MethodsFive screening and cost outcomes were simulated over 1 year at a “base case” community health center serving 1000 screening-eligible patients: (1) FIT completion among patients due for screening; (2) proportion up-to-date on screening; (3) cost per patient due for screening; (4) cost per completed FIT; and (5) total organizational cost. Uncertainty analysis investigated potential savings from optimizing staff workflows during FIT outreach. Data were collected in 2012 – 2014, with analysis conducted 2014 – 2015. ResultsUsing POC strategies, 24. 0 % of patients due for screening completed FIT, versus 42. 4 % under outreach (18. 4 % absolute difference). When calculations included patients up-to-date on screening from prior colonoscopy, 41. 7 % were up-to-date via POC, versus 55. 8 % for outreach (14. 1 % absolute difference). POC cost $ 4. 93 per patient, versus $ 30. 43 for outreach ($ 25. 50 difference). Cost per patient screened was $ 20. 60 for POC and $ 71. 84 for outreach ($ 51. 24 difference). Total organizational cost was $ 3, 779 for POC distribution and $ 23, 315 for outreach ($ 19, 536 difference). Outreach costs decreased by approximately one fourth under optimized workflows. ConclusionsOutreach is an effective, practical, relatively low-cost strategy; costs could be reduced further by optimizing staff workflows. Despite its value, outreach costs more than POC distribution and {{may be difficult for}} community health centers to implement under current payment models...|$|R
40|$|Background : A {{screening}} programme {{to detect}} polyps or early carcinoma would {{significantly reduce the}} mortality and morbidity of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aims {{of the present study}} were to evaluate: (i) the feasibility of training general practitioners in flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) for CRC screening; (ii) the acceptability of screening by faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and FS in asymptomatic standard risk Australians aged over 50 years; and (iii) the yield of such screening. Methods : Subjects were recruited by general practitioner (GP) referral, newspaper advertisement or by a direct approach to retirement villages. Participants were <b>mailed</b> a FOBT <b>kit</b> and a prescreening questionnaire. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed by a GP supervised by an experienced endoscopist. Subjects then completed a second questionnaire. General practitioners were assessed after 50 unassisted procedures. Results : A total of 264 individuals contacted the study coordinator; 169 were screened. Screening was accepted well by the participants. Fifteen per cent of subjects had polyps and 4 % had a positive FOBT. Training in FS was adversely affected by the availability of resources. Three GPs completed 50 unassisted procedures over a 15 -month period, but none were able to reliably assess the distal bowel. Conclusions : Although the three trainees and their supervisors did not consider that the GPs were adequately trained after 50 unassisted procedures, training was adversely affected by limited resources within the Victorian public hospital system. Screening by FOBT and FS was considered to be acceptable by the patients undergoing these procedures. Existing facilities are not adequate if GPs are to be trained in FS as part of a national CRC screening program. <br /...|$|R
30|$|Administration of {{deuterium}} oxide and collection of skin samples {{is very easy}} making this assay highly attractive; however as with any new assay feasibility and cost must be considered. Unlike other methods of assessing protein turnover which historically have used short term i.v. infusion of radiolabelled tracer or invasive punch sampling (discussed above) in this study subjects drink pre-bottled D 2 O at home and are then tape stripped. In our study tape strips were collected by a single person to minimize any sampling variability between subjects in such a small cohort and because the subjects were already visiting the clinic for pre-existing visits. However skin collection could also {{be carried out by}} the subject in an outpatient setting as tape strip collection is painless and requires minimal training. Following collection tape strips are stuck onto a laminated card and can be stored in the subjects’ freezer until collection. It is conceivable to imagine a <b>kit</b> <b>mailed</b> to the subjects home of D 2 O, tape strips and collection cards. The abundance of keratin in the tape strip sample means protein isolation is relatively easy for any chemical laboratory. We envision this method being most applicable to interpretation of clinical trials rather than routine disease management of patients. In this scenario access to a mass spectrometry instrument and chemical lab is not limiting. Additionally, new mass spec methods such as MRM or SISCAPA, are high through put and have been used to translate biomarker approaches from discovery to clinical trials. These methods can be used to measure a targeted protein of interest from a complex biological sample and this method could be adapted to this platform.|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) {{is the most}} common registrable cancer affecting both men and women, and the third most common cause of cancer deaths. Clinical data from randomised, controlled trials indicate that population-based screening utilising the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) can reduce mortality from this disease. However, high adherence rates with repeated testing are required to secure these outcomes. This study examines repeat adherence with FOBT screening in a rural community two years after a first screening round was conducted. Patients, aged 50 to 74 years, registered with four local general practices were <b>mailed</b> a FOBT <b>kit</b> with a letter of invitation from their general practitioner. Following the intervention, 119 telephone interviews were conducted with adherers and non-adherers to examine knowledge and attitudes related to screening. Compliance with screening was recorded and compared with first round-data. Participation in the screening program was modest. Of the 3, 406 participants eligible for both screening rounds, 34. 1 % and 34. 7 % participated in rounds 1 and 2, respectively. A majority of participants (56. 8 %) did not adhere to either screening, a quarter (25. 7 %) participated in both rounds, and 17. 5 % participated in one of the two rounds. First-round adherence was the strongest predictor of second-round adherence (OR= 16. 29; 95 % CI: 13. 58, 19. 53) with 75. 2 % of first-round adherers completing a FOBT in round 2. Females {{were also more likely to}} adhere in both rounds, although the difference between females and males decreased across rounds. Knowledge and attitudes differed between adherers and non-adherers and are discussed within the context of the major findings. Results from this trial indicate that achieving high levels of compliance in a national screening program will be challenging. Strategies to increase repeat adherence are suggested...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Speedy {{has arrived}} in camp. He is {{to act as}} {{political}} adviser to General Napier, and his arrival is a general matter of satisfaction. Mr. Speedy was at one time {{an officer in the}} 81st Foot; he afterwards exchanged into the 10th Punjaubees, of which regiment he was some time adjutant. He afterwards left the service and wandered out to Abyssinia, where he entered the service of Theodore, and assisted him to organise and drill his army. Finding he was likely to share the fate of other British in this potentate’s employ, and to be cast into prison, Mr. Speedy threw up his appointment, and has since been living in Australia. General Napier, having heard of him, wrote to beg him to come; and Mr. Speedy received the letter just in time to come off by the <b>mail,</b> with a <b>kit,</b> according to popular report, consisting only of two blankets. He is not, I am happy to say, an Abyssinian worshipper. Dr. Krapf, Colonel Merewether’s adviser, is so. He seems to think that the black is a very much finer specimen of humanity than the white man; and that deeds which would be punished in the latter are highly excusable, if not laudable, when perpetrated by the former. Dr. Krapf is not singular in his ideas. Had his lines lain in England, I have no doubt that he would have been one of Governor Eyre’s foremost persecutors. I am very glad that a healthier tone is likely to be introduced in our dealings with the natives. Mr. Speedy rode out yesterday, at the General’s request, to some of the villages round, called upon the priests, and offered a present of money for the relief of the poor and distressed. The answer in each case was the same. The priests said that {{had it not been for}} our coming, a period of severe distress and suffering would probably have occurred. The crops had been devastated by the locusts, and the present drought would seriously affect the next harvest. Thanks, however, to the money which the English had distributed through the country in payment for cattle purchased by the commissariat, and for hay, wood, milk, &c., and for the hire of transport, the people were better off than usual; and therefore, with the exception of three or four dollars for the aged and infirm, they would decline with thanks General Napier’s gift.|$|R
40|$|To {{paraphrase}} a by now well-known story, back in 1975 on the West Coast of California, a {{group of}} hobbyists interested in {{the latest developments in}} electronic computers met in the garage of a suburban house to exchange stories, information and show each other the latest pieces of technology they had acquired and the adaptations they had made to the same. This was the Homebrew Computer Club. One of the early computers scrutinised by this congregation was a <b>mail</b> order do-it-yourself <b>kit</b> for the Altair 8800, which had featured as the cover story of the January issue of Popular Electronics. It was a fairly basic machine –just a simple steel box with a number of toggle switches and LED lights which, when assembled, allowed the user to do nothing more than use the toggle switches to programme the computer to make the lights flash as it counted in binary and performed mathematical calculations. One member of the club, a certain Steve Wozniak who had been building electronic projects of his own since elementary school, saw this as an unacceptable state of affairs, and thought that he could build something much better. In six months, using the cheapest microprocessor chip on the market, Wozniak developed a computer that used a keyboard to enable programming and a television monitor as an output. With his friend Steve Jobs he founded the company Apple Computer Inc. in 1976, used Steve Jobs’ parents’ garage as the company’s headquarters, and sold the components for around 175 of the Apple I computer in kit form. It was a well-received product, despite owners having to make wooden cases for the computer themselves. Using the money from selling these kits, the two Steve’s went on to design and produce a more commercial and hugely successful machine, the Apple][(or Apple II as it became known) in 1977, just in time for Apple to become a major force in the explosion of the home computer market that occurred that year. Numerous detailed academic and mainstream accounts of the birth and history of Apple Computers have been written over the years, and whole books have even been written about individual products, particularly the ground-breaking Apple Macintosh of 1984. This level of media attention has accompanied every step of Apple’s progress on its route to becoming the largest and most profitable technology corporation the world has ever seen. For a company that is notoriously secretive, there is a huge amount of information out there about every product they have ever sold, ranging from official corporate press releases, journalistic coverage in newspapers and magazines, academic analyses in books and journals and user opinion on numerous blogs. This has been rendered possible largely because of the unprecedented rationalisation of their product portfolio. As an example, let us take a particular point in time. In 2001, Apple launched the iPod – a device which, although not employing any new technology, nevertheless completely altered the way vast numbers of people engage with music. At the time of its release on the 23 rd of October, the official Apple website displayed the company’s complete range of hardware as: the iPod, the iMac, the Power Mac G 4, the G 4 server, the iBook, the PowerBook G 4, the 22 ” Cinema Display monitor, the 17 ” and 15 ” Studio Display monitors, the Apple Pro mouse, Apple Pro keyboard and the Airport modem. That’s it. A mere 12 products produced and sold globally. It is a radically minimalist approach indicative of Apple, and one which is completely in line with the aesthetics of the company’s design philosophy. A highly considered output of very refined products, each eagerly anticipated by and released with huge fanfare to an enormous fan base of ‘Macolytes’. And every time a product is released it is immediately splashed across every newspaper and magazine; dissected, analysed and discussed at length on innumerable websites, with every strength and weakness highlighted through social media. It is the kind of exposure and reverence that has allowed every product that Apple has ever produced to become a collectible piece of design history, documented and indexed to from part of a coherent, manageable timeline of production and consumption that could be, and indeed to a large part has been, pragmatically displayed in a single exhibition with an appropriately considered catalogue. This is not the usual state of affairs. Compare the output of Apple with just one of its competitors. At almost exactly the same time, Sony, a similarly global corporation selling similarly priced high-end technology, had a significantly larger product portfolio. On the 13 th December 2001 the Sony UK website listed 25 different product categories including TV, Video, Hi-Fi, Home Entertainment, Walkman, Playstation, Portable Cassette, Radio, Computers, Vaio Notebooks, Clie Handheld Computers and so on. Within just one of these categories, Vaio Notebooks, there were seven different series of Notebooks listed, each containing between one and seven products. A total of 36 discrete models of laptop – three times the number of products produced by Apple across their complete product range. And that is just for one of the 25 product categories, each of which contained a similarly sized or larger range of products; and that website only covered the United Kingdom. The global site listed 55 separate countries, each of which had its own individual website, each containing different ranges of country specific models of their products. In short, and in sharp contrast to Apple, it is to all intents and purposes impossible to compile a complete list of technology products emanating from a single corporation such as Sony at any particular point in time, let alone any kind of complete historical picture of all technological products. The point of this comparison is to highlight one of the main problems of researching any aspect of the design history of modern technology – the sheer amount of different products produced and discarded year upon year by companies such as Sony, Philips, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and numerous other well-known global brands. In itself an incalculable amount of production, yet likely dwarfed by the combined output of an enormous number of much smaller, less well-known competitors producing lower quality, cheaper, ‘me too’ products. After all, if two guys in a garage can change the world, surely anyone can do it...|$|R
