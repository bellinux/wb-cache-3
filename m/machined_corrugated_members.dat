40|$|Corrugated {{paper is}} {{produced}} by gluing three types of papers of the same breadth. Given a set of orders, we first assign each order {{to one of the}} standard breadths, and then sequence those assigned to each standard breadth so that they are continuously manufactured from the three rolls of the specified standard breadth equipped in the machine called corrugator. Here we are asked to achieve multi-goals of minimizing total length of roll papers, total loss of papers caused by the differences between standard breadths and real breadths of the orders, and the number of machine stops needed during production. We use integer programming to assign orders to standard breadths, and then develop a special purpose algorithm to sequence the orders assigned to each standard breadth. This is a first attempt to handle scheduling problems of the corrugator <b>machine.</b> Scheduling <b>Corrugated</b> paper Complexity Contiguous set Integer programming...|$|R

A general recycling depot, to which residents and businesses could bring appliances (refrigerators, stoves, washing <b>machines,</b> etc.), <b>corrugated</b> cardboard, drywall, scrap metal and tires for recycling operated at the site, as did a tire recycling depot. The facility also had a yard waste drop-off area, from which the operators would transport material for composting in large outdoor windrows on a site north of the landfill, at the Avondale Composting Site. It also accepted waste brought by residents of households in York Region, but building contractors abused the privilege by bringing numerous small loads to the landfill, prompting {{the imposition of a}} tipping fee in 1990 for pickup trucks and small trailers. Commercial haulers were charged $18 per tonne in 1988, and $97 per tonne in 1990.|$|R
40|$|A {{pultrusion}} <b>machine</b> {{employing a}} <b>corrugated</b> impregnator vessel to immerse multiple, continuous strand, fiber tow in an impregnating material, and an adjustable metered exit orifice for the impregnator vessel {{to control the}} quantity of impregnating material retained by the impregnated fibers, is provided. An adjustable height insert retains transverse rod elements within each depression of the corrugated vessel to maintain the individual fiber tows spread and {{in contact with the}} vessel bottom. A series of elongated heating dies, transversely disposed on the pultrusion machine and having flat heating surfaces with radiused edges, ensure adequate temperature exposed dwell time and exert adequate pressure on the impregnated fiber tows, to provide the desired thickness and fiber/resin ratio in the prepreg formed. The prepreg passing through the pulling mechanism is wound on a suitable take-up spool for subsequent use. A formula is derived for determining the cross sectional area opening of the metering device. A modification in the heating die system employs a heated nip roller in lieu of one of the pressure applying flat dies...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} investigations and finite element analyses {{is presented in}} the compression response and subsequent failure modes in foam-filled corrugated core sandwich panels. The corrugated cores based on carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) were fabricated using a hot press molding process and then bonded to face sheets based on the same material, to produce a range of lightweight sandwich panels. A liquid of low-density Rigid Polyurethane (PUR) foam was injected to fill the empty space of the panels, where to investigate the influence of filling the corrugation with the foam. The experiments also provide an insight into the post-failure response of the sandwich panels. The results are compared with the numerical predictions offered by a finite element analysis (FEA). Buckling of the cell walls {{has been found to be}} initial failure mode in these corrugated core panels. Continued loading resulted in fracture of the cell walls, localized delamination as well as debonding between the skins and the core. The predictions of the FEA show reasonably good agreement with the experimental measurements, for semi-filled and fully-filled foams. Finally, filling the inside of the corrugated core sandwich panels with the foam significantly improved the specific energy absorption (SEA) characteristics of the panels. The SEA for the GFRP and the CFRP fully-filled specimens were improved by almost 160 % and 105 %, respectively. This improvement was due to the constraint effects between the foam and the <b>corrugated</b> core <b>members...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Hospital {{infections are}} one of the {{important}} reasons of mortality and incurred expenses. Therefore, we must control these infections by identifying contamination sources. The aim of this study was the determination of bacterial pollution of corrugated anesthesia sets in surgical rooms. Methods: This study was an analytic-description one performed in training hospitals of Yazd city. Research sample was 440 cases provided from different parts of corrugate after completing the anesthesia period by wet sterile swabs and transferred to culture media. On Thursday, each week, a sample from different parts of tube after sterilizing with cetrimide solution was obtained. Finally, after 24 hours, culture medias were studied for colony growth. Results: Obtained results indicated that of 440 cases taken samples, 343 cases were without bacterial pollution, 71 cases (19. 29 %) had bacterial pollution of samples before sterilizing and 26 cases (36. 1 %) were polluted after tube sterilizing. Conclusion: Sampling and culturing from used equipment and tools in hospital is one of the important actions for identifying and controlling hospital infections. Obtained results from this study indicated that of 440 cases, there were 97 cases of pollution. Therefore, it is suggested that anti bacterial filters should be installed before Y form piece of tubes in anesthesia <b>machines</b> and disposable <b>corrugated</b> tubes should replace traditional tubes. In addition, it seems necessary that wider investigations should be done...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrugated}} cardboard {{is widely used}} in manufacturing industries as a packaging and transportation material. Faculty of {{corrugated cardboard}} is depended on the fragility, weight, thickness, toughness and so on. The strength of corrugated cardboard changed with the fabrication process, used atmosphere and variety of loading patterns. On the <b>machining</b> process of <b>corrugated</b> cardboard box, the cutting and ruling technology is very important factor. The effects of these factors {{on the strength of}} corrugated cardboard have not yet enough been identified. In general, the corrugated cardboard was composed with three layer of paperboard. One is outside liner and inside liner and the other is corrugated medium. The top of corrugated medium is bonded with glue on outside or inside layer surface. The bonded space was decided by company standard. The evolutional method of bonding strength had not been established. The development of new simple method has been needed. In this research, to establish the evaluation method of strength of corrugated cardboard material, new practical tensile test and shear test, considering the glue bonding strength, was proposed and the factory of these test method was investigated. In current studies, it was too hard to evaluate the reproductive tensile and shear strength of corrugated cardboard, because of fabrication method of the cut specimen and the deformation of chuck position. On the shear test, as the direction of parallel chuck changed during loading process, the specimen was rotated. In this research, the new developed method of tensile and shear was accomplished, the reproduced strength could be obtained. The fatigue test was tried on the shear test to investigate the effect of thickness of specimen...|$|R
