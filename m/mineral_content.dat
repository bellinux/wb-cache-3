5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E

The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or <b>mineral</b> <b>content.</b> When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high <b>mineral</b> <b>content.</b> Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina.

40|$|There {{are three}} major {{components}} in completely decomposed granite (CDG) : quartz, feldspar and clay mineral. How about the variation {{and the value}} range of their contents, especially the clay mineral? Taking samples from 18 blocks (each side 30 cm length) from 3 trial pits in Kowloon, Hong Kong, as an example, we try to solve this problem. The specimens for XRD test are cut from different zones in the blocks. The test results (involving the three components contents, percentages of kaolinite and of illite in clay size particles) are analyzed and compared. It is found that the <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> generally vary within a range of 10 %- 20 %; the varied range of kaolinite content is bigger than that of illite; the change values of specimens with coarse-particle structures are larger than that of finer-particle structures; and the results from different analyzers vary to an extent. After analysis {{it is known that}} both the inhomogeneity of CDG and the experiences of analyzers mostly make the clay <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> change even in the same zone of one block. Furthermore, the XRD results are compared with those from statistic values via thin sections to check the variation of <b>mineral</b> <b>contents.</b> As a result, it is shown that for the <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> from XRD, the quartz is usually higher, the feldspar is smaller, and the clay mineral higher and smaller for different specimens. The <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> from XRD and thin section are different in a range of 0 %- 35 %. Totally this research quantitatively describes the inhomogeneity of the CDG in block and trial pit sizes, which together with the identification of initial mineral or secondary clay mineral (e. g. feldspar or kaolinite, mica or vermiculite), causes the variations of the content results to a great extent. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} a syrinx, which has enough <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> for fossilization, {{was found in a}} specimen of the duck-like Vegavis iaai dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently. A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size. The crests of the Lambeosaurini and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance, though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E

Capsaicin, ?-carotene, ascorbic acid, fruit quality attributes, and fruit mineral compositions were evaluated at five different ages of fruits at 25 Days after fruit set (DFS), 35 DFS, 45 DFS, 55 DFS, and 65 DFS. Results revealed that capsaicin, ?-carotene, ascorbic acid, fruit quality, and <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> in fruits and leaves of sweet pepper increased with increasing rate of nigari compared to the control.
