40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microstructure {{model for the}} unsecured overnight euro money market, similar to that developed for stock markets by Easley and O'Hara (1992). More specifically, this paper studies the role of heterogeneity in the population of banks participating on this market, {{and the influence of}} the institutional framework and market organizational aspects of the overnight deposit market. A first empirical assessment of the functioning of this market is based on the probability of informed trade which measures the ability of traders (banks) to interpret signals on the expected evolution of the overnight rate. This indicator is estimated on real-time data publicly available to market participants. Results show that between 2000 and 2004 a heterogeneous learning process of market mechanisms within participants could be observed. From 2005 onwards, however, heterogeneity in the learning process sharply decreased. Moreover, the empirical evidence show that the March 2004 changes in Eurosystem's operational framework have modified the informational patterns of order flow in the euro area money market: informed trades became even more predominant between the last <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> {{and the end of the}} reserves maintenance period than they were before March 2004.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of crises - {{the global financial}} crisis in 2008, the "Great Recession" in 2009 and the subsequent Euro crisis - constituted a major challenge for policy makers. After the fiscal policy had used up its powder in fighting the 2009 recession, monetary policy remained the only expansionary player in the policy arena. The ECB reacted to the crises with applying conventional (interest rate) and unconventional (qualitative easing) measures, however, with a considerable delay to the US Fed. The interest (<b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation)</b> rate was set to zero in September 2014 (the Fed already in December 2008) and the proper QE programme started not until March 2015 (the Fed shortly after the Lehman brothers crash). In evaluating the crisis management of the ECB one must state a clear failure in reaching its own medium term inflation target of 2 percent. However, it was successful in bringing down interest rates for government bonds after Draghi's famous "whatever it takes" speech in July 2012 and the following announcement of the outright monetary transactions programme. Whether ECB's QE programme 2015 - 2017 will be successful in reaching its primary goal, namely regaining the inflation target of 2 percent is an open question. Simulations with the Global Economic Model of Oxford Economics indicate {{that it will be}} able to reach the inflation goal but only with a considerable lag. The impact on the real economy will not be as large as QE experiments in the USA. Other unintended effects - e. g., the creation of bubbles on the stock markets - are larger than the intended effects. In contrast to the usual dynamic stochastic general equilibrium exercises our simulations of ECB's QE with the global economic model can not only quantify the effects for the Euro area as a whole but also for its member countries and it can identify the possible spillovers to countries outside the Euro area...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few months, euro area money markets {{have been exposed to}} intense tensions. On 8 August, {{overnight}} interest rates rose to very high levels which required interventions of the Eurosystem in order to stabilise short-term money market interest rates around the target level, i. e. the minimum bid rate on the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations.</b> The article explains how the Eurosystem steers very short-term money market interest rates by adjusting its supply of liquidity on the money market. It is shown how the Eurosystem’s liquidity management stabilised short-term money market interest rates around the minimum bid rate on the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> {{in the first half of}} 2007. Although short-term money market interest rates were more volatile during the period of financial turmoil, the Eurosystem nevertheless managed to safeguard the signalling function of the short-term money market interest rates by applying its operational framework in a flexible way. More specifically, the Eurosystem decided to allot more liquidity than the benchmark amount in the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> early within the maintenance period. It was also decided to conduct fine-tuning operations on a more frequent basis in order to stabilise short-term rates. Finally, the Eurosystem also decided to increase the share of longer-term refinancing operations in the total amount of outstanding open market operations. Despite the relative success in stabilising very short-term money market interest rates, longer maturity unsecured interest rates – for instance the 3 -month Euribor – increased significantly during the period of financial turmoil. These movements cannot be controlled directly by central banks as they are determined predominantly by private sector behaviour.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set, I study whether {{structural}} bank characteristics {{can help to}} explain a bank's propensity to take recourse to the ECB's marginal lending facility (MLF). My key finding is that besides structural measures capturing a bank's business model, indicators for its liquidity risk management have a highly significant predictive power for a bank's access to the lender-of-the-last-resort (LLR) facility. A bank with volatile reserve holdings, a lower average reserve fulfillment and a more aggressive bidding behavior in the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations,</b> is {{significantly more likely to}} revert to the MLF.

40|$|The {{fixed rate}} tender {{is one of the}} main {{procedures}} used by central banks in the implementation of their monetary policies. While academic research has largely dismissed the procedure owing to its tendency to encourage overbidding, central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of England have continued using it. We investigate this apparent conflict by considering an auction-theoretic setting with private information about declining marginal valuations. Since overbidding entails exposure risk, an equilibrium may exist even if bids are costless and the intended volume is pre-announced. In fact, the allotment quota may be strictly below one with certainty. Also with adaptive expectations, overbidding need not escalate. However, the resulting allocation is typically ineffi cient.

The ECB, while applying fixed rate tenders, appears to have been attempting stabilise the market interest rate at a level close to the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> rate. However, this aim was at least partially overridden by that of stabilising total money market liquidity {{over the course of the}} reserve maintenance period – even more so when banks were expecting the ECB to raise the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> rate in the near future. The banks’ aggregate bids increased considerably during the period of fixed rate tenders.
