25|$|A <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (MFC), or {{biological}} fuel cell, is a bio-electrochemical system that drives an electric current by using bacteria and mimicking bacterial interactions found in nature. MFCs can be grouped into two general categories: mediated and unmediated. The first MFCs, {{demonstrated in the}} early 20th century, used a mediator: a chemical that transfers electrons from the bacteria in the cell to the anode. Unmediated MFCs emerged in the 1970s; {{in this type of}} MFC the bacteria typically have electrochemically active redox proteins such as cytochromes on their outer membrane that can transfer electrons directly to the anode. In the 21st century MFCs started to find a commercial use in wastewater treatment.|$|E

25|$|A <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (MFC) is {{a device}} that {{converts}} chemical energy to electrical energy {{by the action of}} microorganisms. These electrochemical cells are constructed using either a bioanode and/or a biocathode. Most MFCs contain a membrane to separate the compartments of the anode (where oxidation takes place) and the cathode (where reduction takes place). The electrons produced during oxidation are transferred directly to an electrode or, to a redox mediator species. The electron flux is moved to the cathode. The charge balance of the system is compensated by ionic movement inside the cell, usually across an ionic membrane. Most MFCs use an organic electron donor that is oxidised to produce CO2, protons and electrons. Other electron donors have been reported, such as sulphur compounds or hydrogen. The cathode reaction uses a variety of electron acceptors that includes the reduction of oxygen as the most studied process. However, other electron acceptors have been studied, including metal recovery by reduction, water to hydrogen, nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for energy resources has urged scientists {{to focus on}} improving the renewable energy sources. <b>Microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (MFCs) have received an increasing attention. Both energy conversion mechanism and electrode type have attributed to affect {{the efficiency of the}} <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Electrodes {{as one of the most}} important components of the <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have been widely investigated. While most of the electrode materials are carbon based, there is very little effort on introducing novel materials for this purpose. This paper intends to shed an insight on the effect of using a new cathode material on the performance of <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> We employ hydrodynamic forces to control both molecular organization and microstructure size and shape in order to create highly structured microfibers. A microfluidic sheath flow device is used for the fabrication processes. The core flow is acrylate solution and UV light cures the photoinitiator to start the polymerization process. The exiting stream goes inside a water bath, where the sheath flow dissolves in the DI water and the core flow forms the microfibers. Controlled self-assembly can be used to deposit a thin layer of functionalized metal nanoparticles on the polymeric structure made from microfibers to enhance their electric conductivity. A conductive and porous network formed by the microfibers can be used as an efficient cathode material in <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, using this fabrication technique we can make microfibers with different shapes and sizes...|$|R
40|$|Neutral red (NR) was {{utilized}} as an electron mediator in <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> consuming glucose to study both its efficiency during electricity generation {{and its role}} in altering anaerobic growth and metabolism of Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus succinogenes. A study of chemical <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> in which NADH, NR, and ferricyanide were the electron donor, the electronophore, and the electron acceptor, respectively, showed that electrical current produced from NADH was proportional to the concentration of NADH. Fourfold more current was produced from NADH in chemical <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> when NR was the electron mediator than when thionin was the electron mediator. In <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> in which E. coli resting cells were used the amount of current produced from glucose when NR was the electron mediator (3. 5 mA) was 10 -fold more than the amount produced when thionin was the electron mediator (0. 4 mA). The amount of electrical energy generated (expressed in joules per mole of substrate) and the amount of current produced from glucose (expressed in milliamperes) in NR-mediated <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> containing either E. coli or A. succinogenes were about 10 - and 2 -fold greater, respectively, when resting cells were used than when growing cells were used. Cell growth was inhibited substantially when these <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> were making current, and more oxidized end products were formed under these conditions. When sewage sludge (i. e., a mixed culture of anaerobic bacteria) was used in the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> stable (for 120 h) and equivalent levels of current were obtained with glucose, as observed in the pure-culture experiments. These results suggest that NR is better than other electron mediators used in <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and that sludge production can be decreased while electricity is produced in <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Our results are discussed in relation to factors that may improve the relatively low electrical efficiencies (1. 2 kJ/mol) obtained with <b>microbial</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
