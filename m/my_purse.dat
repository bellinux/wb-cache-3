500|$|... {{the cruel}} oppressions of this kingdom by England {{are not to}} be borne. You send what books you please hither, and the booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here. As this is {{absolute}} oppression, if I were a bookseller in this town, I would use all the safe means to reprint London books, and run them to any town in England, that I could, because whoever offends not the laws of God, or the country he lives in, commits no sin.... But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E
6000|$|... "They wanted <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> to look at," [...] said Clarence hurriedly, [...] "and that's how {{the thing}} happened. Somebody put HIS OWN MONEY back into <b>MY</b> <b>purse</b> by accident." ...|$|E

6000|$|To Antwerp town I hasten'd post, [...] And as I took my {{evening meal}} [...] I felt <b>my</b> pouch,--my <b>purse</b> was lost, [...] O Heaven! Why came I not by Lille? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In eight days, too, <b>my</b> {{travelling}} <b>purse</b> will be exhausted. [...] It is yet utterly {{impossible for}} me to labour with my mind. [...] In my hand, therefore, are at present no resources.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} none of his coinage in <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> though, Michael," [...] said mine host; [...] "I know what belongs to falsifying the Queen's coin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As long as there's {{the ghost}} of a chance left to me," [...] Lord Harry replied, [...] "I'll take any way of filling <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> but yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can then? The {{day after}} to-morrow, if you please. You are {{to pay all}} charges out of <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> You hear the {{condition}} of your going?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{saw them}} as I rode up. And a fine lot they are; but of too good a stamp for <b>my</b> short <b>purse,</b> or for <b>my</b> holy master's riding,--a fat priest likes a quiet nag, my master." ...|$|R
6000|$|I humored the idea. I {{came forward}} under an {{imaginary}} guard of the enemy's soldiers, produced my paper, {{and read it}} through. For answer, Clarence struck the paper out of <b>my</b> hand, <b>pursed</b> up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} getting at <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> and my revolver," [...] he said, showing them. [...] "I've {{got to get}} some stores at the Ferry by daylight." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{gold watch}} and chain, <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> {{and three of}} the nicest fellers that ever breathed," [...] {{continued}} Smith, who was now entering into the spirit of the thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will do it}} myself, David," [...] cried Barnstable, {{struggling}} to conceal his emotion; [...] "I will call on her the instant we let go our anchor in Boston harbor; and as your credit can't be large, I will divide <b>my</b> own <b>purse</b> with her!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{enter into}} no sordid particulars, in {{discussing}} {{this part of}} the subject. My mind recoils from them. With a Roman austerity, I show <b>my</b> empty <b>purse</b> and Percival's to the shrinking public gaze. Let us allow the deplorable fact to assert itself, once for all, in that manner, and pass on.|$|R
6000|$|... "That upsets things badly," [...] said Captain Ichabod, without unclouding his brow. [...] "With my slow {{vessel and}} <b>my</b> empty <b>purse,</b> bedad, I don't see how I am ever goin' to catch Blackbeard {{if he has}} gone north.

6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "I {{would have}} stayed myself to meet her, but I'd left my plush bag with <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> in it at Stearns's, and I {{had to go back}} after it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One--only one. Fanny Hackbutt {{comes at}} half past eleven. I am {{not getting a}} great income now," [...] said Mrs. Garth, smiling. [...] "I am at a low ebb with pupils. But I have saved <b>my</b> little <b>purse</b> for Alfred's premium: I have ninety-two pounds. He can go to Mr. Hanmer's now; he is just at the right age." ...|$|R

40|$|I {{looked at}} <b>my</b> slim <b>purse</b> {{and once again}} {{explored}} its depths hopefully. A nickel, two pennies, a dime and a fifty-cent piece rewarded my search. With bargains all over town it was really deploring {{to be in a}} such a situation. Ah, happy thought! I 2 Ì† 7 d go window shopping. That would be more fun anway, because I could choose whatever I liked regardless of price tags...|$|R
6000|$|UNKNOWN. In <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> in the reticule. It was a crimson silk purse. Really, I wouldn't have come--I don't want to {{make any}} fuss. But I must get my money back--mustn't I? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am afraid, Uncle," [...] {{he said in}} the morning, [...] "that the furnishment of the <b>purse</b> <b>my</b> {{father gave}} me, at starting, will not go far towards what you may {{consider}} necessary for my outfit." ...|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. Here are <b>my</b> answers. (Producing <b>purse</b> and dice.) These {{are both}} too light. This purse is empty, these dice are not loaded. Is it indiscretion to inquire how you share? Equal with the Captain, I presume? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I won't indeed, my dear," [...] says he, [...] "unless I am {{obliged to}} it. I assure you I {{do not intend}} it; but if I should, I am not worth robbing now, for I have nothing about me but about six pistoles in <b>my</b> little <b>purse</b> and that little ring," [...] showing me a small diamond ring, worth about ten or twelve pistoles, which he put upon his finger, in the room of the rich one he usually wore.|$|R
