50|$|The {{passing loops}} {{on either side}} of the main line have been {{retained}} and are used on a daily basis. The north side, beyond the up-loop, is a large Green Link tree-planting project. On the south side, beyond the down-loops, are <b>maintenance</b> <b>sidings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{environmental}} impact of masonry depends {{on the type of}} material used. In general, concrete and concrete based materials are intensive energy materials to produce. However, the long durability and minimal <b>maintenance</b> of masonry <b>sidings</b> mean that less energy is required {{over the life of the}} siding.|$|R
5000|$|A {{predecessor}} {{to modern}} <b>maintenance</b> free <b>sidings</b> was asphalt brick siding. Asphalt impregnated panels (about 2 feet by 4 feet) gave {{the appearance of}} brick or even stone. Many buildings still have this siding, especially old sheds and garages. If the panels are straight and level and not damaged, the only indication {{that they are not}} real brick may be seen at the corner caps. Trademarked names included Insulbrick, Insulstone, Insulwood. Commonly used names now are faux brick, lick it and stick it brick, and ghetto brick. Often such siding is now covered over with newer metal or plastic siding. Today thin panels of real brick are manufactured for veneer or siding. {needs date of first use of asphalt brick siding} ...|$|R
50|$|The local granite {{quarries}} are a {{major source}} stone aggregate railway traffic especially for road building and railway <b>maintenance</b> purposes. Transfer <b>sidings</b> for this traffic are located next to the station and are controlled from the station signal box. This had to be relocated following a fatal accident at the station in August 1950. Six people were killed when a goods train undertaking shunting operations at the station {{in the early hours}} was inadvertently diverted onto the main line, where it collided with the fast-moving eastbound Irish Mail express from Holyhead. The poor view afforded of the sidings from the old box was cited as one of the contributory factors to the accident.|$|R
50|$|On 18 January 2012, the Federal Railway Authority {{asked the}} TÃ¼bingen region {{to conduct an}} {{additional}} consultation process on further changes to the plans. These changes include {{the elimination of the}} originally planned fifth platform in the station, the elimination of Ulm Ost station and modifications to soundproofing and waste water technology. Deutsche Bahn justified the omission of the fifth platform with operational improvements {{as a result of the}} concentration of all train parking in a new vehicle <b>maintenance</b> facility and <b>sidings.</b> The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure doubted whether the platform could actually be eliminated if long-term service improvements (including the planned Danube-Iller Regional S-Bahn) are to be implemented. A critic sees the S-Bahn concept compromised if the fifth platform is not provided from the outset. If a fifth platform is actually necessary, according to the DB, funding would have to be provided for separately. The DB is not aware of formal plans for an S-Bahn.|$|R
