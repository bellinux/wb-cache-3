50|$|As of 2013, The Livestock Conservancy {{considers}} the <b>Mulefoot</b> to be critically endangered, a categorization given to breeds {{with a population}} of fewer than 2,000 and yearly registrations of fewer than 200. As of 2006, there were estimated to be fewer than 200 purebred <b>Mulefoot</b> hogs in existence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mulefoot</b> are a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} pig which {{is named for}} its intact, uncloven hooves reminiscent of a mule.|$|E
50|$|Maveric Ranch {{took over}} conservatorship of the <b>Mulefoot</b> Breed in 2006. To date they have placed {{breeding}} groups on over 40 farms across the USA.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mulefoot</b> likely {{originated}} with swine {{brought to the}} Gulf Coast by the Spanish; however, exactly when they originated as a syndactyl animal is not clear. While pigs with single hooves are found in writings {{as far back as}} Aristotle, the <b>Mulefoot</b> is the only population to be considered a breed, with an established standard type and extensive agricultural usage. The breed is possibly related to the Choctaw pig, and may share a similar ancestry. The Spanish-descended stock was minimally managed, with some selective breeding, which continued into the late 1800s. Breed standards for the <b>Mulefoot</b> arose around 1900, and its ability to fatten quickly meant was used mainly for the production of meat and lard, with its hams being particularly prized. The breed was seen mainly in the Corn Belt and Mississippi River Valley. The early 20th century saw the breed at the peak of its popularity, with over 200 purebred herds and two breed associations. At the same time, some Mulefoots were exported to Canada, but the population was not maintained.|$|E
50|$|Will {{currently}} pastures <b>Mulefoot</b> hogs and Highland cattle, keeps a {{flock of}} chickens and turkeys, and grows a large food garden on his Osage County, Kan., farm. He is an experienced grazier who favors low-stress, intensive management of animals, pastures and hay meadows. He believes in improving soils and the pasture matrix by carefully timing the frequency and duration of animal grazing.|$|E
50|$|Choctaw hogs {{have two}} {{distinctive}} characteristics indicative {{of their ancestors}} brought from Spain. First, their toes are typically fused forming a single hoof {{like that of a}} mule. The <b>mulefoot</b> shares this trait for the same reason and the two breeds may come from common ancestral stock which was loosely selected and managed until the late 19th century. Secondly, many have fleshy wattles on each side of their necks.|$|E
50|$|Pigs are {{exhibited}} at agricultural shows, judged either as stud stock {{compared to the}} standard features of each pig breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat. According to The Livestock Conservancy, as of 2016, three breeds of pigs are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000). They are the Choctaw, the <b>Mulefoot,</b> and the Ossabaw Island pig.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-20th century, the {{population}} began to decline, and by 1964, one breeder, R.M. Holiday of Louisiana, Missouri, established {{what would become}} the last herd of purebred <b>Mulefoot</b> hogs. He acquired stock from all known purebred breeders, and used selective breeding to maintain the breed standard. By 1976, the registries for the breed closed, and the herd books, pedigrees and other registration information was lost. In 1993, Mark Fields and the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy (later The Livestock Conservancy) began working with Holiday to re-establish the breed registry and expand breeding programs to additional farms.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mulefoot</b> pig breed {{originated}} as a landrace, but {{has been}} a standardized breed since the early 1900s. The standardized swine breeds named [...] "Landrace" [...] are not actually landraces, and often not even derived from one, but from other breeds with [...] "Landrace" [...] in their names. The Danish Landrace pig breed, pedigreed in 1896 from the actual local landrace, is the principal ancestor of the American Landrace (1930s). The Swedish Landrace {{is derived from the}} Danish and from other Scandinavian breeds, as was the British Landrace breed, which was established as late as 1950.|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{syndactyly}} with {{a variable}} number of affected feet {{was observed in}} eight black and white German Holstein calves. Analysis of the pedigree data revealed that all affected individuals could {{be traced back to}} a single founder. The pedigree was consistent with monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance and variable expressivity. Bovine syndactyly or "mulefoot" has been previously shown to map on the telomeric end of bovine chromosome 15 and we performed PCR genotyping of microsatellite markers spanning 27 cM of this chromosomal region to test the new cases for genetic linkage with the phenotype. The haplotype segregation confirmed the suggested inheritance pattern of the <b>mulefoot</b> mutation in this family and markers RM 004, BM 848 and BMS 820 showed significant linkage to the phenotype. The results confirmed the chromosomal location of the <b>mulefoot</b> gene in this pedigree. Furthermore the study demonstrated that although marker testing has been available for nearly a decade the use of <b>mulefoot</b> carriers in cattle breeding remains uncontrolled. The presented family provides a resource for positional cloning of the causative mutation...|$|E
40|$|Twelve animals {{affected}} with syndactyly or <b>mulefoot</b> were sampled in the Dutch black-and-white cattle population. Analysis of {{the pedigree}} data reveal {{that all of}} these individuals traced back to a single acknowledged carrier founder individual. Between seven and nine generations separated the founder from its 12 affected descendents. The 12 affected offspring were genotyped for a battery of 213 microsatellites spanning the 29 bovine autosomes. The resulting genotypes were analyzed using a maximum likelihood approach searching for shared homozygous haplotypes among affected individuals. Three candidate regions for the syndactyly locus emerged from this initial screening. syndactyly was shown to map to one of these candidate regions on chromosome 15 by genotyping 29 additional individuals linking founder and affected offspring and performing a conventional linkage analysis with the LINKAGE programs. This study illustrates the potential of identity-by-descent mapping in livestock populations. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Isolated {{syndactyly}} in cattle, {{also known}} as <b>mulefoot,</b> is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with variable penetrance in different cattle breeds. Recently, two independent mutations in the bovine LRP 4 gene have been reported as {{the primary cause of}} syndactyly in the Holstein and Angus cattle breeds. Results We confirmed the previously described LRP 4 exon 33 two nucleotide substitution in most of the affected Holstein calves and revealed additional evidence for allelic heterogeneity by the identification of four new LRP 4 non-synonymous point mutations co-segregating in Holstein, German Simmental and Simmental-Charolais families. Conclusion We confirmed a significant role of LRP 4 mutations in the pathogenesis of congenital syndactyly in cattle. The newly detected missense mutations in the LRP 4 gene represent independent mutations affecting different conserved protein domains. However, the four newly described LRP 4 mutations do still not explain all analyzed cases of syndactyly. </p...|$|E
