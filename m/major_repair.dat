5|$|<b>Major</b> <b>repair</b> {{work was}} done in 2003 and 2006, when the Victorian {{drainage}} culvert was replaced and the track lowered to allow access for larger passenger and freight stock {{at a cost of}} £10million. The 16 closed airshafts were deteriorating and had to be re-capped. In 2003 the excavated material from the works was recycled to shore up the railway embankment near Castley.|$|E
5|$|Coins of both Carausius and Allectus {{have been}} {{discovered}} buried in {{the foundations of the}} fort's walls. A later coin of 330–335 was found under a tower in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> or reconstruction around that time. The usurpers had inherited an existing system of coastal defence – the earlier Saxon Shore forts – and may have decided to augment it with the construction of Pevensey Castle and its close contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle).|$|E
5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm went to Kiel after {{returning}} from the expedition to China, where on 14 August Konteradmiral Fischel raised his flag aboard the ship. She {{was assigned to the}} I Squadron as the second command flagship for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises were interrupted by the visit from Nicholas II of Russia, who came aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. After the maneuvers, Fischel was replaced by Konteradmiral Curt von Prittwitz und Gaffron on 24 October. In late 1901, the fleet went on a cruise to Norway, during which Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm stopped in Oslo. During the months of December, January, and February, the ship was in drydock for <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> work.|$|E

5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated it from {{him and told him}} that they would not continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|In 1684, the government, through Governor General Gabriel Curuscalegui, {{approved}} {{the collection of}} a tribute for five years {{for the sole purpose}} of constructing a stone church. The foundation was laid in 1732 during the term of Father Fernando Haro, but it burned down in 1739. It was begun again, and the construction of the church finished in 1767 with the addition of a tower in 1777. The image of Our Lady of Turumba was unveiled in 1788. In 1840, Father Joaquin de Coria repaired the church, but because of a fire in 1851 which ravaged most of the town, Father Juan de Llanera fixed the damages to the church the following year. Father Juan de Dios de Villayos rebuilt the church roof and bell tower after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and the church was rebuilt again in 1883 by Father Paulino Camba. Damaged by the earthquake of 1937, it was repaired again by Father Federico Diaz Pines with the help of the Confederation of United Catholics (Kapisanang Unidad Catolica). During World War II, the church suffered damage and was later renovated. A <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> was done from 1980 to 1984, when a story of the bell tower was rebuilt and the ceiling was renovated under the Parish Council of the Laity.|$|E

25|$|The {{settlement}} soon grew as a deep-water port, specialising {{at first}} in ship repairs; indeed, before {{the construction of}} the Panama Canal, Port Stanley was a <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> stop for ships travelling through the Straits of Magellan. The rough waters and intense storms found {{at the tip of the}} continent forced many ships to Stanley Harbour, and the ship repair industry helped to drive the island economy.

25|$|The new and {{slightly}} larger St James, built of weatherboard and battens, was dedicated in 1878.

Three 60-gun ships were rebuilt to this specification during the early 1720s - the Plymouth, Canterbury and Windsor - while the Dreadnought underwent a <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> amounting to a rebuild and a fifth ship - the Sunderland - was replaced by new construction. In the late 1720s, six new 60-gun ships were rebuilt to replace obsolete 50-gun ships - the Deptford, Pembroke, Tilbury, Warwick, Swallow and Centurion (the last-named to a somewhat broader specification), while the 60-gun Dunkirk was likewise rebuilt. A slightly lengthened ship - the Rippon - was built in 1730–1735.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century the northern portico was built, in 1823 the cemetery and stone fence around the church was removed. In the years 1903-1904 church tower was rebuilt in Neo - Gothic style by the architect F. Schulek. Interior modifications in 1914 and in the thirties were focused on exchanging the floor. That time the monochrome painting of architectural stone elements were mechanically removed. In the fifties windows of the south nave and presbytery were filed with new stained glass windows. The floor was paved with travertine tiles, the phonics and the new Cross Way lit from behind from stained glass was installed.

25|$|On March 15, 2015, a fire engulfed the convent's tallest bell tower, which pinnacles at {{height of}} 72 meters. The monastery had been {{undergoing}} <b>major</b> <b>repair</b> work and {{was covered in}} scaffolding. It took firefighters almost three hours {{to put out the}} fire. The blaze reportedly affected an area of three hundred square metres, but it was restricted to the scaffolding and didn't do any damage to the historical building itself. The speculated cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by heat guns used for drying the facade. The press service for the Moscow cultural heritage department has blamed the fire on the firm doing the restoration work. However, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Grigory Pirumov said that heat guns were not in use on the territory of the convent and the bell tower had been disconnected from the mains power supply.|$|E
