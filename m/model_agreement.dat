5000|$|PROSESS (Protein Structure Evaluation Suite & Server) is a freely {{available}} {{web server}} for protein structure validation. [...] It is {{specifically designed to}} assist with the process of evaluating and validating protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy. Structure validation is a particularly important component of the structure determination pipeline as many protein structures have small structural errors (i.e. distorted bond lengths or angles, incompatible torsion angles, overlapping atoms) that are not easily detected by visual inspection. For protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy, where large numbers of structures are generated and where coordinate inaccuracies are common, this problem is particularly acute. Most NMR-based structure validation protocols primarily use NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement), J-coupling or residual dipolar coupling (RDC [...] ) data to assess or validate structures. In particular, they try to assess the agreement between the experimentally observed and the calculated NOEs, RDCs and/or J-couplings. Good agreement between the calculated and observed parameters normally indicates a good structure. Other methods for structure validation (such as ProCheck, MolProbity, ResProx and VADAR) focus on measuring coordinate data, rather than experimental data, to assess the quality of the bond or torsion angle geometry. PROSESS is unique among structure validation servers in that it evaluates both coordinate quality and experimental data quality. Furthermore PROSESS is also able to use NMR chemical shifts (as well as NOEs) to assess or validate protein structures. Chemical shifts are easily and very precisely measurable NMR observables that provide {{a great deal of information}} about protein structure and dynamics (see Protein Chemical Shift Prediction). Specifically, PROSESS assesses the agreement between observed chemical shifts and ShiftX-predicted HA, CA, CB, N, C, and HN NMR chemical shifts. In addition to its ability to validate structures using chemical shifts, PROSESS also checks many other protein structure parameters including covalent bond quality, non-covalent bond and atomic packing quality, torsion angle quality and NOE quality (i.e. measuring the <b>model</b> <b>agreement</b> with NOE-based distance restraints). A total of 8 different programs (see PROSESS sub-programs below) are used in the PROSESS evaluation and validation process. PROSESS generates a richly detailed and very colorful structure validation report, including tables, color-coded images and graphs or bar charts. Many of the tables contain embedded hyperlinks to additional details or carefully written explanations. For most all of its graphs and charts, PROSESS uses a simple RAG (red, amber, green) color scheme to indicate the quality of different structure parameters for the protein (as a whole), for different members of the structure ensemble, for specific residues and for specific atoms. Different shades of red indicate serious problems, different shades of yellow or amber indicate potential problems and different shades of green indicate that the protein model or its residues/atoms are free of problems. Each color is also assigned a number (ranging from 0 to 9 -- with 0 being bad and 9 being excellent) so that the structure quality assessment is more quantifiable. PROSESS’s quality indices and quality color scales have been designed specifically to help non-structural biologists to more easily and rapidly understand protein structure validation reports. In addition to being able to validate NMR protein structures, PROSESS can be used to validate or evaluate any protein model, regardless of how it was solved (X-ray, NMR, comparative modelling, etc.). The PROSESS webserver is located at http://www.prosess.ca ...|$|E

40|$|Dependency parsing {{has been}} shown to improve NLP systems in certain {{languages}} and in many cases helps achieve state of the art results in NLP applications, in particular applications for free word order languages. Morphologically rich languages are often short on training data or require much higher amounts of training data due to the increased size of their lexicon. This paper examines a new approach for addressing morphologically rich languages with little training data to start. Using Tamil as our test language, we create 9 dependency parse models with a limited amount of training data. Using these models we train an SVM classifier using only the <b>model</b> <b>agreements</b> as features. We use this SVM classifier on an edge by edge decision to form an ensemble parse tree. Using only <b>model</b> <b>agreements</b> as features allows this method to remain language independent and applicable {{to a wide range of}} morphologically rich languages. We show a statistically significant 5. 44 % improvement over the average dependency model and a statistically significant 0. 52 % improvement over the best individual system. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Convention has two parts. Whereas {{the first}} part {{contains}} the legally binding regulations of the treaties, the second part lists a series of ‘model agreements’, both for the inter-state and the local levels, as options for possible CBC arrangements. This {{latter part of the}} convention is intended for guidance only and has no treaty value. The legally binding obligation the Convention puts on the signatory states is to facilitate cross-border cooperation between territorial authorities and to promote the conclusion of agreements that may prove necessary for this purpose (art. 1). Furthermore, the contracting parties commit to encourage any initiative by territorial authorities inspired by the <b>model</b> <b>agreements</b> listed in part two of the Convention. At the same time, the fulfilment of these obligations is subject to a number of clauses. CBC shall not alter the existing powers of the territorial authorities as they are defined in the respective domestic legal orders. The signatory states are also allowed to exclude certain types of authorities from the scope of the Convention. These clauses mean that the fulfilment of the international law Convention is always limited by national law.The second part of the Convention contains various optional ‘model agreements’, grouped in two categories, i.e. inter-state agreements on the one hand, and contracts between local authorities, on the other. The proposed <b>model</b> <b>agreements</b> provide possible frameworks for varying degrees of co-operation which were drafted according to actually existing CBC treaties and arrangements, such as the 1974 treaty between Luxembourg and the German Land Rheinland-Pfalz. For instance, the <b>model</b> <b>agreements</b> listed under art. 1.4 and 1.5 were inspired by the such as the 1974 treaty between Luxembourg and the German Land Rheinland-Pfalz Subsequently, they informed a series of further inter-state treaties, enabling local authorities to participate in private and public law CBC initiatives.|$|R

40|$|Models used {{to predict}} species’ {{potential}} distributions {{have been described as}} either correlative or mechanistic. We attempted to determine whether correlative models could perform as well as mechanistic models for predicting species potential distributions, using a case study. We compared potential distribution predictions made for a coastal dune plant (Scaevola plumieri) along the coast of South Africa, using a mechanistic model based on summer water balance (SWB), and two correlative models (a profile and a group discrimination technique). The profile technique was based on principal components analysis (PCA) and the group-discrimination technique was based on multiple logistic regression (LR). Kappa (κ) statistics were used to objectively assess model performance and <b>model</b> <b>agreement.</b> Model performance was calculated by measuring the levels of agreement (using κ) between a set of testing localities (distribution records not used for model building) and each of the model predictions. Using published interpretive guidelines for the kappa statistic, model performance was “excellent” for the SWB model (κ= 0. 852), perfect for the LR model (κ= 1. 000), and “very good” for the PCA model (κ= 0. 721). <b>Model</b> <b>agreement</b> was calculated by measuring the level of agreement between the mechanistic model and the two correlative models. There was “good” <b>model</b> <b>agreement</b> between the SWB and PCA models (κ= 0. 679) and “very good” agreement between the SWB and LR models (κ= 0. 786). The results suggest that correlative models can perform as well as or better than simple mechanistic models. The predictions generated from these three modelling designs are likely to generate different insights into the potential distribution and biology of the target organism and may be appropriate in different situations. The choice of model is likely to be influenced by the aims of the study, the biology of the target organism, the level of knowledge the target organism’s biology, and data quality...|$|E
