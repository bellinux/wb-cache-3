5|$|The President of Croatia {{is elected}} for a five-year term by a direct vote of all {{citizens}} in a <b>majority</b> <b>system,</b> requiring runoff elections if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of {{votes in the}} first round. Members of Parliament are elected for a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, with additional members elected in special constituencies reserved for the Croatian diaspora and national minorities. As of November 2011, legislation provides for the election of 151 members of the unicameral parliament (including three representatives of the Croatian diaspora and eight representatives of national minorities). Out of 31 political parties which won seats in Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1990, only six have won ten seats or more in any one parliamentary election. Those were the Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Peasant Party, the Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats, the Croatian Social Liberal Party, Social Democratic Party of Croatia and the Bridge of Independent Lists. The county prefects, city/town mayors and municipality presidents are elected for four-year term {{by a majority of}} votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city/town and municipal councils are elected for a four-year term through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} impact of winning and losing in {{parliamentary}} systems on protest behavior. I argue that losers in parliamentary systems with single party, majority governments are more likely to protest than losers in systems with coalition governments. In the empirical analysis, I provide support for my argument using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) survey from 2001 to 2006. The results suggest that losers in single party, <b>majority</b> <b>systems</b> were more likely to protest than their counterparts in coalition systems. In addition, while it is unclear whether winning and losing had an effect on protest behavior in coalition systems, losers in single party, <b>majority</b> <b>systems</b> were more likely to protest than winners...|$|R

50|$|A {{referendum}} on the electoral system was held in Slovenia on 8 December 1996. Voters were given three options to approve or not; a compensatory system, a two-round <b>majority</b> <b>system</b> and a proportional representation system at a national level. Due to the low turnout of 37.9%, none of the proposals crossed the legal threshold {{and the results were}} invalidated. However, in 1998 the results were revisited by the Constitutional Court, who found that the two round <b>majority</b> <b>system</b> had been approved.|$|E

50|$|When {{the first}} Grand Coalition (1966-1969) took office, there were strong tendencies within both major parties, CDU and SPD, to abandon {{proportional}} representation which had existed/had been applied since {{the foundation of}} the German Federal Republic in 1949. Instead, they suggested implementing the <b>majority</b> vote <b>system.</b> These plans were even part of the coalition agreement. The smaller FDP which has no chance of winning the majority in an election district, protested because the implementation of this voting system would have threatened its further existence. Ultimately, however, the introduction of the <b>majority</b> vote <b>system</b> failed because large parts of the SPD were convinced that it would not have meant better prospects of power. Paul Lücke (CDU), Federal Minister of the Interior, resigned from office on April 2, 1968.

Each voter is rational and picks the candidate that maximizes her expected utility, which results from the balancing of her preferences and beliefs about the pivot-probabilities. Candidate positioning is endogenous and the result of a Nash game. The possible equilibria are computed for plurality and runoff <b>majority</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
