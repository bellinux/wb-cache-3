40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>cranes</b> are {{important}} loading/unloading equipment in use at ports for transferring goods to/from marine vessels {{such as a}} merchantman. One {{of the most important}} design decision criteria for <b>marine</b> <b>cranes</b> is to ensure that the stress magnitudes remain below the maximum allowable stress values on the crane’s structural members during their operation. However, a full scale test to investigate such loading during design validation may be a very expensive practice or almost impossible. Therefore, it is considered more practicable to work with scale models to investigate stress distributions and likely deformations physically. This study presents stress analysis for a sample <b>marine</b> <b>crane’s</b> boom, which is originally designed with a boom length of 9 m using experimental and numerical methods. To enable the experimental part of the study, a 1 : 10 scale model of a sample <b>marine</b> <b>crane’s</b> boom has been considered. Strain measurement techniques (using strain-gauges) were utilised for the experimental stress measurement of the scale model. Finite Element Method (FEM) as a numerical method was used to map and simulate stress distribution on the scaled boom structure. The results showed that significant information about stress distribution on the crane members could be obtained from FEM simulation. A good correlation between experimental and simulation values of stresses were observed until the boom’s plastic deformation failure...|$|R

Safe and efficient <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> operations are challenging under adverse environmental conditions. System testing and operation training on physical systems and prototypes are time-consuming and costly. The development of virtual simulators alleviates the shortcomings with physical systems by providing 3 D visualization and force {{feedback to the}} operator. Currently, haptic technology has limited applications in heavy industries, due to the system stability and safety {{issues related to the}} remote control of large manipulators. As a result, a novel 6 -DoF haptic device was developed for crane operations allowing for a larger workspace range and higher stiffness. The employment of the haptic device enlarges the interaction scope of the virtual simulator by sending feedback forces to the operator. In the case study, simulations of <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> anti-sway control suggested that the load sway time and amplitude were reduced with force feedback.

The 3 D visualization of <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> operations on DP vessels in OSOM will be developed in GLview. In the filed of marine operations, especially for the subsea technologies for Oil and Gas industry which is highly rely on the Platform Supply Vessel (PSV) or Offshore Construction Vessel (OSV). These vessels are equipped with <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> system or winch system that can provide heavy lifting operation for the subsea constructions. The OSOM platform emphasizes on the interconnected behavior of the vessel and the equipment on board, as well as the environmental loads, such as wave load, current load and wind load during the operations. This is because the equipment on board and the DP vessel will have significant impact on the dynamic behavior between each other. This thesis mainly focus on <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> and its sub-systems on the DP vessel, and set a framework for modelling, simulation and analysis of the dynamics of rigid body systems through Lagrange method and bond-graph approach. Based on this framework, many sub-systems such as actuators, hydrodynamics and controllers can be interfaced. In addition, in order to build an efficient and handy marine operation simulator, the visualization of the model is very important.

40|$|In this thesis, {{simulation}} models for a knuckleboom crane and its winch system have been developed. The {{simulation models}} {{have been used to}} design model based control laws for positioning the orientation of the crane joints and for softly landing its cargo. The control law for positioning the crane has been implemented and tested in an experimental crane lab at the department of marine technology at NTNU. As part of this process, the lab has been improved with a new set of sensors, filters and hands-on control systems. The simulation model of the crane has been based upon the physical crane in the lab and was derived using Lagrangian mechanics and modelling procedures for robotic manipulators. The model was derived by treating the crane as a system of linked rigid bodies and includes the weight of the actuator, but not their dynamics. The load of the crane was modelled as a constant weight acting {{at the tip of the}} crane. Simulation studies of the model has shown that the crane behaves as an undamped, double gravity pendulum when not influenced by external forces, or with limitations imposed on the joint angles. The control law for positioning the crane joints was designed using the crane simulation model and the non-linear backstepping technique. The procedure yielded a globally asymptotic stable control law for the system. When the control law was tested with the crane simulation model it was able to follow a ramp reference signal lifting and lowering the crane arms and perform heave compensation with the upper arm, with a load of 16 attached to the tip. Testing the control law in the <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> lab revealed that the crane was able to follow ramp reference signals and perform heave compensation with the upper arm, without an attached load. However, the lower arm was not able to lift a load of 6 when using a wire with a diameter of 1. 7. The actuator motor drew full current, but was not able to move the arm. This was most likely due to increased resistance caused by using a thin wire or by the friction profile of the actuator. The simulation model of the winch has been used to design a control law for softly landing crane cargo. The control law was designed by defining the control objective as tracking, where the wire velocity should follow a desired speed profile. Simulation results have shown that the control law achieved the objective with good accuracy. The lab has been improved with new gyroscopes that fits the velocity range of the crane and accelerometers that have been attached to the mass centres of the lower and upper crane arm. The accelerometers have been used to measure the absolute orientation of the crane by calculating their orientation relative to the gravitational axis. A low-pass filter has been designed to remove high frequency components from the gyroscope measurements and a Kalman filter to remove noise from the accelerometer and estimate gyro bias. In addition, the crane's winch has been finished and a simple hands on-control system for controlling the winch speed has been implemented. Meaning that the state of the <b>marine</b> <b>crane</b> lab has been improved and that the process of implementing model based controllers simplified...|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the systems}} {{considering}} wave synchronization in the literature are concerned with moon pool operations. The objective of this thesis is to transition the existing knowledge from some of that work into <b>marine</b> <b>cranes</b> working {{over the side of}} the vessel. This aim is mainly motivated by the fact that cranes working {{over the side of the}} vessel are more versatile. They can be used for more comprehensive and differently shaped objects. In addition, vessels with cranes mounted this way are more flexible since the moon pool configuration consumes a considerable amount of deck space. The main contribution of this thesis is a consideration of the transition from cranes lifting through a moon pool to cranes lifting over the side of the vessel. This includes consideration of the roll and pitch motion of the vessel, as well as simulating the complete system with wave synchronization control. The system is also simulated without any motion compensation for comparison. The degrees of freedom (DOFs) available for motion compensation control in different crane configurations are discussed, and some comments are made on how the actuators may cooperate in order to achieve better motion compensation. It is found that nothing obstructs the use of control algorithms originally developed for moon pool cranes for cranes working over the side of a vessel. The behaviour {{of the systems}} is roughly equal in the two cases, and the physical aspects are the same regarding wave elevation, still water level, and wire behaviour. There is however, one aspect to consider when designing overboard cranes, and that is the response time needed for following the wave elevation with the payload. When the payload is lifted over the side of the vessel, the roll and pitch motions affect the movement of the crane tip. In the worst case scenario, a wave can have a velocity directed upward, while the crane tip has a velocity directed downward. If this is the case, a faster motion compensation system is needed than for the moon pool applications. </p...|$|R
