If you recycle even your own sets, and use them again, that's going to save <b>money.</b> <b>You</b> don't have to buy new lumber. So there are cost savings, absolutely." [...] Additionally, the production team aims to reduce vehicle idling, which decreases carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

[...] She was also noted for a strong personality, as her friend, Hermann Bleibtreu of the University of Arizona explained: [...] "If she was in any position of leadership or power, she was dominant." [...] She became a strong environmentalist, donating to conservation, environmental, and aquaculture research. She supported renewable energy, smart growth, and water conservation, and promoted reform of state land management. She also helped Defenders of Wildlife preserve the Aravaipa Canyon. Carl Hodges, of the University of Arizona's Environmental Research Lab, stated, [...] "she was as fine and intellectually competent an environmentalist as anybody I'd ever known." ...|$|E

500|$|Married to the {{daughter}} of the lord of Pont Audemer, Neville died around 1176. After his death, the monks of Battle Abbey petitioned the king to have Neville's body buried at their monastery, perhaps hoping through this action to secure some of Neville's estate. The king is supposed to have replied [...] "I will have his <b>money,</b> <b>you</b> can have his body, the demons of hell his soul. Neville had at least four sons – Ives, Thomas, Ralph, and Geoffrey. Neville may have been the father of Alan de Neville, who was a royal justice. [...] Hugh de Neville, who was chief forest justice under Kings Richard I, John, and Henry III, was probably the grandson of the Chief Forester, the son of Ralph. Neville was succeeded in office by Thomas fitzBernard.|$|E

Rose had halted the show several times to calm the audience. From then on, he became known for personally addressing disruptive fans and giving instructions to security personnel from the stage, at times stopping concerts to deal with issues in the crowd. In 1992, Rose stated, [...] "Most performers {{would go to a}} security person in their organization, and it would just be done very quietly. I'll confront the person, stop the song: 'Guess what: You wasted your <b>money,</b> <b>you</b> get to leave.'" [...] As a result of the deaths at Monsters of Rock, the festival was canceled the following year.|$|E

[...] But this originality does not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: [...] "Just once, I'd like to make the kind of <b>money</b> <b>you</b> do." [...] His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design. Pei refers to his own [...] "analytical approach" [...] when explaining the lack of a [...] "Pei School". [...] "For me," [...] he said, [...] "the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements... to arrive at an ideal balance among them." ...|$|E

A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns, who were in last place {{at the time of}} his release. His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner Donald Barnes. On July15, Hornsby won $35,000 ($ today) from betting on a horse race. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, Barnes refused it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested to Barnes, [...] "The money is as good as the <b>money</b> <b>you</b> take from people in the loan-shark business. It's better than taking interest from widows and orphans... "; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes. Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a [...]321batting average and 18hits in 20games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.|$|E
500|$|That August, Brownlee {{received}} a letter from MacLean reading in part [...] "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." [...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I {{want to tell you that}} the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its <b>money</b> <b>you</b> are after, I haven't got it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{basic premise}} of the episode, {{as well as the}} design of Peter's panic room, are based on the movie Panic Room. When Peter's Paleolithic {{ancestor}} is attempting to market the wheel, Brian tells him [...] "You so <b>money,</b> <b>you</b> don't even know it", a reference to the film Swingers. His ancestor says [...] "Let's party like it's 9" [...] in reference to the Prince song [...] "1999." [...] The story of Nate Griffin, an ancestor of Peter, makes references to the first installment of Roots, as well as the LAPD's low-speed pursuit of O. J. Simpson following his wife's murder and the song [...] "Hot for Teacher". Nate Griffin {{is a member of the}} tribe of Tootie-and-Blair, a reference to The Facts of Life. The scene in which the slave ship captain is thrown overboard uses the song [...] "Are You Ready For the Summer?" [...] from the film Meatballs. The story about Peter's ancestor who was a silent film star is a spoof of Singin' in the Rain, as the girl in Singin' in the Rain did not have a good voice for the talking pictures. His speaking voice, deemed unacceptable for talkies, was a spoof of Bobcat Goldthwait.|$|E

Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much <b>money.</b> <b>You</b> have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the <b>money</b> <b>you</b> could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E
