40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} human hair {{is determined by the}} interaction of trichocyte alpha keratin protein, matrix, and disulfide bonds crosslinking. Much effort has been spent to understand the link between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic fiber properties. Here we apply a mesoscopic coarse-grained model of the keratin <b>macrofilament</b> fibril combined with an analytical solution based on the concept of entropic hyperelasticity of the protein helix to investigate the link between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic properties of keratin fibers. The mesoscopic model provides good agreement {{with a wide range of}} experimental results. Based on the mesoscopic model, the predicted stress–strain curve of hair fibers agrees well with our own experimental measurements. The disulfide crosslink between the microfibril–matrix and matrix–matrix contributes to the initial modulus and provides stiffening at larger deformation of the trichocyte keratin fibers. The results show that the disulfide bonds reinforce the <b>macrofilament</b> and enhance the robustness of the <b>macrofilament</b> b...|$|E
40|$|Cultural and {{molecular}} approaches {{were used to}} analyse the microbial assemblages associated to the deep-sea hydrothermal vent polychaete worms of the family Alvinellidae. In a {{first part of the}} work, the populations associated to three alvinellid species from the Juan de Fuca Ridge (paralvinella palmiformis, paralvinella pandorae and paralvinella sulfincola) were identified by phylogenetic analyses. A wide microbial diversity was detected, like a great number of new sequences or of sequences belonging to species previously unidentified at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. All the libraries were found to be dominated by sequences affiliated to the e-Proteobacteria. In others respects, fermentative micro-organisms belonging to the Thermococcale, the Thermotogales, the CFB and the Firmicutes were isolated. Autotrophic bacteria reducing sulphur and/or nitrates and belonging to the e-Proteobacteria or to the genus Desulfurobacterium were isolated. Three miro-organisms,have been characterised : Caminicella sporogenes, Desulfurobacterium crinifex and Caminibacter hydrogeniphilus. In {{the last part of the}} work, ultrastructural and chemical anlyses of the atypical <b>macrofilaments</b> formed in culture by desulfurobacterium crinifex were performed. Finally, in situ colonisation experiments of new surfaces were performed in alvinellid habitat. The microbial cohort preceding the Alvinella spp. settlement and the populations associated to these polychaetes were analysed using cultural and phytogenetic approaches. Thermal and chemical conditions were monitored during the colonisation process. Based on our results, it would seem that the formation of a microbial mat would be necessary to the alvinellid settlement. BREST-BU Droit-Sciences-Sports (290192103) / SudocPLOUZANE-Bibl.
