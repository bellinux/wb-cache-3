In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she <b>might</b> <b>really</b> enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

John von Neumann had mastered three methods." [...] He {{went on to explain}} that the three methods were: ...|$|E
500|$|After House violates {{one of the}} {{conditions}} set by Cuddy, Amber informs the team of House's ruse of faking syphilis. This discovery leads Kutner to suspect that Jeff's actual, positive syphilis result <b>might</b> <b>really</b> {{be the result of}} a parasite called Chagas' disease, which he contracted while working in the jungles of Costa Rica years ago. The diagnosis is confirmed: the parasite embedded itself in Jeff's brain during his stay in the country, thus causing the shift in his personality and giving him the inability to be angry. At the end of the episode the only evident change is that the patient says he now does not like ketchup, although he does wonder aloud to his wife, [...] "I wonder what else I don't like," [...] which appears to make her anxious.|$|E

Lustick argued that people who assume Israel will persist as a Zionist project should consider how quickly the Soviet, Pahlavi Iranian, apartheid South African, Baathist Iraqi and Yugoslavian states unraveled. Lustick concludes that while it may not arise without [...] "painful stalemates", a one-state solution may {{be a way to}} eventual Palestinian independence.|$|E

This delayed the sentence for five years, but Reis was finally tried in May 1930. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In prison, Reis converted to Protestantism and converted other prisoners. He was released in May 1945, and was offered, but refused, a job as a bank employee.

2500|$|Examination of {{excavated}} fragments {{shows the}} fired clay {{body is a}} light grey colour, sometimes compared to the colour of incense ash. Although stoneware by Western criteria (not a category recognised in traditional Chinese thinking), the wares are fired at a relatively low temperature, and are far from fully vitrified, absorbing water at a [...] "fairly high" [...] rate. Nor is the body free from flaws when examined under magnification. Since it was almost entirely covered by glaze, these issues did not detract from the wares. [...] Some authorities note that the body <b>might</b> <b>really</b> be considered earthenware, though it is always classified by Western writers as stoneware, because of the other Northern Celadons it relates to, and in Chinese terms as porcelain.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1998, a {{young woman}} {{standing}} at a Los Angeles bus stop was taken at knife point to a deserted parking lot and raped by an unknown assailant. A bagel shop manager, Luis Vargas, {{was arrested and charged}} with this crime and with assaults on two other young women. Despite the fact that coworkers at the bagel shop placed him there at the time of the rape (which occurred 20 miles away), based upon ambiguous and contradictory identifications made by the three women, and upon a prior conviction for raping a former girlfriend, Vargas was convicted of the crimes. Vargas stated at the time of his sentencing to 55 years to life in prison on December 7, 1999, [...] "As far as I’m concerned, [...] individual [...] really did these crimes <b>might</b> <b>really</b> be raping someone out there, <b>might</b> <b>really</b> be killing someone out there." [...] Vargas' prophecy proved correct, as rapes and other assaults on women with a similar modus operandi continued to take place, not only after Vargas was sentenced, but even during the time between his arrest and conviction. The CIP became interested in Vargas' case in 2011, when Vargas sent the organization press clippings about recent assaults similar to those of 1998, which were attributed to a serial attacker known as the [...] "Teardrop Rapist." [...] The CIP requested that the clothes of the 1998 rape victim be examined for DNA, using technology not available at the time. The DNA samples did not match Vargas' DNA... but did match DNA taken from recent victims whose attacker matched the profile of the Teardrop Rapist. In September 2015, Vargas was exonerated of the crimes for which he had served nearly 16 years in prison. It was the CIP's third DNA exoneration and its 20th overall. Vargas is currently engaged in a civil suit against the Los Angeles Police Department, prosecutors and others, claiming that exonerating evidence was withheld at his original trial. Vargas' case was noted in an article citing the record number of exonerations that occurred in 2015.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{military}} {{was well aware}} of the dangers posed by German artillery dominating the Dover Strait and on 4 September 1940 the Chief of Naval Staff issued a memo stating that if the Germans [...] "…could get possession of the Dover defile and capture its gun defences from us, then, holding these points {{on both sides of the}} Straits, they would be in a position largely to deny those waters to our naval forces". Should the Dover defile be lost, he concluded, the Royal Navy could do little to interrupt the flow of German supplies and reinforcements across the Channel, at least by day, and he further warned that [...] "…there <b>might</b> <b>really</b> be a chance that they (the Germans) might be able to bring a serious weight of attack to bear on this country".

This is the basic, post-Roman view of Arthur as a battle-hardened warlord.|$|R
