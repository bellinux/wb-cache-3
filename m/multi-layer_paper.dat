The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate pre-packing cooling and types of packages in the maintenance of the physiological quality of soybean seeds during storage. The completely randomized experimental design was used, with four replications, considering a factorial arrangement involving or not the pre-packing cooling of the seed mass, three types of packages (<b>multi-layer</b> <b>paper</b> bag, big bag, and polyethylene container), and five storing periods (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 months). The physiological quality was evaluated by the tests of first germination count, germination, accelerated aging, electrical conductivity, emergence speed index and emergence. The use of packages with larger amount of seeds (big bag and polyethylene container) did not favor the maintenance of the pre-packing cooling temperature. The types of packages did not show significant differences in the seeds viability during storage, up to eight months, regardless the pre-packing cooling. The cultivars seeds showed different tolerance to storing, i. e. seeds of the cultivar TMG 1176 had lower storing potential comparing to the seeds from the cultivar SYN 9074...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work was to study the effect of storage in a climatized environment on the physiologic quality of hybrid of sorghum seeds harvested with different moisture contents and submitted to storage, in Uberlândia-MG. The seeds used were collected in a commercial seed production field of Monsanto Brasil Ltd., in the cropping season 2002 / 2003. The samples were placed in <b>multi-layer</b> <b>paper</b> bags, stored in a climatized warehouse at the processing unit of Monsanto Brasil Ltd. The experimental design was randomized blocks with split plots on time. The experiment had seed samples harvested with four moisture contents (20 %, 18 %, 14 % and 11 %) and four storage times (beginning of storage, 10, 22 and 28 months). The changes on seed physiologic quality were evaluated by germination test (normal or abnormal seedlings), cold test (vigour). Also, the moisture content of the seeds was analyzed during storage. From the results, {{it can be concluded}} that: a) as harvest proceeded with greater moisture contents, the physiologic quality of these seeds decreased; b) seed physiologic quality decreased significantly; however, the germination percentage remained within the commercialization standard until 28 months.

As amostras das parcelas foram acondicionadas em sacos de papel multifoliados e armazenadas em armazém climatizado (temperatura de 10 ºC e umidade relativa de 50 %) na unidade de beneficiamento da Monsanto do Brasil Ltda. O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos casualizados com parcelas subdivididas no tempo.

Estudou-se a umidade das sementes durante o armazenamento e as alterações na qualidade fisiológica das sementes, utilizando-se os testes de germinação e de frio.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{non-contact}} method for simultaneous measurement of thermal conductivity and diffusivity of anisotropic materials. This method could be applied to biological materials. Three-dimensional transient heat conduction equation in an anisotropic solid is solved numerically when the solid surface is heated locally. Then, the time variations of non-dimensional average surface temperature are obtained as a master plot, which depend on the ratio of thermal conductivities in x-, y-direction E_ (=λ_y/λ_x). In experiment, the surface of an anisotropic sample is heated locally by the laser beam and the surface temperature profiles are measured by an infrared thermometer. The measured temperature variations are compared with the numerical ones to yield the thermal conductivity and diffusivity in x-direction λ_x, α_x and the ratio E_ simultaneously. To confirm the applicability and the accuracy of the present measuring method, are used the <b>multi-layered</b> <b>paper</b> and vinyl chloride resin film as the samples with known thermophysical properties.

In [25], Chen et al. first raised a novel RDHEI method with public key cryptography by dividing a pixel into two parts: LSB and the rest. Image owner encrypted these two parts with Paillier mechanism and transmitted them to data hider. In this way, the transmitted data in size will be twice of the directly encrypted image. One bit can be embedded in encrypted domain by modifying magnitude relationships between the encrypted LSB values of two adjacent pixels with homomorphic multiplication. Since the magnitude relationships can not be kept for the corresponding ciphertexts, the hidden data cannot be extracted before decryption. Aiming at retrieving the hidden data in encrypted domain, Zhang et al. proposed a new reversible data hiding algorithm with public key cryptosystem [26] by using a pre-procession operation to shrink histogram of original image to vacate room for data hiding.
