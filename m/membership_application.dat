5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the <b>membership</b> <b>application</b> has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.|$|E

25|$|Being a mini/youth rugby club {{membership}} {{is through the}} youth players themselves; parents {{are not required to}} obtain a membership before their child can participate in rugby Although there are no adult memberships, unlike the social norm practised by a number of prominent social clubs which offer mini/youth rugby, parents get involved by taking up the role as a team manager or coach – usually in one group in which their own child plays.

25|$|Each housing {{cooperative}} {{has their own}} bylaws. The members hold annual meetings in the {{housing cooperative}}, in which they elect {{a board of directors}} that take on the responsibility of managing the cooperation during the upcoming year. In most normal-sized cooperatives the board members are recruited among the inhabitants. The board sets the monthly fee, secures proper administrative procedures, keeps the property in good condition, and may initiate large renovation projects when necessary. The board is also involved when a member sells his apartment (i.e. sells his right to inhabit the apartment) to someone else, as the board has to make decisions on allowing the exit of old members and the entry of new members. If the buyer of a bostadsrätt is found financially viable, the board has no right to turn down a <b>membership</b> <b>application.</b> The board is also involved when individual members want to initiate large renovation projects, or when individual members want to rent out the apartment to a non-member.|$|E
