50|$|There are {{two common}} designs for {{magnetic}} cartridges, moving magnet (MM) and <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> (MC) (originally called dynamic).

5000|$|With the DC switch set to its [...] "AC" [...] {{position}} and the AC switch set to [...] "DC", no current can flow through the instrument. However whenever any <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> instrument {{is likely to be}} subjected to heavy shock in transit, it is good practice to damp the movement by short circuiting the <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> using a heavy gauge wire connected across the terminals. On earlier Avometers, this may be done by short-circuiting the input terminals and selecting the most sensitive direct current range. The Model 8 Mark V, 6 & 7 were provided with an [...] "OFF" [...] position on the DC switch which both disconnected the meter's terminals and short-circuited the <b>moving</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{used with}} a DC <b>coil</b> <b>relay,</b> a flyback diode can cause delayed {{drop-out}} of the contacts when power is removed, due to the continued circulation of current in the <b>relay</b> <b>coil</b> and diode. When rapid {{opening of the contacts}} is important, a low-value resistor can be placed in series with the diode to help dissipate the coil energy faster, at the expense of higher voltage at the switch.|$|R

25|$|The D'Arsonval/Weston meter {{movement}} uses a <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> {{which carries}} a pointer and rotates on pivots or a taut band ligament. The coil rotates in a permanent magnetic field and is restrained by fine spiral springs which {{also serve to}} carry current into the <b>moving</b> <b>coil.</b> It gives proportional measurement rather than just detection, and deflection is independent of {{the orientation of the}} meter. Instead of balancing a bridge, values could be directly read off the instrument's scale, which made measurement quick and easy.|$|R

50|$|Moving magnet {{ammeters}} {{operate on}} {{essentially the same}} principle as <b>moving</b> <b>coil,</b> except that the coil is mounted in the meter case, and a permanent magnet moves the needle. Moving magnet Ammeters are able to carry larger currents than <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> instruments, often several tens of Amperes, because the coil can be made of thicker wire and the current {{does not have to}} be carried by the hairsprings.Indeed, some Ammeters of this type do not have hairsprings at all, instead using a fixed permanent magnet to provide the restoring force.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by {{engineers}} Arnold Poulsen and Axel Petersen in 1918. Initially focusing on sound film technology, Ortofon began to diversify into gramophone record playback and cutting equipment {{towards the end of}} World War II. The firm pioneered the use of <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> technology in phonograph equipment; the first cutting head based on this technology was introduced in 1945. Ortofon's first <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> magnetic cartridge, the AB model, was launched in 1948, and similar variations of that product are still manufactured today due to demand from enthusiasts.|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} thin and light diaphragm membrane, often {{only a few}} micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained {{to the top of}} the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.|$|R

The motor includes two circular joints, one {{on each side of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>coil.</b> These joints are ferrofluidic. They fulfil the guidance and centring function and the air tightness function. This structure is quite rigid. As there is no traditional suspension in this structure, the related non-linearities and hysteresis disappear...|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{uses for}} the {{galvanometer}} mechanism are in positioning and control systems. Galvanometer mechanisms are divided into moving magnet and <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> galvanometers; in addition, they are divided into closed-loop and open-loop - or resonant - types.|$|R
50|$|Sustained by {{the disk}} drive {{business}} and Informatics, Data Products began {{development of their}} first line printer. Introduced in 1963, the 3300 was a 300 line per minute drum printer that used a <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> actuator for the print hammer.|$|R
5000|$|Piezoelectric sensor {{velocity}} receivers {{are similar}} to a piezoelectric accelerometer, except that {{the output of the}} device is proportional to the velocity of the transducer. Unlike the <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> variety, piezoelectric sensors will likely require an amplifier due to the small generated signal.|$|R
40|$|Vacuum circuit {{breakers}} are the dominant technology in medium voltage distribution networks {{since they are}} environmentally friendly and maintenance free. It {{is a challenge to}} design an actuator for a vacuum circuit breaker, which achieves a high operating speed whilst maintaining high efficiency. A fast operating <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> actuator for a vacuum interrupter (VI) has been developed. An analytical model of the actuator was initially developed and then simulated using a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model. The model showed that the opening force was higher than the closing force due to asymmetry {{in the structure of the}} actuator, which resulted in a reluctance force component. The complete operating actuator prototype was built to avoid known problems such as contact popping, bounce, rebound and welding. The magnetic field distribution and the static electromagnetic force on the <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> were measured and provided a good correlation with the FE model simulation predications. The opening operation of the actuator prototype was compared for different capacitor supply voltages. A maximum velocity of 2. 3 m/s was achieved when the capacitor was charged to 150 V. The actuator demonstrated successful operation at atmospheric pressure and also in a vacuum chamber. The opening time of the actuator in the vacuum was approximately 5 ms, compared to 5. 5 ms at atmospheric pressure. We designed and built this actuator to illustrate that the <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> actuator is capable to operate the vacuum circuit breaker quickly with high efficiency. Tests showed that further design optimizations for improving the operating speed and efficiency of the <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> actuator are essential and the options have also been suggested...|$|R
