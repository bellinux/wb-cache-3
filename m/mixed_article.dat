Economic growth remained lackluster in 2004 owing to a depressed world demand for vanilla and crop, and cattle diseases. Government revenue stagnated, while wage outlays rose significantly {{on account of}} hirings associated with the new constitutional arrangements. Monetary policy remained prudent, but inflation increased slightly.

Within the Australian Army, <b>mixing</b> <b>articles</b> of uniform and civilian attire is known as mixed dress and prohibited. Removing all badges as well as the puggaree removes the hat's status as uniform and it may be worn with civilian dress.|$|R
40|$|Mixed methods {{research}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly popular approach in several areas, and {{it has long been}} called for as an approach for providing a better understanding of research problems. However, there have been no assessments as to whether such research, which may be timely and expensive, has more impact on the field. The main {{purpose of this article is}} to determine whether the use of a mixed methods approach is a predictor of article impact. The analysis is based on articles published in the Strategic Management Journal from 1980 to 2006. The findings show that <b>mixed</b> methods <b>articles</b> tend to receive more citations than monomethod articles do. The average citations received per year and the cumulating sum of citations are both higher for articles reporting studies using mixed methods than for monomethod research designs. Furthermore, a content analysis of the <b>mixed</b> methods <b>articles</b> identified shows that there are different types of studies based on several characteristics (purpose, priority, implementation, and design). All types of <b>mixed</b> methods <b>articles</b> tend to have a higher number of citations than the group of monomethod studies. Keyword...|$|R

50|$|Released at {{the start}} of the 21st century was Toxic, a comic which mixed comic strips {{alongside}} game reviews and other articles.

However The Dandy eventually moved away with this Toxic strategy in October 2010 when the comic was revamped. The BeanoMAX (which also started in 2007) also borrowed some of Toxics features.

40|$|Cultural {{histories}} of nineteenth-century Britain {{have studied the}} important physical and psychological transformations caused by the industrialization of light. Gaslight, though discovered prior to the nineteenth century, became aligned with the era’s narratives of national and industrial progress, an arc that, one might argue, culminated in {{the growing popularity of}} electric {{light at the end of}} the century. Yet, despite these new technologies of ‘artificial light’, ‘natural’ wood and coal fires remained popular in British culture. This issue explores fire as a visual and narrative technology in art, literature, and public displays by examining the ways in which it evoked competing symbolic values, such as primitivism and modernity, vitality and destruction, intimacy and spectacle. The reading order <b>mixes</b> <b>articles</b> and shorter pieces together to demonstrate the continuities of fire across various sites, including: the domestic fireside, the tallow candle, theatrical conflagrations, Turner’s fires, fireworks, funeral pyres, subterranean fire, solar fire, and a coal-ship fire...|$|R
