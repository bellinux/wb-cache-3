25|$|While many PCL players {{went on to}} play in {{the major}} leagues, teams in the league were often {{successful}} enough that they could offer competitive salaries to avoid being outbid for their players' services. Some players <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the minor leagues. One of the better known was Frank Shellenback, whose major league pitching career was brief, but who compiled a record PCL total of 295 wins against 178 losses. Many former major league players came to the PCL to finish their careers after their time in the majors had ended.|$|E
25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce Scott said PETA should apologize to Irwin's family {{and the rest of}} Australia.|$|E

500|$|San Francisco's Dead Kennedys <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{mentioning}} Reagan in {{songs like}} [...] "Moral Majority," [...] "We've Got a Bigger Problem Now," [...] "Bleed for Me," [...] {{and the track}} [...] "Kinky Sex Makes the World Go Round," [...] a spoken word piece about World War III formatted as an erotic phone call between Margaret Thatcher and Reagan's fictitious Secretary of War. [...] The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. [...] "Potshot Heard Round the World" [...] is about U.S. military actions in the Middle East, [...] "with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes." [...] Reagan plays the title role in the song, [...] "Rambozo the Clown," [...] a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist.

500|$|John L. Flynn, a Towson University English {{professor}} {{who has written extensively}} about science-fiction film, unfavorably compared Night of the Blood Beast to The Creeping Terror (1964), which was also about an astronaut returning from space with a stowaway alien creature. Although Flynn said it lacked the [...] "epic pretentiousness" [...] of that film, he nevertheless said of Blood Beast: [...] "Corman <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> making cheap knock-offs of popular films, but he seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel here". The Washington Post writer Tom Shales said [...] "it would be hard to find a worse movie" [...] and that the monster [...] "looks like the San Diego Chicken after having been tarred and feathered". Film critic and historian Steven H. Scheuer said the plot was a good idea but criticized what he called a [...] "sloppy execution". Literary and film critic John Kenneth Muir said he considered the film a failure because the monster [...] "simply could not live up to expectations once revealed". Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars with the entry: [...] "Well directed, but too low budget to succeed." [...] Night of the Blood Beast was among several films universally considered terrible that film reviewer Michael Adams watched as part of a book about his quest to find the worst film of all time. However, Adams said he enjoyed it on a B movie level, calling it [...] "cheap but enjoyable and buoyed by its ideas". John Stanley, who hosted the San Francisco television show Creature Features about science-fiction films, said Night of the Blood Beast deliberately imitated the best scenes from The Thing from Another World. Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the alien in the film [...] "looks like a human-sized parrot covered in feces" [...] and ranked it as the fifth worst movie monster of all time. However, he said that the film's idea of an alien impregnating a human being was an [...] "interesting concept," [...] noting that it was reused in Ridley Scott's Alien.|$|E

5000|$|The {{show was}} first aired in 1993, on the Israeli public Channel 1, {{formulated}} by producer Aaron Goldfinger, who envisioned {{a show in}} which political debates are taking place, {{and in the midst}} of these debates, small breaks that will include pop music, in an in-studio playing, that will be conducted by various singers and bands - and so the show was granted its name Popolitica (Pop+Politics). Within a short period of time, the show developed its characteristic format, and was regularly hosted by two veteran news and political show hosts, Nissim Mishal and later, Dan Margalit, and included the regular following [...] "panel": journalist Tommy Lapid (later <b>made</b> <b>a</b> political <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of his [...] "stardom" [...] as [...] "panelist" [...] of the show), journalist Amnon Dankner, and Haredi journalist Yisrael Eichler (also later <b>made</b> <b>a</b> political <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of his [...] "panelist" [...] role).

2500|$|Gladwell's {{critics have}} {{described}} him as prone to oversimplification. The New Republic called the final chapter of Outliers, [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking" [...] and said Gladwell believes [...] "a perfect anecdote proves a fatuous rule". Gladwell has also been criticized for his emphasis on anecdotal evidence over research to support his conclusions. Maureen Tkacik and Steven Pinker have challenged the integrity of Gladwell's approach. Even while praising Gladwell's writing style and content, Pinker summed up Gladwell as [...] "a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning", while accusing him of [...] "cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies" [...] in his book Outliers. Referencing a Gladwell reporting mistake in which Gladwell refers to [...] "eigenvalue" [...] as [...] "Igon Value", Pinker criticizes his lack of expertise: [...] "I will call this the Igon Value Problem: when a writer's education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong." [...] A writer in The Independent accused Gladwell of posing [...] "obvious" [...] insights. The Register has accused Gladwell of making arguments by weak analogy and commented Gladwell has an [...] "aversion for fact", adding: [...] "Gladwell has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> handing simple, vacuous truths to people and dressing them up with flowery language and an impressionistic take on the scientific method." [...] In that regard, The New Republic has called him [...] "America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer". His approach was satirized by the online site [...] "The Malcolm Gladwell Book Generator".|$|E

5000|$|On March 4 Bret Easton Ellis tweeted: [...] "With [...] "Taipei" [...] Tao Lin {{becomes the}} most {{interesting}} prose stylist of his generation, which doesnt mean that [...] "Taipei" [...] isnt a boring novel..." [...] In an unprecedentedly long blurb, Frederick Barthelme stated: [...] "Tao Lin has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> distinctive <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of sticking to his guns, his guns being the ultra-high-res self-consciousness that characterizes our lives but which we routinely ignore in our lives and in our art. In Taipei he is a constant microscope, examining a world of miniature gestures, tiny facial movements, hands in motion, shrugs, nods, twists, ticks, flicks and snaps, {{a world in which}} the barrage of information we take in moment by moment is simultaneously cataloged, interpreted, cross-referenced, recorded, and filed. Taipei is a paean to the minutely examined life, where what is examined is every twitch, flinch, jerk, spasm, tremor, and tic, every high-speed half-formed thought, everything that we routinely consider meaningless and inessential. Here all that is turned on its head and becomes central and predominate, fundamental to being. There is no mistaking that we live a new, ultra self-conscious life, skating on the surface of things while overlaying that surface with a facsimile of the [...] "old life" [...] in which traditional values retain their power and majesty. What is fascinating about Tao Lin’s fiction is his willingness, nay, insistence, on sticking to the true life of the new century, as raw, flat, fatigued as it may be. In Taipei he follows an utterly modern creature through a semi-robotic life in America and Taiwan, limiting himself and his characters to reasonably accurate renderings of normal responses without the literary humanist overlay, that is to say, a world almost binary and without much in the way of conventional [...] "emotion", the stuff of which storytelling has forever been <b>made.</b> Lin is <b>a</b> 21st century literary adventurer, willing to work with what he actually has rather than a simulacrum of what once was, or might have been. The result is a fascinating book, bone dry, repellant, painful, but relentlessly true to life. Stripped of any version of the pretty Hallmark Card world that occupies so much fiction today, and which seems vulgar and pathetic by comparison, Taipei lays open the present and likely future of ordinary life in a way that few writers would acknowledge, let alone champion. You owe it to yourself to read Taipei, and to contemplate the world it predicts." ...|$|R
