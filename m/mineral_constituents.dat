25|$|Because the {{minerals}} are mostly fine-grained, {{it is much}} more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.|$|E
25|$|Silts, sands and gravels are {{classified}} by their size, and hence they may {{consist of a}} variety of minerals.

25|$|Abrasion is the {{property}} of the coal which describes its propensity and ability to wear away machinery and undergo autonomous grinding. While carbonaceous matter in coal is relatively soft, quartz and other <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> in coal are quite abrasive. This is tested in a calibrated mill, containing four blades of known mass. The coal is agitated in the mill for 12,000 revolutions at a rate of 1,500 revolutions per minute.(I.E 1500 revolution for 8 min.) The abrasion index is determined by measuring the loss of mass of the four metal blades.|$|E
500|$|Three main factors {{determine}} {{the quality of}} preserved material in a coal ball: the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents,</b> {{the speed of the}} burial process, and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved, although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse. Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate, which has earned iron sulfide the title [...] "chief curse of the coal ball hunter".|$|E

The most developed beach on Nevis is the [...] 6.5km [...] long Pinney's Beach, on the western or Caribbean coast. There are sheltered swimming beaches in Oualie Bay and Cades Bay. The eastern coast of the island faces into the Atlantic Ocean, and can have strong surf {{in parts of the}} shore which are unprotected by fringing coral reefs. The colour of the sand on the beaches of Nevis is variable: on a lot of the bigger beaches the sand is a yellow grey in colour, but some beaches on the southern coast have darker, reddish, or even black sand. Under a microscope it becomes clear that Nevis sand is a mixture of tiny fragments of coral, many foraminifera, and small crystals of the various <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> of the volcanic rock of which the island is made.|$|E

60|$|But {{why should}} the water have become briny? Why should the {{evaporation}} of an old Superior produce at last a Great Salt Lake? Well, {{there is a small}} quantity of salt in solution even in the freshest of lakes and ponds, brought down to them by the streams or rivers; and, as the water of the hypothetical Lake Bonneville slowly evaporated, the salt and other <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> remained behind. Thus the solution grew constantly more and more concentrated, till at the present day it is extremely saline. Professor Geikie (to whose works the present paper is much indebted) found that he floated on the water in spite of himself; and the under sides of the steps at the bathing-places are all encrusted with short stalactites of salt, produced from the drip of the bathers as they leave the water. The <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents,</b> however, differ considerably in their proportions from those found in true salt lakes of marine origin; and {{the point at which the}} salt is thrown down is still far from having been reached. Great Salt Lake must simmer in the sun for many centuries yet before the point arrives at which (as cooks say) it begins to settle.|$|E
60|$|The {{flexures}} of the gneiss are incomparably more irregular {{and confused}} {{than those of}} the quartz, and often contain flattened spheres of highly crystalline felspar, that cleave perpendicularly to the shorter axis. These spheres are disposed in layers parallel to the foliation of the gneiss: and are the result of a metamorphic action of great intensity, effecting a complete rearrangement and crystallization of the quartz and mica in parallel planes, whilst the felspar is aggregated in spheres; just as in the rearrangement of the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> of mica-schists, the alumina is crystallized in the garnets, and in the clay-slates the iron into pyrites.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{weathering}} {{alters the}} <b>minerals</b> <b>constituent</b> of rock surface. Decomposition of mafic and opaque minerals releases ions and colloids of iron, magnesium, calcium and sulphur. Alteration of feldspars and feldspathoids releases silica colloid. These materials are reached and transported by surface water. The remnant materials are highly aluminous and siliceous. They could have certain mechanical firmness of own minerals, however no cohesion. Therefore, physical {{disintegration of the}} rock takes place to form the surface.|$|R
25|$|Zircon is {{a common}} {{accessory}} to trace <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> of most granite and felsic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and {{is a common}} constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within mafic rocks and very rare within ultramafic rocks aside {{from a group of}} ultrapotassic intrusive rocks such as kimberlites, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.|$|R
30|$|BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin {{is a novel}} {{formulation}} of vancomycin designed to target bone. We have demonstrated that it has similar in vitro activity to vancomycin against MRSA, indicating that BT 2 -peg 2 formulation {{does not affect the}} antimicrobial activity of vancomycin. We have additionally shown that the addition of the bone-targeting moiety to vancomycin enhances its in vitro ability to bind to the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> of bone. Results of pharmacokinetic studies also support targeting of bone; however, this is not without presence of BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin in plasma.|$|R
60|$|That slate {{may have}} been once mud, is made {{probable}} by {{the simple fact that}} it can be turned into mud again. If you grind tip slate, and then analyse it, you will find its <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> to be exactly those of a fine, rich, and tenacious clay. The slate districts (at least in Snowdon) carry such a rich clay on them, wherever it is not masked by the ruins of other rocks. At Ilfracombe, in North Devon, the passage from slate below to clay above, may be clearly seen. Wherever the top of the slate beds, and the soil upon it, is laid bare, the black layers of slate may be seen gradually melting--if I may use the word--under the influence of rain and frost, into a rich tenacious clay, which is now not black, like its parent slate, but red, from the oxidation of the iron which it contains.|$|E
60|$|Some hot-springs {{burst from}} {{the bank of the}} Lachen a mile or so below the village: they are used as baths, the patient {{remaining}} three days at a time in them, only retiring to eat in a little shed close by. The discharge amounts to a few gallons per minute; the temperature at the source is 112.6 degrees, and 106 degrees in the bath.* [This water boiled at 191.6 degrees, the same at which snow-water and that of the river did; giving an elevation of 11,730 feet. Observations on the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> of the water will be found in the Appendix.] The water has a slightly saline taste; it is colourless, but emits bubbles of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, blackening silver. A cold spring (temperature 42 degrees) emerged close by, and the Lachoong not ten yards off, was 47 degrees to 50 degrees. A conferva grows in the hot water, and the garnets are worn out of the gneiss rock exposed to its action.|$|E
60|$|But {{how about}} the juice, the sap, the qualities of the soil, the manure required? is the incredulous cry of Other People. What {{is the use of}} the roots, and {{especially}} of the rootlets, if they are not the mouths and supply-tubes of the plants? Well, I plainly perceive I can get 'no forrarder,' like the farmer with his claret, till I've answered that question, provisionally at least; so I will say here at once, without further ado--the plant requires drink as well as food, and the roots are the mouths that supply it with water. They also suck up a few other things as well, which are necessary indeed, but far from forming the bulk of the nutriment. Many plants, however, don't need any roots at all, while none can get on without leaves as mouths and stomachs. That is to say, no true plantlike plants, for some parasitic plants are practically, to all intents and purposes, animals. To put it briefly, every plant has one set of aerial mouths to suck in carbon, and many plants have another set of subterranean mouths as well, to suck up water and <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents.</b>|$|E

The suitability of groundwater for irrigation is evaluated and concentrations of groundwater quality parameters using electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), percent of sodium (Na 2 +%) and total hardness (TH). USSL diagram (SAR vs. EC plot) and Wilcox diagram (Na 2 +% vs. EC plot) were also applied to evaluate the irrigation suitability of groundwater in many instances.|$|R
30|$|The bone-targeting {{capacity}} of vancomycin HCl and BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin diacetate was evaluated in vitro using an HA binding assay. For comparative purposes tetracycline was {{included as a}} control and was defined as having an HA binding index of 100. Vancomycin HCl did not bind to HA (HA binding index = 0), whereas BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin diacetate showed appreciable binding to hydroxyapatite (HA binding index = 57). This suggests that vancomycin does not attach to HA {{but that it is}} the bone-targeting moiety which is attached to the parent vancomycin molecule by polyethelene glycol linkage (Figure  1) which is responsible for BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin’s ability to bind to the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> of bone.|$|R
60|$|The {{strike of}} all the rocks (gneiss with granite veins) seemed to be north-east, and dip north-west 30 degrees. Such also were the strike and dip on another spur from Donkia, north of this, which I ascended to 19,000 feet, on the 26th of September: it abutted on the scarped precipices, 3000 feet high, of that mountain. I had been {{attracted}} to the spot by its bright orange-red colour, which I found {{to be caused by}} peroxide of iron. The highly crystalline nature of the rocks, at these great elevations, is due to the action of veins of fine-grained granite, which sometimes alter the gneiss {{to such an extent that}} it appears as if fused into a fine granite, with distinct crystals of quartz and felspar; the most quartzy layers are then roughly crystallized into prisms, or their particles are aggregated into spheres composed of concentric layers of radiating crystals, as is often seen in agates. The rearrangement of the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> by heat goes on here just as in trap, cavities filled with crystals being formed in rocks exposed to great heat and pressure. Where mica abounds, it becomes black and metallic; and the aluminous matter is crystallised in the form of garnets.|$|E
6000|$|Confervae {{abound in}} the warm stream from the springs, and two species, one ochreous brown, and the other green, occur {{on the margins of}} the tanks themselves, and in the hottest water; the brown is the best Salamander, and forms a belt in deeper water than the green; both appear in broad {{luxuriant}} strata, wherever the temp. is cooled down to 168 degrees, and as low as 90 degrees. Of flowering plants, three showed in an eminent degree a constitution capable of resisting the heat, if not a predilection for it; these were all Cyperaceae, a Cyperus and an Eleocharis, having their roots in water of 100 degrees, and where they are probably exposed to greater heat, and a Fimbristylis at 98 degrees; all were very luxuriant. From the edges of the four hot springs I gathered sixteen species of flowering plants, and from the cold tank five, which did not grow in the hot. A water-beetle, Colymbetes(?) and Notonecta, abounded in water at 112 degrees, with quantities of dead shells; frogs were very lively, with live shells, at 90 degrees, and with various other water beetles. Having no means of detecting the salts of this water, I bottled some for future analysis.* [For an account of the Confervae, and of the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> of the waters, etc. see Appendix B.] ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the outset}} you will soon find {{yourself}} involved in chemical and meteorological questions: as, for instance, when you ask--How {{is it that}} I find one flora on the sea-shore, another on the sandstone, another on the chalk, and another on the peat-making gravelly strata? The usual answer would be, I presume--if we could work it out by twenty years' experiment, such as Mr. Lawes, of Rothampsted, has been making on the growth of grasses and leguminous plants in different soils and under different manures--the usual answer, I say, would be--Because we plants want such and such <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> in our woody fibre; again, because we want {{a certain amount of}} moisture at a certain period of the year: or, perhaps, simply because the mechanical arrangement of the particles of a certain soil happens to suit the shape of our roots and of their stomata. Sometimes you will get an answer quickly enough; sometimes not. If you ask, for instance, Asplenium viride how it contrives to grow plentifully in the Craven of Yorkshire down to 600 or 800 feet above the sea, while in Snowdon it dislikes growing lower than 2000 feet, and is not plentiful even there?--it will reply--Because in the Craven I can get as much carbonic acid as I want from the decomposing limestone: while on the Snowdon Silurian I get very little; and I have to make it up by clinging to the mountain tops, {{for the sake of the}} greater rainfall. But if you ask Polopodium calcareum--How is it you choose only to grow on limestone, while Polypodium Dryopteris, of which, I suspect, you are only a variety, is ready to grow anywhere?--Polypodium calcareum will refuse, as yet, to answer a word.|$|E
30|$|The {{ground water}} {{suitability}} for irrigation is {{contingent on the}} effects of their <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> in water on both soil and plants (Richards 1954). An important factor which relates the crop growth with water quality is drainage. If a soil is well drained, crops may grow on it, even if it has a generous amount of saline water. On the other hand, in poorly drained area but having good quality water may fail to produce satisfactory yield (Todd 1980). For determining the irrigation water quality, some important hydrochemical parameters such as EC, salinity, percent sodium, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), Kelly’s index (KI), and magnesium ratio (MR) are used.|$|R

6000|$|After a {{while we}} turned off the high road into a forest path, which was sound enough, the soil being one sheet of poor sand and white quartz gravel, which would in Scotland, or even Devonshire, have carried nothing taller than heath, but was here covered with impenetrable jungle. The {{luxuriance}} of this jungle, be it remembered, must not delude a stranger, as it has too many ere now, into fancying that the land would be profitable under cultivation. [...] As long as the soil is shaded and kept damp, it will bear an abundant crop of woody fibre, which, composed almost entirely of carbon and water, drains hardly any <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> from the soil. But if that jungle be once cleared off, the slow and careful work of ages has been undone in a moment. The burning sun bakers up everything; and the soil, having no mineral staple wherewith to support a fresh crop if planted, is reduced to aridity and sterility for years to come. Timber, therefore, I believe, and timber only, is the proper crop for these poor soils, unless medicinal or otherwise useful trees should be discovered hereafter worth the planting. To thin out the useless timbers--but cautiously, for fear of letting in the sun's rays--and to replace them by young plants of useful timbers, is all that Government can do with the poorer bits of these Crown lands, beyond protecting (as it does now {{to the best of}} its power) the natural crop of Timit-leaves from waste and destruction. So much it ought to do; and so much it can and will do in Trinidad, which--happily for it--possesses a Government which governs, instead of leaving every man, as in the Irishman's paradise, to 'do what is right in the sight of his own eyes, and what is wrong too, av he likes.' Without such wise regulation, and even restraint, of the ignorant greediness of human toil, intent only (as in the too exclusive cultivation of the sugar-cane and of the cotton-plant) on present profits, without foresight or care for the future, the lands of warmer climates will surely fall under that curse, so well described by the venerable Elias Fries, of Lund. {257a} ...|$|E
60|$|The {{waters of}} the Dead Sea are thus in the {{condition}} of having already deposited almost all their gypsum, {{as well as the}} greater part of the salt they originally contained. They are, in fact, much like sea water which has been boiled down till it has reached the state of a thick salty liquid; and though most of the salt is now already deposited in a deep layer on the bottom, enough still remains in solution to make the Dead Sea infinitely salter than the general ocean. At the same time, there are a good many other things in solution in sea water besides gypsum and common salt; such as chloride of magnesia sulphate of potassium, and other interesting substances with pretty chemical names, well calculated to endear them at first sight to the sentimental affections of the general public. These other by-contents of the water are often still longer in getting deposited than common salt; and, owing to their intermixture in a very concentrated form with the mother liquid of the Dead Sea, the water of that evaporating lake is not only salt but also slimy and fetid to the last degree, its taste being accurately described as half brine, half rancid oil. Indeed, the salt has been so far precipitated already that there is now five times as much chloride of magnesium left in the water as there is common salt. By the way, it is a lucky thing for us that these various soluble minerals are of such constitution as to be thrown down separately at different stages of concentration in the evaporating liquid; for, if it were otherwise, they would all get deposited together, and we should find on all old salt lake beds only a mixed layer of gypsum, salt, and other chlorides and sulphates, absolutely useless for any practical human purpose. In that case, we should be entirely dependent upon marine salt pans and artificial processes for our entire salt supply. As it is, we find the materials deposited one above another in regular layers; first, the gypsum at the bottom; then the rock-salt; and last of all, on top, the more soluble <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents.</b>|$|E
60|$|Terai {{is a name}} loosely {{applied to}} a tract of country at the very foot of the Himalaya: it is Persian, and signifies damp. Politically, the Terai {{generally}} belongs to the hill-states beyond it; geographically, it should appertain to the plains of India; and geologically, it {{is a sort of}} neutral country, being composed neither of the alluvium of the plains, nor of the rocks of the hills, {{but for the most part}} of alternating beds of sand, gravel, and boulders brought from the mountains. Botanically it is readily defined as the region of forest-trees; amongst which the Sal, the most valuable of Indian timber, is conspicuous in most parts, though not now in Sikkim, where it has been destroyed. The Terai soil is generally light, dry, and gravelly (such as the Sal always prefers), and varies in breadth, from ten miles, along the Sikkim frontier, to thirty and more on the Nepalese. In the latter country it is called the Morung, and supplies Sal and Sissoo timber for the Calcutta market, the logs being floated down the Konki and Cosi rivers to the Ganges. The gravel-beds extend uninterruptedly upon the plains for fully twenty miles south of the Sikkim mountains, the gravel becoming smaller as the distance increases, and large blocks of stone not being found beyond a few miles from the rocks of the Himalaya itself, even in the beds of rivers, however large and rapid. Throughout its breadth this formation is conspicuously cut into flat-topped terraces, flanking the spurs of the mountains, at elevations varying from 250 to nearly 1000 feet above the sea. These terraces are of various breadth and length, the smallest lying uppermost, and the broadest flanking the rivers below. The isolated hills beyond are also flat-topped and terraced. This deposit contains no fossils; and its general appearance and <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> are the only evidence of its origin, which is no doubt due to a retiring ocean that washed the base of the Sikkim Himalaya, received the contents of its rivers, and, wearing away its bluff spurs, spread a talus upwards of 1000 feet thick along its shores. It is not at first sight evident whether the terracing is due to periodic retirements of the ocean, or to the levelling effects of rivers that have cut channels through the deposit. In many places, especially along the banks of the great streams, the gravel is smaller, obscurely interstratified with sand, and the flattened pebbles over-lap rudely, in a manner characteristic of the effects of running water; but such is not the case with the main body of the deposit, which is unstratified, and much coarser.|$|E
