5000|$|After the Dilgar War, the Earth Alliance entered {{another round}} of expansion. However, in 2245 the Earth Alliance had a {{disastrous}} first contact with a reclusive alien race called the Minbari, resulting in the devastating Earth-Minbari War. The Minbari had been a space-faring race {{for at least a}} thousand years and wielded powerful technology, surpassing the capabilities and resources of the younger races at that time. The Minbari Sharlin Warcruisers possessed powerful [...] "slicer" [...] beams which could fire from a superior range, as well as an advanced form of stealth technology which prevented the Earth Alliance ships from achieving an automatic target lock, leaving only the option of an ineffective <b>manual</b> <b>lock</b> instead. EarthForce ships and soldiers fought bravely, but after two years of bloody fighting and heavy losses for the Earth Alliance (Some of the losses for the Minbari included 2 Sharlin Warcruisers, 3 Heavy Cruisers and an unknown amount of ground forces) the Minbari headed straight for Earth, bypassing the remaining colonies, and intending to let this war reach its genocidal conclusion. The final and most desperate battle of the war was the Battle of the Line, where the Minbari abruptly surrendered after they found Minbari and Human souls are linked.|$|E

5000|$|The pistol has a {{multi-stage}} {{safety system}} {{consisting of two}} automatic internal safeties, two external trigger safeties and a <b>manual</b> <b>lock</b> safety. The first external trigger safety acts as the primary fail-safe. A small, spring-loaded inner trigger is housed in a wide, outer trigger and cannot be actuated unless the inset trigger is depressed first. This keeps the trigger from being pulled by an inadvertent off-angle trigger pull. This trigger safety also activates and when released—deactivates the two internal safeties: the firing pin and drop safety. The firing pin safety is contained in the pistol’s slide and blocks the longitudinal movement of the striker. The second trigger safety is an optional, manually operated plastic bar located inside the trigger guard and projecting out {{from the base of}} the pistol’s frame when activated, revealing a small white dot. This indicates that the pistol is currently incapable of being fired. It is used as an additional safety that disables the trigger with the firing pin spring cocked (after reloading the pistol). This safety is engaged by simultaneously pushing in two buttons on both sides of the frame and then deactivated by simply lifting the trigger finger and pushing the bar up and into the pistol's frame, thus allowing the trigger to be pulled back and the weapon fired. These safeties enable safe handling of the pistol with a round present in the chamber (the so-called [...] "cocked and locked" [...] condition) and allow for rapid deployment and immediate firing; this arrangement however does not permit the firing mechanism to be re-cocked in case of a misfire after the trigger has been pulled.|$|E

50|$|Conventional {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} <b>manual</b> <b>locking</b> hubs and a two-speed dual range New Process 205 transfer case with four drive modes: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, while Four High yielded a locked 50:50 torque split. Four Low applied reduction gearing. The {{front and rear}} propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral allowed for flat towing, or use of the power take off (PTO).|$|R
50|$|The {{locks on}} this canal have been collectively named Old Ford Three Locks, all lying within the {{district}} of Old Ford, but are now individually known as Hertford Union Top, Middle and Bottom locks. They are grouped together towards the north-eastern end, and descend approximately 19 ft from the Regent's Canal to the Lee Navigation. These locks are all single <b>manual</b> <b>locks,</b> and the largest craft that can use them have a length of 72 feet and a beam of 14 feet.|$|R
50|$|From {{the mouth}} upwards to Dehrn (of Runkel), Lahn-km 70 (above Limburg), {{the river is}} {{consistently}} passable for larger vessels, with locks operated by personnel. The Water and Shipping Administration guarantees a minimum water depth of 1.60 m in the navigation channel. There are stream gauges at Kalkofen (of Dörnberg) (normal water level 1.80 m) and at Leun. Above Dehrn there are <b>manual</b> <b>locks</b> and frequent shoals, making the passage of boats difficult. Two weirs in Wetzlar are an obstruction to shipping further upriver.|$|R
50|$|On {{two-wheel drive}} F-250 and F-350 pickups, the Twin I-Beam {{independent}} front suspension with coil springs was used; their four-wheel drive counterparts were equipped with solid front axle (Dana 50 and Dana 60) with leaf springs. In 2005, the front suspension was updated as four-wheel drive trucks were converted to front coil springs; to reduce unsprung weight, the mounting of the front sway bar was changed to the frame instead of the front axle. The <b>manual</b> <b>locking</b> hubs on Super Duty trucks are made by Warn.|$|R

50|$|As {{the medical}} {{director}} of the Marion Nursing Home for some three decades, he became aware of the problem of wheelchair-related falls among semi-ambulatory patients who did not or could not remember to use manual brakes on their wheelchairs. Some patients in wheelchairs, particularly the elderly, have a tendency to fall and injure themselves when trying to stand because they fail to engage the <b>manual</b> <b>locks.</b> Dugas hence attempted {{to find a way to}} save these patients from potentially debilitating injuries. He began his experimentation with locking systems and procured his first patent (#5,203,433) on April 20, 1993. The wheelchair locks/brakes are made of stainless steel, and worked well but were heavy and had a tendency to require maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Most 70 Series Land Cruisers (both petrol {{and diesel}} models) use inline six-cylinder engines. The {{exceptions}} are the V8 diesel 1VD-FTV engine introduced in some markets in 2007 and the V6 petrol 1GR-FE introduced in 2009, with the last straight-6 available being the diesel 1HZ for markets with less stringent emission rules such as Africa and Bolivia. Regardless of the engine, a 5-speed manual transmission delivers power to a part-time four-wheel-drive transfer case with high and low range. The solid front axles are a full-floating design with <b>manual</b> <b>locking</b> hubs. The solid rear axles are available in semi-floating and full-floating variations. Selectable locking differentials (front and rear) are factory options in some markets.|$|R

50|$|The 2WD and 4WD sport truck package {{came with}} factory {{air-conditioning}} {{as well as}} the clock and tachometer in the cluster as standard with exclusive gradient-patterned bucket seats for both drivetrains (with the 4WD versions offering the center console and gauges of the DX model, and the 2WD having center console storage in place of the transfer case lever), as well as King-Cab variants. It had similar radio, back-glass, cruise control, and roll-bar/brush guard options as the DX trim. The sport truck package also was the only package with standard power windows and locks (all other packages only received <b>manual</b> <b>locks</b> and windows), as well as a tilting sunroof. ST stickers were placed {{on the end of the}} rear quarter panels. Ironically, the ST package had no performance modifications, however in the 1986 model year it had an optional Z24i single-port fuel injected engine.|$|R
40|$|Introduction To {{accommodate}} the new Argos 500 MEG instrument [1] a general upgrade {{of the existing}} 2 + 1 layer magnetically shielded room at the neurological department was necessary. Due to the innovative technology and the ambitious goal more stringent requirements where set for shielding performances and shielding anisotropy. The upgrade process of the existing MSR {{was carried out in}} cooperation with Advanced Technologies Biomagnetics and consisted in: 1. Adding a third layer of soft magnetic material. 2. Redesigning the structure supporting the magnetic layers of the door to improve the matching with the walls to reduce the door effects. 3. Redesigning completely the operation of the door by removing all hidden mechanisms and leverages and replacing them with external pneumatic locks. 4.

50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move {{four-wheel drive}} system with {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the {{permanent four-wheel drive}} system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive system featured new automatic self locking hubs and synchronized direct high range planetary gearing, such that the truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked four-wheel drive at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts. Conventional four-wheel drive was still available with <b>manual</b> <b>locking</b> hubs.|$|R
