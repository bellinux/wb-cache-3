500|$|Nevertheless, Brodie's {{book has}} been criticized by some scholars, most often for its {{speculative}} interpretations of early Mormon history and its presumptions about Smith's internal motivation. In reviewing No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History,</b> Vardis Fisher (himself a prolific novelist—and atheist—who remained unconvinced by Brodie’s theory of Smith's motivations) incorrectly speculated that Brodie would “turn novelist in her next book.” ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She {{never tried}} to regain her membership.

[...] The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." [...] Before No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History</b> was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, [...] "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, {{and the fact that we}} come out on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you."

500|$|For [...] {{more than}} a quarter century Fawn Brodie's No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History</b> has been {{recognized}} by most professional American historians as the standard work on the life of Joseph Smith and perhaps the most important single work on early Mormonism. At the same time the work has had tremendous influence upon informed Mormon thinking, as shown by the fact that whole issues of B.Y.U. Studies and Dialogue have been devoted to considering questions on the life of the Mormon prophet raised by Brodie. There is evidence that her book has had strong negative impact on popular Mormon thought as well, since to this day in certain circles in Utah to acknowledge that one has [...] "read Fawn Brodie" [...] is to create doubts as to one's loyalty to the Church.|$|E
500|$|Its title, No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History,</b> {{alludes to}} a comment Joseph Smith {{made in a}} speech shortly before his {{assassination}} in 1844. [...] Brodie presents the young Joseph as a lazy, good-natured, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker. In an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, he developed the notion of golden plates and then {{the concept of a}} religious novel, the Book of Mormon. [...] It was based in part on View of the Hebrews, an earlier work by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. Brodie asserts that at first Joseph Smith was a deliberate impostor; but at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, he became convinced that he was a prophet. She wrote that he never escaped [...] "the memory of the conscious artifice" [...] that created the Book of Mormon.|$|E
500|$|During her research, Brodie {{discovered}} {{primary sources}} {{that had previously}} been overlooked or neglected. She presented the young Joseph Smith as a good-natured, lazy, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker, who, in an attempt to improve his family's fortunes, first developed the notion of golden plates and then the concept of a religious novel, the Book of Mormon. This book, she claims, was based in part on an earlier work, View of the Hebrews, by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. [...] Brodie asserts that at first Smith was a deliberate impostor, who at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, became convinced that he was indeed a prophet—though without ever escaping [...] "the memory of the conscious artifice" [...] that created the Book of Mormon. Jan Shipps, a preeminent non-LDS scholar of Mormonism, who rejects this theory, nevertheless has called No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History</b> a [...] "beautifully written biography...the work of a mature scholar [...] represented the first genuine effort {{to come to grips with}} the contradictory evidence about Smith's early life." ...|$|E

500|$|Although No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History</b> criticized many {{foundational}} Mormon {{beliefs about}} Joseph Smith, the LDS Church {{was slow to}} condemn the work, even as the book went into a second printing. [...] In 1946, The Improvement Era, an official periodical of the Church, said {{that many of the}} book's citations arose from doubtful sources and that the biography was [...] "of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith." [...] The [...] "Church News" [...] section of the Deseret News had a lengthy critique: it praised the biography's [...] "fine literary style" [...] and denounced it as [...] "a composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before." [...] In the booklet, [...] "No, Ma'am, That's Not History", the BYU professor and LDS historian and apologist Hugh Nibley challenged Brodie. [...] He asserted that she had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others.

500|$|Although No Man Knows <b>My</b> <b>History</b> {{questioned}} many common Mormon {{beliefs and}} portrayals of Joseph Smith, {{the work was}} not immediately condemned by Mormon institutions, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), even as the book went into a second printing.

500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of <b>my</b> <b>history</b> and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E

2500|$|Also in November 2006, Billboard {{magazine}} was {{curious as to}} why the artist is credited as just his first name, [...] "Yusuf" [...] rather than [...] "Yusuf Islam".

It's more intimate, and to me that's the message of this record." [...] As for why the album sleeve says [...] "the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens", he responded, [...] "That's the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I'm not averse to that.

2500|$|However, the {{magnitude}} of victory in the ninth league match against Manchester United in October 2011 surprised many more. Before the match, City were on 22 points and United close behind at 20. Some believed {{that this would be}} a season which would be contested between the two Manchester clubs, as Arsenal were in poor form and Chelsea appeared in transition under new manager André Villas-Boas. The match therefore carried great importance in the title race, but the scoreline proved to be a mismatch: City defeated United away at Old Trafford 6–1. United had not lost a home match since April 2010, it was also their heaviest defeat in Premier League, worst loss at Old Trafford since 1955 and the first time conceded six at home since 1930.

2500|$|Nibley {{also wrote}} about LDS Temples, the {{historical}} Enoch, similarities between Christian Gnostic and Latter-day Saint beliefs, {{and what he}} believed to be anti-Mormon works.

He wrote many scholarly articles, including a widely referenced study of the Roman sparsiones. His Berkeley dissertation was on Roman Festival Games. He has been published in Classical Journal, Western Political Quarterly, Western Speech, Jewish Quarterly Review, Church History, Revue de Qumran, Vigililae Christianae, The Historian, The American Political Science Review, and the Encyclopaedia Judaica. Possibly his most contentious essay was [...] "The Passing of the Church: Forty Variations on an Unpopular Theme," [...] from 1961. He shifted from scholarly to LDS publications in the mid-sixties.
