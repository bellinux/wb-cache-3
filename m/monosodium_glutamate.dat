5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline {{is used to}} slice vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate.</b> Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG, {{also known}} as sodium glutamate) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, {{one of the most}} {{abundant}} naturally occurring non-essential amino acids. <b>Monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> is found naturally in tomatoes, cheese and other foods.|$|E

25|$|Many {{physicians}} also recommend {{changes in}} diet to treat chronic headaches. Many chronic headache sufferers {{fail to recognize}} foods or beverages as headache factors, because the consumption may not consistently cause headaches or the headaches may be delayed. Many of the chemicals in certain foods can cause chronic headaches, including caffeine, <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG), nitrites, nitrates, tyramine, and alcohols. Some of the foods and beverages that chronic headache sufferers are advised to avoid include caffeinated beverages, chocolate, processed meats, cheese and fermented dairy products, fresh yeast-risen baked goods, nuts, and alcohol as well as certain fruits and vegetables. Additionally, people may have differing dietary triggers on an individualized basis, because not all foods affect people the same way. Different medical professionals suggest different ways of testing or changing diets. Some may suggest eliminating {{a few of the}} potentially headache-causing foods at a time {{for a short period of}} time, while others suggest removing all the threatening foods from a person's diet and slowly adding a couple back at a time. Yet, others may not suggest diet modification at all. The treatment of chronic headaches through changes in diet is based on personal opinion, and, therefore, controversial.|$|E
500|$|The first Indian KFC was a two-storey outlet on {{the fashionable}} Brigade Road in Bangalore in June 1995. According to {{journalist}} Michael White, {{the company could}} not have chosen a [...] "more difficult venue for its maiden entrée into the country". Bangalore housed {{the headquarters of the}} Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one of the most influential, vocal and anti-foreign investment farmers' associations in the country. The first outlet suffered protests from left wing, anti-globalisation and environmental campaigners, as well as local farmers, who objected to the chain bypassing local producers. Many Indians were concerned about the onslaught of consumerism, the loss of national self-sufficiency, and the disruption of indigenous traditions. The protests came to a head in August 1995, when the Bangalore outlet was repeatedly ransacked. The KFC outlet in Bangalore demanded, and received, a police van permanently parked outside for a year. The outlet was closed on September 13, 1995 by local authorities, who claimed the company used illegally high amounts of <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG) in its food. The outlet re-opened a few hours later as the result of an appeal by KFC to the Karnataka High Court. The company stated the recipe was no different than that used in any other KFC store. Rural activist M. D. Nanjundaswamy claimed KFC would adversely affect the health of the impoverished, by diverting grain from poor people to make the more profitable animal feed. Environmentalist Maneka Gandhi joined the anti-KFC movement. A second outlet opened in Delhi, but was closed by the authorities throughout November, purportedly for health reasons, but more likely to avoid a repetition of the Bangalore incident. The Delhi outlet soon closed permanently.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the process}} is secret, the general method for making yeast extract on a {{commercial}} scale is to add salt to a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, {{which leads to the}} cells shrivelling up; this triggers [...] "autolysis", in which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are sieved out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free glutamic acids, which are analogous to <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Glutamate is a proteinogenic {{amino acid}} and neurotransmitter, {{though it is}} perhaps {{publicly}} best known in its sodium salt form: <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG). [...] It is also a flavor on its own, producing the umami or savory flavor found in many fermented foods such as cheese. [...] As an amino acid it acts {{as a source of}} fuel for various cellular functions and as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate operates as an excitatory neurotransmitter and is released when a nerve impulse excites a glutamate producing cell. [...] This in turn binds to neurons with glutamate receptors, stimulating them.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, Food Safety Regulators {{from the}} Uttar Pradesh, India found that samples of Nestlé's leading noodles Maggi had up to 17 times beyond {{permissible}} safe limits {{of lead in}} addition to <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate.</b> On 3 June 2015, New Delhi Government banned the sale of Maggi in New Delhi stores for 15 days because it found lead and <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> in the eatable beyond permissible limit. [...] Some of India's biggest retailers like Future Group, Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Nilgiris had imposed a nationwide ban on Maggi as of 3 June 2015. On 3 June 2015, Nestlé India's shares fell down 11% due to the incident. Thereafter, multiple state authorities in India found unacceptable amount of lead {{and it had been}} banned in more than 5 other states in India by 4 June 2015. [...] The Gujarat FDA on 4 June 2015, banned the noodles for 30 days after 27 out of 39 samples were detected with objectionable levels of metallic lead, among other things. On 4 June 2015, Nestlé's share fell down by 3% over concerns related to its safety standards. On 5 June 2015, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) orders banned all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles from India, terming them [...] "unsafe and hazardous" [...] for human consumption. On 5 June 2015 Nepal indefinitely banned Maggi over concerns about lead levels in the product. On 5 June 2015, the Food Safety Agency, United Kingdom launched an investigation to find levels of lead in Maggi. Maggi noodles has been withdrawn in five African nations - Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and South Sudan by a super-market chain after a complaint by the Consumer Federation of Kenya, as a reaction to the ban in India.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the massacre, Huberty's wife and daughters stayed {{with a family}} friend. Amidst impromptu protests from some residents, Etna received the first payout from the survivors' fund. In 1986, she unsuccessfully sued both McDonald's and Babcock & Wilcox, her husband's longtime former employer, in an Ohio state court for $5million. The suit claimed that the massacre was triggered by both a poor diet, and her husband working around highly poisonous metals, further citing that <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> in McDonald's food, combined with {{the high levels of}} lead and cadmium discovered in Huberty's body at his autopsy — most likely built up from fumes inhaled during his 14 years of welding at Babcock & Wilcox — [...] had induced delusions and uncontrollable rage.

2500|$|The {{reason for}} the shootings was never determined. A typed letter left behind by Ferri {{contained}} a list of complaints, but the letter was largely unintelligible. Four single spaced pages in length, the letter contained many grammatical errors, misspellings and was typed in all caps. Ferri claimed he had been poisoned by <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG), a flavor enhancer in food, {{and that he had}} been [...] "raped" [...] by Pettit & Martin and other firms. The letter also contained complaints against the Food and Drug Administration, the legal profession (which he claimed gave [...] "allegiance to the monarchy"), and a list of over 30 [...] "criminals, rapists, racketeeres, lobbyists", none of whom were among his actual victims. Pettit & Martin occupied floors 33 (partial floor) and 34 through 36. The main reception floor was 35 and Ferri intended that floor as a target. His elevator stopped at the 34th floor because a secretary from that floor had pushed the up button for an elevator. As a result, Ferri began shooting on the 34th floor and worked his way down to lower floors.|$|E
2500|$|Glutamate is a {{nutrient}} that {{is extremely}} difficult to be deficient in, as, being an amino acid, it is found in every food that contains protein. [...] Additionally it is found, as previously mentioned, in fermented foods and in foods containing <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate.</b> [...] As such, good sources of glutamate include meat, fish, dairy products and a wide array of other foods. [...] Glutamate is also absorbed extremely efficiently by the intestines. [...] However, there are instances of glutamate deficiency occurring, but only in cases where genetic disorders are present. [...] One such example is Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency and can cause either minor or profound physical and intellectual disabilities, depending on the severity of the condition. [...] This disorder is extremely rare however, as only twenty people have so far been identified with this condition. [...] Glutamate, while critically important in the body also acts as an excitotoxin in high concentrations not normally found outside of laboratory conditions, although it can occur following brain injury or spinal cord injury.|$|E
2500|$|A loanword from Japanese meaning [...] "good flavor" [...] or [...] "good taste", [...] is {{considered}} fundamental to many Eastern cuisines; and other cuisines have long operated under principles {{that sought to}} combine foods to produce savory flavors, {{such as in the}} emphasis on veal stock by Auguste Escoffier, the pre-eminent chef of 19th century French cuisine, and in the Romans' deliberate use of fermented fish sauce. However, it was only recently recognized in modern science as a basic taste; well after the other basic tastes have been recognized by scientists, in part due to their correspondence with the four tastes of ancient Greek philosophy. [...] Umami, or “scrumptiousness”, was first studied with the scientific method and identified by Kikunae Ikeda, who began to analyze kombu in 1907, attempting to isolate its dashi taste. [...] He isolated a substance he called ajinomoto, Japanese for “at the origin of flavor”. Later identified as the chemical <b>monosodium</b> <b>glutamate</b> (MSG), and increasingly used independently as a food additive, it is a sodium salt that produces a strong savory taste, especially combined with foods rich in nucleotides such as meats, fish, nuts, and mushrooms.|$|E
