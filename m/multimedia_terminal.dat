50|$|The fiber-optic micro-nodes - {{which are}} also {{referred}} to as RFoG optical-networking units (R-ONUs) - terminate the fiber connection and convert traffic for delivery over the in-home network. Video traffic can be fed over coax to a set-top box, while voice and data traffic can be delivered to an embedded <b>multimedia</b> <b>terminal</b> adapter (eMTA), which connects to analog telephone lines over the subscriber’s internal phone wiring and to PCs via Ethernet or WiFi. The return path for voice, data, and video traffic is over a 1310 or 1590/1610 nm wavelength to a return path receiver, which converts the optical signal to RF and feeds it back into the CMTS and video controller. Although RFoG is providing a capacity increase, one undesired effect of the system is that more than one R-ONU can have the optical return path activated {{at the same time and}} on the same wavelength (for instance, one R-ONU falsely triggered by ingress); thus, an optical collision may occur (optical beating).|$|E
