50|$|The fiber-optic micro-nodes - {{which are}} also {{referred}} to as RFoG optical-networking units (R-ONUs) - terminate the fiber connection and convert traffic for delivery over the in-home network. Video traffic can be fed over coax to a set-top box, while voice and data traffic can be delivered to an embedded <b>multimedia</b> <b>terminal</b> adapter (eMTA), which connects to analog telephone lines over the subscriberâ€™s internal phone wiring and to PCs via Ethernet or WiFi. The return path for voice, data, and video traffic is over a 1310 or 1590/1610 nm wavelength to a return path receiver, which converts the optical signal to RF and feeds it back into the CMTS and video controller. Although RFoG is providing a capacity increase, one undesired effect of the system is that more than one R-ONU can have the optical return path activated {{at the same time and}} on the same wavelength (for instance, one R-ONU falsely triggered by ingress); thus, an optical collision may occur (optical beating).|$|E
