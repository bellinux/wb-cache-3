50|$|It is {{inferred}} from the empirical study of natural satellites in the Solar System {{that they are}} likely to be common elements of planetary systems. The majority of detected exoplanets are giant planets. In the Solar System, the giant planets have large collections of natural satellites (see <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Saturn, <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Uranus and <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Neptune). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that exomoons are equally common.|$|R

5000|$|Galileo had {{discovered}} the <b>moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter in 1609. Scheiner argued that {{what appeared to be}} spots on the sun were in fact clusters <b>of</b> small <b>moons,</b> thereby trying to deploy one of Galileo's own discoveries as an argument for the Aristotelian model. [...] In his Letters on Sunspots Galileo showed how sunspots were nothing like the <b>moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, and the comparison was false. Scheiner claimed that the sunspots, with their irregular movements, were like the <b>moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter whose positions were similarly hard to predict. To counter this argument, Galileo published tables of predictions for the future position <b>of</b> the <b>moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, so that astronomers could easily distinguish between the regular, predictable movements they followed with the ephemeral and irregular sunspots.|$|R
5|$|Puck—the largest inner <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Uranus—was {{discovered}} {{from the}} images taken by Voyager 2 on 30 December 1985. It {{was given the}} temporary designation S/1985U1.|$|E

5000|$|... "The <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter" [...] was {{originally}} published in The New Yorker on 22 May, 1978, with a slightly different version being republished as the title story of Munro's fifth collection {{that came out in}} 1982. [...] "The <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter" [...] has been included in the author's own compilations three times, in 1996, in 2004 and in 2006, which makes the work range among those that have been republished the most. Furthermore, [...] "The <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter" [...] counts among the stories that generated Munro's international breakthrough during the years around 1980.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter {{is a book}} {{of short}} stories by Alice Munro, {{published}} by Macmillan of Canada in 1982. It was nominated for the 1982 Governor General's Award for English Fiction. The title of the collection follows from the last short story in the collection [...] "The <b>Moons</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter".|$|R
5|$|After {{the merger}} with Fantastic, Mavor {{continued}} to draw well-known writers to the magazine, including Orson Scott Card, George R. R. Martin, and Roger Zelazny. Brad Linaweaver's <b>Moon</b> <b>of</b> Ice, {{which appeared in}} March 1982, {{was nominated for a}} Nebula award; Martin's Unsound Variations, which had appeared the issue before, was nominated for both a Nebula and a Hugo award.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Neptune, is probably a captured plutoid from the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

5|$|Margaret is {{the only}} known {{irregular}} prograde <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Uranus, and it currently has the most eccentric orbit of any moon in the Solar System, though Neptune's moon Nereid has a higher mean eccentricity. As of 2008, Margaret's eccentricity is 0.7979.|$|E
5|$|One {{week before}} the film's release and during the full <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> November 17, 2013, {{different}} cast members began posting their autographs on the official website once per day.

5|$|The Uranian moons {{are listed}} here by orbital period, from {{shortest}} to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in light blue and bolded. Irregular moons with retrograde orbits {{are shown in}} dark grey. Margaret, the only known irregular <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Uranus with a prograde orbit, is shown in light grey.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of maria on the Near Side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, {{which may have}} formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Earth a few {{tens of millions of}} years after their formation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple weeks}} later {{and during the}} full <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> September 19, 2013 an update was {{released}} which revealed limited edition railcards featuring promotional images of the film. The cards were scheduled to go on sale at the Shimbashi and Toyosu train stations between October 1 and 31, 2013. They granted a bearer access to the New Transit Yurikamome train which connects to the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo Bay between Minato and Kōtō in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|During {{the full}} <b>moon</b> <b>of</b> April 9, while Ikutsuki, Mitsuru and Yukari are observing Makoto during the midnight phenomenon, Akihiko Sanada (Hikaru Midorikawa) rushes {{back to the}} dorm just as it comes under the attack of a swarm of monstrous creatures. Yukari {{immediately}} grabs Makoto and flees to the roof. However they are cornered by a giant creature who knocks Yukari out. Much to everyone's amazement though, Makoto awakens {{to the power of}} Persona, calling forth Orpheus. However another Persona known as Thanatos, rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints.|$|E
