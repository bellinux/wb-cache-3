It allows <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a mask". She lives alone and, {{by her own}} account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would {{be surprised to find}} out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would be surprised to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?" [...] She has expressed interest in taxidermy and entomology. She collects preserved skulls and insects.|$|E
500|$|According to Emily Jupp of The Independent, despite various {{changes in}} musical direction, an [...] "unconventional fashion sense" [...] {{has been a}} {{constant}} in Diamandis's career. In the video to [...] "How to be a Heartbreaker," [...] she [...] "subverts the norm" [...] by wearing more clothes than male models in the background; she reflected that [...] "I don’t think it suits <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> very little clothing, it just wouldn’t feel right. I’d rather people listen to what I have to say instead of staring at my bum." [...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{explanation}} is that the attacks were an angry response by Bajrang Dal over the allegations that the New Life Fellowship Trust were indulging in forceful religious conversion of Hindus and distribution of vulgar literature slandering Hindu gods and goddesses. Bajrang Dal claimed that nearly 15,000 people had been forced to adopt Christianity as their religion in Mangalore alone in the past year after monitoring the situation. In the book Satyadarshini, written by Andhra Pradesh Pastor Paravastu Suryanarayana Rao, it was also reported that the New Life Fellowship Trust had denigrated and defamed Hindu gods, causing anger amongst the Bajrang Dal. Hindu activists also alleged that excerpts from Rao's book had been published in pamphlets to spread its influence. Mahila Parishat leader Asha Jagadish believed that the attacks were solely motivated by religious conversion by New Life and claimed that her neighbour was forcefully converted into Christianity to marry a Christian girl, further stating, [...] "The Holy Saint School in Bangalore, where I studied up to fifth standard, did not allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> kumkum or bangles according to Hindu tradition." [...] Fr. Francis Serrao, rector of St. Aloysius College, stated that he believed the attacks were not due to conversion, but was rather a reflection of the struggle between Christianity and Brahmanism and theorised that Christian ideology and Brahmin ideology can never coexist as [...] "Christianity propagates love and Brahmanism propagates hate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Călinescu {{remained}} in office during the royal dictatorship established by King Carol in 1937, serving as vice-premier under Miron Cristea. [...] According to historian Joseph Rothschild, {{he was actually}} the real power in the government. [...] He was also {{a founding member of}} the National Renaissance Front (FRN) created by as the sole legal party in December 1938, and was generally seen as very close to Carol. He soon became involved in a virulent dispute with historian Nicolae Iorga, when the latter issued harsh criticism regarding Carol's January 1939 initiative to dress large sections of the society, including Romanian Academy members, in various uniforms (a measure backed by Călinescu); Iorga remarked with irony: [...] "I'm prepared to wear the FRN uniform, but allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a speared helmet on my head, on which to place [...] the Minister of the Interior". Eventually (in May of the same year), Iorga gave in to the demands and became a supporter of the regime.|$|E
2500|$|In his own words, [...] "fit {{for nothing}} {{but to be}} shot at for six pence a day", Burton enlisted in {{the army of the}} East India Company at the behest of his ex-college classmates who were already members. He hoped to fight in the first Afghan war, but the {{conflict}} was over before he arrived in India. He was posted to the 18th Bombay Native Infantry based in Gujarat and under the command of General Charles James Napier. While in India, he became a proficient speaker of Hindustani, Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi, Saraiki and Marathi as well as Persian and Arabic. His studies of Hindu culture had progressed {{to such an extent that}} [...] "my Hindu teacher officially allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the Janeu (Brahmanical Thread)", although the truth of this has been questioned, since it would usually have required long study, fasting, and a partial shaving of the head. It has been suggested that his teacher, a Nagar Brahmin could have been an apostate. Burton's interest (and active participation) in the cultures and religions of India was considered peculiar by some of his fellow soldiers who accused him of [...] "going native" [...] and called him [...] "the White Nigger". Burton had many peculiar habits that set him apart from other soldiers. While in the army, he kept a large menagerie of tame monkeys in the hopes of learning their language. He also earned the name [...] "Ruffian Dick" [...] for his [...] "demonic ferocity as a fighter and because he had fought in single combat more enemies than perhaps any other man of his time".|$|E

6000|$|... "O, it isn't that," [...] Rose said, looking down. [...] "I haven't {{anything}} {{suitable to}} wear." [...] She went on quickly, {{as if to}} put an end to the whole matter. [...] "I'm a farmer's girl living on five hundred dollars a year, and I can't afford fifty dollar dresses.

I might find myself taken off, at a moment's notice, to the police court at Frizinghall, to be charged on suspicion, and searched accordingly.
