Thirteen items are listed as essential materials. Another 36 entries are described as helpful materials. These include books, guides, workbooks, and five career kits.

40|$|The MUFI {{group has}} {{published}} a recommendation for the selection of characters from the Unicode Standard and for characters to be allocated to the Private Use Area (PUA). Like the previous versions, it has been edited by Odd Einar Haugen, University of Bergen. This recommendation coordinates the usage of PUA with several other fonts and font projects, notably the TITUS project and Junicode. The recommendation has been divided into two parts, each containing {{the same number of}} characters, but in different order. Part 1 lists the characters in alphabetical order, beginning with alphabetical characters and then giving numbers, abbreviation characters, punctuation characters, symbols, and finally geometrical and metrical characters. Part 2 lists the characters according to the code charts in the Unicode Standard. Part 1 is intended for casual users, because it is fairly easy to find any particular character simply by browsing through the document on screen or in print. Part 2 is intended for encoders and font designers, because it lists characters according to Unicode code charts and accordingly in ascending code-point order. It also shows the structure of the Private Use Area more clearly than Part 1. In general, it contains more information than Part 1; it distinguishes between ISO entity <b>names</b> (<b>where</b> <b>applicable)</b> and MUFI-recommended entity names, and it includes an appendix specifying all changes from version 3. 0 to 4. 0. While there was a code-point conflict between Junicode and earlier versions of the recommendation, these conflicts have now been resolved. Version 4. 0 will be the last version of the MUFI character recommendation to be published in the present form. Any further updates will most likely be {{in the form of a}} database accessible from the MUFI web site...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} techniques to automatically infer mother's <b>maiden</b> <b>names</b> from public records. We demonstrate our techniques using publicly available {{records from the}} state of Texas, and reduce the entropy of a mother's <b>maiden</b> <b>name</b> from an average of close to 13 bits down to below 6. 9 bits for {{more than a quarter of}} the people targeted, and down to a zero entropy (i. e., certainty of their mothers <b>maiden</b> <b>name)</b> for a large number of targeted individuals. This poses a signi cant risk not only to individuals whose mothers <b>maiden</b> <b>name</b> can easily be guessed, but highlights the vulnerability of the system as such, given the traditional reliance of authentication by mother <b>maiden</b> <b>names</b> for nancial services. While our techniques and approach are novel, it is important to note that these techniques { once understood { do not require any insider information or particular skills to implement. This emphasizes the need to move away from mothers <b>maiden</b> <b>names</b> as an authenticator.
