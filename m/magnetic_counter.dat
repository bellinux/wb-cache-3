50|$|This {{experiment}} contained two sealed pressure zones, extending {{along the}} interior {{walls of the}} satellite, which were designed to record the impact of micrometeorites large enough to pierce the satellite shell. These pressure zones were partial vacuums, each at a different pressure, and were protected by 0.66 mm magnesium walls that presented an exposed surface area of 0.162 m², which was 20% of {{the area of the}} shell. A puncture in the walls of either zone was detected by a differential pressure gauge mounted between them, and telemetered as a change in the length of one of the telemetry channels. Erosion of the satellite shell through bombardment by space dust, micrometeorites, and other particles was recorded by three chromium-strip erosion gauges mounted on the satellite surface, and by a photosensitive detector. Electrical resistances of the gauges changed as their surfaces were changed by erosion. The photosensitive detector, a cadmium sulfide cell protected by an opaque covering of aluminized PET film, also showed a resistance change as the covering was eroded or penetrated. Erosion measurements also were telemetered as channel lengths, which permitted estimates of the erosion rates. Four barium titanate-type microphones recorded micrometeorite impacts on the satellite's surface. The microphone output was amplified, shaped, and fed into a <b>magnetic</b> <b>counter</b> unit, which provided continuously, in three-decimal digits, the cumulative count of impacts. The unit counted up to 1000 and then reset to zero. The satellite recorded 6600 micrometeorite impacts during 66 days of operation, of which 2800 occurred during a 70-h interval from November 16 to 18, 1959. No penetrations or fractures were recorded in the sensors of the surface penetration experiment. Because the erosion sensors were not disrupted, no definite results could be drawn from that experiment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} instruments {{designed to}} measure the tone-volume of the piano. The tone-volume depends {{on the amount of}} kinetic energy which the player spends on striking the key. The kinetic energy is in direct proportion to the mass set in motion and is the square of the velocity. The mass set is always constant and the energy depends only upon the velocity of the hammer. Thus it is possible to analyze the tone-volume by measuring the velocity of the hammer. Electronic digital devices generally have great advantages over analog ones in the field of physical measurement. The velocity is converted to the time interval by photo-transistors and flip-flop.

We confirm all the predictions of the hydrostatic analysis and demonstrate its usefulness for clarifying the behaviour of the derived solutions. We further show that the outflow solutions can be extended to larger scales (so that, in particular, they also cross the Alfvén critical surface) by matching the localized disc solutions to global 'cold' wind solutions of the type introduced by Blandford & Payne.

Forty young adult rats were randomly assigned to sedentary control and exercise groups for an experimental period of 8 or 20 weeks. Animals assigned to exercise groups were subjected to 24 h daily free access to an in-cage running wheel with circumference of 1. 19 m. A <b>magnetic</b> digital <b>counter</b> was attached to the running wheel to record daily exercise distance run by the animals. Control rats were housed in cages without a running wheel, located next to the exercised animals. Body weight and food intake were recorded weekly. After the experimental periods of 8 and 20 weeks, blood, left ventricle, soleus and plantaris muscles were collected for analysis. No significant difference was found in plasma total antioxidant capacity between exercised and control animals in the 8 and 20 week groups according to our ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) analysis. However, modified FRAP for ascorbic acid (FRASC) analysis indicated that plasma ascorbic acid content was significantly increased by 46 and 34 % in 8 and 20 week exercise groups, respectively, when compared with the corresponding control groups. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly elevated by 39 % in erythrocytes of animals exercised for 8 weeks relative to control animals. In the 20 week exercise group, Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in ventricle and plantaris was significantly upregulated by 477 and 290 %, respectively, relative to control values. As demonstrated by comet assay, the oxidant-induced DNA damage was significantly reduced by 21 and 45 % in lymphocytes of animals exercised for 8 and 20 weeks, respectively, when compared with the corresponding control lymphocytes. Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript expression of SOD 2 was significantly elevated by 939 % in lymphocytes of animals exercised for 8 weeks relative to control animals. Increased expressions of SOD 2 (by 19 %), catalase (25 %), APEX nuclease (multifunctional DNA repair enzyme) 1 (APEX 1; 46 %), Protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide (Prkdc; 9 %) and O- 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (Mgmt; 26 %) were found in lymphocytes of animals exercised for 20 weeks relative to control rats. These results demonstrate that habitual exercise confers increased resistance of lymphocytes to oxidant-induced DNA damage, and this protective effect is possibly attributed to the regular exercise-induced elevated expression of antioxidant and DNA repairing enzymes.

The pairs of coils, positioned {{a short distance}} from opposing sides of the rotor, are connected in series. A current runs through the coils, generating a magnetic flux between the coils. This attracts the protruding poles on the rotor, and just as the poles on the rotor approach the coils, the current to the coils is inverted, repelling the rotor s poles as they pass the coils. This current switching, back and forth, provides a continuous rotational torque to the rotor. reliability, durability, low cost, and operation in adverse environments such as high temperatures, extreme temperature variations, and high rotational speeds. However, because rotors are often manufactured with minute flaws due to imperfections in the machining process, traditional switched reluctance motors often suffer from substantial amounts of vibration. In addition, the current in the coils imparts a strong radial magnetic force on the rotor; the continuous alternating of the direction of this force also causes vibration. As a result, switched reluctance motors require bearings that, run at high speeds, can require lubrication apparatus and are subject to problems with heat and wear. My mentor s recent invention, the "Bearingless" Switched Reluctance Motor, actually uses magnetic bearings instead of traditional physical bearings. Sensors are used to continuously determine the position of the rotor. A computer reads the position sensor input, performs calculations, and outputs a current to a set of extra coils (in addition to the coils rotating the rotor).

Most counters installed on the selected road sections were based on the standard 48 -hour traffic counts. Then, the obtained average daily traffic (ADT) was converted to annual average daily traffic (AADT) by means of adjustment (monthly variation) factors. ^ Traffic data obtained from the counters were analyzed before the development of the AADT prediction models. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to develop the AADT prediction models, which are reliable and easy to use. Two different AADT prediction models were developed for county roads, one for paved road and the other for gravel road. There were quantitative and qualitative predictor variables used in the model development. Because too many predictor variables were involved in the model development, a principal component analysis was also conducted. ^ To validate the developed models, additional field traffic data were collected from eight randomly selected counties. The accuracy measures of the validation showed the high accuracy of the prediction models. After various statistical analyses and tests, the study identified that models without reasonable outliers gave a better estimate. The statistical analysis also found that the independent variables employed in the models were statistically significant. The number of independent variables included in the models was kept to a minimum. ...|$|R
