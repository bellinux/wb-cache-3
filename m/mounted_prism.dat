40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} structure of random pressure fields, the nature of fluid-structure interactions and associated loads acting on finite height, surface <b>mounted</b> <b>prisms</b> are examined. Two prismatic cylinders exposed to boundary layer flows of varying turbulence in-tensity, simulating varying terrain conditions, are studied here. The following measured and derived features of the pressure field around these prisms, {{with a focus on}} aspect ratio and ap-proach flow features, are discussed here: local pressure power spectra; pressure cross-correlation structure on windward, leeward and side faces; alongwind, acrosswind and torsional load spec-tra; influence of approach flow incidence on integral loads. The mechanisms responsible for the modifications of flow features, particularly the incident flow and aspect ratio, are critically examined. Results demonstrate a unique influence of the approach flow field characteristics that results in either enhancing or suppressing the development of coherent flow features, par-ticularly at varying angles of attack...|$|R

This project encompasses building 3 earthen dams of 2. 9 km, 3. 2 km and 0. 8 km length to enclose a valley of approximately 7. 2 km long and 3. 2 km wide. A fully automatic survey system {{has been designed to}} monitor the stability of the dams and of the surrounding area. There will be over 360 deformation monuments to be monitored continuously or, at least, monthly starting from completion of structures (end of 1999) through to the complete filling of the reservoir, estimated to take at least 5 years. A geodetic surveying system was designed to detect displacements of points larger than 10 mm at 95 % confidence level using multiple, permanently installed, robotic total stations and an array of permanently <b>mounted</b> <b>prisms</b> to provide an economically feasible way to monitor such a large site. The total stations will be remotely operated and will automatically collect three dimensional data on a set time schedule.

SAA is a geotechnicalinstrument often used for monitoring of displacements in soil. SAA uses micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors to measure tilt in the gravity field. The geodeticmonitoring system, which uses ALERT software, senses the displacements of targetsrelative to control points, using a robotic total station (RTS).

40|$|With an {{increasing}} tendency in civil engineering to build ever taller skyscrapers and longer bridges with lighter materials, structures {{are more susceptible}} to wind-induced vibrations. In the design process, however, aeroelastic safety is often not considered. While the conceived structures are perfectly adopted to standard design loads, they are only seldom aerodynamically optimized. Many examples exist where wind-induced vibrations have led to catastrophic structural failure. Wind-induced vibrations can be caused by either forced excitation or aeroelastic effects. In the first case, the forced vibrations originate from turbulent fluctuations in the wind flow around the structure, e. g. from natural turbulence in the wind flow attacking the structure or due to periodic vortex shedding {{in the wake of the}} structure. The second, aeroelastic phenomena are typically self-excited and are due to displacements of the structure that result in interactions with the wind flow. It must be emphasized that it is often impossible to pinpoint one specific excitation mechanism as the single cause of observed wind-induced vibrations since these are often initiated by a combination of different phenomena. In design codes, however, only forced excitation is mostly considered. It is therefore important to develop advanced techniques to study wind-induced vibrations that can incorporate all different excitation mechanisms at once. To study the susceptibility of a structure to wind-induced phenomena, a coupled multiphysics problem considering both wind flow and structural dynamics has to be solved. Because of the complexity of such problems, simplified phenomenological and experimental models are often unsatisfactory while numerical methods have the advantage that all possibly interacting excitation mechanisms can be accounted for simultaneously. With procedures available to couple a numerical model for the wind flow, i. e. computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the structure, e. g. finite element (FE) models, it should be possible to study wind-structure interaction (WSI) numerically. The goal of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether for a realistic, complex WSI problem numerical simulations can adequately predict observed wind-induced vibrations. For this purpose, the specific case study of a silo group is considered where wind-induced ovalling vibrations were observed during a storm in October 2002 on several empty silos in a group of forty silos in the port of Antwerp (Belgium). The necessity of performing complicated numerical WSI simulations for this problem is examined. First, it is investigated with both 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations how turbulent fluctuations in natural atmospheric winds can be simulated and how they are preserved in the flow field. In the 2 D simulations realistic turbulence levels cannot be simulated in the oncoming wind flow but these calculations allow to study wake-induced effects on the aerodynamic pressures in the silo group for a changing angle of incidence of the wind flow, as the simulations are computationally significantly less intensive. In the 3 D simulations, the turbulent wind flow can be modelled more realistically although some difficulties are encountered with the preservation of turbulence levels in the wind flow attacking the silo group as well. Due to the particular geometry of the silo group and the highly turbulent character of the wind flow, validation of the CFD simulation results is difficult. In addition to the silo group, the flow around a single silo is therefore considered. The better documented 2 D flow around a single cylinder is validated with results from the literature, while for the validation of the 3 D wind flow simulations, a wind tunnel test is performed for the single silo configuration. The influence of the blockage effect in the experiment is investigated and the pressure distribution on the silo surface shows reasonably good agreement in experiment and simulation. Qualitative validation is furthermore performed wherever possible for the silo group by comparing the flow pattern with geometrically similar flows e. g. through tube bundles of heat exchangers or around surface <b>mounted</b> <b>prisms.</b> The typical ovalling eigenmodes of a silo are determined from the FE model of the structure and subsequently, the modal projection of the aerodynamic pressure distributions from the 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations is determined. This approach allows to assess at which locations in the silo group ovalling vibrations are excited through direct forcing by the transient wind loads. For all angles of incidence in the 2 D simulations, a harmonic decomposition methodology is introduced as an alternative for the 3 D modal projection. The effect of a different turbulence modelling approach in the 2 D and 3 D simulations on the aerodynamic pressures on the silo surfaces is significant. While the 2 D simulations are found to be inadequate for the present purposes, the location of the ovalling vibrations in the silo group is predicted well by the 3 D simulations. Finally, the FE model of the structure and the 3 D CFD wind flow simulations are considered together as a single problem. To evaluate the importance of incorporating WSI for the prediction of ovalling vibrations, the structural response due to external aerodynamic forces is first calculated in one-way coupled simulations. The applied transient wind loads are determined a priori in the 3 D CFD simulations. In this approach, only forced excitation is considered as a possible excitation mechanism of wind-induced vibrations. In the two-way coupled WSI simulations by contrast, the structural and fluid solver are fully interacting and information is exchanged at the interface between the two solvers in every time step. Therefore, in this approach aeroelastic phenomena are also accounted for. Both one-way and two-way coupled simulations are performed for the single silo configuration and for the entire silo group. The structural response in the different coupled simulations in terms of excited eigenmodes is compared by considering modal deformation energy. Different frequency components can be clearly distinguished in the modal deformation energy of the structural response which are related to physical phenomena in the turbulent wind flow. After qualitative comparison of the results in the one-way and two-way coupled simulations, it cannot decisively be concluded whether ovalling vibrations of a single silo are due to forced excitation or if aeroelastic effects are important. Because the coupled WSI simulations are at the limit of practical feasibility of present day computational power, no grid independent solutions could be obtained. Nevertheless, the results of low resolution simulations for the silo group arrangement indicate that aeroelastic effects have a sigificant impact on the structural response of the silos. It is therefore concluded that complicated and grid independent WSI simulations are in general required to realistically predict the onset of ovalling vibrations in silo groups with numerical techniques. nrpages: 238 status: publishe...|$|R
