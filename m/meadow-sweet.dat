60|$|<b>MEADOW-SWEET</b> (Spiraea Ulmaria).--Raising its creamy cymes of {{blossoms}} {{in every}} ditch {{where there is}} a little moisture.|$|E
60|$|The sultry air, {{charged with}} a scent of <b>meadow-sweet,</b> of river and roses, closed on his senses, drowsing them.|$|E
6000|$|She whistled {{a little}} flatly for a moment, and threw small stones at {{a clump of}} <b>meadow-sweet</b> that sprang from the bank. Then she remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Grace {{had been}} up early, and now, with her garden hat on, and {{scissors}} in hand, was coming up the steps with her white apron full of roses, white lilies, <b>meadow-sweets,</b> and honeysuckle, for the parlor-vases, when the servant handed her a letter.|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed and}} went on with his work. She smiled a little, too, {{thinking}} {{she had made a}} great impression. She put out her hand with a dramatic gesture, and looked at me, when the scythe crunched through the <b>meadow-sweet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The trumpet-mouths of red {{convolvulus}} So dear to maidens, creamy <b>meadow-sweet</b> Whiter than Juno's {{throat and}} odorous As all Arabia, hyacinths the feet Of Huntress Dian would be loth to mar For any dappled fawn,--pluck these, and those fond flowers which are ...|$|E
6000|$|This English Thames is holier far than Rome, Those harebells like {{a sudden}} flush of sea Breaking across the woodland, with the foam Of <b>meadow-sweet</b> and white anemone To fleck their blue waves,--God is likelier there Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear! ...|$|E
60|$|So Martin and Adrian {{went down}} {{to the end of the}} little gravelly tongue and {{crouched}} among the tall <b>meadow-sweet</b> and grasses, while the others, working furiously, rolled the two barrels to the water-edge and shipped them, throwing rushes over them that they might not catch the eye of the Spaniards.|$|E
60|$|Then {{indeed he}} slumbered truly, this engarlanded weaver, his lids concealing all bright speculation, his jowl of vanity (foe of the Philistine) at peace: and I might gaze unperceived. The moon filled his mossy cubicle with her untrembling beams, {{streamed}} upon blossoms sweet and heavy as Absalom's hair, while tiny plumes wafted {{into the night}} the scent of thyme and <b>meadow-sweet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{whiteness}} {{of the white}} flower where there is any red is never unhuman, probably because a very brilliant red or rose colour on some delicate skins causes the light flesh-tints to appear white by contrast, and is the complexion known as [...] "milk and roses." [...] The apple-blossom is a beautiful example, and the beloved daisy--the [...] "wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower," [...] which {{would be so much}} less dear but for that touch of human crimson. This is the herb-Margaret of so many tender and pretty legends, that has white for purity and red for repentance. Even those who have never read these legends and that prettiest, most pathetic of all which tells of the daisy's origin, find a secret charm in the flower. Among other common examples are the rosy-white hawthorn, wood anemone, bindweed, dropwort, and many others. In the dropwort the rosy buds are seen among the creamy white open flowers; and the expression is always very marked and beautiful when there is any red or purple tinge or blush on cream-whites and ivory-whites. When we look from the dropwort to its nearest relative, the common <b>meadow-sweet,</b> we see how great a charm the touch of rose-red has given to the first: the <b>meadow-sweet</b> has no expression of the kind we are considering--no human association.|$|E
60|$|After a {{time they}} came back, {{dropping}} armfuls of loose-strife, <b>meadow-sweet,</b> blue vetch, and honey-suckle over delighted Cherry; and falling down by her side, coats off, all gasp and laughter, and breathless narrative of exploits and adventures, which somehow died {{away into the}} sleepiness due to their previous five-mile walk. Felix went quite off, lying flat on his back, with his head on Cherry's little spreading lilac cotton frock, and his mouth wide open, much tempting Edgar to pop in a pebble; and this being prevented by tender Cherry in vehement dumb show, Edgar consoled himself by a decidedly uncomplimentary caricature of him as Giant Blunderbore (a name derived from Fee, Fa, Fum) gaping for hasty pudding.|$|E
60|$|Some village friends stood upon a {{promontory}} {{lower down}} the stream to wave us a last farewell; but we, having already performed these shore rites, with excusable reserve, as befits {{those who are}} embarked on unusual enterprises, who behold but speak not, silently glided past the firm lands of Concord, both peopled cape and lonely summer meadow, with steady sweeps. And yet we did unbend {{so far as to}} let our guns speak for us, when at length we had swept out of sight, and thus left the woods to ring again with their echoes; and it may be many russet-clad children, lurking in those broad meadows, with the bittern and the woodcock and the rail, though wholly concealed by brakes and hardhack and <b>meadow-sweet,</b> heard our salute that afternoon.|$|E
60|$|The tall <b>meadow-sweet</b> was in bud {{along the}} tiny beach {{and we walked}} knee-deep among it, {{watching}} the foamy race of the ripples and the whitening of the willows on the far shore. At the place where Nethermere narrows to the upper end, and receives the brook from Strelley, the wood sweeps down and stands with its feet washed round with waters. We broke our way along the shore, crushing the sharp-scented wild mint, whose odour checks the breath, and examining here and there among the marshy places ragged nests of water-fowl, now deserted. Some slim young lap-wings started at our approach, and sped lightly from us, their necks outstretched in straining fear of that which could not hurt them. One, two, fled cheeping into cover of the wood; almost instantly they coursed back again to where we stood, to dart off from us at an angle, in an ecstasy of bewilderment and terror.|$|E
6000|$|We cannot, therefore, {{deny the}} vast change which insects have {{produced}} upon the earth's surface, {{and which has}} been thus forcibly and beautifully delineated by Mr. Grant Allen: [...] "While man has only tilled a few level plains, a few great river valleys, a few peninsular mountain slopes, leaving the vast mass of earth untouched by his hand, the insect has spread himself over every land in a thousand shapes, and has made the whole flowering creation subservient to his daily wants. His buttercup, his dandelion, and his <b>meadow-sweet</b> grow thick in every English field. His thyme clothes the hillside; his heather purples the bleak gray moorland. High up among the alpine heights his gentian spreads its lakes of blue; amid the snows of the Himalayas his rhododendrons gleam with crimson light. Even the wayside pond yields him the white crowfoot and the arrowhead, while the broad expanses of Brazilian streams are beautified by his gorgeous water-lilies. The insect has thus turned the whole {{surface of the earth}} into a boundless flower-garden, which supplies him from year to year with pollen or honey, and itself in turn gains perpetuation by the baits that it offers for his allurement."[160] ...|$|E
60|$|The Theatre lay in {{a meadow}} called the Long Slip. A little mill-stream, {{carrying}} water to a mill two or three fields away, bent round one corner of it, {{and in the middle}} of the bend lay a large old Fairy Ring of darkened grass, which was the stage. The millstream banks, overgrown with willow, hazel, and guelder-rose, made convenient places to wait in till your turn came; and a grown-up who had seen it said that Shakespeare himself could not have imagined a more suitable setting for his play. They were not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and they took their supper--hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope--with them. Three Cows had been milked and were grazing steadily with a tearing noise that one could hear all down the meadow; and the noise of the Mill at work sounded like bare feet running on hard ground. A cuckoo sat on a gate-post singing his broken June tune, 'cuckoo-cuk', while a busy kingfisher crossed from the mill-stream, to the brook which ran on the other side of the meadow. Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy stillness smelling of <b>meadow-sweet</b> and dry grass.|$|E
60|$|The {{flowers are}} quite {{different}} from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills. The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also <b>meadow-sweet,</b> meadow-rue, and comfrey of every shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. Orchis latifolia is in plenty, and also Orchis incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey orchis. Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, Orchis conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact Orchis pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and crow garlic, in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|E
60|$|When {{the ground}} was {{partially}} bare of snow, and a few warm days had dried its surface somewhat, it was pleasant to compare the first tender signs of the infant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty of the withered vegetation which had withstood the winter--life-everlasting, goldenrods, pinweeds, and graceful wild grasses, more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer even, as if their beauty was not ripe till then; even cotton-grass, cat-tails, mulleins, johnswort, hard-hack, <b>meadow-sweet,</b> and other strong-stemmed plants, those unexhausted granaries which entertain the earliest birds--decent weeds, at least, which widowed Nature wears. I am particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the wool-grass; it brings back the summer to our winter memories, and is among the forms which art loves to copy, and which, in the vegetable kingdom, have the same relation to types already {{in the mind of}} man that astronomy has. It is an antique style, older than Greek or Egyptian. Many of the phenomena of Winter are suggestive of an inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy. We are accustomed to hear this king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant; but with the gentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of Summer.|$|E
60|$|The {{instinct}} to couple, starved within herself, was always {{at work in}} June. She stood watching Fleur row back; the girl took her hand off a scull to wave farewell, and June walked languidly on between the meadows and the river, with an ache in her heart. Youth to youth, like the dragon-flies chasing each other, and love like the sun warming them through and through. Her youth! So long ago--when Phil and she--And since? Nothing--no one had been quite what she had wanted. And so she had missed it all. But what a coil was round those two young things, if they really were in love, as Holly would have it--as her father, and Irene, and Soames himself seemed to dread. What a coil, and what a barrier! And the itch for the future, the contempt, as it were, for what was overpast, which forms the active principle, moved {{in the heart of}} one who ever believed that what one wanted was more important than what other people did not want. From the bank, awhile, in the warm summer stillness, she watched the water-lily plants and willow leaves, the fishes rising; sniffed the scent of grass and <b>meadow-sweet,</b> wondering how she could force everybody to be happy. Jon and Fleur! Two little lame ducks--charming callow yellow little ducks! A great pity! Surely something could be done! One must not take such situations lying down. She walked on, and reached a station, hot and cross.|$|E
6000|$|So they did, along a paved {{causeway}} which presently got {{clear of}} the cottages and gables of old factories, and led along, with the brightly glassy sheet of water on one side, and the steep wooded slope on the other, loose-strife and <b>meadow-sweet</b> growing thickly on the bank, amid long weeds with feathery tops, rich brown fingers of sedge, and bur-reeds like German morgensterns, while above the long wreaths of dog-roses projected, the sweet honeysuckle twined about, and the white blossoms of traveller's joy hung in festoons from the hedge of the bordering plantation. After a time they came {{on a kind of}} glade, opening upwards though the wood, with one large oak-tree standing alone in the centre, and behold! on the grass below sat or lay a company-—Mrs. Joseph Brownlow in the midst, under the obnoxious mushroom-hat, reading aloud. Radiating from her were five boys, the biggest of all on his back, with his hat over his eyes, fast asleep; another cross-legged, with a basket between his knees, dividing his attention between it and the book; two more lying frog-like, with elbows on the ground, feet erected behind them, chin in hand, devouring the narrative with their eyes; the fifth wriggling restlessly about, evidently in search of opportunities of mischief or of tormenting tricks. Just within earshot, but sketching the picturesque wooden bridge below, sat one girl. The little one, with her youngest brother, was close at their mother's feet, threading flowers to make a garland. It was a pretty sight, and so intent were most of the party on their occupations that they never saw the pair on the bank till Joe, the idler, started and rolled round with [...] "Hollo!" [...] when all turned, it may be feared with muttered growls from some of the boys; but Carey herself gave a cry of joy, ran down the bank like a girl, and greeted Mary Ogilvie with an eager embrace.|$|E
6000|$|The old Irish {{and the old}} Welsh, {{though they}} had less of the old way than the makers of the Kalavala, had more of it than the makers of the Sagas, {{and it is this}} that distinguishes the {{examples}} Matthew Arnold quotes of their 'natural magic,' of their sense of 'the mystery' more than of 'the beauty' of nature. When Matthew Arnold wrote it was not easy to know as much as we know now of folk song and folk belief, and I do not think he understood that our 'natural magic' is but the ancient religion of the world, the ancient worship of nature and that troubled ecstasy before her, that certainty of all beautiful places being haunted, which it brought into men's minds. The ancient religion is in that passage of the Mabinogion about the making of 'Flower Aspect.' Gwydion and Math made her 'by charms and illusions' 'out of flowers.' 'They took the blossoms of the oak, and the blossoms of the broom, and the blossoms of the <b>meadow-sweet,</b> and produced from them a maiden the fairest and most graceful that man ever saw; and they baptized her, and called her Flower Aspect'; and one finds it in the not less beautiful passage about the burning Tree, that has half its beauty from calling up a fancy of leaves so living and beautiful, they can be of no less living and beautiful a thing than flame: 'They saw a tall tree {{by the side of the}} river, one half of which was in flames from the root to the top, and the other half was green and in full leaf.' And one finds it very certainly in the quotations he makes from English poets to prove a Celtic influence in English poetry; in Keats's 'magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn'; in his 'moving waters at their priest-like task of pure ablution round earth's human shore'; in Shakespeare's 'floor of heaven,' 'inlaid with patens of bright gold'; and in his Dido standing 'on the wild sea banks,' 'a willow in her hand,' and waving it in the ritual of the old worship of nature and the spirits of nature, to wave 'her love to come again to Carthage.' And his other examples have the delight and wonder of devout worshippers among the haunts of their divinities. Is there not such delight and wonder in the description of Olwen in the Mabinogion: 'More yellow was her hair than the flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands and her fingers than the blossoms of the wood-anemone amidst the spray of the meadow fountains.' And is there not such delight and wonder in-- ...|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the south}} of the central {{embankment}} is marshland, damp and water-logged. Rushes are abundant, and plants include Marsh-marigold, Cuckooflower, <b>Meadow-sweet,</b> Ragged-robin, Lesser Spearwort and Common Marsh-bedstraw.|$|E
50|$|Arrhenatherum elatius is a {{principal}} species in two UK National Vegetation Classification habitat communities: the very widespread MG1 (Arrhenatherum elatius grassland) and the much rarer MG2 (Arrhenatherum elatius - Filipendula ulmaria tall-herb grassland). This means {{that it can be}} found with species such as Dactylis glomerata (also known as cock's-foot and orchard grass), and Filipendula ulmaria (also known as <b>meadow-sweet).</b>|$|E
50|$|Acleris shepherdana, the <b>meadow-sweet</b> button, is {{a species}} of moth of the Tortricidae family. It is found in Europe, {{where it has been}} {{recorded}} from Great Britain, France, the Benelux, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Baltic region and European Russia. It is also found in the Russian Far East (Ussuri), Manchuria, Mongolia, China and Japan. The habitat consists of fens, marshes, river-banks and other damp areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{north shore}} is mainly vegetated with scrub and woodland, {{including}} willow, blackthorn, elder, birch, hawthorn, and hazel. Common spotted orchids {{grow in the}} base-rich flushed areas. At the extreme south eastern corner of the site there {{is an area of}} marshy grassland with abundant <b>meadow-sweet,</b> wild angelica, common knapweed, and sneezewort and where there is periodic flooding of the shore you can also find species like common spike rush, reed canary grass, lesser spearwort, and amphibious bistort.|$|E
50|$|The site is ancient {{woodland}} on chalky {{boulder clay}} and sandy loam. It was mainly elm, {{but this has}} died and the wood regenerated naturally with ash, {{and there is also}} some field maple and hornbeam. Bramble and dog's mercury dominate the ground layer, and there is a rich variety of plants in wetter areas, such as oxlip and <b>meadow-sweet.</b> There are many species of birds and butterflies, and four ponds which have great crested newts, dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, Bath Oliver {{biscuits}} seem {{to evoke}} a nostalgic, very English, idyll {{in the first}} chapter of Puck of Pook's Hill by Rudyard Kipling: [...] "child heroes of the story were not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and they took their supper—hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope—with them. ... Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy stillness smelling of <b>meadow-sweet</b> and dry grass."Also the biscuits are a favourite of Inspector Lestrade in the M. J. Trow mystery series.|$|E
50|$|The main {{tree species}} in the Espy Bog include pin oak, silver maple, American elm, white pine, ash, and red maple. The shrub layer in the wetland complex {{consists}} of various species that are common in wetlands. These include poison sumac, buttonbush, smooth alder, silky dogwood, spicebush, willow, winterberry holly, and <b>meadow-sweet.</b> However, some introduced species have also been observed in the wetlands. These include buckthorn, common privet, Morrow's honeysuckle, and multiflora rose. The herbaceous layer contains several types of wetland fern as well as monkey flower, northern blue flag, marsh purslane, marsh St.-John's-wort, bulbiferous water hemlock, two tearthumb species, swamp milkweed, and skunk cabbage. Various sedges and grasses occur in meadow-like openings in the wetland complex, as does soft rush.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} [...] "A New England Nun" [...] captures several qualities of both nature and {{religious}} sentiments. The genre of local color is partially {{characterized by the}} landscape scenes. [...] "There was a full moon that night. About nine o’clock Louisa strolled down the road a little way. There were harvest-fields on either hand, bordered by low stone walls. Luxuriant clumps of bushes grew beside the wall, and trees—wild cherry and old apple trees—at intervals. Presently Louisa {{sat down on the}} wall and looked about her with mildly sorrowful reflectiveness. Tall shrubs of blueberry and <b>meadow-sweet,</b> all woven together and tangled with blackberry vines and horsebriers, shut her in on either side." [...] The emphasis is not on the impact nature has on the humans, nor the humans upon nature. Like a good ecosystem, both nature and humans are able to interact peacefully. However, in spite of the drama of the story, the ecosystem continues on in its natural rhythm.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and <b>meadow-sweet</b> Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, hoary plantain Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus. A drainage ditch along two sides of the site supports five species of willow including purple willow Salix purpurea and almond willow Salix triandra. Common comfrey Symphytum officinale, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, cyperus sedge Carex pseudocyperus and the uncommon aquatic liverwort Riccia fluitans...along this ditch.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} a comprehensive {{data on the}} antioxidant, antimicrobial and neutrophil-modulating ac-tivities of extracts from six medicinal plants — blackber-ry (Rubus fruticosus) leaves, chokeberry (Aronia melano-carpa) leaves, hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) leaves, lady’s mantle (Alchemilla glabra) aerial parts, <b>meadow-sweet</b> (Filipendula ulmaria) aerial parts and raspberry (Rubus idaeus) leaves. In order to analyze the antioxi-dant activity of the herbs, several methods (ORAC, TRAP, HORAC and inhibition of lipid peroxidation) were used. Blackberry leaves and meadowsweet extracts revealed the highest antioxidant activities via all methods. All ex-tracts studied blocked almost completely the opsonized zymosan particle-activated ROS production by neutro-phils from human whole blood. On the other hand, the effect of extracts on phorbol myristate acetate-activated ROS production was much milder and even nonsignifi-cant {{in the case of}} chokeberry leaves. This latter result suggests that extracts (apart from their antioxidative ac-tivity) interfere with the signaling cascade of phagocyte activation upstream of the protein kinase C activation. The antimicrobial activity of the investigated extracts against 11 human pathogens was investigated using three different methods. Meadowsweet and blackberry leaves extracts had the highest antimicrobial effect and the lowest minimal inhibiting concentrations (MICs) against the microorganisms tested.
