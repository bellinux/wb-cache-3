5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number}} of text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s {{were less}} {{successful}} for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The {{completion of the}} Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.|$|E

25|$|The single player {{campaign}} for the Xbox 360, Windows and PlayStation 3 versions are the same. The Wii/PS2 version has a significantly different campaign although the stories are mostly the same. Over {{the course of the}} game, the Proton Pack is upgraded to include an additional firing mode other than the Proton Stream, such as the Shock Blast, Slime Blower (positively charged) and a Meson Collider, each with an alternate firing mode (a Boson Dart, Stasis Stream, Slime Tether and Overload Pulse). By capturing ghosts, as well as identifying cursed artifacts and new species of ghosts using the PKE Meter, players earn in-game <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> upgrades to proton pack modes and ghost traps. The game also tallies monetary destruction caused by the player, with Xbox 360 Achievements and PlayStation 3 Trophies awarded for either minimizing damage done, or for causing a high amount of damage.|$|E
25|$|Clarke's {{spending}} {{had left}} Leeds in a precarious financial situation, and Gray {{was forced to}} concentrate on youth development to rebuild the team. Gray had no <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> team building, and those players he developed were often sold off as well. Young players to emerge during this period included Neil Aspin, Denis Irwin, John Sheridan, Scott Sellars and Bob Taylor – who all enjoyed considerable success at other clubs after leaving Leeds. The 1984–85 season saw Leeds take the promotion battle to the final game, but lost 1–0 away to Birmingham City. However, that game {{will be remembered for}} all the wrong reasons by both clubs due to a high-profile hooliganism incident at St Andrew's stadium. Leeds fans rioted at the game, causing a wall to collapse and crushing a 14-year-old boy to death. 96 policemen were injured, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused by vandalism and graffiti, and the collapsed wall also crushed several parked motor vehicles beyond repair.|$|E

It has been reported by the Daily Telegraph that under the Conservatives, police chiefs {{will no longer be}} given a fixed amount of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> only <b>on</b> PCSOs. Before the 2010 General Election the then Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling was understood to be doubtful of the effectiveness of PCSOs and was concerned that a disproportionate number of them were disciplined in 2009. He stated he would leave it up to individual chief constables to decide whether their particular police force needs PCSOs. However, when interviewed by the Yorkshire Post in May 2009 he suggested that the Conservative Party may well scrap PCSOs altogether.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the SPL was the {{dominance}} of the two Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers. No team outside the Old Firm has won the Scottish league championship since 1985. Until Rangers were ejected from the SPL due to their liquidation, there was only one SPL season (2005–06) where both clubs failed to occupy first and second positions, with Hearts finishing second behind Celtic. While other European leagues were dominated by a few clubs in the 2000s, the Old Firm dominance in Scotland dated {{back to the beginning of}} Scottish league football, with a few exceptional periods. The average home attendances of both clubs is significantly higher than the other Scottish clubs, which resulted in the Old Firm having far greater revenues and therefore more <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> players. Both clubs also received significant revenues from participation in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.|$|E
25|$|As the Great Depression set {{in during}} the post-Broadway {{national}} tour of Show Boat, the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment. Audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic had little <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> entertainment, and only a few stage shows anywhere exceeded a run of 500 performances during the decade. The revue The Band Wagon (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Porter's Anything Goes (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as The Dancing Years, while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including On Your Toes (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), Babes In Arms (1937) and The Boys From Syracuse (1938). Porter added DuBarry Was a Lady (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was Hellzapoppin (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} of ZX Computing {{praised the}} game's difficulty, {{suggesting that it}} was [...] "recommended" [...] for advanced gamers in the wargame genre. Irving criticised the game's value for money and playability, stating that £12.95 was [...] "a lot" [...] of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> a game that the player would most likely dislike. However, Rook heralded the gameplay as [...] "smooth" [...] and [...] "challenging", contrary to other critics.|$|E

In addition, several daily newspapers in Washington, such as the Seattle Daily Times and the Catholic Northwest Progress conjectured that if Initiative 49 were passed, it would deliver the state government {{into the hands of the}} Klan, as had happened in Oregon and Indiana. Finally, said newspapers pointed out the bill would actually cause injury to the public school system- by increasing the number of students attending, the bill would shrink the amount of <b>money</b> available <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> each student.|$|R

500|$|Much of Stelmach's term as Premier was {{dominated}} by questions related to the Athabasca Oil Sands. The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions. After winning the Premiership, Stelmach emphasized {{that he had no}} intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that the economy would find its own appropriate growth rate. He aggressively defended Alberta's oil at home and abroad, and called the idea that it was extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost [...] "a myth". When Liberal Party of Canada leader Stéphane Dion proposed a federal carbon tax to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that it would hurt the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces. Instead, he championed the development of carbon capture technology. In July 2008, Stelmach announced $2billion worth of funding for carbon capture initiatives, for which he was applauded by industry groups. However, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business called it [...] "a huge amount of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> something that isn't proven", and Mike Hudema of Greenpeace suggesting that there were better environmental uses of the money available.|$|E
500|$|In the {{run up to}} the Democratic National Convention, set {{to begin}} at the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896, no {{candidate}} {{was seen as an}} overwhelming favorite for the presidential nomination. [...] The leading candidates were former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. [...] "Silver Dick" [...] Bland was seen as the elder statesman of the silver movement; he had originated the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, while Boies' victories for governor in a normally Republican state made him attractive as a candidate who might compete with McKinley in the crucial Midwest. [...] Both had openly declared their candidacies, and were the only Democrats to have organizations seeking to obtain pledged delegates. [...] Neither candidate had much <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> his campaign. [...] In addition to the frontrunners, other silver men were spoken of as candidates. [...] These included Vice President [...] Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, Indiana Governor Claude Matthews, and Bryan. [...] Illinois Governor Altgeld, a leader of the silver movement, was ineligible because he was not a natural-born U.S. citizen as required for the presidency in the Constitution. [...] When Senator Teller walked out of the Republican convention in protest over the currency plank, he immediately became another possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. [...] However, he was deemed unlikely to succeed, as many Democrats feared that if elected, he might fill some patronage jobs with Republicans. [...] President Cleveland spent the week of the convention fishing, and had no comment about the events there; political scientist Richard Bensel attributes Cleveland's political inaction to the President's loss of influence in his party.|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} between 1866 and 1867, Cope went on trips to western parts of the country. He related to his father his {{scientific}} experiences; to his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life {{as part of her}} education. Cope found educating his students at Haverford [...] "a pleasure", but wrote to his father that he [...] "could not get any work done." [...] He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield, in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey. Due to the time-consuming nature of his Haverford position, Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it out to others, but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits. Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career, he finally sold the farm in 1869. Alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming, and Edward focused on his scientific career. He continued his continental travels, including trips to Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. He visited caves across the region. He stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana, but remained interested in the subject. Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the 1860s, paying periodic visits to the marl pits. The fossils he found in these pits became the focus of several papers, including a description in 1868 of Elasmosaurus platyurus and Laelaps. Marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions. Cope's proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more frequent trips possible. The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard. Two maids tended the estate, which entertained a number of guests. Cope's only concern was for more <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> his scientific work.|$|E
50|$|The {{rapid rise}} in the number of UK food banks since 2009 has often been used as {{evidence}} of growing hunger.

Regression analysis published by Oxford University in 2015 found that it is largely need not simply awareness of foodbanks that is causing the growth in usage. However the academics conducting the research agree that foodbank usage is not the best measure of hunger, saying that studies in other countries have suggested that most people suffering from food poverty don't use food banks.|$|R

This is verified in the quote “the crisis in Ukraine probably has ruined prospects for another formal Russian-U.S. arms control agreement during the Obama administration’s second term". As far as reducing nuclear weapons in other countries, besides Ukraine, there is more of a chance of an agreement. This idea is explained in “countering nuclear weapons proliferation to states and to nonstate actors, the prospects are somewhat better, given mutual Russian and U.S. concerns in that area”. There are still many agreements that have been proposed that can be passed between the United States and Russia as far as nuclear weapons and the control and elimination of them are concerned. As time progresses, the threat of nuclear weapons and the <b>money</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> the elimination of them diminishes.
