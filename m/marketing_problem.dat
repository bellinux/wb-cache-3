2500|$|By the 1990s, GM's {{program of}} sharing {{components}} across divisions {{that began in}} the 70s as a way to cut costs grew into a <b>marketing</b> <b>problem.</b> After the 1984 reorganization forced teamwork by the divisions, parts sharing evolved into wholesale sharing of entire designs and simply re-badging vehicles for each division. Observers suggested that differences between automobiles produced and marketed by the Chevy, Buick, and Oldsmobile divisions were less distinct as a consequence. Automotive commentators cited a lack of a distinct brand identity and demographic changes as crucial factors in the demise of the Oldsmobile division in 2004. Compounding GM's problems was the fact that while entire platforms shared designs, the engineered parts beneath the surface, where customers didn't care or didn't notice were often not shared, which is where money could be saved. Analyst David Cole summed it up: [...] "The engineering was 180 degrees out of phase. GM cars looked alike outside but were all different inside." ...|$|E

According to the results, the most important problems of these managements are: the difficulty of following technology,inadequte demand, difficulty of costumer satistification, cheating and confusing advertisements, excessive competition, and not having talented and educated salesmen. Against these problems, it is understood that service, product, pricing and advertising are mostly focused by the managements.

5000|$|In contrast, {{post-hoc}} segmentation {{makes no}} {{assumptions about the}} optimal theoretical framework. Instead, the analyst's role {{is to determine the}} segments that are the most meaningful for a given <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> or situation. In this approach, the empirical data drives the segmentation selection. Analysts typically employ some type of clustering analysis or structural equation modeling to identify segments within the data. The figure alongside illustrates how segments might be formed using clustering, however note that this diagram only uses two variables, while in practice clustering employs a large number of variables. Post-hoc segmentation relies on access to rich data sets, usually with {{a very large number of}} cases and uses sophisticated algorithms to identify segments.|$|E
50|$|A {{major step}} in the {{segmentation}} process is {{the selection of a}} suitable base. In this step, marketers are looking for a means of achieving internal homogeneity (similarity within the segments), and external heterogeneity (differences between segments). In other words, they are searching for a process that minimises differences between members of a segment and maximises differences between each segment. In addition, the segmentation approach must yield segments that are meaningful for the specific <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> or situation. For example, a person's hair colour may be a relevant base for a shampoo manufacturer, but it would not be relevant for a seller of financial services. Selecting the right base requires a good deal of thought and a basic understanding of the market to be segmented.|$|E

5000|$|In America, the {{commercial}} industry for bison {{has been slow}} to develop despite individuals, such as Ted Turner, who have long marketed bison meat. In the 1990s, Turner found limited success with restaurants for high-quality cuts of meat, which include bison steaks and tenderloin. Lower-quality cuts suitable for hamburger and hot dogs have been described as [...] "almost nonexistent". This created a <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> for commercial farming because the majority of usable meat, about 400 pounds for each bison, is suitable for these products. In 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture purchased $10 million worth of frozen overstock to save the industry, which would later recover through better use of consumer marketing. Restaurants {{have played a role in}} popularizing bison meat, like Ted's Montana Grill, which added bison to their menus. Ruby Tuesday first offered bison on their menus in 2005.|$|E

50|$|Its {{location}} on the Hudson River in Guttenberg {{was said to be}} both its greatest advantage and its biggest drawback. The fact that the Towers has been likened to a self-contained city within a town that is only four-blocks long has plagued the Galaxy's owners from the building's inception. Its unusual status made it difficult to rent units when they were merely apartments, and then selling them after the conversion to condominiums was approved in 1980. Because the Galaxy began as a rental project that subsequently converted to condominium ownership, the Galaxy has had the <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> of tenants who elected not to buy their apartments, but whose occupancy hinders their sale to the public. In addition, environmentalists objected to their construction because they obliterated views of the Hudson Palisades, which they considered a valuable resource.The towers' $3.3 million in real-estate taxes exceeds by more than $1 million what Guttenberg collects {{from the rest of the}} property in town. As of November 2011, one-fifth of the town's population lives in the Towers, though reporter Stephen LaMarca incorrectly stated in the Hudson Reporter that 'most' of the town's population lives in the towers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{brand name}} {{that is well}} known to the {{majority}} of people or households is also called a household name [...] and may be an indicator of brand success. Occasionally a brand can become so successful that the brand becomes synonymous with the category. For example, British people often talk about [...] "Hoovering the house" [...] when they actually mean [...] "vacuuming the house." [...] (Hoover is a brand name). When this happens, the brand name is said to have [...] "gone generic." [...] Examples of brands becoming generic abound; Kleenex, Cellotape, Nescafe, Aspirin and Panadol. When a brand goes generic, it can present a <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> because when the consumer requests a named brand at the retail outlet, they may be supplied with a competing brand. For example, if a person enters a bar and requests [...] "a rum and Coke," [...] the bartender may interpret that to mean a [...] "rum and cola-flavoured beverage," [...] paving the way for the outlet to supply a cheaper alternative mixer. In such a scenario, Coca-Cola Ltd, who after investing in brand building for more than a century, is the ultimate loser because it does not get the sale.|$|E
5000|$|Cullinane's public {{offering}} was of note {{as it was}} the first successful offering of a pure software products company ever and the first software company Hambrecht & Quist ever took public. Cullinet was also the first software company to have a billion dollar valuation, and the first to do a Super Bowl ad. Specifically, Cullinane Database Systems, Inc., went public in 1978. On April 27, 1982 the company became the first computer software firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and later, the first to become a component stock of the S&P 500 Index. However, two quarters after the company went public IBM introduced its 4300 series. Its salesmen told all mutual clients that IDMS didn't run on the 4300 series and that all IBM software of the future would be built with IMS/DL1. This caused a major problem as every IDMS customer went ballistic and every prospect went on hold. The company only had three months to solve this <b>marketing</b> <b>problem</b> and technical problem, and remarkably, they did. Technically, it only required the modification of one instruction to get IDMS running on a 4300. The solution to the company's revenue problem turned out to be its new Integrated Data Dictionary. By moving very fast, the company used it to put IBM on the defensive and made its numbers, no small accomplishment. It then went from winning one out five competitions to winning four out five and this fueled its growth.|$|E
