2500|$|Galton {{wrote a book}} {{entitled}} [...] "Hereditary Genius" [...] about different characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make them more [...] "fit" [...] than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength) are important domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied work in psychometrics was undertaken {{in an attempt to}} measure intelligence. Galton, often referred to as [...] "the father of psychometrics," [...] devised and included mental tests among his anthropometric measures. James McKeen Cattell, who is considered a pioneer of psychometrics went on to extend Galton's work. Cattell also coined the term <b>mental</b> <b>test,</b> and is responsible for the research and knowledge which ultimately {{led to the development of}} modern tests.

2500|$|In psychometrics, item {{response}} theory (IRT), {{also known}} as latent trait theory, strong true score theory, or modern <b>mental</b> <b>test</b> theory, is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of tests, questionnaires, and similar instruments measuring abilities, attitudes, or other variables. It is a theory of testing based {{on the relationship between}} individuals’ performances on a test item and the test takers’ levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. Several different statistical models are used to represent both item and test taker characteristics. Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales and evaluating questionnaire responses, it does not assume that each item is equally difficult. This distinguishes IRT from, for instance, the assumption in Likert scaling that [...] "All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments" [...] (p.197). By contrast, item response theory treats the difficulty of each item (the ICCs) as information to be incorporated in scaling items. ICC stands for item characteristic curve.|$|E

40|$|This article charts {{the history}} of <b>mental</b> <b>testing</b> {{in the context of}} the rise and fall of Russian child science between the 1890 s and the 1930 s. Tracing the {{genealogy}} of testing in scientific experimentation, scholastic assessment, medical diagnostics and bureaucratic accounting, it follows the displacements of this technology along and across the boundaries of the child science movement. The article focuses on three domains of expertise – psychology, pedagogy and psychiatry, examining the key guises that <b>mental</b> <b>testing</b> assumed in them – namely, the experiment, the exam and the diagnosis. It then analyses the failed state-bureaucratic harnessing of <b>mental</b> <b>testing</b> in early Soviet attempts to manage mass education, discussing the peculiar dynamics of the (de) legitimation of testing, as it swung between black-boxing and instrumentalization, on the one hand, and scandal and controversy, on the other. The article argues that <b>mental</b> <b>testing</b> thrived in Russia as a strategically ambiguous and flexibly interpreted ‘boundary object’, which interconnected a highly heterogeneous field, enabling the coexistence and cooperation of diverse occupational agendas and normative regimes...|$|R
