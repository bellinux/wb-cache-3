Actually the Higgs <b>mass</b> <b>window</b> can close completely, which settles an upper bound on the Majorana mass for the right-handed neutrinos, M, ranging from 10 ^ 13 GeV for three generations of quasi-degenerate massive neutrinos with m_ν≃ 2 eV, to 5 × 10 ^ 14 GeV for just one relevant generation with m_ν≃ 0. 1 eV. A slightly weaker upper bound on M, coming from the requirement that the neutrino Yukawa couplings do not develop a Landau pole, is also discussed.
