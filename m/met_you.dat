Peterson knew he would voice Dug when he wrote his line [...] "I have just <b>met</b> <b>you,</b> and I love you," [...] {{which was based on}} what a child told him when he was a camp counselor in the 1980s. The DVD release of the film features a short called Dug's Special Mission, which follows Dug just before his first meeting with Carl and Russell. Dug previously appeared in Ratatouille as a shadow on a wall that barks at Remy.|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics {{revolve around}} the pursuit of love, {{functioning}} as an ode to Fantasia's husband Kendall Taylor. Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When I <b>met</b> <b>you,</b> I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen to me when I tell you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still." [...] The song ends with a spoken word monologue, in which Fantasia details the first time she met Taylor.

Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I <b>met</b> <b>you,</b> I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I <b>Met</b> <b>You)</b> {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E

500|$|The EP {{opens with}} [...] "Call Me Maybe", an upbeat track that draws {{influences}} from dance-pop and R. The clever lyrics {{of the song}} describes the [...] "infatuation and inconvenience of a love at first sight," [...] as described by Bill Lamb of About.com. During the pre-chorus, the singer states, [...] "Ripped jeans, skin was showing/Hot night, wind was blowing/Where you think you’re going, baby?" [...] As the chorus begins, the background incorporates synthesized string chords, and she sings, [...] "Hey, I just <b>met</b> <b>you,</b> And this is crazy, But here's my number, So call me maybe." [...] Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] is a [...] "Taylor Swift meets Robyn" [...] song. The title track, [...] "Curiosity", has a similar sound to [...] "Call Me Maybe", and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs for more of his love. [...] "Picture" [...] is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship. Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content. [...] "Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "Just a Step Away" [...] were both described as mid-tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love, teen love and that first crush. Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks, Carly is able to transcend the listener [...] "to a porch swing or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside’s summer sunshine. Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything that comes along with it." [...] The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Both Sides Now". Musically, the song is also an upbeat ballad, and differs from the original version {{in the sense that}} Jepsen's version is [...] "fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist." [...] Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to [...] "attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit" [...] with her [...] "unique version." ...|$|E
