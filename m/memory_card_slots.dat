25|$|Sony eBook Library was {{not officially}} {{supported}} on Linux-based systems or other operating systems, although when {{the device is}} connected it grants access to its internal flash memory and any <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> {{as though they were}} USB Mass Storage devices (on all models except PRS-500s that have not received the free EPUB upgrade from Sony), allowing the user to transfer files directly. See the Third party tools section below for a third-party software utility that provides comprehensive support for MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux. Note if the device is locked, using the optional 4 digit pin it will not mount via USB, the lock option needs to be disabled in order to mount the device.|$|E
500|$|In late 1995, California-based {{software}} company Working Designs, {{who had previously}} provided the translation for the original Silver Star, signed on to produce the English-language version. The company originally expressed interest in localizing the Saturn version under the name Lunar: Silver Star Story Director's Cut {{to be released in}} Fall 1996. The initial project was dropped due to internal conflicts between Working Designs and Sega of America, and work began on the PlayStation version in 1998. Silver Star Story Complete was headed by company president Victor Ireland, who also served as head translator and localizer. Like the original game, the English version features a lighthearted, non-literal interpretation of the original Japanese script while retaining the same basic story, which now includes American pop culture references, breaking the fourth wall, and slapstick humor. [...] Working Designs kept in close contact with the original Japanese team, adding several new features to the North American version including DualShock controller support, the ability to switch between <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> on the save screen, and the ability to create up to fifteen save files instead of three. Programming and production difficulties stifled progress, resulting in numerous delays and changing release dates until the game's eventual release in May 1999. A stand-alone demo version of the game was distributed to several game stores across the United States which preceded the final version, as well as a Ghaleon punching puppet available with pre-order of Lunar 2 Eternal Blue ...|$|E

50|$|Although many early PDAs did {{not have}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots,</b> now most have either some form of Secure Digital (SD) slot, a CompactFlash slot or a {{combination}} of the two. Although designed for memory, Secure Digital Input/Output (SDIO) and CompactFlash cards are available that provide accessories like Wi-Fi or digital cameras, if the device can support them. Some PDAs also have a USB port, mainly for USB flash drives. Some PDAs use microSD cards, which are electronically compatible with SD cards, but have a much smaller physical size.|$|E
