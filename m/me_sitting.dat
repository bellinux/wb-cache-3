25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was known}} to be {{pressure}} from within the party to force Klein out sooner than planned. [...] On March 23, 2006, Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Lyle Oberg was suspended from the party's legislative caucus for six months and dismissed from the Cabinet after he told constituents in Brooks that he would not urge delegates at the March 31 leadership review to support Klein. [...] Oberg had been considered a contender for the leadership prior to this decision, but described the premier's directive regarding the June 1 deadline as a [...] "bombshell" [...] and infuriated fellow Tories when he told constituents [...] "If I were the premier, I wouldn't want <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> as a backbencher... I know where all the skeletons are." [...] Despite this, Oberg pressed on with his leadership campaign and was re-admitted to caucus on July 25, 2006.|$|E

6000|$|... "'You're a man, Mr. Whamond,' says she, 'that the {{minister}} delights to honor, and so you'll oblige <b>me</b> by <b>sitting</b> {{in his own}} armchair.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Granny Fox after a while, [...] "that Meadow Mouse {{thinks he}} can fool <b>me</b> by <b>sitting</b> still. I'll give him a scare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Let’s go {{down into}} the cabin,’ she ses, at last, with a little shiver; ’it makes <b>me</b> melancholy <b>sitting</b> here and {{thinking}} of the [...] "might-have-beens."’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Giles, why didn't {{you come}} across to me?" [...] she asked, with arch reproach. [...] "Didn't you see <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> there ever so long?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{soon the}} rising moon, that lights The eve of my defeat, Shall see <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> as of yore By my old master's feet.|$|E
60|$|This {{is the way}} it all {{looks and}} seems to <b>me,</b> <b>sitting</b> over under the big hemlock, out of sight, and {{watching}} the birds through my field-glass.|$|E
6000|$|Our eyes met, but I {{could not}} stand his inquiring glance and looked down. He came to <b>me,</b> and <b>sitting</b> {{on the arm of}} my chair, {{put his hand on my}} {{shoulder}} and said affectionately,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t {{think you}} can expect to get the full benefit unless you do," [...] he ses, coming up close to <b>me</b> and <b>sitting</b> down agin. [...] "It’s a bit of a shock at fust, but Halloa!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{went down}} on one knee and, placing her arms round me, {{assisted}} <b>me</b> to a <b>sitting</b> posture.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Surely, sir, {{you do me}} strange injustice!’ said I, now {{the master}} of myself. ‘You see <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> here, a {{monument}} of tranquillity: pray may I help myself to wine without umbraging you?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it's {{stronger}} than mine. It made me come out, when I thought I had much better not, {{and it keeps}} <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> here long after I should have started for home." ...|$|E
60|$|As if {{in answer}} to my question, the lad entered at that moment, and upon seeing <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> up, talking to Michelot, he uttered an exclamation of joy, and hurried forward to my bedside.|$|E
6000|$|To this I replied: [...] "She is {{a native}} of the Middle West--Ohio, I believe. No, she does not do this for a living; in fact, she makes no charge for her services. She is very gentle and lady-like, and much interested, naturally, in {{converting}} you to spiritualism; for, like most psychics, she believes in spirits. She says her 'controls' have especially urged her to give <b>me</b> <b>sittings.</b> I am highly flattered to think the spirit folk should consider me so particularly valuable to their cause. Seriously, I hope you will appreciate the wonderful concessions Mrs. Smiley is making in thus putting herself into our hands with the almost certain result of being discredited by some of us. I believe she really is doing it from a sense of duty, and is entitled to be treated fairly." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked down}} on <b>me.</b> She was <b>sitting</b> upon a parapet of the {{brickwork}} and I was below her. She seemed to be weighing possibilities.|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted <b>me</b> into a <b>sitting</b> position, and I could see with my own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they went}} on, and I heard 'em being {{attended}} to {{by some of}} our fellows. They didn't {{know what they were}} doing, or they couldn't have missed <b>me</b> <b>sitting,</b> the way they did.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely, sir, {{you do me}} strange injustice!" [...] said I, now {{the master}} of myself. [...] "You see <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> here, a {{monument}} of tranquillity: pray may I help myself to wine without umbraging you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will go away}} again, now," [...] Annie said, getting up. [...] "He told me to keep {{on walking}} about, {{and he would not}} like it if he were to wake up and find <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|My friend Private Mulvaney told <b>me</b> this, <b>sitting</b> on the parapet of {{the road}} to Dagshai, when we were hunting {{butterflies}} together. He had theories about the Army, and colored clay pipes perfectly. He said that the young soldier is the best to work with, [...] "on account av the surpassing innocinse av the child." ...|$|R
60|$|They left my dear girl {{still sitting}} at the piano and <b>me</b> still <b>sitting</b> beside her. When they were gone out, I drew my arm round her waist. She put her left hand in mine (I was sitting on that side), but kept her right upon the keys, going over and over them without {{striking}} any note.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my boy," [...] said Mr. Touchett, [...] "not {{unless you}} bury <b>me</b> in a <b>sitting</b> posture, {{as some of}} the ancients--was it the ancients?--used to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The sun is halfway down, Beric; I {{will wait}} for you till it touches that hill over there. Till then you will find <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> by the first tree {{at the spot where}} we left the forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] {{continued}} the skipper, [...] "at {{any time you}} felt like taking too much, and you stopped with the beer-mug half-way to your lips, and thought of <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> in this disgraceful state, what would you do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know she}} does, but she won't let me relieve her, even for an hour. It isn't because she doesn't trust me; she says it's because she doesn't want <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> there--so--publicly. She doesn't oppose my {{housekeeping}} any more--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He heard <b>me</b> out, <b>sitting</b> with crossed legs. Sometimes {{his head}} would {{disappear}} completely {{in a great}} eruption of smoke, and a sympathetic growl would come out from the cloud. When I finished he uncrossed his legs, laid down his pipe, leaned forward towards me earnestly with {{his elbows on the}} arms of his chair, {{the tips of his fingers}} together.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let {{me look at}} it,' {{said the}} old neighbour. 'Ah, I thought so; it is a turkey's egg. Once, when I was young, they tricked <b>me</b> to <b>sitting</b> on a brood of turkey's eggs myself, {{and when they were}} hatched the creatures were so stupid that nothing would make them learn to swim. I have no {{patience}} when I think of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't refuse me," [...] Vont went on, {{his voice}} strong enough now. [...] "Watch me and listen," [...] he added, leaning forward. [...] "There's {{my hand on}} the Book. Here's my right hand to Heaven, and I swear by the living God that if you fail me, you shall find <b>me</b> to-morrow, <b>sitting</b> dead. That's what your broken oath will do." ...|$|R
6000|$|GERALD. Good night.--They're very bucked to see <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> {{here with}} a woman--a young lady as they'll say. I guess your name will be flying round to-morrow. They stop partly {{to have a good}} look at you. Do they know you, do you think? ...|$|E
6000|$|Phil {{caught up}} to her and {{instantly}} began to complain. [...] "Say, you certainly made a sight out of yourself--and out of me--leaving <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> there with the waiter laughing his boob head off at me. Lord! I'll never dare go near the place again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{would often}} put their children--particular their little girls,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'upon my knee; and many a time {{you might have}} seen <b>me</b> <b>sitting</b> at their doors, when night was coming in, a'most as if they'd been my Darling's children. Oh, my Darling!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Among superstitions that I, after all, cherish. Mon siège est fait--a great {{glittering}} crystal palace. How many panes {{will you}} reward <b>me</b> for amiably <b>sitting</b> {{up with you}} by smashing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took his}} self-reproach literally. [...] "You couldn't have seen <b>me.</b> I was <b>sitting</b> pretty far back, and I went out {{before any of}} your family saw me. Don't you go there?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't need you. I've been elected.
