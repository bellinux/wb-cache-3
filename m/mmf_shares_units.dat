40|$|AbstractShared service {{centers have}} emerged since the 1990 s and {{refer to a}} variety of functions: {{information}} technology, SAP support, accounting, payroll, management reporting, purchasing, call centers, help lines, market surveys via phone or the internet. <b>Shared</b> service <b>units</b> can be organized in several forms but are in each case a particular value pattern distinct from the standard market price/ shareholder profit pattern. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze value patterns, and this article is part of a wider research on value based management. <b>Shared</b> service <b>units</b> can be organized according to the organizational design of the matrix organization, or according to the multidimensional organization. <b>Shared</b> service <b>units</b> may be charged via a transfer price system to the receiving corporate related company. These are iterative activities, organized according to the activity based costing logic. Alternatively, shared services can refer to more complex functions that provide service to corporate functions, and can be organized according to the multidimensional organization logic as allocations to the operating units. The value proposition of <b>shared</b> service <b>units</b> differs from market price and profit driven financial statements. <b>Shared</b> service <b>units</b> require low personnel cost and stability, both of which indicate to Romania as a favorable location. These are the two arguments in favor of shared services as a specific model for Romanian companies, a country in which we find evidence shared services have been set up in the past ten years as parts of corporations...|$|R

40|$|Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) memory systems {{suffer from}} the effects of {{destructive}} thread interference. This interference reduces performance predictability because it depends heavily on the memory access pattern and intensity of the co-scheduled threads. In this work, we confirm that all <b>shared</b> <b>units</b> must be thread-aware in order to provide memory system fairness. However, the current proposals for fair memory systems are complex as they require an interference measurement mechanism and a fairness enforcement policy for all hardware-controlled <b>shared</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, they often sacrifice system throughput to reach their fairness goals which is not desirable in all systems. In this work, we show that our novel fairness mechanism, called the Dynamic Miss Handling Architecture (DMHA), is able to reduce implementation complexity by using a single fairness enforcement policy for the complete hardware-managed shared memory system. Specifically, it controls the total miss bandwidth available to each thread by dynamically manipulating the number of Miss Status Holding Registers (MSHRs) available in each private data cache. When fairness is chosen as the metric of interest and we compare to a state-of-the-art fairness-aware memory system, DMHA improves fairness by 26 % on average with the single program baseline. With a different configuration, DMHA improves throughput by 13 % on average compared to a conventional memory system...|$|R
