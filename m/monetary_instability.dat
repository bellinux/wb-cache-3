Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955.

Through the exchange rate policy, countries can influence their economies, i. e. price stability and export competiveness. Croatia is a new EU member state, {{it has its own}} monetary policy and currency but it is on the way to euro introduction. Regarding the experiences {{from the beginning of the}} 1990 s when Croatia was faced with serious <b>monetary</b> <b>instabilities</b> and hyperinflation, the goal of Croatian National Bank (CNB) is to ensure price stability and one way to do so is through exchange rate policy. Croatia, as a small and open economy, has applied a managed floating exchange rate regime. The exchange rate is determined primarily by the foreign exchange supply and demand on the foreign exchange market, with occasional market interventions by the CNB. Therefore, in order to maintain exchange rate stability, policymakers must be able to recognize how changes in these factors affect changes in the exchange rate. This research aims to find a relationship among the main sources of foreign currency inflow and outflow and the level of exchange rate in Croatia. The analysis is carried out by using the bounds testing (ARDL) approach for co-integration. The results indicate the existence of a stable co-integration relationship between the observed variables, whereby an increase in the majority of variables leads to an exchange rate appreciation...|$|R

50|$|In {{the study}} of the social history of Serbia and urban elites of Belgrade in the late 19th and early 20th century, members of the Veljković Family were unavoidable, they were famous politicians, jurists and officers, who, by their education, {{political}} and military commitments and cultural engagement, had a huge influence on social, political, cultural and artistic life of Serbia. The founder of the family, Jovan Veljković, was the son of Veljko Miljković, the duke of Paraćin, and {{one of the leaders of}} the First Serbian Uprising led by Karađorđe, a colonel and a Minister of Justice. In 1832, in collusion with Prince Miloš, Jovan stirred up a rebellion in the nahiye (administrative unit) of Paraćin. As a result, six more nahiyes were returned to Serbia in compliance with the Treaty of Bucharest of 1812. In his old age, he joined the barricades during the bombing of Belgrade in 1862. Under Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević he served as the Minister of Finance. Privately, he was a weapons collector and a subscriber to the first editions of the Belgrade newspaper. His eldest son, Jevrem, aide-de-camp to Prince Mihailo, was trained at the Prussian Military Academy, took part in the activities of the United Serbian Youth and was known as a great lover of literature. He continued his father’s tradition and passion for collecting weapons and for the literature. The younger son Stojan received his doctoral degree in law in Heidleberg and pursued postdoctoral studies in Berlin and Paris. He served as minister of justice, president of the Court of Cassation and, with Jovan Ristić, the leader of the Liberals and a diplomat, drew up the Constitution of 1859. He taught Roman and criminal law at the Belgrade Great School. As the Minister of Justice, he was responsible for the enactment of the Agrarian Reform Law which provided for the economic independence of the peasants in the newly liberated regions of Serbia. Prestigious European universities were alma maters for the next generation of the family as well, a privilege of the few in Serbia at the time. Stojan had two sons, Jovan and Vojislav. Jovan graduated from the Military Academy, served as King Milan’s aide-de-camp and fought in the First World War. The younger Vojislav, the “father of the Yugoslav golden dinar”, received his doctoral degree in law from the Sorbonne with highest honours. He was the professor of the Administrative law at the Lyceum, a Serbia’s delegate to the First Hague Peace Conference, and a secretary to the King Aleksandar Obrenović. After the First World War, in 1919, he served as the Minister of Finance under Regent Aleksandar Karađorđević. In the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (SCS) marked by <b>monetary</b> <b>instability</b> and currency chaos, Vojislav Veljković developed a new monetary system and carried out currency reform. The Ministry of Finance he headed introduced a single currency: the dinar. His activity in the area of monetary policy and public purse management includes the law on the central bank of the Kingdom of SCS passed in 1920. Later that year, after the great professional success, he withdrew from politics and devoted himself to the Serbian Literary Herald as one of its founders, and to collecting art. Inspired by Palazzo Medici, he had the headquarters of the Vračar Cooperative Bank built (today housing the Embassy of Turkey), and in its courtyard, an atelier for the painter Beta Vukanović, his advisor on new acquisitions for his art collection. His home at 21 Birčaninova Street was a venue for prominent writers, artists, scientists and politicians, such as Jovan Cvijić, Jaša Prodanović, Paja Jovanović, Uroš Predić and many others. Stojan V. Veljković was an industrialist, and a co-owner of a Steam mill and a brewery with his brother.|$|E

In this context, the thesis presents an intitutional analisys about central banks {{as well as it}} shows the logic of historical evolution of central banks and the importance of them for regulating the financial and <b>monetary</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the capitalist economy. The thesis is divided in five chapters: first of all, there is an introdution; in chapters two, tree and four it presents the historical origins of central banks, the evolution of their functions and the relations of them with government and private banks; the last one presents the principal conclusions. The historical analisys of central banks concludes that they are important institutions to the economic system. Why? Because they result from a process that shows the relation between the evolution of payments system and the public action. Due to this, the central banks are singular institutions: at the same time, they are part of State structure and of the private credit system. How do the relations between the central banks and the private banks apear? The answer comes into view when an important function of central banks is analysed, that is to say, the "lender of last resort" function. The performance of this function creates a basic trade-off to the central banks: the central banks condition of "lender of last resort" conducts the private banks to a situation which they can have more risk positions. The classics denominated this trade-off as "moral azard". By the way the "moral azard" defines the characteristic private banks of the relations between central banks and On the other hand, the ambivalence of the central banks and the relations of them with the private banks determine a specific connection between the central banks and government: the central banks can not be totally independent as well as they can not be completly dependent from government. Finally, the idea of interdependence defines the characteristics of central banks as well as it shows the relations of them with government and private banks. Why? Because the concept of interdependence brings the contradiction and the ambivalence that are part of these relations. On the other hand, the notion of interdependence explains the variability and the evolution of central banks norms as well as it shows the permanent conflict between the lagal rule of central banks and their specific action...|$|R

Based on the largest dataset of its kind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates economic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery. Far from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure investment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's track record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich democracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive projects results in the buildup of debt, <b>monetary</b> expansion, <b>instability</b> in financial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We conclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation of surfacing economic and financial problems in China.
