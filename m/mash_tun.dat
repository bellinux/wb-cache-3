500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a <b>mash</b> <b>tun.</b> The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extraction}} {{is done in}} a large kettle (usually made {{of stainless}} steel) called a <b>mash</b> <b>tun.</b> At first, the hot water dissolves the sugars (maltose) and enzymes (diastase) in the grist. Then the enzymes act on the starch {{left over from the}} malting stage, continuing the conversion to sugar, and producing a sugary liquid called wort. Typically, each batch of grist is mashed three times or so to extract all the fermentable sugars. [...] The first water is injected at approximately 60°C, the second portion at approximately 72°C and the third and final portion at approximately 88°C. [...] The wort from the first two water courses is drained into [...] "washback" [...] vessels for further processing, whereas the third course is retained as the first charge in the next batch.|$|E

50|$|Juniper {{is used in}} the {{traditional}} farmhouse ales of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. In Norway, the beer is brewed with juniper infusion instead of water, while in the other countries the juniper twigs are mainly used in the mash, as filters to prevent the crushed malts from clogging the outlet of the <b>mashing</b> <b>tun.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... Bladnoch was {{scheduled}} to resume production by spring of 2017, with much new equipment, including four 5 tonne <b>mash</b> <b>tuns,</b> six Douglas Fir wooden washbacks, two 12,500 litre capacity wash stills, two 9,500 litre capacity low wines stills, and a steam boiler that will be fuelled with LPG. [...] In late 2016, Prior officially relaunched Bladnoch, and announced three new expressions, created from aged stocks by master distiller Ian MacMillan: the no age statement Samsara, the 15-year-old Adela and the 25-year-old Talia.|$|R

500|$|In 1973, Watney Mann {{commissioned}} a new brewhouse. In 1979 a new £6million lager plant was started, initially brewing Holsten. By the early 1980s the brewery had beer production volumes of around 400,000 barrels per annum and employed around 600 people. At this time, the brewery {{was described as}} [...] "wonderfully traditional" [...] by Roger Protz and had open fermentation vessels, <b>mash</b> <b>tuns</b> and copper brewing vessels. Production of Budweiser began in 1984. Having previously been used for storage, in 1986 the historic Long Can Hall was converted to function as the brewery's visitor's centre.|$|R
5000|$|Shepherd Neame {{has been}} making beer at its {{historic}} site in the market town of Faversham, Kent, for more than 500 years. It still uses traditional methods and 100% natural ingredients to create a portfolio of award-winning classic ales, contemporary beers and internationally celebrated lagers. Every beer is brewed with chalk-filtered mineral water from the brewery’s own artesian well, deep below the brewery, and 93% of the hops used in its beers are grown in Kent. [...] Centuries of brewing experience have been passed down to the current team of brewers, who still use many traditional methods, including handcrafting beer in the UK’s last remaining unlined solid oak <b>mash</b> <b>tuns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Springbank then dries its barley using peat sourced from Islay {{for various}} lengths of time (30 to 48 hours) to imbue {{different}} levels of the smoky flavor associated with Scottish whisky. Unpeated malt becomes Hazelburn, whereas medium-peated and heavily-peated malts become the distillery's Springbank and Longrow labels, respectively. Once dried, the barley is ground into grist, mashed into warm water to extract the barley sugars, and fermented for 72-110 hours in cast iron open-top <b>mash</b> <b>tuns.</b> This long fermentation period allows {{for the formation of}} esters that shape the fruity secondary characteristics that help make the identity of the final product. The liquid (essentially, now beer) goes into the stills for the distillation phase.|$|R

50|$|In 1970 the {{distillery}} {{was greatly}} expanded, and an entire new building with six new stills {{was taken in}} operation. The four older stills remained in operation alongside the new stills. The old side of the distillery was then updated over the next decade. First, new installations for milling, mashing and fermentation were built in 1973, and in 1975 the distillery added a dark grains plant, which produces cattle feed from the draff. In 1984 the old side of the distillery was mothballed, and the new side followed the next year, temporarily ending production entirely. The new side of the distillery resumed production in 1991. The old side didn't resume production, and was demolished in 1999. In 2000 a mash filter press was installed in the distillery, which is unique in Scottish malt whisky production; all other Scottish whisky distilleries use <b>mash</b> <b>tuns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its equipment the brewery contained machinery for manufacturing aerated water and ice. The brewing system {{was based on the}} gravitational principle and was extensively described in the Australian Brewers' Journal, July 20, 1895. Water was raised by a pump to an iron tank {{at the top of the}} tower and passed into water-coolers and then insulated tanks on the floors below. Also housed in the tower were the hot-liquor vat, grist cases, <b>mash</b> <b>tuns</b> and the copper-room containing two open steam copper boilers. On the second floor were ammonia-condensing coils, refrigerators and a fermenting room; a large, lofty space with cavity walls to ensure a cool stable temperature. In the basement of the tower were the engine and mill rooms and the refrigerating and ice-making machinery. The remainder of the cellar and the main floor above were used for storage.|$|R
5000|$|Initially a small undertaking, with an {{output of}} just 30,000 gallons per annum, the {{distillery}} expanded over time, {{and by the}} time Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery in the 1880s, it had grown to cover some 14 acres. In his book, The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom, Barnard described Marrowbone Lane as having some of the biggest distilling equipment in the world, including two <b>mash</b> <b>tuns</b> with capacities in excess of 100,000 gallons, which were the [...] "said to be the largest in the United Kingdom". At its peak, the distillery was the second largest in Dublin (then one of the world's largest whiskey distilling centres), with an output of 900,000 gallons per annum, and a staff of 200, including 30 coopers. The whiskey produced at the distillery, known as [...] "Dublin Whiskey" [...] was chiefly exported to Australia, Canada, India and the United States.|$|R

50|$|Liquid adjuncts {{are either}} sucrose syrups or syrups from a grain (maize, rice or wheat), are added {{directly}} to the wort kettle and therefore {{can be used to}} reduce loading on the <b>mash</b> and lauter <b>tun</b> and effectively increase the brewhouse capacity. Liquid adjuncts may also be added after fermentation as primings sugars to give sweetness to the beer for secondary fermentation as in cask or bottle conditioning.|$|R
50|$|In {{decoction}} mashing, {{part of the}} mash {{is taken}} out of the <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> and placed in a cooker, where it is boiled for a period of time. This caramelizes some of the sugars, giving the beer a deeper flavor and color, and frees more starches from the grain, making for a more efficient extraction from the grains. The portion drawn off for decoction is calculated so that the next rest temperature is reached by simply putting the boiled portion back into the <b>mash</b> <b>tun.</b> Before drawing off for decoction, the mash is allowed to settle a bit, and the thicker part is typically taken out for decoction, as the enzymes have dissolved in the liquid, and the starches to be freed are in the grains, not the liquid. This thick mash is then boiled for around 15 minutes, and returned to the <b>mash</b> <b>tun.</b>|$|E

50|$|Royal Brackla has a <b>mash</b> <b>tun,</b> 12.5 tonnes {{and eight}} wash backs {{with a total}} volume of 480,000 litres. Cawdor Burn has been the {{constant}} water supply for Royal Brackla, with the Cursack Springs being used for mashing.|$|E
50|$|Breconshire Brewery was {{established}} when beer distributing company C.H. Marlow decided {{to expand into}} beer production. Marlow established the brewery {{in a part of}} their warehouse in Brecon. The brewery's copper, <b>mash</b> <b>tun,</b> lauter tun and fermenters came thirdhand from Pembrokeshire Brewery.|$|E
50|$|Mackmyra has two active distilleries. The {{first went}} on stream at Mackmyra in 2002, {{featuring}} a full-sized pot still from Forsyth's in Rothes, Scotland, Swedish stainless steel washbacks and a German <b>mash</b> <b>tun,</b> with a production capacity of 600,000 bottles a year.|$|E
50|$|Lochside was latterly {{fitted with}} a cast iron <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> and open {{stainless}} steel washbacks. Distillation was carried out using 2 wash stills and 2 spirit stills. The distillery was also fitted with grain stills, which, under DYC's tenure, were unused. Spirit was matured in ex-bourbon casks.|$|E
50|$|The malt is {{then placed}} in a wooden <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> and hot brewing liquor made from water boiled with juniper boughs and berries, is poured into the tun. The porridge-like mixture called mash is first {{thoroughly}} agitated and then left to rest {{for a couple of}} hours.|$|E
50|$|If the {{lauter tun}} is a {{separate}} vessel from the <b>mash</b> <b>tun,</b> the mash is transferred to the lauter tun at this time. If the brewery has a combination mash-lauter tun, the agitator is stopped after mash-out temperature is reached and the mash has mixed enough to ensure a uniform temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{water of}} the region Speyside, which the {{distillery}} belongs to, comes from Bardon Burn. The malt is purchased from Castle Head Maltings in Elgin. The distillery has one <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> (12 tonnes), eight washbacks (54,000 l), three washstills (14,400 l) and three spirit stills (17,000 l). The distillery works run on steam.|$|E
50|$|A new {{brewhouse}} {{was installed}} at the ancient brewery in 2012. The old <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> was replaced with a mash conversion vessel and lauter-tun system, which broadens the beer styles that can be brewed there, in particular opening up the possibility of brewing lagers as well as ales. The brewhouse was officially opened by HRH Princess Anne on 18 January 2013.|$|E
50|$|Production was {{upgraded}} in 1990, {{with the}} distillery becoming {{capable of producing}} a million litres of spirit a year. It uses a traditional copper - domed cast iron <b>mash</b> <b>tun,</b> four washbacks made of Oregon pine, and four spirit stills. The whisky is matured in both former bourbon whiskey and sherry casks. Maturation {{takes place at the}} distillery at Deanston.|$|E
5000|$|According to BrewBound.com, the Stony Creek Brewery has {{produced}} [...] "more than 10,000 barrels {{during its first}} 12 months." [...] Crowley also predicts, [...] "to have over 288,000 people through the brewery this year." [...] Recognizing that demand was quickly outpacing supply, Stony Creek reinvested $3 million on 13 new fermentation tanks, two bright beer tanks, a dedicated <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> and a centrifuge.|$|E
5000|$|Mashing {{converts}} the starches released {{during the}} malting stage into sugars {{that can be}} fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a <b>mash</b> <b>tun.</b> In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed {{together to create a}} cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This [...] "conversion" [...] is called saccharification. The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or [...] "wort", which is then strained through the bottom of the <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> in a process known as lautering. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about 75 - 78 C (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as sparging).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{transport}} {{limitations in}} earlier centuries, products from Taynton sometimes included substantial monoliths. In the 17th century Robert Plot recorded that Sir Compton Reade had a stone <b>mash</b> <b>tun</b> made at Taynton that measured 6+3/8 * 3+3/8 * 4+1/2 ft and held about 65 bushels (about 2,400 litres). A team of 21 horses hauled it by road from Taynton to Shipton-under-Wychwood, {{a distance of}} about 4 mi.|$|E
