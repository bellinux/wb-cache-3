5|$|Napoleon's baptism {{took place}} in Ajaccio on 21 July 1771; he was piously raised as a Catholic but he never {{developed}} <b>much</b> <b>faith.</b> As an adult, Napoleon was a deist. Napoleon's deity was an absent and distant God. However he had a keen appreciation {{of the power of}} organized religion in social and political affairs, and paid {{a great deal of attention}} to bending it to his purposes. He noted the influence of Catholicism's rituals and splendors. Napoleon had a civil marriage with Joséphine de Beauharnais, without religious ceremony. Napoleon was crowned Emperor on 2 December 1804 at Notre-Dame de Paris in a ceremony presided over by Pope Pius VII. On 1 April 1810, Napoleon married the Austrian princess Marie Louise in a Catholic ceremony. During his brother's rule in Spain, he abolished the Spanish Inquisition in 1813. Napoleon was excommunicated by the Catholic Church, but later reconciled with the Church before his death in 1821.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{failure to}} advance in Italy prompted the Combined Chiefs of Staff to postpone Operation Anvil, the on-again-off-again proposal for Allied landings {{along the coast}} of southern France coinciding with Overlord. Clark told Devers that another attack on the Gustav Line could not be mounted until May, and VI Corps could not be withdrawn from Anzio until it succeeded. But planning for Anvil, begun in mid-January by AFHQ's Force 163 in Algiers continued. Initially Clark was to lead the assault, with Lucas taking over Fifth Army. Devers did not have <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in either of them, even before Lucas' relief. Lyman Lemnitzer later recalled that Fifth Army staff feared that Devers would relieve Clark every time the two met.|$|E
5|$|Clyde began 1974 {{season with}} a 3–0 record, but became embroiled in {{controversy}} following a dispute between new manager Billy Martin and general manager Bobby Brown. Martin and Brown argued about what {{was the best way}} on handling Clyde's future development, which led to Brown's resignation and caused Clyde to miss a month before remaining on the Rangers roster {{for the rest of the}} year. He played in 28 games (21 starts) and finished with 3–9 record, and a 4.38 ERA. He started one game in 1975 (a loss) before injuring his shoulder and was demoted to the Pittsfield Rangers of the Eastern League. He stayed in the minors for three seasons, having a shoulder operation in 1976. The Rangers organization lost so <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in Clyde's ability that he was left unprotected in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft, but was not chosen. He played for the Sacramento Solons in 1976, and the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League in 1977 where he had 5–7 record with a 5.84 ERA. When the season ended, the Rangers traded Clyde and veteran Willie Horton to the Cleveland Indians for Tom Buskey and John Lowenstein on February 28, 1978.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January Derby told Haig that {{he saved}} Robertson from the sack by {{threatening}} resignation. He also hinted to Haig {{that the government}} wanted the removal of Launcelot Kiggell (“a tired man”) as BEF Chief of Staff, and that General Butler, Haig’s preferred choice, was not acceptable. Haig had {{an interview with the}} King (2 January) to pick up his Field Marshal’s baton. Haig appears to have been placing too <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in recent German peace feelers ("Germany is now ready, we are told, to give all we want in these respects"), now known not have been seriously intended. He told the King that British soldiers (who, in a large conscript army, now included men from “all classes in the nation, and many are most intelligent”) needed to be told what they were fighting for. In Haig’s view, Britain should keep to her original war aims - the defence of France and liberation of Belgium - not try to gain Alsace-Lorraine for France or Trieste for Italy. In Haig's view the “democratising of Germany”, about to be publicly reiterated by Lloyd George as a British aspiration in his Caxton Hall speech (5 January), was likely to destabilise Germany, as the fall of the Tsar in March 1917 had destabilised Russia, and was not “worth the loss of an Englishman” (like many Scots of his era, Haig often referred to Britain or even the British Empire as “England”).|$|E

He added that this can be regarded the best among his films. Michael Nordine characterised Gatlif's directorial style as passive and [...] "documentarian", such that it [...] "sometimes verges on emotional distance". [...] "What easily noticeable flourishes he adds tend to be understated", he added. Eric Hynes at TimeOut lauded Gatlif's work in making a celebration of textures and music of the Romani out of a melodramatic story. East County Magazines negative review summed that Gatlif had too <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> on his audience, [...] "expecting them to take everything at face value".|$|E
500|$|In {{regard to}} his own time, Villani {{provides}} modern historians with valuable details on Florentine social and living habits, such as the growing trend and craze of wealthy Florentines in building large country homes far outside of the city. However, the early 20th-century historian Philip Wicksteed stated of Villani, [...] "When dealing with his own times, and with events immediately connected with Florence, he is a trustworthy witness, but minute accuracy is never his strong point; and in dealing with distant times and places he is hopelessly unreliable." [...] For example, although Nicolai Rubinstein acknowledged that Villani's chronicles were much more matured and developed than earlier ones, Villani still relied on legend and hearsay {{to account for the}} origins of cities such as Fiesole. On Villani's estimation that a third of Antwerp's population died off during the Great Famine of 1315-1317, the early 20th-century historian Henry S. Lucas wrote, [...] "not <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> can be placed in such statistics which are little better than guesses."

They {{eliminated the}} one-year ban because they judged it to be ineffective in protecting the Constitution. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney moved that the states vote and the prohibition carried by vote of 8 states to 3. Robert Yates noted that the clause [...] "which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased" [...] was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created. Madison moved that the phrase [...] "or the Emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter." [...] This motion failed 2–8, with one state divided. The clause was limited to [...] "civil" [...] offices so as not to restrict military service. Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of The Lion King coincided {{with that of}} Pocahontas, {{which most of the}} animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two. The story artists also did not have <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job [...] "because the story wasn't very good", and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft [...] "I don't know who {{is going to want to}} watch that one." [...] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal. Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa. Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] sequence, were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King. Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.|$|E

2500|$|The {{subject matter}} of the album also {{distinguished}} it from its predecessor. Beckett addressed the psychological nature of war in [...] "No Man Can Find the War", and Underwood welcomed Buckley's entry into darker territory with [...] "Pleasant Street". [...] "I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain" [...] represented a confessional lyric to his estranged wife and child, while the mix of introspective folk songs and political-themed content attracted folk fans and anti-war audiences alike. Elektra owner Jac Holzman had <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in the young up-and-comer, renting advertising space for the musician on the Sunset Strip which was virtually unheard of for an unestablished solo act. Holzman stated, [...] "the combined effect of his words, his music, his passion, his persona struck a particular resonance."

Stan had many highlights that year. He had a walk-off home run against the Milwaukee Braves on June 27 {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning to win the game 4–3. Lopata finished fourth in the fan voting for catchers on the National League all-star roster, tallying 16,197 votes. He received his second all-star nomination when a roster spot opened up after Braves catcher Del Crandall was injured and unable to play. On August 11, Lopata ended Brooklyn Dodgers hurler Don Newcombe's 39 scoreless innings streak with a two-run home run in a 5–2 losing effort. Lopata led all major league catchers in slugging percentage by posting up a [...]535 mark. His 32 home runs set a since-broken Phillies' team record for right-handed batters. The Phillies had a lackluster season overall with a 71–83 record, but management did not fault Lopata. They had so <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in him that after the season was over, they stated that every player on the roster was subject to possible trade except for Lopata.|$|E
2500|$|For Hauerwas, the Niebuhrs are {{important}} figures {{in part because}} the flaws in their thinking represent the same flaws which are endemic to much of modern Christianity, with the Church often being shaped more by the culture of liberal democracy than the message of Jesus. In Hauerwas' view, this has led the Church (and Christians in general) to compromise their values and place too <b>much</b> <b>faith</b> in secular political ideologies, often leading to a misplaced passion for political power. This represents the thesis of Hauerwas in his most popular book, Resident Aliens (which was co-written by William Willimon). In the book, Hauerwas and Willimon argue that the Church's accommodation to secular culture has led to tragedies like the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima Hauerwas, therefore, believes that the Niebuhrs' thinking is subject to the same flaws as Jerry Falwell, with Hauerwas and Willimon stating that [...] "few books have been a greater hindrance to an accurate assessment of [...] situation" [...] than H. Richard Niebuhr's famous book Christ and Culture. Thus according to Hauerwas, while they may have disagreed when it comes to policy, both the Niebuhrs and Falwell fell prey to the notion Christians have a duty to use the political process as a means to enact [...] "Christian" [...] legislation or pursue justice.|$|E
