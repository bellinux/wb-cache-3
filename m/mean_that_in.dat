5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change.

500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{considered}} the Jim and Dwight scenes {{to be one}} of the only highlights of the episode, especially due to them being the core element to the series.

She concluded that while the episode was not [...] "terrible", it was a mediocre conclusion to the Florida storyline and wrote that [...] "I've got a suspicion that the best part of Season 8 is behind us". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, writing that the only drawback for the episode was the Scranton subplot, because it [...] "turned really old, really fast", although he did compliment Lieberstein's performance in the episode.|$|E

[...] Coghill himself has described himself as a [...] "superhero". He has also stated that he shares the band's hatred of band photos. Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most [...] "out there" [...] member of the band. He says this is true because [...] "We have so much energy...We’re stuck up the back and we’re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it."

500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from." ...|$|E

[...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room...

[...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{resignation}} {{from the}} captaincy of England {{at the end}} of 1951 left no obvious replacement candidate. Traditionally, captains in county or Test cricket were amateurs, who usually came from privileged backgrounds, in contrast to professionals, who often came from the working classes. Consequently, class distinction pervaded cricket which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs, many of whom reasoned that professionals would not make good captains owing to their worries over safeguarding their contracts or concerns about affecting the livelihoods of other professionals. In 1952, the selectors judged that none of the serving amateur county captains possessed the required ability or experience to fill the role of England captain. Consequently, the selectors decided to radically depart from tradition and appoint a professional captain. All previous England captains in home Test matches had been amateurs, and no professional had captained England in any match in the 20th century. But, as widely anticipated by the press, Hutton was appointed to captain England in the first Test of a four-match series against the 1952 Indian tourists. He harboured private doubts whether the cricket establishment would accept a professional captain, but declined to turn amateur, as Wally Hammond had done in 1938. The decision met with broad approval from the press, and the editor of Wisden wrote: [...] "In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side." [...] Hutton had not expected to be asked and had thought an amateur would have been appointed as usual. He presumed his appointment was an interim measure until a more suitable candidate could be found.|$|E
