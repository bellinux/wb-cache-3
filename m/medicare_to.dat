5|$|Hospice Medical Director: The hospice medical director, a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The hospice medical director is also required under <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> recertify patients.|$|E
5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

Like an unfunded mandate, there are no reimbursement provisions.|$|E

25|$|On 1 February 1984, the {{original}} Medibank model was reinstated by the Hawke Labor government, but renamed <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish it from}} Medibank Private which continued to exist. The major changes introduced by the Fraser government were largely reversed, although the financing arrangements were changed. Medicare, which came into effect on 1 February 1984, followed the passage in September 1983 of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1983, including amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973.|$|E
25|$|Medicare sets a {{schedule}} of fees, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The standard Medicare rebate is 100% of a general practitioner and 85% of a specialist schedule fee. Where medical practitioners bill Medicare directly ("bulk bill"), they agree with <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> accept 85% of the schedule fee in full payment for their services. Many medical practitioners bulk bill pensioner patients, and some bulk bill all of their patients. In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% {{in the three months}} to September 2016.|$|E

25|$|Rep. Paul Ryan (R) has {{proposed}} the Roadmap for America's Future, {{which is a}} series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes the transition of <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> a voucher system, meaning individuals would receive a voucher which could be used to purchase health insurance in the private market. This would not affect those near retirement or currently enrolled. A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also partially scored the bill.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Paul {{went against}} the {{majority}} of Republicans and voted to block implementation of the Medicare Part D program, which expanded <b>Medicare</b> <b>to</b> {{cover the costs of}} medications for the elderly and disabled, and which prohibited the government from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies to try to get lower prices for the covered medications. In 2007, he again {{went against the}} majority of House Republicans when he voted with all of the Democrats in support of the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, which, if enacted, would have given the government the authority to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices with the manufacturers. During the 2012 presidential primary campaign, Paul said that although he remains opposed to Medicare Part D, repealing it was not one of his immediate priorities.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} did {{not give}} Social Credit partisans much reason for optimism. [...] Strom did not draw the crowds that Progressive Conservative Peter Lougheed did, although an August 25 rally in Edmonton's Jubilee Auditorium featuring speeches by Strom and Manning was full. [...] After criticizing the Conservatives' medicare platform, which promised free <b>medicare</b> <b>to</b> Albertans older than 65, as spendthrift, Strom announced Social Credit's barely cheaper alternative: <b>medicare</b> <b>to</b> Albertans older than 65 for one dollar per month. [...] The Edmonton Journal, which had earlier published a poll showing that a plurality of Edmontonians intended to vote P.C., endorsed Lougheed for Premier. [...] Election night saw Social Credit defeated, taking 25 seats to the P.C.s' 49. [...] Though Social Credit's share of the vote had only slipped slightly, Lougheed benefited from a substantial reduction in the New Democrats' vote and a near-collapse of the Liberals'. [...] The party was also decimated in the province's two largest cities, losing all of its seats in Edmonton and all but five in Calgary.|$|E
