2500|$|Adrian Busietta, {{the later}} {{owner of the}} residence, was born on 14 January, 1935 to William Busietta and Evelyn (née Casolani), a working class family, and lived his early life in Sliema.

The encounter is said to have led to an arranged marriage; Busietta had always estranged his wife whom he married on October 10, 1958, and who bore him three children: Hadrian Jr., Rowena and Fiona. His marriage to Eileen was a turning point from a simple clerk to a prosperous life and opened before him a number of career opportunities such as a banker, businessman, and the President of the Malta Chamber of Commerce. After Busietta gained access to his wife and family business, he spent money on luxurious goods, creating several financial debts, and was partially to blame for the liquidation of the many companies and assets owned by the family. Busietta had an extra <b>matrimonial</b> <b>relationship</b> with his mistress, Maria [...] "Marie Angelique" [...] Caruana, during which period they had a child.

After some years, Eileen entered into a relationship with a man named Vince, whom also fathered his step-children.|$|E
60|$|The former {{alternative}} leads {{either to}} a romantic organisation {{of society in}} which men will live and fight and die for wonderful, beautiful, exaggerated creatures, or it leads to the hareem. It would probably lead through one phase to the other. Women would be enigmas and mysteries and maternal dignitaries that one would approach {{in a state of}} emotional excitement and seclude piously when serious work was in hand. A girl would blossom from the totally negligible to the mystically desirable at adolescence, and boys would be removed from their mother's educational influence at as early an age as possible. Whenever men and women met together, the men would be in a state of inflamed competition towards one another, and the women likewise, and the intercourse of ideas would be in suspense. Under the latter alternative the sexual relation would be subordinated to friendship and companionship; boys and girls would be co-educated--very largely under maternal direction, and women, disarmed of their distinctive barbaric adornments, the feathers, beads, lace, and trimmings that enhance their clamorous claim to a directly personal attention would mingle, according to their quality, in the counsels and intellectual development of men. Such women would be fit to educate boys even up to adolescence. It is obvious that a marriage law embodying a decision between these two sets of ideas would be very different according to the alternative adopted. In the former case a man would be expected to earn and maintain in an adequate manner the dear delight that had favoured him. He would tell her beautiful lies about her wonderful moral effect upon him, and keep her sedulously from all responsibility and knowledge. And, since there is an undeniably greater imaginative appeal to men in the first bloom of a woman's youth, she would have a distinct claim upon his energies {{for the rest of her}} life. In the latter case a man would no more pay for and support his wife than she would do so for him. They would be two friends, differing in kind no doubt but differing reciprocally, who had linked themselves in a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>relationship.</b> Our Utopian marriage so far as we have discussed it, is indeterminate between these alternatives.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} located within a {{conceptual}} framework which integrates related theoretical concepts under an overarching critical feminist disability studies lens. The study sought to explore within an African context, the experiences of sexuality of 16 disabled women in Zimbabwe by using a narrative methodology. The Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method was used to generate data and a three phased approach to analysing data was used by employing narrative analysis in the first level to produce whole life stories and analysis of narratives at the second level to produce distinctive themes from the stories. The third level of analysis builds on the second level of analysis and in this study it {{is embedded in the}} discussion of findings where it represents a latent and deeper layer of analysis which seeks to further understand the data. The findings that emerged from the narrative analysis illuminate the biographic specificity of the experiences of sexuality of disabled women, albeit drawing belief systems from the wider national context. At the second level, the cross-case analysis generated thematic findings which revealed that all participants dynamically engage in intimate partner relationships, albeit being vulnerable to gender based violence, including in <b>matrimonial</b> <b>relationships,</b> in a setting where contextual silences that surround issues of sexuality are detrimental to the well-being of participants. The third level of analysis illuminates the fact that disabled women are not passive recipients of disability and sexuality stereotypes but they claim their agency and create opportunities for themselves in the area of sexuality. Participants value heterosexual marriage in a context where different sexual orientations are despised by culture and same sex marriages are prohibited by the constitution of Zimbabwe. The complex intersection of culture, disability and normative gender roles and power relations within heteronormative relationships facilitate the vulnerability of disabled women to unsafe sexual practices which exacerbate their vulnerability to HIV infection, in a context which is characterised by a lack of sexuality education...|$|R
