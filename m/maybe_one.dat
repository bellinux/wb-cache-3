Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>one</b> can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. Perhaps, {{it is no coincidence}} that Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E

500|$|Despite his intentions, Moore {{admitted}} in November 1986 {{that there were}} likely to be delays, stating that he was, with issue five on the stands, still writing issue nine. Gibbons mentioned that {{a major factor in the}} delays was the [...] "piecemeal way" [...] in which he received Moore's scripts. Gibbons said the team's pace slowed around the fourth issue; from that point onward the two undertook their work [...] "just several pages at a time. I'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end, call him up and say, 'Feed me!' And he'll send another two or three pages or <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> page or sometimes six pages." [...] As the creators began to hit deadlines, Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons. On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel grids on pages to help save time.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just {{take a little bit of}} it, <b>maybe...</b> <b>one</b> or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E

[...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little bit of luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{called the}} third season The X-Files [...] "best season and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> of the {{greatest}} TV seasons of all time", noting it was consistent and [...] " [...] from strength to strength" [...] between mythology and stand-alone episodes. However, he thought it [...] "starts out kind of terribly" [...] with [...] "The Blessing Way". Zack Handlen, VanDerWerff's colleague, wrote that the third season was [...] "one of the show's strongest, with the conspiracy arc still keeping tension high instead of just vamping for time. By this point, the sometimes awkward effects work of the early years is gone, and the overall direction is highly polished, giving even the season's weakest entries a cinematic feel". He also stated that Morgan's [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] and [...] "Jose Chung's From Outer Space" [...] were [...] "The X-Files two greatest hours". The writing credits provided by Morgan was widely cited as a highlight of the season. [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] written by him received positive reviews, and Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A, who praised the absurdity and entertainment value of the episode. Another episode, [...] "Quagmire" [...] containing some writing credits by Morgan received positive reviews, with the 10-minute dialogue sequence featuring Mulder and Scully receiving highly positive reviews.|$|E
500|$|Between March and May 1970 Morrison {{began work}} on the album at the A {{recording}} studios in New York City. He intended to create a full a capella record, and {{with this in mind}} assembled a vocal group he called the Street Choir, consisting of his friends Dahaud Shaar, Larry Goldsmith, Andrew Robinson and then wife, Janet [...] "Planet" [...] Rigsbee, who all lived near Woodstock. He had wanted the choir to feature only four vocalists, but was persuaded to allow two additional members to join: the wives of Keith Johnson and Jack Schroer (Martha Velez and Ellen Schroer). However, Morrison was later persuaded to abandon the use of a cappella: [...] "I had a group of people in mind for the Street Choir... I asked them if they wanted to sing... then the old ladies got involved and it ruined the whole thing." [...] He was unhappy with the tracks recorded with the choir, as he wanted to use the group for a different effect: [...] "I wanted these certain guys to form an a cappella group so that I could cut a lot of songs with just <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> guitar. But it didn't turn out." [...] During this session Morrison recorded the same tracks used for the demo session in Woodstock, as well as [...] "Gypsy Queen" [...] and an additional instrumental, six of which were used on Street Choir. Elliot Scheiner was used as the engineer for this session, after he helped to produce Moondance. However, according to biographer Clinton Heylin, Scheiner and Morrison had a disagreement, so he was not used {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} four seasons received similar praise. During the show's second season, Entertainment Weekly named The X-Files the [...] "Program of the Year" [...] for 1994, stating [...] "no other show on television gives off the vibe that The X-Files does". The DVD Journal gave {{the second season}} four out of four stars, calling it a [...] "memorable season". The review highlighted [...] "The Host", [...] "Duane Barry" [...] and [...] "Ascension", the cliffhanger finale [...] "Anasazi", the [...] "unforgettable" [...] "Humbug" [...] and meeting Mulder and Scully's families in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "One Breath". IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had [...] "started to explore a little" [...] and the [...] "evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club argued that the third season of The X-Files was the show's [...] "best season and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> of the greatest TV seasons of all time", noting it was consistent and [...] " [...] from strength to strength" [...] between mythology and stand-alone episodes. Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the fifth season an [...] "A – [...] ", writing that it [...] "proves the show was—even then—still at its creative peak (if only for another year or so) and full of surprises". He praised the new additions to the series' mythology and concluded that [...] "many stand-alone episodes now look like classics". Francis Dass, writing for the New Straits Times, noted that the season was [...] "very interesting" [...] and possessed [...] "some [...] truly inspiring and hilarious" [...] episodes.|$|E

500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
