Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the <b>money</b> <b>income</b> were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low.

2500|$|Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution {{notes that}} many economists and analysts who use U.S. census data fail to {{recognize}} recent and significant lower- and middle-income gains, primarily because census data does not capture key information: [...] "A commonly used indicator of middle class income is the Census Bureau's estimate of median household <b>money</b> <b>income.</b> The main problem with this income measure is that it only reflects households' before-tax cash incomes. It fails to account for changing tax burdens {{and the impact of}} income sources that do not take the form of cash. This means, for example, that tax cuts in 2001-2003 and 2008-2012 are missed in the census statistics. Furthermore, the Census Bureau measure ignores income received as in-kind benefits and health insurance coverage from employers and the government. By ignoring such benefits as well as sizeable tax cuts in the recession, the Census Bureau's <b>money</b> <b>income</b> measure seriously overstated the income losses that middle-income families suffered in the recession.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} {{illustrated}} {{with the help}} of [...] Figure 1 both X1 and X2 are normal goods in which case, the demand for the good increases as <b>money</b> <b>income</b> rises.

As the income of the consumer rises,and the consumer chooses X0 instead of X' i.e. if the consumer's indifference curve is I4 and not I2, then the demand for X1 would fall [...] In that case, X1 would be called an inferior good i.e. demand for good X1 decreases with a rise in income of the consumer. Thus, a rise in income of the consumer may lead his demand for a good to rise, fall or not change at all. It is important to note here that, the knowledge of preferences of the consumer is essential to predict whether a particular good is inferior or normal.|$|E
