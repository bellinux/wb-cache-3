25|$|The {{deposits}} of coal in Sulukta mainly consist of lignite or brown coal. From a petrogprahic point of view, the coal of Sulukta contains fusain and clarain. Historically, Sulukta's coal was extracted using both surface and underground mining methods. Currently, it is extracted using only the underground mining method, {{as there is}} no longer any surface <b>mining</b> <b>equipment</b> in the town. Private mines have replaced almost all of the large-scale, state-owned mines of the Soviet period.|$|E

To redevelop the facilities, Kirkenes Utviking was established, which was owned by the municipality, Finnmark County Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and the Industrial and Regional Development Fund.

25|$|Materials on the Moon's surface contain helium-3 at {{concentrations}} on {{the order}} of between 1.4 and 15 ppb in sunlit areas, and may contain concentrations as much as 50 ppb in permanently shadowed regions. A number of people, starting with Gerald Kulcinski in 1986, have proposed to explore the moon, mine lunar regolith and use the helium-3 for fusion. Because of the low concentrations of helium-3, any <b>mining</b> <b>equipment</b> would need to process extremely large amounts of regolith (over 150 million tonnes of regolith to obtain one ton of helium 3), and some proposals have suggested that helium-3 extraction be piggybacked onto a larger mining and development operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{campaign of}} mine warfare waged by the French and Germans was continued by the British, exploiting {{the advantage of}} being on the dip slope and only having to dig horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions. The Germans, on the steeper scarp slope, had to dig down before they could dig horizontally, which added to the German disadvantage in manpower and <b>mining</b> <b>equipment.</b> An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences. Success would gain more defensive depth and forestall mine attacks on the German positions before the British had been able to organise their defences on the ridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{mining company}} held {{an option to}} {{purchase}} a majority stake in Malmfrakt, which they executed to increase their ownership to 96 percent. The shipping company's head office was moved to Kirkenes in 1952. The icebreaker, owned by Dampskipselskapet Pasvik, had been sunk during the war, so a new icebreaker was delivered in 1947, MS Varangis. All heavy transport during the reconstruction was done using railway, and tracks were laid throughout the mining facility. The contracts to build new facilities was awarded to Trondhjem Cementstøberi og Entreprenørforretning. <b>Mining</b> <b>equipment</b> was delivered in 1949 and procured through the Marshall Plan. By 1950 there were 700 employees, in addition to 150 construction workers working for subcontractors. From operations started, transport within the mine was performed using trackless machinery.

25|$|Collecting the melange is {{hazardous}} in the extreme, since rhythmic {{activity on}} the desert surface of Arrakis attracts the territorial worms, which are capable of swallowing even the largest <b>mining</b> <b>equipment</b> whole. Harvesting is carried out by a gigantic machine called a Harvester, which is carried to and from a spice blow by a larger craft called a Carryall. The Harvester on the ground has four scouting ornithopters patrolling around it watching for wormsign — the motions of sand indicating that a worm is coming. Melange is collected from the open sand until a worm is close, at which time the Carryall lifts the Harvester to safety. The Fremen, who base their entire industry around the sale of spice and the manufacture of materials out of spice, have learned to co-exist with the sandworms in the desert and harvest the spice manually for their own use and for smuggling off-planet.|$|E
50|$|The OK Copper Mines Development Syndicate NL, which {{established}} and developed the mine and smelter, is significant in Queensland's {{history as the}} first North Queensland copper company to pay a dividend, due to its practical equating of technical requirements and expenditure on smelters and <b>mine</b> <b>equipment</b> against the known reserves of ore.
