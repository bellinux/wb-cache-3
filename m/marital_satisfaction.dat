5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{the link}} between {{attachment}} styles and <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> remain poorly understood.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the factors influencing depression of married immigrant women in Korea. Methods: Participants included 127 married immigrant women who met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate in the study. Participants were evaluated for subjective assessment of married immigrant-related con-structs using a self-report questionnaire, for depression, acculturation stress, and social support. The analysis was done using SPSS for Windows, version 18. 0, and included stepwise regression. Results: The major findings were as follows; 1) Depression significantly differed according to native country, length of residence in Korea, education, family monthly income, household and primary support. 2) There were significant relationships between <b>marital</b> life <b>satisfaction</b> (r=-. 80, p<. 001), acculturative stress (r=. 78, p<. 001), and social support (r=-. 20, p =. 025). 3) <b>Marital</b> life <b>satisfaction,</b> family monthly income, acculturative stress, primary support and social support were significant factors, which explained 84. 6 % of the variance in depression (F= 138. 04, p<. 001).

50|$|Similarly, Schwarz {{has found}} that when a {{question}} about <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> precedes a question about general life satisfaction, responses for the two questions are highly correlated because the first question renders information about one's marriage highly accessible, but other studies have found the same correlation when the <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> question is asked after the general life satisfaction question, presumably because <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> is chronically accessible. Schwarz also found that this correlation vanishes when the two questions are framed as subordinate parts of a larger question, presumably because the respondent infers that the interviewer does not want redundant information and thus <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> should be specifically subtracted from general life satisfaction. Similar reasoning {{has been applied to}} understanding the relation between people's ratings of social groups' central tendency and variability.|$|E

40|$|Miscarriage {{may be a}} {{frightening}} and difficult event. In times of difficulty, such as miscarriage, individuals may have trouble communicating about their experiences. Even though some women are unaware of their miscarriages and others view their miscarriage(s) are insignificant events, most women who have knowingly experienced a miscarriage consider it an emotionally painful event, particularly when {{they feel they have}} lost a baby they had grown attached to (Kirkley-Best 2 ̆ 6 Kellner, 1982; Malacrida, 1997; Reinharz, 1987). Despite this potential difficulty, little is known about how individuals communicate about this type of trauma. ^ Research on narrative suggests that “storying” one’s difficulties is the primary way that individuals make sense of traumatic experiences (Pennebaker, Mayne, 2 ̆ 6 Francis, 1997; Weber, Harvey, 2 ̆ 6 Stanley, 1987). Additionally, stories that are more complete, organized, or coherent {{may be more likely to}} facilitate coping. In a stressful experience like miscarriage, creating a coherent narrative may help women understand their experiences and may aid them in coping with grief. ^ Even with the evidence of the benefits of creating narratives, little research has examined what might help to facilitate narrative sense-making. One factor that may lead individuals to the process of narrating their experiences is social support. Supportive communication is an essential component within the formation and development of interpersonal relationships (Burleson, Albrecht, Goldsmith, 2 ̆ 6 Sarason, 1994). Additionally, research shows that talk may aid in the coping process (Caplan, Haslett, 2 ̆ 6 Burleson, 2005; Pennebaker, Zech, 2 ̆ 6 Rimé, 2001). However, miscarriage is often not talked about by spouses or members of one’s social network, because of gender differences (Black, 1992; Puddifoot 2 ̆ 6 Johnson, 1997), and the taboo nature of the topic (Rajan and Oakley, 1993; Ujda 2 ̆ 6 Bendiksen, 2000). Thus, talking through the experience of miscarriage may facilitate one’s ability to cope and more completely narrate her experience. ^ In this study, 140 women who had experienced a miscarriage completed an online questionnaire designed to assess support from one’s spouse, a member of one’s social network, support from the Internet, and well-being and <b>marital</b> relational <b>satisfaction.</b> Participants also wrote out the story of their miscarriage experience. Stories were then rated and assessed for overall coherence. ^ Results from a structural equation model indicate that narrative coherence did not mediate the relationship between various sources of social support and the outcome variables of overall well-being and relational satisfaction. However, spousal support was associated with decreased mental health symptoms and perceived stress and higher self-esteem. Spousal support was also positively associated with <b>marital</b> relational <b>satisfaction</b> following a miscarriage, whereas support from the internet was negatively related to <b>marital</b> relational <b>satisfaction.</b> Support from a member of one’s social network was not significantly associated with well-being or <b>marital</b> relational <b>satisfaction,</b> thus highlighting the importance of the spousal relationship following a miscarriage. ...|$|R

50|$|Related {{to these}} findings, those husbands who {{reported}} the highest ratings of global <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> showed the highest ratings in daily intimacy.

Further, couples {{with high levels of}} demand-withdraw communication rated their average daily intimacy as much lower. This suggests a relationship between one's overall <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and the amount of intimacy in a relationship, though no causation can be proven with the present research. Self-esteem has also been found to be a predictor of satisfaction, with couples exhibiting both high self-esteem and high self-disclosure levels being the most satisfied in their relationships.|$|E
50|$|New {{parenthood}} is a {{time where}} there are many adjustments within a family and these adjustments can {{put a lot of}} stress on marital dyads. How a couple deals with first-time parenthood directly correlates to their <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> amount of conflict within their marriage, and the perceptions of themselves (Glade, Bean, & Vira, 2005). Studies show that transitioning into parenting leads to more marital conflicts and less <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> When marital dyads have a child, their once dyadic dynamic relationships quickly changes to a triadic relationship, creating a shift in roles. New topics for discussion between the married couple, such as household labor, finances, and child care responsibilities, can lead to major conflicts. It is important for couples to identify ways that may help them maintain <b>marital</b> <b>satisfaction</b> while coping with becoming parents.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of the first child on the parent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>marital</b> happiness, life <b>satisfaction,</b> and self-actualization using cross-sectional data from subjects who are childfree, in their third trimester of pregnancy, with 5 -month old infants and with 24 -month old toddlers. Using a purposeful sample of 185 subjects, the three dependent variables of <b>marital</b> happiness, life <b>satisfaction,</b> and self-actualization were examined. ^ It was hypothesized that the addition of a child into a marital dyad would result in role changes and stresses. These changes would initially decrease the marital happiness but changes in overall life satisfaction and self-actualization would balance out these stresses. ^ This study found that marital happiness did decline with the onset of childbearing. Life satisfaction was found to significantly increase across the four groups. Self-actualization did not change over the four groups, but it did decrease with the subjects who were pregnant and those with 24 -month old children. ^ In addition to the scales used within the questionnaire, the subjects {{were asked to respond to}} direct questions which asked them how they felt that the pregnancy or child affected the three dependent variables. The positive responses for all three variables demonstrated significant increases across the three groups with children. ^ This study found trends indicating that first children cause some changes in <b>marital</b> happiness, life <b>satisfaction,</b> and self-actualization. Although marital happiness does go down, other aspects of life may be enhanced, so the overall effect is positive. This study suggests that multiple variables are influencing the impact of the first child on the individual. ...|$|R

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Do mode of {{conception}} [ART versus Natural (NC) ] and depression have an interactive effect on antenatal paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes? SUMMARY ANSWER: Depression increased the negative effect of ART on antenatal paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes, specifically on antenatal <b>marital</b> relationship <b>satisfaction.</b> WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Research on antenatal paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes after ART is scarce and has produced inconsistent results. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional study assessed 197 primiparous men (71 ART and 126 NC) during their partner’s second trimester of gestation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants {{were derived from}} three larger longitudinal studies recruited at public Health Services in Northern Portugal. All men, for who this was their first child and had filled in a socio-demographic questionnaire, measures of depression and anxiety, and antenatal paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes were selected. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: An interaction effect of mode {{of conception}} and depression was found on antenatal paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes. ART men showing high depressive symptomatology had lower antenatal <b>marital</b> relationship <b>satisfaction</b> than ART men showing low depressive symptomatology and NC men showing high or low depressive symptomatology. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Due to the cross-sectional design of this study and {{the small sample size}} in the depression groups, the findings should be interpreted with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Specialized psychological support should be available for ART men screened with high depressive symptomatology as part of routine prenatal care appointments. This study was conducted at Psychology Research Centre (UID/PSI/ 01662 / 2013), University of Minho, and at the Unidade de Investigação em Epidemiologia—Instituto de Saúde Pública da Universidade do Porto (EPIUnit) (UID/DTP/ 04750 / 2013).

40|$|Marital {{happiness}} is a judgment {{made by a}} spouse that indicates the sense of well being or satisfaction he or she experiences in the marital relationship. Ever since changing social and economic conditions {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century prompted concern about the breakdown of the family, social scientists have sought to understand marital functioning. The two earliest studies in this domain were on sexual behavior (predating Kinsey by a decade) and both examined its role in marital happiness. The central status accorded happiness in this nascent research area gained the attention of researchers from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, family studies and communications. To this day, what has been variously labelled <b>marital</b> happiness, <b>satisfaction,</b> adjustment, success, companionship or some synonym reflective of the quality of the marriage remains the most frequently studied aspect of marriage. This focus is perhaps not surprising because the protective effect of a happy marriage for the mental and physical health of spouses, as well as the healthy development of their children, is well documented. Initially researchers, mostly sociologists, paid greatest attention to identifying demographic correlates of marital happiness using large scale surveys (the sociological tradition...|$|R
