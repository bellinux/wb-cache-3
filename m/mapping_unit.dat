40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{variability}} of selected physical, chemical, and morphological soil properties in two landtype <b>mapping</b> <b>units</b> on'the Rogue River National Forest in southwestern Oregon was studied. The {{objectives of the}} study were (i) to quantify soil variability in several soil resource inventory <b>mapping</b> <b>units,</b> (ii) to explore methods of describing soil variability in order to make soil map information more useful to the map user, and (iii) to attempt to identify sources of variability. Two <b>mapping</b> <b>units,</b> in the Siskyou and Cascade Mountains, were selected to represent extremes of internal variability. Eight delineations of each <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> were sampled with randomly located transects for a total of 40 sites per <b>map</b> <b>unit.</b> Soil properties exhibited various types of frequency distributions. Normal, skewed, and multi-modal distributions were observed. Nearly half the property-horizon combinations measured in both <b>map</b> <b>units</b> had normal distributions. Chemical properties, such as extractable bases, were consistently positively skewed or approximately log-normal. Square root and logarithmic transformations of the data normalized these distributions and stabilized the variance. These results suggested that for multi-modal and badly skewed populations, assumption of a normal distribution may lead to considerable error if the arithmetic mean and standard deviation are used for predictive purposes. <b>Map</b> <b>unit</b> 74 in the Siskyou Mountains was considered to be more variable, over most properties measured, than <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 33 from the Cascades. For most properties coefficients of variation (CV) were higher, the sample requirements to estimate population means were greater, and the ranges were wider in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74, as compared to <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 33. In both <b>map</b> <b>units,</b> chemical properties were more variable than physical or morphological properties, which were about equal in their variability. The number of samples required to estimate the means of properties varied widely and were often prohibitively large (264 for organic matter in the surface of <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74). This number could be reduced if the sampling scheme was stratified using estimates of within and between delineation variance. Between 50 and 75 percent of the total variation in most properties of both <b>map</b> <b>units</b> occurred within delineations. This result is desireable from a management and broad planning perspective and tends to support the validity of the <b>map</b> <b>units</b> as designed and mapped. When tested by analysis of variance, most properties in both <b>map</b> <b>units</b> had significantly different delineation means. These differences could often be traced to one particular delineation and were many times not of practical significance. Large or small changes in the values of most properties were found to be as likely to occur at 660 foot separation distances as at 15 foot distances. This tends to indicate a random distribution of variation, when distance alone is considered, which could have important consequences when attempting to characterize soil properties for management interpretations or site evaluations. Chemical properties expressed volumetrically were more variable than the same properties expressed on a weight basis. Volumetric chemical concentrations were greater in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74 than in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 33, the reverse of the relationship found with those properties on a weight basis. The proportions of within delineation variance in <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74 increased as a result of conversion to volumetric concentrations. Use of principal components analysis confirmed the chemical properties as contributing greater amounts of variation than the physical or morphological properties. Ordination of sites along axes of selected factors also confirmed the general uniformity of the <b>map</b> <b>units</b> as well as the greater {{variability of}} <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> 74...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of mapping of pachic and cumulic soils in Cache County. The soil maps that were used for this study as the basemap were the Atlas sheets of the published soil survey of Cache County. Five <b>map</b> <b>units</b> from Mendou, Nebeker, Avon, Hendricks and Winn which include almost 52 percent of the pachic and cumulic soils in the survey area were selected for this study. These five soils cover large areas when compared to other soil series and they are distributed throughout the county. All these <b>map</b> <b>units</b> were recognized as pachic and cumulic in the published soil survey report. The thickness of the epipedon was therefore selected as the principal criterion for determining the accuracy of the <b>map</b> <b>units.</b> About 400 samples from the major delineations were studied in the field and the necessary data were collected and interpreted statistically in order to find: (1) the accuracy of each <b>map</b> <b>unit,</b> (2) the inclusions, misclassified and not classified pedons and their proportions, and (3) the estimated thickness of the epipedons. Attempts were made to select the pedons on transects with appropriate interval, depending on landforms and continuity of soils. Statistical interpretations were conducted by using the chi-square method. The results for each <b>map</b> <b>units</b> are as follows: for Mendon <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> (MeA) 42 - 56 percent and for Hendricks <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> (HdD) only 30 - 60 percent of the samples have characteristics required for the named soil in these <b>map</b> <b>units.</b> These values are less than 75 percent which is the critical value for the <b>map</b> <b>units</b> by definition. It is concluded therefore that with the available data the Mendon and Hendricks series have been mapped incorrectly. For Nebeker <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> (NbE) 77 - 93 percent and from Avon <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> (ArA) 85 - 99 percent of the samples have the characteristics required for the named soil in the <b>map</b> <b>units.</b> These values are more than the critical value (75) so it is concluded that with available data the Nebeker and Avon series have been mapped correctly. For Winn <b>map</b> <b>unit</b> (Wn) 54 - 82 percent of the samples have the required characteristics of this series. The statistical analysis did not reveal strictly whether the pedons are mapped correctly or not and additional samples are required to adequately test the accuracy of the Winn <b>map</b> <b>unit.</b> It is concluded that in Cache County the influence of different geologic depositions and variations in topography are two major factors responsible for poor accuracy in mapping the Mendon and Hendricks series...|$|R

50|$|A texture <b>mapping</b> <b>unit</b> (TMU) is a {{component}} in modern graphics processing units (GPUs), historically {{it was a}} separate physical processor.
