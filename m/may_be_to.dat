The earliest mention of coconuts on Key Biscayne is a Spanish account from 1568, although the reference <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> cocoplums rather than coconuts. Mature coconut trees were on Cape Florida by the 1830s, likely grown from coconuts sent from Mexico by Henry Perrine {{to the first}} lighthouse keeper, John Dubose.|$|E

Therfore in this I beleave there happeneth a very rare thing, namely, that the meane is more commendable, then the excellency.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> deliver nutrients.|$|E

5|$|Neville was a royal {{clerk to}} King John {{in the spring}} of 1207, and in December of that year was at Marlborough Castle on royal business. Earlier {{references}} to a Ralph Neville who in 1207 delivered items to Hugh de Neville, or the Ralph Neville who was the same Hugh de Neville's chaplain, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> the future bishop, but the evidence is inconclusive. Hugh de Neville and Neville subsequently worked together, and corresponded on both business and personal affairs. Both men claimed the other as a kinsman.|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E

30|$|All three {{performance}} metrics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> identify critical nodes. For example, {{the scale}} and complexity ofterrorist attacks <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> the size of terrorist groups; smaller groups <b>are</b> less likely <b>to</b> launch coordinated large-scale attacks. The NLCO <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> identify critical terrorists. For another example, to enhance information security, it <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> slow down the spread of viruses in a computer network. The NEMS <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> identify vulnerable computers. For engineered systems such as the Internet and wireless sensor networks, the significance of using the performance metrics is twofold. First, the performance metrics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> compare different system designs. For instance, the NEMS <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> gauge the speed of information diffusion in a wireless sensor network, and help select the best network designs. Second, the performance metrics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> identify critical nodes. In a computer network, for instance, the NEGD <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> identify critical computers whose removal result in a heterogeneous network, which <b>is</b> vulnerable <b>to</b> targeted attacks [1].|$|R
5|$|The {{protease}} {{targets of}} intracellular inhibitory serpins {{have been difficult}} to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E
5|$|The text is {{attributed}} to Yajnavalkya, a revered Vedic sage in Hinduism. He is estimated to have lived in around the 8th century BCE, and is associated with several other major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the Shukla Yajurveda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Dharmasastra named Yājñavalkya Smṛti, Vriddha Yajnavalkya, and Brihad Yajnavalkya. He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, {{as well as in}} ancient Jainism texts such as the Isibhasiyaim. These references to Yajnavalkya in other texts, in addition to the eponymous Yoga Yajnavalkya, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> different sages with the same name.|$|E
5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E
