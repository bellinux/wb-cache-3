50|$|Current <b>modacrylic</b> <b>fiber</b> {{producers}} include Kaneka Corporation in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{production}} of <b>modacrylic</b> <b>fiber</b> began in 1949 by Union Carbide Corporation in the United States. Modacrylic and acrylic fibers {{are similar in}} composition and at one time {{were in the same}} category. In 1960 the Federal Trade Commission decided to separate the two fibers and establish a category for each.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century hairdressers in England and France did a brisk {{business}} supplying postiches, or pre-made small wiglets, curls, and false buns to be incorporated into the hairstyle. The use of postiches did not diminish even as women's hair grew shorter in the decade between 1910 and 1920, but they seem to have gone out of fashion during the 1920s.In the 1960s a new type of synthetic wig was developed using a <b>modacrylic</b> <b>fiber</b> which made wigs more affordable. Reid-Meredith was a pioneer in the sales of these types of wigs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Modacrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> are {{modified}} acrylic fibers {{made from}} acrylonitriles, but larger amounts of other polymers {{are added to}} make the copolymers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>modacrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> are {{produced}} by polymerizing the components, dissolving the copolymer in acetone, pumping the solution into the column of warm air (dry-spun), and stretching while hot.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Trade Commission defines <b>modacrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> as {{manufactured}} fibers {{in which}} the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of less than 85%, but at least 35% weight acrylonitrile units except when the polymer qualifies as rubber.|$|R
30|$|The latest {{development}} in nonwoven barrier fabrics is the siliconized thermally bonded highloft barrier material. The siliconized highloft is {{a blend of}} three different types of siliconized fibers (e.g., Basofil®, Tencel® and Protex®) held together with a low-melt polyester ([Hendermann & Bridges 2006]). Each component of the blend provides a specific and necessary functionality to the barrier material. The siliconized melamine fibers provide a non-shrinking form of carbon, whereas the regenerated cellulosic fiber improves the softness and water repellency of the blend. The regenerated cellulosic fiber is very cost effective and can be used to increase the bulk of the product. Siliconized <b>modacrylic</b> <b>fiber,</b> when used in an appropriate blend ratio, can reduce the local oxygen content within the barrier during a fire, thereby prolonging char oxidation. The low melt polyester provides resiliency to the barrier, and its strong thermoplastic character helps to maintain the structural integrity of the char formed.|$|E
5000|$|Modacrylics are creamy {{or white}} and are {{produced}} in tow and staple form. If {{looked at in}} cross section views they have an irregular shape. <b>Modacrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> are also produced in many different lengths, crimp levels, deniers and they can have various shrinkage potentials.|$|R
5000|$|A {{modacrylic}} has {{properties that}} are similar to an acrylic. However, modacrylics are flame retardant and do not combust. The fibers are difficult to ignite and will self-extinguish. In addition to a modacrylic's flame retardant properties it has a relatively high durability that is comparable to wool. <b>Modacrylic</b> <b>fibers</b> have a moderate resistance to abrasion and a very low tenacity.|$|R
50|$|Dry {{spinning}} is {{also used}} for polymers that must be dissolved in solvent. It differs in that the solidification is achieved through evaporation of the solvent. This is usually achieved by a stream of air or inert gas. Because there is no precipitating liquid involved, the fiber {{does not need to}} be dried, and the solvent is more easily recovered. Acetate, triacetate, acrylic, <b>modacrylic,</b> polybenzimidazole <b>fiber,</b> spandex, and vinyon are produced via this process.|$|R
50|$|Modacrylic is a {{modified}} acrylic fiber that contains at least 35% and at most 85% acrylonitrile monomer. The comonomers vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride or vinyl bromide used in <b>modacrylic</b> give the <b>fiber</b> flame retardant properties. End-uses of modacrylic include faux fur, wigs, hair extensions and protective clothing.|$|R
