If the master pattern was made from steel, the <b>master</b> <b>die</b> can be cast {{directly}} from the pattern using metal with a lower melting point. Rubber moulds can also be cast directly from the master pattern. Alternatively, a <b>master</b> <b>die</b> can be machined independentlyâ€”without creating a master pattern.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a deep drawing die (1) with a top die and a bottom die (2, 3), wherein the top die (2) has a holding down clamp (2 a) and the bottom die (3) has a <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a), and wherein at least one device (6), with which {{the distance between the}} holding down clamp (2 a) and the <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) can be modified in portions or partially, is arranged in a flange region. The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a top die and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between holding down clamp (2 a) and <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and holding down clamp (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|R

50|$|It {{was planned}} that the coin would {{continue}} using the voyageur theme of its predecessor, but the <b>master</b> <b>dies</b> {{that had been}} struck in Ottawa were lost in transit {{en route to the}} Mint's facility at Winnipeg. A Commons committee struck to investigate the loss discovered that the Mint had no documented procedures for transport of <b>master</b> <b>dies</b> and that it had shipped them via a local courier in a bid to save $43.50. It was also found to be the third time that the Mint had lost <b>master</b> <b>dies</b> within five years. An internal review by the Royal Canadian Mint argued that while a policy existed to ship the obverse and reverse dies separately, the new coin dies were packaged separately but were part of the same shipment. The Mint also disagreed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's contention that the dies were simply lost in transit, believing instead that they were stolen. The dies were never recovered.|$|R
