5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows <b>machine-to-machine</b> transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E

25|$|The PackML (Packaging Machinery Language) sub-committee’s {{focus was}} to develop a method to quickly {{integrate}} a line of machines without concern on what field bus (protocol & media-the domain of the PackConnect sub-committee) was going to carry the data set between machines, SCADA and MES. After several iterations the approach taken was to extend the ISA S88 Part 1 State Model concept to the Packaging Industry. Later in the development process, the concept of PackTags was introduced to provide a uniform set of naming conventions for data elements used within the state model. PackTags are used for <b>machine-to-machine</b> communications; for example between a Filler and a Capper. In addition, PackTags were designed to address OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations. PackTags can be used to provide data exchange between machines and higher level information systems like Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Information Systems.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to gain {{industry}} acceptance Procter & Gamble (P) developed a “PackML Implementation Guide” with a software template & help files that was provided royalty-free, non-exclusive licensed to OMAC. This “OMAC Implementation Guide” is available for download from the OMAC website. The guide is an implementation of ISA-TR88.00.02, [...] borrows concepts from ISA-S88 Part 1 and embraces the ISA-S88 Part 5 draft concepts of the hierarchical model (Machine/Unit, Station/Equipment Module, Control Device/Control Module). The OMAC Implementation Guide provides PackML implementation guidelines, data structures and a minimum set of recommended PackTags (i.e. those typically needed for commercial MES packages). The implementation guideline provides a method to deliver State Control, <b>Machine-to-Machine</b> Communications and Machine-to-Information System Communications.|$|E
