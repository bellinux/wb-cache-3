500|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{appears to}} be the most common <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiency</b> in crop plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. [...] Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia. [...] Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.|$|E

40|$|Background: Ethiopia is {{amongst the}} African {{countries}} that have received significant food aid. Nonetheless, the common <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> among food aid beneficiaries are not well documented. Objective: To find out the common <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> among food aid beneficiaries in the country based on available data. Methods: Literature search was made from the Internet, peer-reviewed journals, various agency reports, national survey data, books, handouts and Masters in Public Health (MPH) theses since the year 2000. Micronutrient status information for food aid beneficiaries came mainly from studies in refugee/emergency settings, with very few published studies found documenting the nutritional status of non-emergency situations.

In examining the effect of sex on the economic and social costs of <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> the paper found that: (1) <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> affect global health outcomes; (2) <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> incur substantial economic costs; (3) health and nutrition outcomes are affected by sex; (4) <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are affected by sex, but this is often culturally specific; and finally, (5) the social and economic costs of micronutrient de-ficiencies, with particular reference to women and female adoles-cents and children, are likely to be considerable but are not well quantified. Given the potential impact on reducing infant and child mortality, reducing maternal mortality, and enhancing neuro-intellectual development and growth, the right of women and chil-dren to adequate food and nutrition should more explicitly reflect their special requirements in terms of micronutrients. The positive impact of alleviating micronutrient malnutrition on physical activ-ity, education and productivity, and hence on national economies suggests that there is also an urgent need for increased effort to demonstrate the cost of these deficiencies, as well as the benefits of addressing them, especially compared with other health and nutri-tion interventions.

40|$|Introduction We {{hypothesized}} that nutritional deficiency would be common in {{a cohort of}} postpartum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected women and their infants. Methods Weight and height, as well as blood concentrations of retinol, &# 945;-tocopherol, ferritin, hemoglobin, and zinc, were measured in mothers after delivery and in their infants at birth and at 6 - 12 weeks and six months of age. Retinol and &# 945;-tocopherol levels were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography, and zinc levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The maternal body mass index during pregnancy was adjusted for gestational age (adjBMI). Results Among the 97 women 19. 6 % were underweight. Laboratory abnormalities were most frequently observed for the hemoglobin (46. 4 %), zinc (41. 1 %), retinol (12. 5 %) and ferritin (6. 5 %) levels. Five {{percent of the women}} had mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations < 31 g/dL. The most common deficiency in the infants was &# 945;-tocopherol (81 %) at birth; however, only 18. 5 % of infants had deficient levels at six months of age. Large percentages of infants had zinc (36. 8 %) and retinol (29. 5 %) deficiencies at birth; however, these percentages decreased to 17. 5 % and 18. 5 %, respectively, by six months of age. No associations between infant <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and either the maternal adjBMI category or maternal <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were found. Conclusions <b>Micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were common in HIV-infected women and their infants. <b>Micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> were less prevalent in the infants at six months of age.

This systematic review investigates <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and related adverse clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery. A systematic approach involving critical appraisal was conducted independently by 2 researchers to examine deficiencies of phylloquinone, folate, iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, iodide, copper, and vitamins A, D, and B- 12 in pregnant and postpartum women after bariatric surgery, together with subsequent outcomes in the neonates. The search identified 29 relevant cases and 8 cohort studies. The quality of reporting among the case reports was weak according to the criteria based on the CARE (CAse REporting) guidelines as was that for the cohort studies based on the criteria from the Cohort Study Quality Assessment list of the Dutch Cochrane Center. The most common adverse neonatal outcomes related to maternal <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> include visual complications (vitamin A), intracranial hemorrhage (phylloquinone), neurological and developmental impairment (vitamin B- 12), and neural tube defects (folate).

40|$|Purpose of review: In {{addition}} to overt manifestations of undernutrition such as stunting, wasting and underweight, <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are also recognized as important {{components of the}} spectrum of malnutrition. This review focuses on recent advances {{in our understanding of}} undernutrition and <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> during childhood from {{a review of the literature}} over the last 18 months (August 2006 -January 2008). Recent findings: There is considerable advance in our understanding of the epidemiology and burden of childhood undernutrition and <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Based on recent surveys, an estimated 32 % (178 million) of children under 5 years of age were stunted. The corresponding global estimate of wasting is 10 % (55 million children), of which 3. 5 % (119 million children) are severely wasted. It is estimated that nearly 11 % of all children under 5 years of age, die due to four <b>micronutrient</b> <b>deficiencies</b> (vitamin A, zinc, iron and iodine). There is evidence from recent reviews of evidence-based interventions that administering single or multiple micronutrients can make a significant difference to health outcomes.
