5000|$|Increased fire {{response}} time - Because the piping is empty {{at the time}} the sprinkler operates, there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler, partially filling the piping in the process. A <b>maximum</b> of <b>60</b> <b>seconds</b> is normally allowed by regulatory requirements from the time a single sprinkler opens until water is discharged onto the fire. This delay in fire suppression results in a larger fire prior to control, increasing property damage.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the power quality {{evaluation of a}} 1. 2 MW tidal power plant. The {{results show that the}} unit works well and that the power quality impact is moderate to low and for future units which most likely will have more turbines, the power quality impact will be very low. The wind turbine power quality standard IEC 61400 - 21 was used in this investigation, and was adequate, however, regarding the connecting transients, there could be a need for a specific standard. It is found that the power level is well controlled at higher water speeds, the maximum 10 minute power is found to be 1. 21 MW. The maximum 02 second value is found to be 1. 46 MW and the <b>maximum</b> <b>60</b> <b>second</b> value is found to be 1. 30 MW. The reactive power exchange with the grid is negligible, at full load the power factor is 0. 99. The flicker coefficient is between 1 and 5, depending on the grid impedance angle. Finally, {{it can be said that}} the maximum total harmonic distortion (THD) for the voltages is found to be 1. 2 % and for the current 0. 65 % during operation with the complete power plant...|$|R
25|$|The temple games {{featured}} {{the two remaining}} teams competing in three physical challenges to earn Pendants of Life which the winning team used in the final round. Several different types of temple games were featured, with the episode's legend serving as a theme for each. Most temple games lasted for a <b>maximum</b> of <b>60</b> <b>seconds</b> but some were untimed. After each challenge, the winning team received some portion of a protective Pendant of Life. The first two challenges, pitting single members from each team against one another, were worth one half of a pendant, while the final challenge, involving both contestants on both teams, was worth a full pendant. If a temple game ended in a tie, both teams received the pendant value of that game.|$|R
5000|$|When {{one or more}} of the {{automatic}} sprinkler heads is triggered, it opens allowing the air in the piping to vent from that sprinkler. Each sprinkler operates independently, as its temperature rises above its triggering threshold. As the air pressure in the piping drops, the pressure differential across the dry pipe valve changes, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flow from sprinklers, needed to control the fire, is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers. In regions using NFPA 13 regulations, the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a <b>maximum</b> of <b>60</b> <b>seconds.</b> In industry practice, this is known as the [...] "Maximum Time of Water Delivery". The maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced, depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system.|$|R
40|$|Production of {{pharmacologically}} important compounds from earthworms {{is a novel}} area {{in modern}} day medicine termed as vermiceuticals. In the present study effect of coelomic fluids of Polypheretima elongata and Eudrilus eugeniae were indeperndently examined for ome of their possible medical applications. Coelomic fluids from P. elongata and E. eugeniae were extracted by applying heat and cold shock treatments. The coelomic fluids of both the earthworm species showed anti oxidant and anti coagulant activities at different levels. Anti Coagulation assay was performed to the coelomic fluids of the earthworm species using standard clotting time delay method of Baughmann (1995). Both the species P. elongata and E. eugeniae exhibited the anticoagulant activity with the clotting time delay of <b>maximum</b> <b>60</b> and 40 <b>Seconds</b> respectively with the coelomic fluids volume of 200 µl. Both the species exhibited antioxidant activity. The presence of Glutathione was confirmed in both the species at a concentration of 0. 12 µg/ml and 0. 06 µg/ml respectively in P. elongata and E. eugeniae. The above results clearly indicate that coelomic fluid of P. elongata has bioactive molecules in higher levels than E. eugeniae. The salient findings of the study include coelomic fluid of earthworms namely P. elongata and E. eugeniae has protein factors and some of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} this paper is to define a {{reliability}} of the test for the estimation of basic kinematics and mechanical characteristics of pulling force in swimmers measured by the method of tethered swimming with <b>maximum</b> intensity of <b>60</b> <b>seconds.</b> The sample was composed of 10 categorized senior age swimmers. All swimmers were specialists in sprint and middle distance crawl techniques (50, 100, 200 and 400 m). Testing was administered by tensiometric probe with the hardware-software logistics support by test-retest method. Kinematics characteristics were given in two variables (AVG STROKE 60 TS Time – average stroke duration and AVG HZ 60 TS – realized stroke frequency) while pulling force characteristics were given in five variables (AVG F max 60 TS – average of maximum pulling force (peaks) of individual strokes, AVG F min 60 TS – average of minimal pulling force of the individual strokes, AVG F 60 TS – average of pulling force of the individual strokes, AVG Imp F 60 TS – average of impulses of pulling force of the individual strokes and AVG RFD 60 TS – average rate of force development of the pulling force in individual strokes. On the basis of the obtained results we can conclude that the given estimation method is generally valid on the level of Crombach's alpha = 0. 8694, is generally reliable on the level of Spearman-Brown's rtt = 0. 9722 (97. 22 %) and is generally factor valid on th...|$|R

40|$|Poison dart frogs, family Dendrobatidae, {{are known}} to differ in their levels of {{toxicity}} from one species to another; with Phyllobates terribilis known {{to be the most}} toxic of the dart frogs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the escape behavior of P. terribilis to a less toxic but closely related species, Dendrobates tinctorious. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory setting with captive reared frogs of both species. The same researcher walked toward a stationary frog on the ground while holding a wooden snake model in front of him. As the researcher neared the frog, he knelt and approached the front of the frog with the snake model. We measured the distance the researcher was from the frog when it first moved. If the frog did not move when the snake model was 2 cm in front of it, we timed how long the frog remained stationary with a <b>maximum</b> time of <b>60</b> <b>seconds.</b> Significantly more D. tinctorious moved when approached by the researcher than did P. terribilis. In addition, 50 % of the P. terribilis remained stationary for the maximum time even after the snake model was placed 2 cm in front of them. Our data suggest that escape behaviors correspond with the level of toxicity frogs {{are known to}} have in the wild. Absent or minimal escape behaviors may have conservation implications if P. terribilis are confronted by collectors in the wild wearing protective gear or other situations where their toxicity could be circumvented...|$|R
