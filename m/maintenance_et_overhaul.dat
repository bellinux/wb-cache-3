40|$|Bevacizumab in {{combination}} with taxanes in HER 2 -negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients has shown improved progression-free survival (PFS), {{despite the lack of}} clear overall survival (OS) benefit. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact of paclitaxel-bevacizumab and of maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (BM) and endocrine therapy (ET) in the real-world practice. We identified 314 HER 2 -negative MBC patients treated in 12 cancer centers. Overall, the median PFS and OS were 14 and 40 months, respectively. Among the 254 patients potentially eligible for BM, 183 received BM after paclitaxel discontinuation until progression/toxicity. PFS and OS were improved in patients who had received BM in comparison with those potentially eligible but who did not receive BM (P< 0. 0001 and P = 0. 001, respectively). Results were confirmed when adjusting for propensity score. Among the 216 hormone-receptor positive patients eligible for BM, a more favorable PFS and OS were observed when <b>maintenance</b> <b>ET</b> was administered (P < 0. 0001). Multivariate analysis showed that PS, BM, number of disease sites and <b>maintenance</b> <b>ET</b> were related to PFS, while response and <b>maintenance</b> <b>ET</b> were related to OS. In hormone-receptor positive patients, BM produced a significant PFS and a trend towards OS benefit only in absence of <b>maintenance</b> <b>ET</b> (P = 0. 0007 and P = 0. 06, respectively). In the triple-negative subgroup, we observed a trend towards a better OS for patients who received BM (P = 0. 06), without differences in PFS (P = 0. 21). Our results confirmed the efficacy of first-line paclitaxel-bevacizumab in real-world practice; both BM and <b>maintenance</b> <b>ET</b> significantly improved PFS and OS compared to no maintenance therapies.

40|$|Abstract-Even after {{thorough}} {{testing of}} a program, usually a few bugs still remain. These residual bugs are usually uniformly {{distributed throughout the}} code. It is observed that bugs {{in some parts of}} a program can cause more frequent and more severe failures compared to those in other parts. It should, then be possible to prioritize the statements, methods and classes of an object-oriented program according to their potential to cause failures. Once the program elements have been prioritized, the testing effort can be apportioned so that the elements causing most frequent failure are tested more. Based on this idea, in this paper we propose a program metric called the influence of program elements. Influence of a class indicates the potential of class to cause failures. In this approach, we have used the intermediate graph representation of a program. The influence of a class is determined through a forward slicing of the graph.

To guide supportive interventions, more {{knowledge of how}} to best assess ET use is needed. OBJECTIVE: To provide new knowledge of perceived and observed levels of difficulty of ETs in older adults with and without cognitive impairment. METHODS: Two samples of older adults (n= 118 and 116) with and without cognitive impairment were assessed. One was interviewed with the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ) about perceived difficulties in ET use. The other sample’s observed ability to manage ET was assessed with the Management of Everyday Technology (META). Data was analyzed using a Rasch measurement model and rank-ordered hierarchies of perceived and observed levels of ET difficulty were identified, correlated and examined. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated a correlation of 0. 63 (p ˂. 001). The upper range of both hierarchies contained more complex ETs like cell phones and computers while the lower comprised more home <b>maintenance</b> <b>ETs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Perceived and observed levels of ET difficulty appear as similar, yet not identical constructs. In self-reports, though, ETUQ to a great extent seems to capture levels of ET difficulty.

Machine breakdown or product quality loss is probable when a machine continues to work unceasingly for a long time. To avoid this situation, preventive maintenance is conducted on the machine which may be periodic or flexible (Xu et al. 2015). In a flexible maintenance the earliest and latest start time are determined and the maintenance process is allowed to start during this period. Yang et al. {{were the first to}} study a single machine scheduling problem with a flexible <b>maintenance</b> (Yang <b>et</b> al. 2002).

They proposed heuristics as well as Branch and Bound based approaches to determine the sequence of jobs and maintenance start times while total completion time is minimized. Furthermore, Chen proposed a mixed binary integer programming and a heuristic to minimize mean flow time (Chen 2006).

Lately, gender differences have also been investigated relative to self-weighing. Klos et al.
