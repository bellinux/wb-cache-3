40|$|The alpha 2 {{adrenergic}} agonist [3 H]mivazerol labelled two {{populations of}} binding sites in membranes {{from the human}} striatum. Forty per cent of the sites labelled by 3 nM [3 H]mivazerol corresponded to alpha 2 adrenergic receptors as they displayed a high affinity for (-) -adrenaline and for rauwolscine. The remaining binding was displaced by <b>mivazerol</b> with a pIC 50 of 6. 5 ± 0. 1. These sites displayed higher affinity for dexmedetomidine (pIC 50 = 7. 1 ± 0. 1), but much lower affinity for clonidine (pIC 50 < 5. 0) and for idazoxan (pIC 50 = 5. 1 ± 0. 1). <b>Mivazerol</b> also showed low affinity for the [3 H]clonidine-labelled I 1 imidazoline receptors and for the [3 H]idazoxan-labelled I 2 receptors (pIC 50 = 5. 1 and 3. 9, respectively). These {{results suggest that the}} non-adrenergic [3 H]mivazerol binding sites are distinct from the imidazoline receptors in the human striatum. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Mivazerol</b> {{is a drug}} with alpha 2 -agonist {{properties}} that reduces post-ganglionic noradrenaline availability and spinal efferent sympathetic output. Methods: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 61 European centers during a 2. 5 -yr period on 2, 854 patients: 1, 897 with coronary heart disease and 957 patients without overt coronary heart disease but classified as {{at high risk for}} it. The present analysis was restricted to those patients with previous known coronary heart disease of whom 48...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the extent to which}} {{presynaptic}} noradrenergic mechanisms contribute to the anaesthetic-sparing effects of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists in vivo microdialysis was used to investigate the combined effects of sodium pentobarbitone and imidazol(in) e α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists on extracellular levels of noradrenaline (NA) in the rat frontal cortex. Dialysate levels of NA were markedly reduced by the addition of TTX (2 [*]μM) or by the removal of calcium in the perfusate. These data imply that dialysate NA levels are ultimately dependent on exocytotic release mechanisms from afferent coeruleo-cortical neurones. Systemic administration of sodium pentobarbitone (85 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) induced general anaesthesia and reduced NA levels by 92 % after 30 [*]min. The restoration of basal levels 90 [*]min later was closely associated with a return of the corneal blink reflex. Basal NA levels in conscious animals were not affected by an intravenous infusion of equally radioactive solutions of either imidazoline (clonidine) or imidazole (<b>mivazerol)</b> α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists. The dose rate employed for each compound was 2 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]h− 1 over 2 [*]h. The co-administration of intravenous clonidine or <b>mivazerol,</b> each at 2 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]h− 1 for 2 [*]h, with sodium pentobarbitone (85 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), produced a marked and prolonged reduction in NA efflux. After 2 [*]h, NA levels remained suppressed by 95 % (clonidine) and 80 % (<b>mivazerol)</b> and animals remained deeply anaesthetized. The accumulation of tritium in brain tissue was 42 – 73 % lower across all brain regions examined after [3 H]-mivazerol administration than after [3 H]-clonidine administration. Sodium pentobarbitone did not alter the accumulation of tritium in brain tissue after the administration of either α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist. These data demonstrate that α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists potentiate the inhibitory effects of sodium pentobarbitone on extracellular levels of NA in the frontal cortex. Further studies will be necessary to establish a causal role of noradrenergic mechanisms in the potentiation of anaesthesia by selective α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} α 2 agonist, <b>mivazerol,</b> {{known to}} be effective in reducing myocardial ischaemia when given intravenously immediately before an exercise tolerance test, produced a significant increase in exercise duration and time to the onset of angina when given orally over a two week period to 25  patients with stable angina. A non-significant trend to reduction in electrocardiographic signs of ischaemia was also noted. The clinical relevance of this improvement now needs to be tested in larger numbers.    Keywords: α 2 agonist; sympathetic activity; myocardial ischaemia; stable angina; exercise tolerance tes...|$|E
40|$|Hartree-Fock instabilities are {{investigated}} for about 80 compounds, from acetylene to <b>mivazerol</b> (27 atoms) and {{a cluster of}} 18 water molecules, within a double zeta basis set. For most conjugated systems, the restricted Hartree-Fock wave function of the singlet fundamental state presents an external or so-called triplet instability. This behavior is studied in relation with the electronic correlation, {{the vicinity of the}} triplet and singlet excited states, the electronic delocalization linked with resonance, the nature of eventual heteroatoms, {{and the size of the}} systems. The case of antiaromatic systems is different, because they may present a very large internal Hartree-Fock instability. Furthermore, the violation of Hund's rule, observed for these compounds, is put in relation with the fact that the high symmetry structure in its singlet state has no feature of a diradical-like species. It appears that the triplet Hartree-Fock instability is directly related with the spin properties of nonnull orbital angular momentum electronic systems. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|The <b>mivazerol</b> {{and three}} of its {{methylated}} derivatives are studied at the ab initio SCF level within the MINI- 1 and 6 - 31 G basis sets. This study aimed at determining some probable conformations, either neutral or protonated, that could interact with the alpha 2 adrenoceptors. The solvent effect was also studied within the Onsager's solvent model at the two dielectric constant (epsilon) values of 4 and 80. The interaction with the environment (either solvent or receptor) is schematically studied by positioning either two water molecules or one formamide or/and one formic add near the amide and the imidazole for few isomers. The medium polarization, through epsilon, and the solvation effect, through the interaction with the solvent molecules or the receptor side chains, stabilize the same isomers. Post-SCF calculations are performed at the CISD level, the first excited singlet and triplet states energies are determined, {{and the question of}} the wave-function stability is addressed. The results indicate the probability of a spin-orbit coupling with the first excited triplet state, thus opening the question of such a possibility within an enzyme active site.
