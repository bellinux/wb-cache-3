25|$|Lil Wayne has {{announced}} several possible upcoming projects, including a collaborative album entitled I Can't Feel <b>My</b> <b>Face</b> with Harlem-based rapper Juelz Santana, {{that has been}} in production for several years. On June 19, 2008, Lil Wayne and T-Pain formed a duo called T-Wayne with plans to release an album, titled He Raps, He Sings; however, those plans have died down due to much of the material recorded for the album being leaked. According to an interview with Drake, in the December 2011 issue of XXL, plans for an upcoming album with Lil Wayne had been scrapped for the time being because of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaboration Watch the Throne (2011).|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and <b>my</b> <b>face</b> I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on <b>my</b> <b>face),</b> and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|The mixtape also {{contains}} several references to American director Stanley Kubrick and his films, most notably Eyes Wide Shut. Nicole Kidman's adulterous soliloquy {{from the film}} can be heard during the song [...] "Lovecrimes", adding a sense of manic dread." [...] The film is also referenced on the track [...] "Novacane", where Ocean also sings that he's [...] "feelin like Stanley Kubrick". Following that is the track [...] "There Will Be Tears". The song {{has been described as}} emotional in nature, containing a glitchy beat sampled from Mr Hudson, with heavily synthesised vocals. [...] "There Will Be Tears" [...] has a thundering bass flat over a hyperactive 808 beat. Ocean sings about not having a father; [...] "Hide <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> hide <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> can't let 'em see me crying / Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither / And they weren't crying", where he [...] "lets his guard down completely." ...|$|E

500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed <b>my</b> <b>face</b> onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936).
