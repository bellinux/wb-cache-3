50|$|JADE1 role in {{cytokinesis}} {{was demonstrated}} {{by use of}} several functional assays and cell culture models. DNA profiling by FACS showed that JADE1S depletion facilitated rates of G1-cells accumulation in synchronously dividing HeLa cells. The depletion of JADE1S protein in asynchronously dividing cells decreased the proportion of cytokinetic cells, and increased the proportion of <b>multi-nuclear</b> cells. The data demonstrated that JADE1 negatively controls cytokinesis, presumably by contributing to cytokinesis delay. JADE1 down-regulation increased number of <b>multi-nuclear</b> cells indicative of failed cytokinesis, while JADE1S moderate overexpression augmented the number of cytokinetic cells indicative of cytokinetic delay. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase by specific small molecule drugs resulted in the release of JADE1S-mediated cytokinetic delay and allowed progression of abscission. Since Aurora B is a key regulator of the NoCut, JADE1S is likely to regulate cytokinesis at the abscission checkpoint control.JADE1S but not JADE1L or HBO1 was found in centrosomes of dividing cells throughout the cell cycle, and neither of these proteins was found in cilia. In contrast, another study reported JADE1 localization to the cilia and centrosome. The study did not communicate on JADE1 isoform specificity. Centrosomes are the cytoskeleton nucleation centers. Centrosome signaling contributes {{to the definition of}} cell shape, motility, orientation, polarity, division plane and to the fidelity of sister chromosome separation during mitosis and cytokinesis.|$|E

Many systems for enzyme-mediated nucleic acid hydrolysis, including type II restriction endonucleases and phosphatases, contain di- and <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal active sites. Recent {{progress in the}} design of di- and <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal artificial nucleases has included Fe 3 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Co 3 + and Ln 3 +/ 4 +-azamacrocyclic, aminocarboxylic and pyridyl- or benzimidazolyl-based organic ligands complexes and their conjugates to biomacromolecules. The focus in this article is on di- and <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal complexes that promote DNA cleavage via hydrolytic rather than oxidative pathway. Our purpose is to highlight the relationships between the structures of di- and <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal complexes and their functions, the cooperativities between metal and ligands and between metal sites in the course of DNA hydrolysis and the problems that are faced toward the development of di- and <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal-based artificial restriction enzymes by applying the principles of coordination chemistry and enzymatic chemistry. In {{order to be able to}} conveniently compare kinetic data that have been reported for many di- and <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal complexes, we propose two parameters α and β that are associated with the kinetic studies on DNA hydrolysis. The former α is defined as the ratio of the hydrolytic rate constant mediated by a di- or <b>multi-nuclear</b> metal complex to that by the analogous mononuclear complex under identical or similar conditions, indicating the degree of cooperativity between metal sites. The latter β is recognized as a rate enhancement over unhydrolyzed double-stranded DNA. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

We calculate the Heisenberg symmetric exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya antisymmetric exchange. We show how, {{in the absence}} of spin-orbit coupling, the interplay of electronic correlations and quantum interference leads to a quasi-one dimensional effective spin model in a typical tri-nuclear complex, Mo$_ 3 $S$_ 7 $(dmit) $_ 3 $, despite its underlying three dimensional band structure. We show that both intra- and inter-molecular spin-orbit coupling can cause an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Furthermore, we show that, even for an isolated pair of molecules the relative orientation of the molecules controls the nature of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling.
