40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer,</b> from a company’s demands andrequests to complete manufacturing documentation. The design is developed for thecompany Abexor AB in Östersund that produces <b>tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> The product issupposed to be used by Abexors customer to transport cargos of different kinds,such as gravel, stone, dirt, etc. The work commenced with a meeting at the company where demands were set. After that a pre-study was conducted to find out what traffic rules were required forthe trailer to be allowed to be driven on roads. Similar products were examined tosee how the trailer could be designed. The pre-study was followed by an idea andconcept generation. Nine different concepts were generated and the best werechosen for continued work. The concepts that were chosen resulted in a design in CAD were considerationswere taken for dimensions, traffic rules and function. Manufacturing documentationand a list of components to be bought were generated. In the section discussion and conclusions you can see what the thesis has resulted in. It’s also described what could have been done different and guidelines for futuredevelopment have been made...|$|R
40|$|A {{key element}} with which {{manufacturing}} industries should concern themselves {{in respect of}} cost and efficiency of operation is the cycle time for preparing their products. A reduction in operational time can result in dramatic improvements in both cost and efficiency. Unfortunately, cycle time problems are sometimes difficult to analyse: there are many factors related to this parameter. This paper presents a cycle time analysis of a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> frame in a heavy equipment industry. The cycle time analysis, based on the cycle time data collected by a time study, together {{with the use of}} an Arena software simulation, is outlined. From the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} manufacturing cycle time was 56 hours, and that resources were under-utilised...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has been issued by Miedema to investigate the production process of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> Since Miedema is adopting the lean philosophy, the company wonders {{whether there is a}} more ‘lean’ production process of the HST possible, and if such a solution is feasible. Another problem that Miedema faces is that it is relatively inflexible in comparison tot its competitors. Since Miedema occupies seasonal production, delivery times on certain products may be high. Miedema has indicated that it wants to explore possibilities to make the company more flexible, especially {{in the light of the}} current economic crisis. At the moment, demand is declining and the company wonders how it can cope with the declining sales and declining production. On the other hand, Miedema expects a surge in demand when the economic downturn has passed; it therefore wants to use this period to prepare itself for that moment. Flexibility is thus an important theme for Miedema, since this might win orders. At the same time the company wants to remain its other KPIs at the same level, for this meets customer expectations. The two most important of these KPIs are quality and the low cost of ownership. Given these facts, Miedema first wants to explore its possibilities, before actual changes are made. Since Miedema has ties to the Lean Operations Research Centre (LORC) of the University of Groningen, it has made the request whether such research can be conducted. Goal of the research is to provide management with an overview of possible production processes for the HST, weighted against potential problems and benefits. It therefore requires an independent research, to approach this question from a neutral perspective. It will support the decision making process for the future production of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>Trailer.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In 1945, Joseph Cyril Bamford founded J C Bamford Excavators Limited in Uttoxeter, {{now known}} as JCB. The firm, based in the nearby village of Rocester, is the world's third-largest {{construction}} equipment manufacturer. The firm's first vehicle was a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> made from war-surplus materials, which J. C. Bamford built in a rented lock-up garage in Uttoxeter. The Bamford family had previously started Bamfords, later Bamford International Farm Machinery which was a large employer in the town {{from the end of}} the 19th century through to the early 1980s when it gradually went into decline before closing in 1989. The land and former building was acquired by JCB to form its 'Special Products' division which has now closed and the buildings demolished. The land has yet to be developed.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} tractor-hiring unit of Edo state, Nigeria. The criteria used were fleet of equipment, personnel and workshop facilities {{and its impact on}} the farming populace in the state. The study adopted the use of a questionnaire and interview schedules. Among the information requested from the respondents were access to services rendered by the unit and increment in farm sizes. Records available at the headquarters and zonal offices of the unit provided additional sources of information. The unit has seven Steyr, 18 Fiat and nine Massey Ferguson tractors, eight ploughs, 17 harrows, seven <b>tipping</b> <b>trailers,</b> two boom sprayers, one fertilizer spreader, three maize shellers, two rotary slashers, one drilling machine, two ridgers and a pick-up van which are located in the various zones of the unit. Most of these equipment are either functional or require minor repairs to be used on the field. There is sufficient number of tractors but insufficient implements to fully utilize them. Workshop facilities and personnel are inadequate. The maintenance culture adopted is customer motivated. This is not a good practice as it has resulted in about 12 % of the equipment being abandoned as scraps. There has been a general increase in farmsizes since th...|$|R
50|$|Moving {{floor is}} a hydraulically-driven moving-floor {{conveyance}} system for moving bulk material or palletized product, {{which can be}} used in a warehouse, loading dock or semi-trailer. It automates and facilitates loading and unloading of palletized goods by eliminating the need for a forklift to enter the trailer. In a truck-based application, the system can quickly unload loose material without having to <b>tip</b> the <b>trailer</b> or tilt the floor as with other dumping systems. In a bulk material application such as a waste facility, these systems can reduce double handling by allowing any vehicle to deliver material to the conveying floor and move heavy bulk materials to subsequent stages of a process. For bagged waste, the system can also be combined with bag openers.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 ESTA (the European Association of Abnormal Load Transport and Mobile Cranes) {{published}} the first SPMT Best Practice Guide to help {{address the problem}} of <b>trailers</b> <b>tipping</b> over, which has happened on some occasions even though the operating rules and stability calculations have been precisely followed.Some shipbuilding companies have started to use SPMT instead of gantry cranes for carrying ship sections. This has reduced the cost for transporting loads by millions of dollars.|$|R
50|$|The Dodge Kew Fargo Livestock Transporter (484) {{was issued}} in April 1967. This {{was a large}} animal {{transporter}} based on an American Dodge truck which featured an opening bonnet and carried a cargo of plastic pigs. The Tandem Disc Harrow Plough Trailer (71) was relreased in July 1967 and an updated Agricultural Gift Set (GS5) in October 1967, which featured {{some of the more}} recent releases such as the Dodge Kew Fargo and the Massey Ferguson 165 tractor with scoop. In March 1970 the Massey Ferguson 165 Tractor With Saw Attachment (73) was issued featuring a clever circular saw attachment which rotated as the model was pushed along by means of a long finely coiled spring. Next followed two versions of the Ford 5000 Super Major tractor with a fully operational side trenching scoop (74) in 1970 followed by a version with a rear trenching scoop (72) in January 1971. The next new tractor model was issued in April 1973. The Massey Ferguson MF50B (50) featured a closed cab and was finished in yellow. A version with an operational shovel (54) was released in April 1974 and was featured with a trailer carrying a load of plastic 'hay' with figures sitting atop the 'hay' as the latest version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS4) in July 1974. Another new tractor was added to the range in September 1976. The David Brown Tractor and Trailer Set (GS34) included the new tractor finished in white and with a closed cab and a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer.</b> These models were also featured in another version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS42) released in March 1978, along with models of a grain elevator and grain silo. At the same time the David Brown tractor was issued with a Danish JF combine harvester attachment (1112).|$|R

ADM and Morterm Terminal are accessed by Weaver Rd. The SW-1200 locomotive clipped {{the rear of}} the <b>trailer,</b> <b>tipping</b> the transport truck onto its right side (the truck was heading west at the time and the locomotive was headed northbound) and ripped the axles off the trailer's box and frame. Aside from damage to the transport truck, the locomotive also sustained some damage to one of its couplers, which had impacted the trailer. The driver (who was from Ohio) was uninjured and cooperated with Essex Terminal Railway officials and Windsor Police.

40|$|H. F. Hauff is {{a company}} based out of Yakima which specializes in farming equipment. One of their {{products}} is a trailer which has a wind machine attached to it. In {{order to keep the}} fan’s thrust from <b>tipping</b> the <b>trailer</b> over, the trailer needs outriggers to extend out. The outriggers also serve as a way to level out the trailer in uneven surfaces. The outriggers are what needed to be designed. This portion of the project was the vertical arm which extends from the horizontal arm, and goes towards the ground to raise the trailer. The project consisted of three stages. The first stage was to design the vertical arm. The design consisted of three segments of square tubing which all fit within each other. The actuation mechanism was to be cable, as opposed to hydraulic in order to reduce cost. The design was made on SolidWorks and drawings were generated. The second stage was the construction of the device. Since the design was a new design, it was constructed out of plastic as a proof of concept. The third stage was to test the device. Because the device was constructed simply as a proof that the design would function, it would not support a load. What could be tested was the actual extension and compacting sizes. This would demonstrate whether the arm could level out the trailer in the required grade of slope...|$|R
40|$|Aeroelastic {{analysis}} tools to predict rotor airloads must be both accurate and time effective {{if they are}} to become design tools. While the coupling of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and comprehensive codes (CC) show ever improving predictions, such an approach is computationally expensive and is therefore impractical for use in design. Using simplified adynamic theories based on lifting line theory to predict airloads and inflow distributions not only allow the use of coarser models, but also require less time to compute per step than grid based CFD methods. In this project, a comprehensive code (DYMORE) is coupled with a free wake code (Maryland Free Wake). Results show a significant improvement in the aerodynamic loads predictions using the free wake model. Correlation is similar to other comprehensive models using a free wake. Loose- and tight-coupled solutions are viable; the free wake azimuthal step size appears to be the primary driver of any solution. Multiple versus single <b>tip</b> free wake <b>trailers</b> have also been studied; the computational cost for multiple trailers currently outweighs the benefits, though processes to reduce the simulation times appear practical. Multiple free wake trailers are not warranted at each airstation, but should be placed where geometric features indicate rapid aerodynamic changes may occur...|$|R
40|$|When an {{articulated}} tipper unit {{is being}} loaded or is tipping, {{it is unlikely}} to be standing on perfectly level ground. Also, the centre of gravity of the load is unlikely to be in the centre of the body. Hence the loads carried by the suspension and tyres {{on one side of the}} tipper will be greater than those on the other side. This uneven loading will cause the tyres and suspension on one side of the tipper unit to deform more than those on the other side. It will also cause the chassis to deform; the twisting about its longitudinal axis being the most significant mode of deformation. As a result of these deformations caused by the uneven loading, the position of the centre of gravity will be shifted even further towards the more heavily loaded side. This will cause even more uneven loading and further deformations. Under stable conditions a situation will exist at which the position of the centre of gravity, the deformations and the forces transmitted through the system are compatible. Instability, resulting in roll-over would occur if the overall centre of gravity of the load, body, chassis etc. were to fall outside the area bounded by the contact of the wheel with the ground, before a stable condition was reached. Many factors influence the roll stability. To increase stability, an understanding of the influence of components of the lorry on the stability is required. In order to achieve this, a theoretical model of an articulated tipper was developed which will allow roll-over predictions to be made for a given lorry in likely attitudes. In this model dimensions and stiffness of the lorry components can be altered to assess their influence on roll stability. The previous theoretical roll-over models were based on lumped mass systems, representing various parts of the lorry inter-connected by compliant elements. Certain flexibilities such as the tyres, suspension units, etc. could be obtained from the respective components manufacturers but the tractor and trailer chassis flexibilities are unknown. To overcome this problem the flexibilities were obtained from full scale static tilt tests. This is a very expensive undertaking, providing a limited means in which to assess those elements of trailer design which are important in improving stability, without further recourse to more tilt tests. It was decided that the finite element method should be used to model the tractor and trailer, in order to determine the important deformations. Once the finite element model is created it is relatively straight forward to make changes to the structure. Hence an assessment of component contribution to roll stability can be undertaken relatively inexpensively. Whilst a vehicle operator should always endeavour to discharge the payload with the vehicle standing on level ground, practical situations arise where this is not possible. This may be due to the absence of level ground or poor judgement by the operator, which may result in the vehicle being tipped on a lateral ground slope. As a result of this, the maximum ground slope angle considered for the theoretical model is limited to eight degrees, as this position is at least twice the severity of ground slope on which a vehicle should normally be <b>tipped.</b> For each <b>trailer</b> design, the magnitude of the load, position of the load, ram length and ground slope can be varied in any combination. Four payloads and up to nine payload positions are considered, varying the ground slope from 0 to 8 degrees and varying the ram length from 2 to 8 meters. Also, three further chassis configurations, based on the reference chassis were modelled to investigate the contribution of important component flexibilities on roll stability...|$|R
