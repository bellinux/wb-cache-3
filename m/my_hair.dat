25|$|Hairdressing takes {{almost two}} hours, she said, and while <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> is busy, my mind stays idle. I {{am afraid that}} my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser. Hence my {{headache}} afterwards.

She was shrouded in a white, laced peignoir, her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.|$|E
500|$|My [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] {{video was}} {{completely}} inspired {{by all the}} female surrealist painters like Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo. There's that one shot where my hands are {{up in the air}} and stars are spinning around me. And me flying through the hallway with <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> trailing behind me, the birds flying out of my open robe– all of those images were an homage to female surrealist painters; there's a little bit of Frida Kahlo in there, too.|$|E

But I was also aware that I had a huge {{responsibility}} {{to get it right}} and do justice to those suffering in real life. [...] Because Sam has chemotherapy, I was asked if I'd be willing to shave off <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> and I said, [...] "Absolutely," [...] which is why I'm bald. I've also done a lot of research, and try hard to separate my character from my life off-screen, but I feel guilty {{that at the end of}} each day I can walk away from the illness, when many aren't so fortunate." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Susan's {{appearance}} {{changed and}} she was seen having her long hair cut when she wanted a fresh start following a split from Karl. Woodburne has revealed {{that there is no}} chance of Susan growing her long hair back. She said [...] "I could never grow it long again. I love the ease of having short hair. Back when it was long, I used to wash and dry <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> every morning at home before going into work. That added an extra half-hour to my day". She also added that the Neighbours bosses at the time believed that women should have long hair. In April 2012, Susan debuted [...] "a stylish new haircut" [...] representing her single status.|$|E
500|$|In al-Maʿarri's later years, {{he became}} a strict vegan, neither {{consuming}} meat, nor any other animal products. He wrote:Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draughtfor their young, not noble ladies. And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs;for injustice is the worst of crimes.And spare the honey which the bees get industriouslyfrom the flowers of fragrant plants;For they did not store it that it might belong to others,Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts.I washed my hands of all this; and wish that IPerceived my way before <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> went gray! ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the high}} praise, the festival {{appearance}} was shadowed by allegations of lip-synching. Sky News reporter, Kay Burley, tweeted her in disappointment with Parton for miming a huge event. This created an uproar on the Internet. Dolly {{responded to the}} chaos stating she was not miming. She continued to say [...] "My boobs are fake, <b>my</b> <b>hair's</b> fake but what is real is my voice and my heart".|$|R
500|$|In 1975, at age 22, Schuur {{auditioned for}} drummer/bandleader Ed Shaughnessy. Escorted by her twin brother, she went {{backstage}} {{to seek out}} Shaughnessy after he had finished a concert in Seattle with bandleader Doc Severinsen. Shaughnessy said, [...] "Doc's concert was over and this young blind girl comes in and sits down at the Fender Rhodes keyboard and starts singing the blues. Well, <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> stood on end!" [...] He hired her to be the vocalist in his orchestra, [...] "Energy Force". Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie heard her and, in 1979, invited her to sit in on a set at the Monterey Jazz Festival. According to Dave Gelly in his 2002 book, Stan Getz: Nobody Else But Me, Schuur's performance created [...] "a minor sensation".|$|E
500|$|Burton [...] "loved the idea" [...] {{of playing}} a {{character}} [...] "very different" [...] from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as [...] "Stone Cold". The role of Dylan {{allowed him to}} wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's [...] "uniform" [...] and [...] "black T-shirt", Burton described the experience as [...] "refreshing". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> different, because I know people {{are always going to}} see me as Jason." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{opens the}} song listing {{the things she}} would do for her man during her verses: brush his hair, take his shoes off, give him a manicure, rub his feet, help him put his do-rag on, undo his cufflinks. She also sings the lines [...] "Let me feed you, let me run your bath water, {{whatever}} you desire" [...] after the thins she had previously listed. Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if her man comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'" [...] Williams sings her solo verses during the song's bridge.|$|E

It may perhaps--some of it at least may be fancy. But then, what isn't? What is trustworthy? And now your brother tells me <b>my</b> <b>hair's</b> turning grey. I suppose I have been living too slowly, too sluggishly, and {{they thought it was}} high time to stir me up.' ...|$|R
500|$|She called Betsey Johnson {{a fashion}} inspiration: [...] " [...] {{is a free}} spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E
500|$|For many years, Nelson's {{image was}} marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids {{partially}} concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of Stuff Magazine Nelson was interviewed about his long locks. [...] "I started braiding <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's." [...] On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair, and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published {{a photograph of the}} pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home. In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for [...] at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from being}} Carey's second highest {{worldwide}} seller, Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time. During the album's recording, Carey grew as an artist, {{as well as}} a writer. For {{the first time in her}} career, Carey was able to make music that she truly related to, R and hip hop. While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy". They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia: [...] "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?' They're nervous about breaking the formula. It works to have me sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> up." ...|$|E

500|$|Luke's line, [...] "Welcome to the O.C., bitch", {{which he}} says after beating up Ryan, became a tagline for the show. TV Land placed the line as 83rd in its 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases in 2006. Hadley Freeman of The Guardian noted that the teen-focused show made many {{cultural}} references due to a [...] "renewed interest in the teen market", adding {{that the use of}} cropped tops, micro-minis, and beaded flip-flops showed a [...] "decidedly West Coast approach to fashion". The episode's cultural references to fashion included Julie Cooper's question to her pre-pubescent daughter, [...] "Do you like <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> this straight or is it too Avril Lavigne?", while another mother complains, [...] "What are you doing putting my daughter in Calvin Klein? She was supposed to be in Vera Wang!" [...] Teenage misfit Seth complains that [...] "Every day's a fashion show for these kids".|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I {{had to go back to}} him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E

He had always done his murders with a bowie-knife, and he made all <b>my</b> <b>hairs</b> rise by suddenly snatching it out and showing it to me.|$|R
