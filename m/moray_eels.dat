5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller <b>moray</b> <b>eels.</b> In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|Some {{varieties}} of eels, {{which are a}} primary food source for banded sea kraits, may have coevolved resistance to banded sea krait venom. Gymnothorax <b>moray</b> <b>eels</b> taken from the Caribbean, where the banded sea krait is not present, died after injection with doses as small as 0.1mg/kg body weight, but Gymnothorax individuals taken from New Guinea, where banded sea kraits are endemic, were able to tolerate doses as large as 75mg/kg without severe injury.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and <b>moray</b> <b>eels,</b> and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E

25|$|<b>Moray</b> <b>eels</b> {{and coral}} {{groupers}} (Plectropomus pessuliferus) {{are known to}} cooperate with each other when hunting. Grouper are protogynous hermaphrodites, who school in harems of three to fifteen females. When no male is available, in each school the largest female shifts sex to male. If the final male disappears, changes to the largest female occur, with male behavior occurring within several hours and sperm production occurring within ten days. It is probably {{as a result of}} behavioural triggers.|$|E
25|$|Marine biota in {{the region}} have representatives of both the Indian and Pacific oceans which were caught in the Caribbean before the {{emergence}} of the Isthmus of Panama four million years ago. In the Caribbean Sea there are around 1,000 documented species of fish, including sharks (bull shark, tiger shark, silky shark and Caribbean reef shark), flying fish, giant oceanic manta ray, angel fish, spotfin butterflyfish, parrotfish, Atlantic Goliath grouper, tarpon and <b>moray</b> <b>eels.</b> Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of lobster and sardines (off the coast of Yucatán Peninsula).|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{instances}} of larger lionfish individuals engaging in cannibalism on smaller individuals, adult lionfish have few identified natural predators, likely from {{the effectiveness of}} their venomous spines. <b>Moray</b> <b>eels</b> (family Muraenidae), bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), and large groupers, like the tiger grouper (Mycteroperca tigris) and Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), have been observed preying on lionfish. It remains unknown, however, how commonly these predators prey on lionfish. Sharks are also believed to be capable of preying on lionfish with no ill effects from their spines. Park officials of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras have attempted to train sharks to feed on lionfish as of 2011 in an attempt to control the invasive populations in the Caribbean. Predators of larvae and juvenile lionfish remain unknown, but may prove to be the primary limiting factor of lionfish populations in their native range.|$|E
50|$|Scuticaria tigrina is a <b>moray</b> <b>eel</b> {{found in}} coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is {{commonly}} known as the tiger reef-eel, tiger snake <b>moray,</b> tiger <b>moray</b> <b>eel,</b> tiger <b>moray,</b> tiger <b>eel,</b> spotted eel, or the spotted snake moray.|$|R
50|$|The atoll <b>moray</b> <b>eel</b> (Gymnothorax atolli) is a <b>moray</b> <b>eel</b> {{found in}} coral reefs {{in the eastern}} central Pacific Ocean. It was first named by Pietschmann in 1935.|$|R

25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the <b>moray</b> <b>eels</b> and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Underwater World and Dolphin Lagoon was an {{oceanarium}} {{located on}} {{the western part of}} Sentosa at Siloso Point. Opened in 1991, the living museum had more than 2,500 marine and fresh-water animals of 250 species from different regions of the world. The oceanarium was underground and included an 83-metre long travelator that moved visitors along a submerged, glass-windowed tunnel from which they could look at an array of marine life including a coral reef, stingrays, <b>moray</b> <b>eels,</b> turtles, sharks, and other fishes. In the 'Dive with the Sharks' programme, visitors could scuba dive in the large oceanarium, even if they are not scuba qualified. Underwater World also included a Dolphin Lagoon which is home to some Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphins, also known as the Pink dolphins. For some time the aquarium {{was also one of the}} few places in the world to display captive dugong. The Underwater World Monorail Station of the now-defunct Sentosa Monorail once connected visiting tourists to the western half of the island, but it no longer does as the monorail was discontinued in March 2005. Because of competition from the new aquarium attraction, S.E.A. Aquarium, which is integrated with the transportation and boardwalk, Underwater World closed on 26 June 2016.|$|E
500|$|Most {{observed}} displays by grey reef sharks {{have been}} {{in response to a}} diver (or submersible) approaching and following it from a few meters behind and above. They also perform the display towards <b>moray</b> <b>eels,</b> and in one instance towards a much larger great hammerhead (which subsequently withdrew). However, they have never been seen performing threat displays towards each other. This suggests the display is primarily a response to potential threats (i.e. predators) rather than competitors. As grey reef sharks are not territorial, they are speculated to be defending a critical volume of [...] "personal space" [...] around themselves. Compared to sharks from French Polynesia or Micronesia, grey reef sharks from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific are not as aggressive and less given to displaying.|$|E
5000|$|The elegant moray (Gymnothorax elegans), or Goldsborough's <b>moray</b> <b>eel,</b> is a <b>moray</b> <b>eel</b> {{found in}} coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It was first named by Bliss in 1883.|$|R

500|$|Each {{criterion}} has exceptions. Tuna, swordfish, {{and some}} species of sharks show some warm-blooded adaptations—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature. Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna, salmon, and jacks that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to {{species such as}} eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second. Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air {{as well as from}} the water using a variety of different structures. Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as Corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach. Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish, and gulpers. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in <b>moray</b> <b>eels),</b> or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid (typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), ganoid (various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs), cycloid, and ctenoid (these last two are found on most bony fish). There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water. Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows. A single, an undescribed species of Phreatobius, has been called a true [...] "land fish" [...] as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged leaf litter. Many species live in underground lakes, underground rivers or aquifers and are popularly known as cavefish.|$|E

2500|$|L.amboinesis {{like other}} cleaner shrimp has a {{symbiotic}} relationship with 'client' fish in which both organisms benefit; the shrimp gain a meal from eating parasites living on large fish and the clients benefit from the removal of parasites. Cleaning organisms including shrimp and fish can congregate in one location on a reef in {{what is called a}} [...] "cleaning station" [...] which fish will visit when required; cleaning shrimp perform a rocking dance from side to side to signal their services when fish approach. L.amboinesis is also commonly found living in caves with their client fish, such as <b>moray</b> <b>eels,</b> providing the shrimp with protection from predators.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the coral}} reefs of the Red Sea, roving coralgrouper that have spotted a small prey fish {{hiding in a}} crevice {{sometimes}} visit the sleeping hole of a giant moray and shake their head at the moray, and {{this seems to be}} an invitation to group hunting as the moray often swims away with the grouper, is led to the crevice where the prey hides, and proceeds to probe that crevice (which is too small to let the grouper in), either catching the prey by itself or flushing it into the open where the grouper grabs it. [...] The closely related coral trout also enrolls the help of <b>moray</b> <b>eels</b> in this way, and they only do so when the prey they seek is hidden in crevices, where only the eel can flush them.
