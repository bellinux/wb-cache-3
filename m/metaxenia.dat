50|$|The {{term was}} coined in 1881 by the {{botanist}} Wilhelm Olbers Focke {{to refer to}} effects on maternal tissues, including the seed coat and pericarp, {{but at that time}} endosperm was also thought to be a maternal tissue, and the term became closely associated with endosperm effects. The term <b>metaxenia</b> was later coined and is still sometimes used to describe the effects on purely maternal tissues.|$|E
30|$|Date palm is {{dioecious}} {{in nature}} with separate {{male and female}} trees that are usually wind pollinated, but insect pollination also occurs. However, economic fruit production is only possible if 60 – 80  % of the female flowers are manually pollinated (Nixon and Carpenter 1978; Zaid and de Wet 2002) whereby pollen affects the shape and size of date palm seeds. Pollen also has a <b>metaxenia</b> effect affecting the shape {{and size of the}} fruit, time of ripening and fruit development (Nixon 1934, 1936). Many date varieties produce fruits even without pollination, but those are slender in size with imperfect seed (without embryo and endosperm) and ripen very late (Swingle 1928).|$|E

The influence of 12 pollen sources (10 local selections: M 1, M 2, M 05 -M 09, M 10 -M 12 and 2 internationally recognized cultivars: Fard No. 4 and Jervis No. 1) on fruit set, marketable yield, fruit and seed traits, and time of fruit maturity of cv. Barhi was investigated in the humid coastal region of southern Iran during 2009 - 2010. The M 10 pollen produced the highest fruit set at both kimri (unripe) and rutab (ripe, soft) harvest (71...|$|E
40|$|Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) {{has been}} an {{important}} crop in the desert regions of Asia and North Africa for centuries know adopted in many countries. Alexander the great and Arab conquerors introduced date fruit in Indo-Pak subcontinent after that date extended as a food item. Date palm is among the oldest cultivated plants in history of mankind, being used as food for 6000 years. Date is a world agricultural industry with total production of 7. 5 million metric tonnes (MT) of fruit and Pakistan contribution is 10. 34 metric tonnes. Date palm (2 n= 36) is dioecious monocotyledonous belonging to Arecaceae family. Fertilization and fruit set are consequences of pollination as there is an interesting but uncommon effect known as <b>metaxenia,</b> the direct influence of pollen on maternal tissues of date palm. Pollen not only control the fruit set, size of fruits and seeds but also effect the time of ripening. As pollen grains caused the great diversity and variations in size, quality and ripening time so 9 different pollen sources were selected to study the differential behaviour of pollen parents on fruit characteristics of two female cultivars i. e Hillawi and Khadrawy. Fruit was harvested at Khalal stage from controlled pollinated treatments and pysicochemical analysis was carried out to study the metaxenial effect of different pollen. Physical characters including ripening time, bunch weight, fruit length, fruit width, fruit area, pulp weight, seed weight and biochemical characters, total sugars, DPPH, ascorbic acid, total phenolic contents, total soluble solids, total proteins, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and enzymatic activities (peroxidase, catalaze, superoxidase ans protease) were highly variables. Data regarding all physicochemical characters was analyzed statistically using the two factor factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) that showed the significant differences in all variables. Duncan multiple range test was used to discrete the means (using the statistica 9. 1) revealed that different pollen sources respond variably. Among 9 pollen sources M 8 (Sq. no. 32) was superior because it was positively associated with most of the variables. Fruits developed from M 8 pollination were prominent with high bunch weight more sweetly in taste (high total sugars), good fruit area, enriched with protein, reduced seed weight, high antioxidant and enzymatic activity and reduced ripening time. M 7 (collected from Uni campus) retained highest capability for ascorbic acid, reduced ripening time, good fruit length and width, reduced seed weight. For more positive correlation of pollen parents M 8 was followed by M 7, M 3, M 5 and M 4. Strong positive correlation was found among most o...|$|E
