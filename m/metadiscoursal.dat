40|$|English {{medical and}} {{literary}} texts were compared and contrasted {{to find out}} whether there were any {{significant differences between the two}} kinds of texts in terms of the number and types of <b>metadiscoursal</b> markers. To this end, first, 30 medical and literary journal articles were chosen. Then, 3 successive paragraphs were extracted randomly from each of the selected articles which totaled 90 paragraphs out of which 45 were medical and 45 literary. The frequency and type of <b>metadiscoursal</b> markers in each text were investigated in accordance with Vande Kopple’s (1985) taxonomy. Next, the total number of <b>metadiscoursal</b> items in each type of the texts under study was determined. Finally, the Chi-square test was applied to the collected data to compare medical and literary texts. The statistical results gained through the computer suggested that there was a significant difference in the amount and type of <b>metadiscoursal</b> markers in medical and literary texts...|$|E
40|$|Like {{conversation}} and other modes of communication, {{writing is a}} rich medium for gender performance. In fact, writing functions to construct the disciplines {{as well as the}} gender of its practitioners. Despite the significance of author gender, as one constitutive dimension of any writing, it has been relatively under-researched. One way, by means of which author gender is practiced, and revealed in written discourse, is the incorporation and use of <b>metadiscoursal</b> categories. Examining 20 applied linguistics research articles (10 written by native male English writers and 10 written by native female English writers), the present study sought to examine whether male and female native English writers differed in their use of <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. For this purpose, Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse was employed as an analytical framework to identify the type of <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. The results of Independent samples t-test showed that English male and female writers did not differ significantly in their overall use of metadiscourse; but, significant differences were observed in categorical distribution of <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. The findings of the study can provide a sound basis for the development of pedagogical materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive <b>metadiscoursal</b> factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional <b>metadiscoursal</b> factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|Epistemic lexical verbs (Hyland, 1998) {{constitute}} {{essential elements}} in conveying different interpersonal meanings, among those judgment, certainty, doubt, and evidence, aiding speakers both to project {{themselves into the}} speech and to maintain interesting relationships with audiences. Supporting Sinclair’s (1991) contention that meanings are clustered into lexicogrammatical patternings, and not in isolated items, this paper explores the phraseology accompanying the most representative epistemic lexical verbs (ELVs) in university lectures. By applying corpus-based methodology, we also illustrate the functional variability of think –the most salient of these lexical verbs–, especially the roles it performs when hedging the discourse and complying with politeness conventions as part of interactional and <b>metadiscoursal</b> strategies. At a textual level, results indicate that lecturing speech favors the proliferation of evaluation markers {{that appear to be}} arranged in several recurrent formal patterns. This clearly entails potential for pedagogical purposes and ESP syllabuses. Key words: academic speech, lectures, stance, lexical units, interpersonal pragmatic...|$|E
40|$|Hedges and {{boosters}} {{are important}} <b>metadiscoursal</b> devices {{contributing to the}} construal of persuasion in academic discourse as they enable academic writers to distinguish facts from opinions, evaluate the views of others and convey a different degree of commitment to their assertions (cf. Hyland 1998 a, Hyland 2004, 2005). This study explores cross-cultural variation {{in the use of}} lexical hedges and boosters in the academic discourse of non-native writers. The study is carried out on a specialized corpus of linguistics research articles published in the international journal Applied Linguistics and the national Czech English-medium journal Discourse and Interaction. The main purpose of the cross-cultural investigation is to analyze variation in the rate, distribution and choice of hedges and boosters across the rhetorical structure of research articles in order to shed light on ways in which Anglophone and Czech writers express different degrees of commitment in their assertions when striving to persuade their target readership to accept their views and claims...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which purpose and identity are realised in the written case reports of radiography students in comparison with those of professional writers. Students entering a new discourse community have to take on a new social identity and this identity is expressed by means of familiarity with the appropriate discourse conventions, including genre as the most overt expression of rhetorical purpose. Also important are the pragmatic choices used by writers to guide readers’ understanding of text and to construct interaction between them, i. e. metadiscourse, which here provides an additional and complementary way of viewing purpose and identity. The study aims, at a more theoretical level, to make a contribution to writing research by integrating genre analysis and metadiscourse analysis within a single framework to provide new insight into the resources available to writers to construe identity in text. At a descriptive level, it provides analyses of a hitherto neglected genre of medical writing. Because the study compares the writing of novices and professionals, the description of this genre makes findings available for pedagogical application. Radiographers and radiologists work as members of the same professional teams and both publish case reports, often in the same journals. Data for the study is provided by two corpora of reports, one produced by radiography students and the other published in national journals by professionals. The genre analysis establishes the move structure of the radiological case study for both corpora and a cross-corpus analysis of metadiscourse demonstrates how identity is realised in the text as the moves unfold. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are adopted with regard to the data. The student reports appear to be examples of a sub-genre of case reports with the move structure and <b>metadiscoursal</b> strategies differing in several significant ways, reflecting the different purposes and identities of the writers. Student writers are found not to be concerned with the more persuasive rhetorical functions of the genre and tend to align themselves with the viewpoint of the patient rather than the medical profession, drawing on school essay discourse and making use of <b>metadiscoursal</b> strategies associated with textbooks.

40|$|Multiword {{combinations}} {{perform a}} crucial role in signifying fluency, accuracy and idiomaticity in academic writing. Lexical bundles are recurrent, but not salient, multi-word combinations, for example, on the other hand, the fact that the, and it should be noted. They are important as they act as discourse frames to relate to new information or as interactional devices to mark the involvement of the writer and the reader. These functions can also be regarded as <b>metadiscoursal</b> functions, represented by <b>metadiscoursal</b> models. The use of lexical bundles in L 2 academic writing {{has been the focus of}} a number of recent studies, but few studies distinguish bundles in different sentence positions, investigate bundles from the perspective of <b>metadiscoursal</b> functions, and explore the reasons underlying the bundle choices of L 2 writers. The present study sought to fill these gaps by comparing the use of sentence initial bundles (i. e. bundles at the beginning of sentences) in Chinese L 2 and New Zealand L 1 thesis writing in the discipline of general and applied linguistics. Four collections were built: a Chinese masters thesis corpus, a New Zealand masters thesis corpus, a Chinese PhD thesis corpus and a New Zealand PhD thesis corpus. In comparing these four corpora, this study provided a detailed picture of the use of sentence initial bundles in Chinese postgraduate writing and an overall picture of variation in bundle use across different postgraduate levels of students in terms of frequency, structure and function. Semi-structured interviews with six Chinese postgraduates were conducted after the text analysis to understand the reasons for Chinese students’ bundle choices. The interviews were based on the expressions in participants’ original drafts, which were completely or partially overlapped with the sentence initial bundles generated from the corpus data. Chinese masters and PhD students were found to rely more heavily on sentence initial bundles, particularly interactive bundles. They preferred to start sentences with PP-based bundles, VP-based bundles, and conjunction + clause fragment bundles; but were less aware of the importance of NP-based bundles and anticipatory-it bundles. With regard to function, both the Chinese PhD and masters corpora were characterised by a heavy use of condition bundles and booster bundles; and a relatively low use of endophoric bundles, attitude bundles, hedge bundles, self-mention bundles and directive bundles of cognitive acts. In regard to bundle development, both groups of masters students were found to use more bundles than their PhD counterparts. However, the two PhD groups shared more bundles. More research-related NP-based bundles occurred in masters corpora, and more PP-based bundles and anticipatory-it bundles appeared in PhD students’ writing. A functional analysis showed that both groups of PhD students used more transition bundles, condition bundles, section-level frame bundles and self-mention bundles, but fewer attitude bundles. Interviews with six Chinese postgraduates revealed possible reasons for Chinese students’ bundle selection and use, which included but were not limited to interlingual transfer, classroom learning, noticing in reading, a lack of rhetorical confidence, and misunderstanding of rhetorical conventions. The findings suggest the need to go beyond the teaching of lexical bundles as a list of fixed multiword expressions. Teachers and learners are advised to address the pedagogical implications of bundle studies, and to use corpus-based tools (e. g. FLAX) to approach bundles as lexico-grammatical frames in which slots can be filled with a variety of words...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>metadiscoursal</b> {{components}} of academic texts, through which writers organise, interpret and evaluate content matter, provides one means of examining {{the relationship between}} writer and reader. This paper explores one grammatical feature of metadiscourse, clauses with an anticipatory it and extraposed subject (as in ‘It {{is interesting to note}} that no solution is offered’). This feature is compared in two computerised corpora of text, one consisting of published journal articles from the field of Business Studies and the second of MBA student dissertations written by non-native speakers of English. It-clauses are found to have four main interpersonal roles in hedging, marking the writer's attitude, emphasis, and attribution. The main differences between the two corpora are in the use of it-clauses to persuade readers of the validity of claims, with student writers making an apparently greater and more overt persuasive effort, and stating propositions more forcefully. Proposals are made on why this might be the case, taking into account the different writer-reader relationships in journal articles and dissertations. Implications of the findings for the teaching of academic writing are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{challenges}} faced by non-native researchers writing their scientific papers for publication in English. To publish in peer-reviewed international mainstream journals, researchers {{should be able to}} write in a genre-specific and persuasive manner. Academic writing requires explicit organization of texts, caution in making claims, signposting connections, and creating coherence and clarity in the text. The research article (RA) is a key genre of scientific publishing with a special communicative and rhetorical structure. The structure and language of the RA partly depend on the disciplinary knowledge-making practices and writing conventions applied in the field of research. The subjects of this study were doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in Materials Science at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), all of them non-native speakers of English. The objective of the study was twofold: first, to explore the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and wishes for further training of the researchers writing in English; second, to examine how they employed certain linguistic devices to present the results of their research. The study applied two methods to answer the research questions: an e-mailed questionnaire and a descriptive analysis of published sample RAs written by the subjects. Swales’ Create-A-Research-Space (CARS) model for RA introductions and Hyland’s model of interactive and interactional metadiscourse were used as investigative tools to study certain rhetorical and textual features. On the whole, the TUT respondents showed a positive attitude to writing in English. Approximately half of them felt disadvantaged in writing RAs when compared to native speakers. The researchers considered “creating text flow and coherence to make my reasoning easy to understand” and “expressing my interpretation of the results with an appropriate degree of confidence” most challenging. Both skills involve the ability to write reader-friendly and professionally convincing text. Most sample RAs followed the 3 -move rhetorical pattern of the CARS model. Most of the <b>metadiscoursal</b> items were interactive, which is characteristic of quantitative RAs in natural sciences and engineering. Overall, the writers employed a rather limited selection of <b>metadiscoursal</b> devices. Since proofreaders often pay attention only to obvious lexico-grammatical mistakes in scientific papers, an interactive system with early-stage consultation between writers and proofreaders can help to create persuasive and genre-specific argumentation. Discipline-based writing instruction and materials on textual and rhetorical organization beyond the sentence level could help writers to construct coherent texts...|$|E
40|$|The central idea of genre-based EAP {{teaching}} is assisting {{students to become}} more competent users of genres identified as key to their disciplines. As reading research articles in English is a substantial component of target courses syllabi in university settings in Croatia, a student assignment was designed to implement research articles in the EAP classroom. The assignment {{presented in this paper}} aimed to raise students' awareness of the rhetorical, <b>metadiscoursal,</b> and lexical features of a research article. Students were first required to identify rhetorical moves throughout four main research article sections. The next task was to find a section in a research article containing at least two different hedging expressions and to translate the section into Croatian. Finally, a lexical analysis focused on the identification of academic collocations across the research article sections. The overall results, which in most cases indicated students’ increased awareness of the aspects analyzed, suggest the effectiveness of genre-based teaching in the EAP classroom. The assignment presented here may have wider pedagogical implications, in that it could serve as a generic model for analyzing the same or other academic genres across a range of EAP contexts...|$|E
40|$|Thanks to the {{development}} of the concept of metadiscourse, it is now widely acknowledged that academic/scientific writing is not only concerned with communicating purely propositional meanings: what is communicated through academic/scientific communication is seen to be intertwined with the negotiation of social and interpersonal meanings. While a large number of so called <b>metadiscoursal</b> resources contribute to the simultaneous negotiation of propositional and interpersonal meanings, the present study aimed at investigating the functions self-mention forms can fulfill in academic/scientific communication. Two of Stephen Hawking's scientific books were selected as the corpus of the research, and based on Tang and John's (1999) model, the constructed corpus was analyzed in terms of the functions self-mention forms can fulfill in academic/scientific writing. The findings revealed that from among the different roles identified by Tang and John, the representative role constituted the most frequent self-mention function in the corpus. The remarkably heavy presence of representative role in Hawking's scientific prose was interpreted as a further evidence for the claim that scientists are more likely to persuade readers of their ideas if they frame their messages in ways which appeal to appropriate community-recognized relationships...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a year-long {{research}} study: four teachers of English, their Year 8 (13 – 14 year old) classes (110 students) in urban, secondary schools and a university teacher educator investigated the contexts for students to develop dialogic, exploratory talk in small groups. Assuming a Vygotskyan perspective, the study adapted a pedagogic model from an earlier project, endorsing a structured approach to talk, with ‘ground-rules’ and reflection. The study investigated how this guided model might intersect with other aspects of classroom culture, practice and identity to effect sustained development in students? use of exploratory, dialogic talk. The project involved research collaboration cross-school, including students exchanging formative feedback on videotaped talk. Qualitative research methods comprised comparative discourse analysis of audio and videotapes of representative group talk; semi-structured lesson observations; and sequential teacher and student interviews. The study concludes that practising a structured model and reflecting on discourse had a liberating effect on the majority of students, enabling experimentation with different forms of dialogic talk and identities. Shifts in discourse, confidence and identity positioning were particularly marked in ‘lower-attaining’ students of lower socio-economic status. Teachers’ <b>metadiscoursal</b> reflection resulted in changes in teacher?student relationships and classroom talk characterised by tentativeness, permitting knowledge to be contested...|$|E

The use of evaluation resources {{has proven to}} be an especially difficult area in English for Academic Purposes. Our aim is to propose a methodological framework for identifying recurrent differences in the use of evaluation resources in academic texts across English and other languages. We argue that for comparisons to be meaningful, studies of independent but comparable successful texts should contrast propositions that are similar in terms of their pragmatic or discourse function. We narrow the focus of the proposal down to the academic book review genre in one particular academic discipline and argue for the contrast of propositions functioning as critical acts on similar THINGS, the academic books under review. We reason that for fruitful comparisons it would be necessary to distinguish between evaluation resources occurring on the propositional, <b>metadiscoursal</b> and rhetorical planes. We discuss the types of evaluation resources that occur on these three planes in a corpus of 20 recent literary academic book reviews in English. We conclude that applying this framework to the quantitative analysis of comparable texts and propositions across languages would help to establish {{the extent to which the}} use of evaluation resources varies as a function of the language in a useful way.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with uncovering the organisational structure underpinning Open University television programmes in scientific and technological fields. Using a genre analysis which {{takes into account the}} unique contextual configuration in which vision and pedagogical purpose play a vital part a rhetorical structure is revealed. This structure is based essentially on a string of Episodes. The notion of Episodes is discussed and interpreted as a complete or truncated discourse pattern. Two discourse patterns appear to operate in a potentially complex manner. In general terms, a Situation-Problem-Solution-Evaluation pattern forms the Episodes at an overall structural level while a Demonstration-Explanation-Summary pattern operates at a lower or embedded level. A basic four-level structure emerges in which the entire discourse or Programme is formed of Episodes which are composed of Sections – the components of a discourse pattern – which in their turn are made up of Clause relations. Embedded Episodes operate at the Section level. The study explores the forms, functions and incidence of Transitions, interactive and <b>metadiscoursal</b> units, which link otherwise unconnected units of discourse. The identification of Episodes and Sections is dependent on visual, prosodic, textual and lexical features which is demonstrated in the study. All these features interweave in getting together a specific genre – OU television programmes in science and technology – revealed by a distinctive rhetorical structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} article {{is one of}} the widely practiced genres of communication among members of academic discourse community to contribute their own new knowledge and get acceptance from the audience. A generic analysis of {{research article}}s can cover a wide variety of issues; among them rhetorical features. As argued by Hyland (2004), a valuable means of exploring academic writing and of comparing the rhetorical features and preferences of different discourse communities is through <b>metadiscoursal</b> analysis. Metadiscourse is an aspect of language which provides a link between texts and disciplinary cultures, helping to define the rhetorical context by revealing some of the expectations and understandings of the audience for whom a text is written. Differences in metadiscourse patterns may prove to be an essential means of distinguishing discourse communities (Hyland, 1998). The present paper focused on interactional metadiscourse markers in the result and discussion section of academic research articles across four disciplines, namely, English Language Teaching, Civil Engineering, Biology, and Economics. Sixteen research article result and discussion sections (4 from each discipline) were sourced from four leading international journals for analysis. Results revealed that there were worth-pointing differences, but not statistically significant differences excepting in terms of boosters, between disciplines in the use of interactional metadiscourse markers. Similarities and differences are explained by way of an explication of genre features in terms of contextual configuration and genre specific needs dealing with applied metadiscourse markers by discipline...|$|E
40|$|Meta{{discourse}}, {{known as}} discourse about ongoing discourse, {{has been the}} subject of discourse research from a wide range of perspectives. In academic contexts, knowledge of metadiscourse as a prominent feature of all types of academic discourse provides second language readers with information about writer’s attitudes towards the text and the readers. Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in conducting studies investigating different aspects of metadiscourse in relation to language learning. The present study hopes to contribute to the study of metadiscourse by investigating its effect on EFL learners’ reading comprehension (with three levels of reading proficiency: low, medium, and high) when faced two text types –academic and general. To this end, data were collected through two instruments, namely a TOEFL reading comprehension sample test and a reading comprehension test which consisted of two text types was developed for the purpose of this study. Two versions of this reading comprehension test were developed: one with metadiscourse enriched texts and the other with metadiscourse removed ones. The results of data analysis showed that students in all three levels of reading proficiency performed better on metadiscourse enriched test booklet than their counterpart groups who took the metadiscourse removed text booklet. In comparing students’ performance on metadiscourse removed text types, it was revealed that they did more poorly on academic metadiscourse removed test booklet than on general one. The findings of this study suggest that making students aware of <b>metadiscoursal</b> features of different text types enhances students’ reading comprehension...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} of a six-year study of working and writing {{practices}} in an engineering environment. It is an investigation into a distinctive discourse community of design engineers conducted from an ethnographic perspective. It surveys the engineers’ attitudes towards writing and texts, and describes their distinctive writing practices, including collaborative writing. It shows them to have been acculturated into work attitudes, procedures, and a writing style which {{are at odds with}} actual demands made of them in the workplace. The engineering-lore about engineers being generally incompetent or indifferent writers is explored and, for the most part, debunked. The texts that design engineers write are identified, and it is shown that product design, the type of work activity that most engages and concerns the engineers, provides a common thread throughout all the documents considered. Particular attention is paid to proposals and executive summaries, since they give rise to specifications and requirements, all of which give most cause for concern to the engineers and the company. It is shown that proposals are ultimately persuasive in intent, in which engineers must convince the Customer of the superiority of their ‘solution’ over the proposal submissions from other companies. Pragmatism and problem-solving underpin the approach taken to proposal documents, the description and analysis of which is intended to be useful to the engineer writers themselves, and intended to reflect their collaborative writing practices. An analytical approach has been devised, based on information content, which is of potential use for diagnostic or evaluative purposes. Findings arising out the analysis suggest that the proposals and executive summaries written by design engineers comprise a selection of Information Components (ICs) drawn from a finite set of thirty-nine ICs. They indicate the existence of four major foci for proposal texts: three information-based, and one <b>metadiscoursal.</b> The results also seem to indicate that proposal writers may be focusing too much on product design in proposals to the detriment of other key information, which also contributes to the overall ‘solution’...|$|E
