Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, May 2012.   The collection of aerodynamic measurements including vital capacity and <b>maximum</b> <b>sustained</b> phonation is common practice in Speech-Language Pathology {{to aid in the}} assessment and treatment of vocal dysfunction. Current research lacks information regarding the ideal instructions to be given to a patient about how to exhale for vital capacity or what type of feedback is reasonable to provide to a patient during <b>maximum</b> <b>sustained</b> phonation collection. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effect of instruction and visual feedback during the collection of vital capacity and <b>maximum</b> <b>sustained</b> phonation tasks, respectively.   Fifty female participants were included in this study. Each participant performed a total of 12 <b>maximum</b> <b>sustained</b> phonation tasks. 6 trials were conducted while sustaining the vowel /i/, and 6 trials during the vowel /a/. For each vowel sound /i/ and /a/, 3 trials received visual feedback from the examiner during collection and 3 did not. Each participant also performed 6 vital capacity tasks. Participants were instructed to exhale utilizing a "slow" exhalation for half the trials (8 - 10 seconds) and a "fast" exhalation (3 - 6 seconds) for the other half. The order of <b>maximum</b> <b>sustained</b> phonation and vital capacity tasks was randomized for each patient.   Descriptive analyses of the data revealed that instruction and visual feedback provided no practical significance in predicting length of <b>maximum</b> <b>sustained</b> phonation or amount of air exhaled during vital capacity collection.   M.
